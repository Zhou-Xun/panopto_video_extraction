1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,960
As workers have continuously fought for their rights and a voice in the workplace.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,780
That's where the Center for Healthy Work comes in.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:13,560
We're a naias funded Center of Excellence for Total Worker Health at the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,479
The Center through Research and Education documents the effects of the changing

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,620
nature of work and the experiences of workers engaged in precarious work.

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,770
We identify, build upon and promote best practices for policy change at local, state and national levels.

7
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:38,300
And we collaborate with worker centers, labor unions, social justice groups, government agencies and employers to better equip workers,

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,260
their families and communities to advocate for healthier working conditions.

9
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:49,800
At the Center for Healthy Work, we aim to identify and support sustainable action to make healthy work a reality for all workers.

10
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,040
Parents over for the first 20 minutes of pass. Sorry.

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,730
Goodness, you're all here. This happens on Thursday.

12
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,989
Sorry, Josh. I don't know why I forget in this class.

13
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:09,430
I always remember in my 830 class. Okay, I have to remember Thursday.

14
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:17,840
So, I mean, it is very much like a community focused situation.

15
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,110
So if we take a look here, this this is Harvard's conceptual framework that they designed.

16
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,840
As we talked about, conceptual frameworks can look very different.

17
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:34,520
So essentially they kind of adapt the social determinants of health or the sorry, the social,

18
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:42,200
social, ecological model, but rather they blow it out into the individual being the worker,

19
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,450
the interpersonal being, the enterprise, the community slash organizational, dealing with employment,

20
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,670
labor patterns, and then like policy being like social, political, economic environment.

21
00:01:53,330 --> 00:02:00,469
So they're taking into account the worker characteristics, including union status, safety, health and well-being,

22
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:08,090
and looking at programs, policies and practices that inform the working conditions and result in enterprise outcomes.

23
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,610
So let's take a look at just their website to see what they're working on.

24
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,069
So they have their own little video, too, but we don't need to look in particular.

25
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:25,840
If you look at research, that's what their conceptual model I just showed you was and their current research project,

26
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:33,170
they're working on a Boston hospital workers health study, a fulfillment center intervention,

27
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,720
thriving workers, thriving workplaces and older workers health and well-being.

28
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,880
So I clicked on these two because I'm like, I'm not exactly sure what that is.

29
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:49,200
So this one fulfillment center intervention is health and well-being at fulfillment centers in the e-commerce division.

30
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:56,980
So this kind of looks like it's geared towards people who work in like Amazon or like fulfillment warehouses in particular.

31
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:07,150
And then this one here, thriving workers, thriving workplaces. It's working conditions along with a safe environment, essentially.

32
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:16,960
Yes, Sam, this is kind of this might not quite this any of these researchers or do anything affect the gig economy of like DoorDash,

33
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:22,220
Uber or any of those workers because I know they don't have any rights at all from their workers.

34
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:29,560
So Harvard, I don't know, but they use UCLA labor.

35
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,100
LOESCH Which is the labor and Occupational Safety and Health Center.

36
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,330
They are very much like trying to survey the gig economy.

37
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,300
But it's so difficult because a lot of these people have day jobs.

38
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:50,769
So, I mean, unless you talk to the company directly or you're able to like market on social media

39
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:56,169
like Facebook or Instagram or like something to capture people into your study,

40
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:04,659
it's very difficult to recruit to find out who actually works for like Lyft or like Instacart or DoorDash, right?

41
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:12,220
Because they essentially don't have hardly any protections at all and they're like harassed all the time or sometimes.

42
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:21,070
So gig economy workers are very, what we call consider like precarious employment.

43
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:32,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We also most of the centers, if you're interested, also have to have free resources.

44
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,409
So like they have a massive online course, for example,

45
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:43,600
that you could take for free on improving your business through the culture of how they have reported webinars like they did.

46
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:55,240
A lot of them did like reopening during COVID kind of situations, continuing education courses or fellowship opportunities case for any of you.

47
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,980
And then they do research and all this kind of etc. stuff.

48
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,470
But essentially it's still very novel and new, right?

49
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,970
So it's nothing like super established, like the National Cancer Institute or anything like that.

50
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,080
So priority areas and emerging issues in regards to total worker health.

51
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:24,690
So this was back in 2013 when this was initially made.

52
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,920
So in the workplace they considered the control of hazards and exposures.

53
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:37,450
Your traditional what we think of occupational safety and health to be prevention of injury illnesses and fatalities,

54
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:45,580
promoting safe and healthy workplaces and then doing risk assessment and control from the employment side.

55
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:54,370
They were particularly concerned about preserving human resources in regards to looking at new employment patterns that we've talked about,

56
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,710
kind of like changing demographics and all that, health and productivity and then health care benefits.

57
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:08,199
And from the worker side, now they're trying to optimize worker well-being by looking at how the behaviors like nutrition,

58
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:17,590
tobacco use, physical activity, work life balance and at risk worker populations.

59
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:26,469
It's interesting to me because moving to the Midwest, I notice people use tobacco here more because in California,

60
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,970
it seems like even growing up in the nineties that smoking was on its way out.

61
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,950
But I feel like smoking is still very much here, including vaping or vaping.

62
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,250
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I would think if you consider vaping, you feel like I would have a California and Midwest the same.

63
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:52,420
But in traditional cigarets and vaping, I don't count like recreational or legalized marijuana in that area now.

64
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,870
But yeah, yeah. I was surprised by by how how they're there.

65
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,819
I mean, it's good that there still are tobacco cessation problems. Vaping is apparently a huge issue.

66
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:09,400
I was glancing you think it was a michigan daily article about like vaping this past week,

67
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,680
massive among high schoolers or I mean, it was pretty big when I was in high school.

68
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:21,800
I graduated 2016. By now, the people underneath me were only crazy and other use like cigarets and coffee.

69
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,240
Yeah. It's like cigarets are cheaper. Yeah. Menthols are huge. Yeah.

70
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:37,809
In high schoolers. Yeah. Oh, wow. I remember when I was a kid, we used to have those, like assemblies, those they're assemblies of whatever.

71
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,940
Those were the like if someone tries to like hand you like menthol.

72
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,660
On the street. What do you say? No. Right.

73
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,169
But it was it was a lot of focus on tobacco cessation.

74
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:53,219
And then you would see those commercials like in the nineties and early 2000,

75
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:59,280
where it's like like they have an egg in a frying pan or they're like, this is your brain on drugs or something like that.

76
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,239
And I feel like those commercials stopped for a good while.

77
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:12,299
But now I'm starting to see some targeted ads again against vaping because a lot of secondary analysis of data.

78
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,770
I don't do it, but some of my colleagues do it.

79
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:24,540
Look at like vaping as a potential gateway into smoking and then other drugs, and there's a pretty strong association there.

80
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:32,880
Um, it's interesting, right, because I myself have never smoked a cigaret in my entire life.

81
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:39,479
My dad was a smoker when I was growing up, but I've never had the like urge to try to smoke inherently.

82
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:46,860
People know vaping is terrible for you, right? I think when it first came out, everyone was like, it's just water vapor.

83
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,459
And that's like I feel like that's why a lot of high schoolers were doing it clearly.

84
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:57,960
So there's nothing wrong with this. They didn't know that much about it and now we know more about it and that it's still bad.

85
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:04,020
And I think a big part of it, too, is like, oh, well, it's not as bad as smoking, it's the lesser of two evils.

86
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:10,530
And then they have like know cigarets and they were like marketing that was like smoking cessation.

87
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:14,550
Yeah. Yeah. Kind of worked but also didn't.

88
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:20,670
Yeah. Yeah. Or then some people tried to liken it to hookah as well.

89
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:27,570
But now I think when I go on airplanes like they used to say like don't smoke cigarets and tamper with the thing in the toilet.

90
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,280
But now they also include like vaping and e-cigarettes as well.

91
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,739
So obviously like with the nicotine use like super carcinogenic.

92
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:46,170
So I baseline like if people are already smoking and smoking at such a young age and then entering into the workforce,

93
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:52,290
they're already entering at decreased immune level and respiratory function.

94
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,379
So it totally depends on like what their job is.

95
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:02,550
I think I was reading this study showing among young people who had vaped and got coded as well,

96
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:09,810
had really more severe outcomes and and took a much longer time to recover.

97
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:17,580
Since 2013, they have added a couple new items to their priority list.

98
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:26,129
So opioid and other substance use disorders in the workplace, which we'll talk about in specific for a week, total worker health outreach.

99
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,370
Again, these centers measuring worker well-being.

100
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:34,820
Future of work we'll talk about. Healthy work, design and wellbeing.

101
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,510
Occupational stress. Working hours and fatigue.

102
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:42,500
Nonstandard work arrangements and mental health in the workplace.

103
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:49,910
I still feel like mental health in the workplace is talked about more since COVID,

104
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:54,230
but I definitely feel like there's still a huge stigma around it that our general feeling

105
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,310
becoming more just American culture towards work in general makes it incompatible.

106
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,000
A lot of mental health interventions, not just in the workplace.

107
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:10,260
I think it's like. Workplace school like any any place of like.

108
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,630
Where you're supposed to be productive. Yeah. Yeah. Mm hmm.

109
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:23,690
Cause I feel like people have this stigma that it's like if you're experiencing mental health issues,

110
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,880
that means that you are not productive or you can't be productive.

111
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,110
That, like, you're not capable or that you're not capable. Sure. Sure.

112
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:41,630
So sometimes a lot of people still still don't discuss these kinds of things and these, like, short term solutions about like, you know,

113
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,260
we have a 30 minute webinar on how to like managers schedule better or like, you know,

114
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:54,770
do like this are your era like these aren't long term sustainable solutions to address and.

115
00:11:55,190 --> 00:12:00,950
I've noticed a lot of like work, meditation classes, stuff in the workplace which is like an expense.

116
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,889
Like, I mean, it's like some stage stuff doesn't work.

117
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:09,920
But I think the way that they kind of put it, I think that leads the way is several of the companies that work for it put it into their things.

118
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:19,249
It's kind of like a we only have to talk about this for 30 minutes if we put a meditation session and then don't incorporate anything else into it.

119
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,360
Is interesting. How many of you do regular meditation practice?

120
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:28,380
Oh, wow. Like half of the half of us. Good for you.

121
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:37,620
I have it. I have tried and tried and tried and have been very unsuccessful at it.

122
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,559
Although, you know, neuro cognitively, I logically understand the benefits.

123
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:50,610
Right. It does actually change, like the way your synopses fire and like grade a white matter ratio and all that kind of stuff.

124
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:56,830
But I just. It's good for anxiety, but it's also one of those kind of bands where it's like it's like saying,

125
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,430
try yoga and I mean, it's not going to work for everyone.

126
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,120
Yeah, it's a deeply over record of like, try X.

127
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,750
I saw it for like 2 minutes a day and I was like, I need to just start a little.

128
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:15,130
And now it's like none of it. It took forever to like sit, sit there and be comfortable, but that's made a huge difference.

129
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,680
Yeah, I've tried a tangent and an interesting way, you know, as a go to meditation,

130
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:29,310
I saw they're now making like a fictionalized version of the Thai cave rescue of the soccer children.

131
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,880
You know what I'm talking about?

132
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:41,889
A couple of years ago, there was a group, a Thai soccer team of just like youth boys, and they got trapped in a cave, like on a field trip.

133
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,660
They're making like a fictionalized version on Netflix. Now, I saw.

134
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:51,280
But there's this PBS Frontline documentary where they're soccer coach, used to be a Buddhist monk,

135
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,229
and they were trapped in that cave for like weeks and weeks before they could be rescued.

136
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:05,410
But he taught them how to do meditation practice to like lower their heart rate and conserve resources like physical resources.

137
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:11,890
And so they wouldn't, like, feel cold or like, you know, they were basically like in the dark.

138
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:18,970
He was incredible. So I can attest to meditation, but these like half an hour workplace things are not it.

139
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:25,540
Interestingly, I have a friend who was an emergency medicine resident.

140
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,470
And, you know, as a medical student, you go through a lot of stress in in.

141
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:34,330
Right. And then when you become a resident, it's even more stress now.

142
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,950
And in that emergency room, she sees a lot of trauma and might get secondary trauma.

143
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:48,160
And I found out that for residents of her program, they only required her to do a 30 minute therapy session once.

144
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:54,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just to check on her mental health and, you know.

145
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,740
No, not. Okay. Next one. Oh, Morgan.

146
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,720
No, I'm saying. What? Oh. Oh, yeah.

147
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,620
Oh, I thought Morgan was. Oh, okay, okay, okay.

148
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,860
It's okay. And you can go back later. Yeah.

149
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,629
So that obviously was not sufficient.

150
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:22,750
But she was raised in a culture where again, like mental health was very stigmatized and generally suppresses things.

151
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,209
And then it comes out when we go out and the drinking and that's like,

152
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:31,850
you don't like going out with her in a loose cannon, but it's like, we're too old for this now.

153
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:42,880
Like you got to get your, your, your mental health sorted or you need to there's a sliding scale, you know, like if you can't afford it.

154
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:49,360
So those are the new items that they've had. So this is their updated figure as of 2020.

155
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:56,470
So compared to this one in 2013, very comprehensive now.

156
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,980
Right. And they've added a whole section on technology.

157
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:07,299
They've started talking about things like adequate breaks, safe staffing work,

158
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:12,160
intensification, prevention, which they are sometimes call this is work conditioning, right?

159
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:24,490
Discrimination, bullying, harassment, equal opportunity, employment, the family and medical leave, all of these kinds of things.

160
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,710
It's very ambitious. It's very ambitious.

161
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:39,110
So one of their big things that they're focusing on is called the Future of Work Initiative or FLW.

162
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:47,179
So their goal is to compile studies on future work feature current and relevant research projects,

163
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:56,270
promote research and among new industries, and then connect trends to the work, place, work and workforce changes.

164
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,720
So essentially this this is for the future of work.

165
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:07,360
These are their priority topics. So we'll put we'll go talk about each one a little bit more.

166
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:14,120
But under the workplace, they have organizational design, technological job displacement, work arrangements.

167
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,969
And then under work, they talk about A.I. robotics technologies.

168
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:25,940
And then for workforce, they're focusing on demographics and economic security and skills.

169
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:40,750
So if we're focusing on organizational design, remote telework and virtual teams have become the accepted way of working, I would say, in most places.

170
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:50,050
Like, for example, my sister who works for the mayor of New York and in in the Legal Council,

171
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:57,880
went on a trip with her friends to upstate New York last weekend to an Airbnb.

172
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:08,080
With their kids. She now has hand, foot and mouth as an adult and has blisters everywhere and she has strep throat.

173
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:16,390
It's such a fun thing. That's my sister. But yeah. There's no teleworking policy allowed under Mayor Adams.

174
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,780
So she'd add up some significance.

175
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,220
She is at the office today. I texted her earlier.

176
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:34,260
She said she's wearing gloves, though her she doesn't touch anything if her blisters block leave and and she's wearing a mask.

177
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,040
And I'm like, I'm sure your colleagues would prefer you not to be there.

178
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:44,490
But like the city workers are pretty upset when Mayor Adams said, like, no more teleworking because he's very old school.

179
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:50,490
Right? He's a police officer, a former police officer. I want to see everybody in the office, blah, blah, blah.

180
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,480
When they all came back to the office, they all got COVID finally.

181
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:03,299
So not true for all workplaces, but most workplaces have now accepted this as a as a way of working that.

182
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,700
GM just did that, too.

183
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:10,590
And like a lot of people have moved back to Detroit to work for GM downtown and they're like, We haven't been here for three years.

184
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:16,590
We moved and now I have to go back. Yeah, I'm not sure what the rationale is.

185
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:22,050
I mean, maybe first a like a man, in fact, if you work in the manufacturing facility, I totally get that.

186
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:30,059
But for an office office job, I would think most companies would prefer you to work from home because they don't have to pay for office space.

187
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,820
They don't have to pay for electricity. Toilet paper.

188
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,989
You're not using their printer to print out random stuff.

189
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,990
Right. But a lot of work,

190
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:47,290
a lot of employers also don't trust that people will do their work like a lot of it's control to

191
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:53,580
where they feel their best managerial styles or walk over how that watercooler conversation like

192
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:59,820
without me being transition in the next couple of years of I mean it's like Tesla imagine that they

193
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,680
were doing like all in person or something and then company I was working for is doing and said,

194
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,879
well, we're flexible, we'll take all of your workers. And yeah,

195
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:19,590
like some of our staff in our department now are entirely remote just because we couldn't find enough qualified people who want to live in Ann Arbor,

196
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:29,340
Michigan. Right. So according to their studies before COVID, about 20% of people were already working virtually.

197
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:37,440
And they estimate that about 40% of all jobs in the United States could be completely performed at home.

198
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,809
But obviously, disparities exist by geographic location and industries.

199
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:47,390
So there's certain jobs where it's really not feasible for you to work remotely, right?

200
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:54,510
Like if you put up drywall and you do insulation, you can't do remote work.

201
00:20:54,870 --> 00:21:03,390
You know how many of you have drawer drive driven up to a drive thru and the person taking your order is on an iPad.

202
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:11,960
Like you're talking to an iPad, not a person is taking your order, an iPad that you have to play.

203
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,580
That's it. Okay. McDonald's or I know started.

204
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:20,000
Yeah. Some companies now they'll like because you know what, Chip?

205
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:29,180
There aren't as many Chick fil A's in this area as other states, but they're you know, they're known for apart from their beliefs as a corporation,

206
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:34,190
but they do have generally very good customer service and it's always their pleasure.

207
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:41,059
And they generally have people always outside taking your orders, rain or shine like they have,

208
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,480
like the little tent things or they'll wear like, you know, whatever.

209
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:53,330
And so during COVID, you would have Chick-Fil-A employees mounted to like an iPad as you drove up,

210
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:58,430
like wearing their outfit, clearly like taking your order from their living room.

211
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,939
But you're at the drive thru what's. Yes. That's funny.

212
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,020
Yes. Doesn't that is not me.

213
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:10,610
Sorry. That's something I never even thought of like. Yeah, you can definitely take people's orders, you know, through the drive thru.

214
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:14,000
You don't have to be there. Yeah.

215
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,060
I ultimately was pushing buttons on a computer.

216
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:26,130
So, yeah, I mean, as long as the, you know, the worker's provided like a computer that links into the system or like and the technology.

217
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:31,760
Right. Or is getting rid of those people and all. And they love the tablets now where you just click on it yourself.

218
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,429
Right. Right. Yeah. Because I mean, I mean, you know,

219
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:41,750
sometimes the person taking your order is also sometimes the person like who like dispenses your drink or something like that.

220
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:48,130
But for the most part, like it just lays. They'll like put all your food on a tray and you just, like, kind of grab it for a while.

221
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:55,790
Taco Bell was like sealing the bag, shut bananas back to, like, just throwing this, like, slow down a little bit.

222
00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:02,180
Yeah, but I mean, hypothetically, like, a lot of jobs could be done remotely, like, maybe this because I'm, like, all that hard.

223
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,540
I hate self-checkout. I really don't like it.

224
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,889
I'll do it. But so many, like so many places are self-checkout now.

225
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:17,570
Like Costco has self-checkout now or, you know, at the library, like the library's been closed.

226
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:21,410
You reserve your books online, you do a drive up. Right.

227
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:26,050
Um, it's closed. The Ypsi Library.

228
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:36,590
Yeah. Sorry, I'm in Ypsi, but. So workplaces are becoming more modernized, but it makes it really complicated in terms of, like, the legal front end,

229
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:44,390
more people working from home because it blurs this boundary of like, what if I get injured on the job?

230
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,309
But I was working on my job from my house type of situation.

231
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:53,280
So like I don't know about shared with you I work at night now.

232
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:58,760
A little sleeve on my arm because I have carpal tunnel in my right hand.

233
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:03,200
Because the entire first year that I was hired here, it was during college.

234
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,690
So I was not supplied any like university issued anything.

235
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:18,979
So I was just working on a laptop. Oh, for the first entire year, making a seminar and two classes and like submitting a bunch of grants and stuff.

236
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:24,530
And I messed my wrist up and I thought I would have fixed it when I came back to the office.

237
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:29,479
But I didn't. I got like an ergonomic assessment here because it was free.

238
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,610
But I mean, I'm not trying to like. Sue the University for Workers Comp.

239
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,840
I probably could, but that seems like a lot of work.

240
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:43,640
That's a lot of work. Try a bigger fish to fry, right?

241
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,030
Yeah. And we know how the university lawyers are, right.

242
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:55,440
So. But also, like, now they're trying to incorporate more work life interventions.

243
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,570
I haven't noticed any directed towards me.

244
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:04,160
And then also. I don't know.

245
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:04,509
Now,

246
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:14,260
more people are definitely pushing for more corporate social responsibility where they try to get them to prioritize societal interests over profits.

247
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:20,110
I don't actually know how much this is happening except for the CEO of Patagonia.

248
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,770
Volume, I could think. Yes. That's the only one I can presently think of.

249
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,360
It's funny, you see, CSR is kind of the old term sustainability,

250
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:34,330
but working on it is not like sustainability is like the baseline and like CSR is viewed as like the people were in the lake and.

251
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:40,230
But it's super interesting where some, some places, I mean almost depends on the manager of the one, the organization.

252
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,000
We'll take it very seriously while others it's got more of a marketing gimmick, which is just really fascinating.

253
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:52,810
How many of you have worked at a workplace where they've tried to help implement a work life intervention?

254
00:25:55,750 --> 00:26:07,200
Yeah. I mean. Starbucks thinks that it is doing that by providing access to.

255
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:12,110
Mike. You know, apps like Headspace and.

256
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:22,670
Stuff like that. But I like that.

257
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:28,970
Yeah, I think Michigan Medicine did that for the first year of the pandemic where they provided it was either headspace

258
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:36,680
or like Betterhelp or whatever one of these like online therapy things for free to the health care workers.

259
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,000
But correct me if I'm wrong.

260
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:47,900
With those online therapies you I've heard from people who have used their services, you get a different therapist potentially every time.

261
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:52,890
I believe headspace is more of a wellness app and not a therapist or meditation.

262
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,820
Yeah. Better than or, you know, better help. Meet therapy. Better help is therapy.

263
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,530
I, I think there's ways to get, to get the same person regularly.

264
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:03,950
But I could be wrong. I think you get the same person, but.

265
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:08,160
I mean, they might have like a crisis label or something.

266
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,510
Yeah, because it's really difficult to like based on their marketing. They've said, I think you can panic.

267
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:17,969
It's like just connecting it to a therapist. Yeah, but yeah,

268
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:23,610
but part of the benefits of therapy is you build a rapport and a relationship with somebody

269
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:29,079
who kind of gets to see the progression of your growth or like work with you on your issues.

270
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:34,920
So. Yeah, I haven't been to a workplace where they tried to implement a successful work.

271
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,149
Like what was an example of work life intervention would be I guess besides like

272
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:46,650
hooking up people to therapy or would that be like I did place where staff got.

273
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:52,500
Free acupuncture. Oh, that's cool. Yeah, I worked in an integrated health clinic, and I.

274
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:07,360
They were like. We? Maybe 30 minutes just a couple of times a week, but it was like from noon to one, you could go and get the.

275
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,930
Most of them I feel like our like fitness or lifestyle thing.

276
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:24,159
So for example, when I worked at Indiana University, I signed up for like this eight week fitness coaching thing that was free and I got sent a free,

277
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:30,640
like the very basic Fitbit that's just like a clip and it just parents how many steps you have.

278
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:37,660
And then once a week I would talk to a health coach who was from New Jersey and was very New Jersey.

279
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:50,890
And we would like talk about my goals or like you could sign up for Weight Watchers at a very discounted rate like pretax.

280
00:28:52,660 --> 00:29:00,520
While I was at I you they had a free smoking cessation program for their employees.

281
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:06,400
I haven't paid as much attention to what they do here because I'm to.

282
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:12,320
Busy to prioritize. Right?

283
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:20,240
I enjoyed it. Kayla there in Ann Arbor. And they actually had a pretty interesting one where they had that like the Fitbits and you can track

284
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,219
activity and like they have also smoke cessation programs and like alcohol reduction programs,

285
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:29,600
but all tied into your health care and your FSA benefit.

286
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,070
So you really get like extra cash for like. Yeah, some companies do that.

287
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,249
Interesting. Yeah. I've never seen anything like that because they try to incentivize.

288
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:41,719
If you have better cardiovascular health, you're less likely to like seek health care services.

289
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,870
So ultimately, it's lower overhead for the employer.

290
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:50,389
Right. Back to my sister who works for the city. She works for the Criminal Justice Department.

291
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:56,150
And each unit has to compete against each other in terms of the number of steps.

292
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,100
And she was complaining to me, she's like, this is B.S. like that.

293
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:06,020
Guys who work at like Parks and Rec and sanitation, of course, like they always win every week, right?

294
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:14,900
So some places, I don't know, I feel like it's mostly like fitness oriented interventions, eating disorders.

295
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:20,080
Yeah. Sometimes you're not selling.

296
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:30,980
It's not good. It's not good. Yes. Oh, sorry.

297
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:36,920
Those should be two bullet points at the end in terms of the next level is technological displacement.

298
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,960
So there are downstream effects in terms of technological job displacement.

299
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,740
So like how we said up to 40% of U.S. jobs could be done remotely.

300
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:53,570
They estimate that 46% of U.S. jobs could actually be performed by computers and algorithms.

301
00:30:54,650 --> 00:31:02,540
So with new technology, you're laughing sound. New technology creates new jobs, but also this creates increased occupational polarization.

302
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:07,170
I'm sure you've heard the rhetoric like these robots are taking away our jobs and blah, blah.

303
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:14,840
I haven't been to like a hotel or a restaurant where I've been delivered anything from a robot yet.

304
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:21,979
But I've certainly had those like customer service phone calls where they're like Bubba and you're like, I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.

305
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:27,799
And I'm like, Oh, you know? So, I mean, how many of you have noticed more automation?

306
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,700
I mean, even at our cafe here? Go ahead for a minute or we'll be there.

307
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,700
Take. They're ripping out Java blue and just getting 24.

308
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:41,180
Yeah. They're putting in a 24 seven like machine thing like airports.

309
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,010
Yeah. Yeah.

310
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:52,879
Not to have a cafe, to be honest, because there is I remember being told that they'd have it this year, but it's been defunct and it's not very good.

311
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,520
But I like the concept of it. It's at least an app.

312
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,270
It's an option. Right. And it was about your lunch.

313
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:04,790
You could go back to 17 that if you forget your lunch, you have to walk down the state street to get food.

314
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:12,750
You can or you can just like get Jimmy Johns delivered here from the end street location, the cafe you can eat at Mojo.

315
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:17,599
That's right. Um, but I will say it's interesting.

316
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,760
Don't do this right now in class, obviously, like in countries like Japan and Singapore,

317
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:27,739
there's a lot of YouTube videos that are super cool where like in Japan,

318
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:33,290
in Singapore, they have essentially like automatic vending machines for like everything.

319
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:39,169
So there's this account that I used to watch called Dancing Beacons, and it was just like this lady who lives in Singapore.

320
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:47,840
So they had like robot baristas, robot like custom boba makers, vending machines.

321
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:55,640
You can get anything from like hot Japanese curry with rice to like, I don't know, like a steak or something like that.

322
00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:05,450
But that's because like the workforce there has shifted where the people who have been displaced from those types of jobs now have other jobs.

323
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:10,670
Whereas in the US the economy is, is flexible in some ways,

324
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:19,610
but also some ways very rigid because those workers who tend to be displaced are usually those of lower

325
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:27,680
socioeconomic status and those with with lower education who kind of do more of these like frontline jobs.

326
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,830
How many of you have been to a hotel where you don't ever get delivery service because they think it's a rip off?

327
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:45,830
But like, you know, those like delivery robots I've seen driving around around here, but on campuses that do like books and stuff like that.

328
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,340
Books? Oh, yeah. I'm assume. I don't know what it is.

329
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,270
I think they do books, but I'm sure it's food and stuff.

330
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:58,490
Have you been to the pizza vending machine on South University? That sounds cool.

331
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,770
It's there next to insomnia, cookies and ALFANO.

332
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:08,330
Let me know how it goes if you if you get it right.

333
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,389
But, you know, they're thinking about, like, digitizing everything.

334
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:17,600
Like even, you know, my experience buying this first house and, like, going through the refinance and all of that.

335
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,250
I regret it now,

336
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:29,210
but I have Rocket Mortgage as my company and it is very heavily computerized and optimized like I should have just gotten the local credit union.

337
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:36,730
Those algorithms, I don't know if you guys have read math by math, this destruction or death by mass destruction,

338
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:40,640
it's like talking about how terrible algorithms have created the world, though.

339
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So it's just like who's whoever's creating. These are putting in biases that are infecting a lot of people.

340
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,900
So I'm interested to see where it go in 20 years.

341
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:56,960
50 years. But yeah, I mean, even if the smart technologies you have to think about, like,

342
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:05,570
I don't know to what extent engineers and the like and computer programmers are getting cultural competency and retraining,

343
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:10,459
but even thinking about something else and this is also another area of work that I do,

344
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:18,680
thinking about something as simple as like hand washing technology, for example, like censored things, censored soap dispensers, sensor paper towel.

345
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,750
They generally don't detect people of darker skin tones because most of the people who have engineered and like be.

346
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:32,670
To tested these technologies are white people. Essentially it's the same for pulse oximeters which is more terrifying.

347
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,670
Pulse ox or even like face face ID. Right.

348
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:45,610
So. So thinking about. Yeah. How accurate those those technologies actually actually are.

349
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:53,320
In regards to work arrangements. So obviously, we know this is a determinant of worker safety.

350
00:35:53,980 --> 00:36:00,730
Many, many more independent contractors and co workers and temp workers now compared to their

351
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:05,110
used when there used to be an there's an increase in nonstandard work arrangements.

352
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:14,070
So that obviously shifts job security, work schedule, your compensation type, pay level, security benefits, etc.

353
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,860
So this includes contingent and precarious employment.

354
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:22,580
So contingent means that the work is not expected to last.

355
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,120
So just say you're a seasonal worker, for example.

356
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:34,960
Maybe you harvest asparagus or maybe you work at like Wired's Orchard, which I think is only open from like September to November.

357
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,850
And you sell. Hi, Mira.

358
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:47,330
You're in my other class. Yeah, I'm okay.

359
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,540
I think that's good. Okay.

360
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:55,470
Which room are you looking for? This one.

361
00:36:55,470 --> 00:37:01,020
We have a class. 202 3230.

362
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,470
It's okay. I was like, is am I going back in time?

363
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,600
Is that morning. Okay. Okay.

364
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:14,000
All right. All right.

365
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:18,809
So, you know, contingent work is not expected to last precarious as what's considered insecure,

366
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:23,430
temporary, vulnerable to unfair treatment, lack of ability to negotiate pay.

367
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,880
So, for example, like I think I mentioned, like construction workers,

368
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:34,200
a lot of times you don't get paid until that day when you show up on the job and then you finish that day's worth of work.

369
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,309
It's not salaried, it's not like contractor or anything.

370
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:47,490
Sometimes it is contract. So like when you see them repair the road, that is contract work because they're paid as long as the job is done.

371
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,079
Now they're trying to do more of a split payment where you get paid faster if you finish the work faster.

372
00:37:55,080 --> 00:38:02,260
Because sometimes for these roadwork contracts, there's not a lot of incentive, as you can tell, living in the Midwest actually, like pretty quick.

373
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:10,980
Okay. So air robotics and technologies like we talked about service robots, social robots,

374
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:17,879
automated industrial vehicles and torque and forklifts that scares me.

375
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:26,760
Combines farming technology, fully automated vehicles for mining, also driving.

376
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:32,249
I've seen that those are here I've seen the ones around town and I'm I've I'm

377
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:37,110
concerned nervous but I really get a good amount of money to help out on them.

378
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:41,610
So does that always. I think it's so cool.

379
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:45,350
You think it's a goal? I love futuristic stuff, so.

380
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,780
Yeah. Unmanned for some more than people. Yeah. Yeah. I'm a guy.

381
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:54,269
The way people drive here, unmanned aerial vehicles like drones, wearable robotics.

382
00:38:54,270 --> 00:39:02,069
So in that picture, there is our engineering department here and part of Posse does a lot of exoskeleton work.

383
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:07,440
So those are wearable robotics essentially where the worker is very able body,

384
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:16,530
but they wear an exoskeleton to kind of essentially supplement their physical natural capabilities and to prevent like musculoskeletal disorders,

385
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,989
improve ergonomics. And then you have digital and managerial robots.

386
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:27,930
So all kinds of technology being integrated into the American workplace.

387
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:34,350
I would say like places like we're a little bit behind some places, like I said, like Japan is very much on the cutting edge.

388
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:40,440
If you look up some YouTube videos, it's very interesting. Singapore, parts of Asia.

389
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:48,930
Trying to think of places even and even in parts of like Scandinavia as well.

390
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:53,840
Yeah. Yeah. You're, you're, you're into the automated vehicles.

391
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,900
I think it's cool. I mean, just like a quick tidbit, I mean,

392
00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:04,560
if we almost we're going to need it like especially for like the agriculture field where the average age of farmers is like 70 years old,

393
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:10,170
like we don't have the skills anymore. Field We have to have automation to kind of like pick up for that.

394
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:18,389
Um, I don't know. I think, I think I feel like as long as the technology works correctly, right?

395
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:26,280
So. And when I was in my master's program, as in Nebraska and my roommate, her dad was a corn and soybean farmer.

396
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:31,100
And I'm not talking like a hobby farm. I'm talking commercial.

397
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:42,180
Okay. They were rich. So I had the opportunity to take a ride in a combine that was a $300,000 combine.

398
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:48,149
And I sat in the cabin and it was like decked out with all of this technology

399
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:53,860
where it shows you the path that you've combined or plowed so far in the field,

400
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:57,870
the the moisture of the soil, all that.

401
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:06,270
But because her dad was the only guy in the whole entire area that could afford Flash had this combine,

402
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:16,530
he not only did this work on his own farm, but other farmers who would pay him to essentially harvest their crop before it went bad.

403
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:22,140
So I could definitely see like, yeah, automatic industrial vehicles.

404
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:29,160
I don't know how I feel if I was like going around Costco and like these automated forklifts of like pallets of just,

405
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:35,790
I mean, like toilet paper is one thing, but like giant cans of beans falling on me is a is another thing.

406
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:44,189
But as long as they get the, the kinks worked out correctly, maybe before the semester ends you can get a ride in the and I think that affected,

407
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:52,830
you know, 256 cool to the same system of like automated vehicles around campus and stuff and it didn't seem to like hit a pedestrian at any time.

408
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:58,440
Okay. They run into one over. There's no horror stories.

409
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:04,580
Okay, interesting. Um, I, for one, welcome a robotic overlords.

410
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:08,640
Yeah, I, I would. I trust them more than people.

411
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:14,340
I mean, that's just cynical of me, but yeah, I'm just like, what if someone hacks into the system?

412
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:22,590
I'm just saying that. So I really do. I don't know. Totally think they've made a lot of movies about that, right?

413
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:27,300
Yeah. And cybersecurity is so bad and then we can't automate everything.

414
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:31,380
Yeah, yeah. There's something about the human touch.

415
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:38,040
Yeah. Sometimes, like, they messed up, but, you know, you can't, like, have a human.

416
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:42,340
Yeah, not really. Not yet. Not yet. My friendship.

417
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,430
Yes, yes. Like a doggie.

418
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:51,600
But my dad sent me this article because I call it the Michigan Healthy Meals while I'm cooperative about how there are now these, um,

419
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:59,399
robot manicures where you just like stick your hand in and you can get it like from a very basic manicure to some like kind of design.

420
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,880
And he was like, oh no, it looks like, like nail salon workers are going to be out of work soon.

421
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:10,080
And I replied and I was like, Actually, don't think so, because nail salon work is what we call the intimate labor industry.

422
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,870
Most of the time, with a customer and the nail technician,

423
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:21,239
you develop a relationship with them like kind of like how my hair stylist knows everything about my life and you know,

424
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:26,990
like with a level of like service and care they provide those things I don't think can ever be replaced by,

425
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:31,830
by a robot, but some things I would prefer to be replaced by a robot.

426
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:36,330
Um, so I'll be curious to see how this evolves over time.

427
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:45,420
I know in construction and mining and manufacturing, they're trying to get more people, more workers to adapt exoskeletons.

428
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:52,170
But it's been very, very slow going and also changes in demographics.

429
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:57,750
So differential employment opportunities, disparate exposures and susceptibility to workplace hazards,

430
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:06,120
inequitable distribution of occupational injury and illness, your individual identities.

431
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:12,959
And then there is a dearth of data for occupational safety and health outcomes for vulnerable groups most of the time,

432
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,230
because they work in workplaces that employ less than ten employees.

433
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:19,680
And if you have a workplace with fewer than ten employees,

434
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,739
you aren't necessarily required to collect any data to oath to report to OSHA on injury and illness,

435
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:29,850
like in nail salons, for example, like in restaurants.

436
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:36,040
But if we think about people who kind of work in the more precarious employment, like migrant workers, for example,

437
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:43,350
or a lot of laborers, these tend to be more like people, generally lower seas or like people of color.

438
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:51,239
For example, my colleagues who work at Nebraska during COVID while they were doing all that COVID mitigation,

439
00:44:51,240 --> 00:45:00,180
they also did a huge study of ethics in the meat and poultry processing facilities in Nebraska and Iowa,

440
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:09,450
just because they employ a large number of the recently resettled refugees from Somalia and Nepal.

441
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:14,399
And they weren't implementing any social distancing we had.

442
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:26,070
They had workers dying, getting sick, but they were just replacing them with like such high turnover rate, economic security, income.

443
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:33,600
So income security is adequate income and benefits, representation, security or individual and collective rights.

444
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:40,350
If you think about things like unionization, labor market security is an opportunity for earning income.

445
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:48,690
Employment security is protection of your income. Earning work job security is control over your content or your of your job.

446
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:56,700
And to build a career and then work security is work conditions that promote safety and well-being and then skill production.

447
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:01,260
Security is opportunity to gain and retain skills.

448
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:09,390
There is more of a demand for skilled workers in the U.S. over the past decade,

449
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:16,259
and now there is a purported skills gap where they're saying there's a mismatch between

450
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:23,190
the skills that workers have and the skills perspective employers actually want and need.

451
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:30,260
Are you also you see in these trends? No.

452
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,740
I mean, I think there's a big thing where it's like the.

453
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:40,500
But, I mean, it's kind of I mean, at this point, it's like the job says like entry level, but these like 3 to 5 years of experience.

454
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,790
And like all employers want 35 years of experience, but they don't want to train workers.

455
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:48,480
And so, yeah, I know that for a lot of different fields. Yeah.

456
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:53,239
Or like an entry level job will require like five years of experience inflection.

457
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,750
I started working when I was like 12 or something.

458
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:04,900
Right. But also now, like, because they love to because they love to blame millennials on everything.

459
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:09,620
I think I saw like millennials, husbands are not as good as boomer.

460
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:17,820
Husbands are not as good as boomer husbands because they don't actually know how to, like, fix anything around the house anymore.

461
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:22,549
True. Right. Just because there's a loss of certain skills.

462
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:28,490
But I think, you know, I'm glad that, like, access to college has increased.

463
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:33,170
Um, I know that some people out in any way,

464
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:41,120
but I've had to have in the last two weeks at least four different conversations with people who told me they want PhDs, and I've had to ask them why.

465
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:49,310
Basically, and I don't. I mean, the mindset college is not for everybody.

466
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:58,580
Um, like some people would really excel at technical positions, but they just push people towards college,

467
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:06,700
especially people who might come from low backgrounds, who may not have had the training they need to be successful.

468
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,870
Like when I went to started college, I was like,

469
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:17,000
I was never taught actually how to study because at my high school they just wanted people to stop getting pregnant and graduate high school.

470
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:27,110
Right. And so, for example, so I have cousins who grew up in Germany and in Germany, it is very different at in fourth grade,

471
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:33,770
when you are nine years old, you take an aptitude test and they basically do that basically determines the track of your life.

472
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:43,370
It's kind of intense. It is intense, yeah. Where you either kind of go down the vocational route or you go down like the like color route.

473
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:51,559
So I have cousins who work at like like Audi and like Volkswagen and do like manufacturing jobs.

474
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:58,879
And then I have a cousin who is like studied American studies and I was like, what does that even mean?

475
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,830
And now she's like a like a travel blogger.

476
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:10,700
And I have another cousin who is like an art teacher at a any college.

477
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:19,100
Anyway, even the ones who work in manufacturing facilities because of the way Germany is set up all make great money.

478
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,909
They all have houses. They all work way less than I do.

479
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:29,899
And they actually get vacations in the summer. Right. And they are like, from what I can tell, generally happy and have fulfilled lives.

480
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:38,210
Whereas here in the United States, I would say there's also more of a stigma now towards people who work at like manual jobs.

481
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:45,560
And growing up in California, like, for example, they would call like things like working in agriculture, low skill.

482
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:55,639
But if you see how fast some of those workers harvest things like asparagus or like I went not here,

483
00:49:55,640 --> 00:50:00,560
but in Indiana to an orchard where I had to, like, pluck my own raspberries for fun.

484
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,459
That hurts. It's very prickly. BUSH Okay.

485
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:09,070
And I got, like, maybe a handful of raspberries after an hour.

486
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:15,380
It is difficult. So now they're saying, is this more of this mismatch of of skills?

487
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:22,639
And then, of course, studies suggest that lower skilled workers have more difficulty getting the training and education

488
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:28,250
they need to respond to structural changes which thereby lead to poorer health outcomes.

489
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:34,879
Um, I guess to remove of the future work stuff, it wasn't super mentioned, I guess you look around and stuff,

490
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,060
but I don't know if this is because it's coming off the calendar pandemic,

491
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:45,320
but there's been a lot of research on like remote work and isolation and like the mental health because I mean,

492
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:52,280
I know future work stuff, maybe people will be more adjusted or have offices or have more of a choice in remote work.

493
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:58,210
But I, I also people who remote work kind of broke them mentally for some time early on.

494
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:03,710
So I'm curious if they've been. I think it totally depends on.

495
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,250
That's a good question. I feel like I'll have to look into that.

496
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:12,230
That'd be more of like a psychology study, I think, because it totally depends on the person.

497
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:19,850
Yeah, I, I am I would say and I would say I'm more of like an amber, but I'm more on the introvert side.

498
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:28,339
And there's some people who might have like social anxiety or something or just meet naturally be more introverted.

499
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:36,680
And they love the. Pandemic or like people who have autoimmune disorders, people who get sick very easily, like they loved working from home,

500
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:43,960
that I will say personally for me, the first two weeks I work from home and I was like, Yeah, this is great.

501
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:50,570
I can sleep in more. And then after two weeks, I was like, I'm so depressed, let me go back to the office.

502
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:53,990
And then I moved here. New city, new state.

503
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:57,740
They were like, You're working remotely? Only ever met my colleagues.

504
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:03,350
And my interview basically sat alone in my house for a year looking at all my neighbors walk their dogs.

505
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:10,040
This is like pre vaccine too. So, like, nobody really was socializing or going out.

506
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:13,610
It was very dark time.

507
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,620
It's like more intense than like normal remote work in a non-pandemic situation too.

508
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:23,569
So yeah, yeah. And, and like we said, like a lot for like women, for example,

509
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:32,270
whom I have caregiving responsibilities at home, but for some people, like it was an awesome time.

510
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:36,260
Like some people like for example, my dad, who's now retired,

511
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:43,880
he worked for the state of California and realistically he could do a month's worth of work in 10 hours.

512
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:50,750
He just went to his job because he was like hiding from my step mom and didn't want to be home with her all the time.

513
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:51,800
Now they're both retired.

514
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:59,510
It's not like a thing, but like, you know, realistically, some people realize like, I can still get my work done and I don't have to.

515
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:05,030
There's been so much research about to reduce carbon emissions from people not commuting,

516
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:10,549
how much work satisfaction and and how people have time for other things now because they're not

517
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:18,410
spending an hour in the car a day roundtrip I posted in the announcement if I find anything for you.

518
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:24,530
And there's been like a new market of like hybrid workplaces for remote workers.

519
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:30,080
Is that like and we were like a we were kind of so yeah, I just ultimately I was like, that's an interesting take on this.

520
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:37,790
I think it does kind of the approach is like here we know that you want people so to work with other people but you have to pay.

521
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:41,479
I think you have to pay for an office, but it's like a different kind of thing.

522
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,840
It is. It is. But really, it's like a communal bathroom.

523
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:48,420
I guess this is a communal bathroom, too. But I don't.

524
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:52,220
I like remote work stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Then I. That's a big thing for a lot of you.

525
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:56,180
For how many of you you want 100% remote work job.

526
00:53:56,530 --> 00:54:01,760
I think 75% to 100 is good for me not to be travel really 75 to 100%.

527
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,449
I think it's like 5050.

528
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:13,799
I do sleep. The one thing that I don't like about remote work is that like you don't necessarily get sick leave.

529
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,990
You're not every time that you're sick, but normally you call into the office, you're like,

530
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:23,569
Well, I'm sick, but I can still get on my laptop and like, yeah, responding to emails.

531
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:25,860
So like I didn't like that cause I literally had career.

532
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:37,550
So I was like trying to work and I was like, I have not gotten anything done in the past five days, so I'm not being straight right out of work.

533
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:43,399
My work life boundaries were so poor the first year was so because I was on the tenure track, I still am.

534
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:47,780
But it was just because I was at home all the time working.

535
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:55,640
I'd still have my laptop out when I was like eating dinner or like watching TV when I was in AmeriCorps.

536
00:54:55,670 --> 00:55:03,170
Because I would just like I had like people's personal health information open on my laptop.

537
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:10,310
I lived in a co-op, so like I lived with like 15 people who like mostly good, but except for that,

538
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:15,350
I had to stay in my room when I was working with people as like health information.

539
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,100
So then I would just be like, especially in the winter, I'd be in my room all day.

540
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:24,410
And that was like, hard to believe. I don't know. Yeah, it was the most depressing.

541
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:32,000
And now that I'm teaching this online class at night and I teach these two classes, I'm here Monday through Thursday.

542
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,159
I don't have to be here Monday through Thursday.

543
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:39,650
I mean, I don't have to be here Monday and Wednesday, but I just choose to be because now when I go home,

544
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:48,649
I eat dinner and then I'll like refresh emails on my phone to see if anybody is like, Oh my God, this place isn't working or whatever.

545
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:56,960
But for the most part, like, I don't work past 630 now, whereas before I was working until 8:09 p.m.

546
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,510
Right? Because there was no like clear distinction of when the day was over.

547
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:06,680
That's what I'm fine with now. It's like. It's like student life kind of.

548
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:12,030
Or the deadlines are 12:00, midnight for a lot of guys. It's like the 24 hours like on 95.

549
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:17,120
So I call. Yeah, absolutely. I will say I don't. Oh, we'll get to the Welby cooler on Thursday.

550
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:21,110
I don't know if it's the process of aging, but when I was your age at the master's level,

551
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:29,210
I was taking 16 credits every every semester, 28, 20 hours on an.

552
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:34,880
Position. It was more like 40, but we weren't. No, but they don't check as much as they do here.

553
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:42,570
Was like running clubs, going to happy hours with my friends, socializing on the weekends.

554
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:47,410
And he was because I had more gusto for life. But now that I'm older.

555
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:54,830
Something about having like a regular 8 to 10 hour job is so draining.

556
00:56:56,270 --> 00:57:01,579
And I don't even have kids or a dog. I mean, I'd be a dog too, but I don't even have kids.

557
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:04,850
So I'm like, and most days I just go home and like, I do.

558
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:08,959
Hello, fresh now. But I'm like, I don't even want to cook for myself.

559
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:15,120
So I don't know how people manage to balance all of these things and maintain their sanity.

560
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:19,730
It's it's quite interesting to me anyway.
