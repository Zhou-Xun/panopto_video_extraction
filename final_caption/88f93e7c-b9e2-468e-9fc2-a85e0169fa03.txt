1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,720
good afternoon everyone. it's five eight five six two. if this is our speaker

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:21,020
who is gonna be the speaker for all of today and all of next Tuesday and off next

3
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:26,960
Thursday. actually he'll probably even be there. the following Tuesday for least part of the time.

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,120
Doctor Anthony Burton goes by Tony. as you're

5
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:37,220
aware on the first page of everyone of the your PowerPoint

6
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,400
you have it has my name but also has his name. many of those power points.

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,760
he probably has more responsibility for putting together than I do so it's very much appropriate. and

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,860
we we completely team talk with last year. so he's very familiar with

9
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,471
class and and all the contacts on and as I mentioned to you he brings

10
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:04,031
interest to get into talk to you about war stories or points if you bring a different perspective

11
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:10,131
than I have because he's really a practicing patient physician

12
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:15,611
work work full time with General_Motors. but you may wanna say more about it. so

13
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:21,531
with no more to do I wanna turn for you. so hello everybody.

14
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:26,591
I have_to say that when I went on Kansas. the. the introductory

15
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:31,731
discussion. we're most of you posted about yourselves. I thought that was really fascinating

16
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:40,131
I just sent a little note about that

17
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:45,771
recording. we're live already.

18
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:51,291
okay. so it was great to hear about backgrounds

19
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:56,731
that you have. we have a number of nurses in the class so you have some clinical experience

20
00:01:56,731 --> 00:02:02,027
and just hygiene so really kind of a broad mix some

21
00:02:02,027 --> 00:02:07,127
with special interest in some of these topics that I'll be talking about and Doctor Robin

22
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:12,327
said. so I do have a day job a full time job and

23
00:02:12,327 --> 00:02:17,487
for the last ten years it's been a General_Motors before that. I work in the non- sufficient

24
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:22,587
medicine. free standing clinic. so I saw work

25
00:02:22,587 --> 00:02:28,267
related conditions from school district street from the airport. you name it soon.

26
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:34,067
lots of different work environment. and I have_to get up quite a few years of doing

27
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:39,267
Hospital Employee Health which is really an animal on to it self workplace

28
00:02:39,267 --> 00:02:44,327
issues. outpatient health and safety issues of

29
00:02:44,327 --> 00:02:49,467
health care workers. so this is kinda push more to support some of these things

30
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:54,667
are high very directly to clinical practice. somehow there's

31
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:59,963
not not so much but it is kind of a selection of different topics

32
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:05,463
this first one is of the three today and Lisa's work related. hearing loss

33
00:03:05,463 --> 00:03:10,963
and you said it's a very big deal. it's

34
00:03:10,963 --> 00:03:16,123
really by definition anything that you get a supposed work is preventable by

35
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:21,403
preventing the exposure and the other thing about hearing loss. like some of the diseases that

36
00:03:21,403 --> 00:03:27,103
you've heard about already. once you lose the Harris Sales and your Coakley and your inner here.

37
00:03:27,103 --> 00:03:33,403
they're gone. it's your reversible so much more reason to

38
00:03:33,403 --> 00:03:38,543
to take the relevant precautions. hearing loss

39
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:43,603
in the work place. so this is one of those flights that I don't remember anything except that it's

40
00:03:43,603 --> 00:03:48,883
a big problem. millions of people expose a_lot_of noise. a_lot_of people are supposed

41
00:03:48,883 --> 00:03:54,203
to toxins mostly chemical toxins out_of toxic

42
00:03:54,203 --> 00:03:59,439
materials that can do damage to hearing tens of thousands of cases

43
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,819
of hearing loss. a_lot_of these the majority in the manufacturing environment. especially

44
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:10,439
whole processes. I actually work at the plant. GM where they build engines

45
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:16,079
and transmissions. this machining and so forth. it's brand-new that we built the plant.

46
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,259
two years ago. some of the newer facilities. these days. I have

47
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:27,079
incredibly strict controls for exposure so there's a stamping plant in Lansing.

48
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:32,079
where you don't even need to wear hearing protection so quite used to be there at the stamping plant with

49
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:37,179
rental. he should be so loud in the whole building would vibrate. I would be small

50
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:42,199
process so things have changed dramatically but this point here is that there's

51
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,439
not this loud noise but there are chemicals in the environment. occupational of that can cause

52
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:53,519
hearing loss. so in terms of occupational diseases.

53
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:59,375
this course really focuses on our special very mental diseases as oppose to injury

54
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:05,135
lawyers this hearing loss is really one of the most common certain occupations.

55
00:05:05,135 --> 00:05:10,155
you're gonna see a large percentage of individuals with hearing loss you can see examples

56
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:15,335
example carpenters plumbers settings. either small employment settings

57
00:05:15,335 --> 00:05:20,835
where you don't have the resources of large company corporation

58
00:05:20,835 --> 00:05:27,335
to protect workers or or work place settings. which don't lend themselves so easily.

59
00:05:27,335 --> 00:05:32,855
to protection. so when you can see hearing impairment in a group

60
00:05:32,855 --> 00:05:38,335
of population this case minors. as compared to the general population

61
00:05:38,335 --> 00:05:44,175
so that's one way to determine whether a particular occupational disease.

62
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:49,815
in an occupational population cohort versus the general population.

63
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:56,165
you can see dramatic discrepancies there. so

64
00:05:56,165 --> 00:06:03,665
and by the way. feel free to read your hand touch and if you have a question or comment.

65
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:08,925
this is a common scene that you hear. repeat repeatedly and that is

66
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:14,785
the data that we have surveillance paid. especially for occupational

67
00:06:14,785 --> 00:06:19,865
diseases. even for operational injuries as well. but for special for

68
00:06:19,865 --> 00:06:25,385
special of diseases. there's a tremendous amount of under reporting and under estimation

69
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:30,425
of the real magnitude of the problem. and that's that that's a serious issue in

70
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:35,725
terms of our ability to understand the magnitude and still the problem

71
00:06:35,725 --> 00:06:41,351
and provide appropriate resources and there is there is a talk

72
00:06:41,351 --> 00:06:46,971
next week on Worker's_Compensation. we'll talk a little bit more about why that's the case.

73
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:52,331
so it's a big problem and it's bigger than we even think it is or can measure

74
00:06:52,331 --> 00:06:58,791
it so when it comes to hearing loss. use. it's not like

75
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:04,131
asked this process and you can't breathe. it's not like conditions that cost

76
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:09,671
pain. it's a question. nothing able to understand in the social setting

77
00:07:09,671 --> 00:07:14,811
and you're socially isolated. anybody have a grandparent with hearing loss.

78
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:19,891
my mother in law turned a hundred on Saturday. and if she doesn't have her hearing

79
00:07:19,891 --> 00:07:24,911
aid again. I have_to yell at her and she'll send me for yelling at her and

80
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:30,291
it's frustrating for those around people who have hearing loss because

81
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:35,291
of that and the social isolation is quite significant. matching yourself in

82
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:40,331
a social setting in a restaurant or a family gathering or something. and everybody's talking and all you

83
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:45,344
hear is what you can see with your rights and you can't understand I can't assisting with

84
00:07:45,344 --> 00:07:50,424
the words so it's a significant issue. and and again once

85
00:07:50,424 --> 00:07:55,524
this is Vance over years. you can't do much about it and I can tell

86
00:07:55,524 --> 00:08:00,584
you that using hearing aid. you have like the original equipment. it isn't the same

87
00:08:00,584 --> 00:08:05,804
as having the ability to discriminate words and understand what people

88
00:08:05,804 --> 00:08:11,184
are saying. how many of you had any discussion I hate your others

89
00:08:11,184 --> 00:08:17,284
any science about noise measuring noise. anybody

90
00:08:17,284 --> 00:08:22,564
few people. so some reviews I'm not. so we'll be talking about how loud

91
00:08:22,564 --> 00:08:28,204
the sound is. we talked about sound pressure level or intensity

92
00:08:28,204 --> 00:08:33,284
and it's measuring decibel. so it's a tenth of a bell and there is

93
00:08:33,284 --> 00:08:38,424
a waiting system because our ability to hear a different frequencies of different pictures.

94
00:08:38,424 --> 00:08:44,086
very five the kitchen so if you look at our sensitivity

95
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:49,326
over range of frequencies and you pop that and you would just for that

96
00:08:49,326 --> 00:08:55,026
that's called eight waiting. so the ace Kelly also often see the abbreviation DVA.

97
00:08:55,026 --> 00:09:01,626
so I guess the bells on the on the waiting scale.

98
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:06,826
when we talk about decibel as a racial blog with him. for those of you are mathematical inclined.

99
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:12,246
you're probably not sweating to hear that. but first for the rest of us. racial

100
00:09:12,246 --> 00:09:17,306
laundry rooms. what it comes down to me is that we're looking at something

101
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:22,886
relative to another another thing so for example twenty twenty vision we measure your vision.

102
00:09:22,886 --> 00:09:28,246
it's where you can see twenty feet at a normal person can see it twenty and you compare

103
00:09:28,246 --> 00:09:33,266
that. so twenty twenty. normal. some people have been in twenty twenty vision twenty

104
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:38,926
thirteen vision and what race is a Walgreens you can get here in specials of zero

105
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:44,140
and you can get a threshold in the negative range that just means it's even better

106
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,420
than a positive number for example. so because

107
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:54,920
of this for six sound and how it's measured. we talk about.

108
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm speaking right now in a normal tone of voice is probably sixty just a bullet. I'm kinda crank it up.

109
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,080
so all you can hear up to maybe I don't sixty five decibel that's eight seventy just the bills.

110
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:10,220
that's eight ten times. the sound intensity or what we

111
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:17,520
might think of is Lawrence. ten times. I've added sixty

112
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,520
increase of three just the bells is doubling up the sound intensity. so

113
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:28,100
just to get a sense that because of the way were measuring sound intensity. when you increase by

114
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:35,280
ten and you really talking about how to increase about factor of ten. just called in an order of magnitude.

115
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,500
and anytime you heard something about sound. you probably seen charts like

116
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:45,874
this where the here's the circle representing

117
00:10:45,874 --> 00:10:50,954
the sound intensity at eighty five decibel. and here's a hundred and sixty six

118
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:56,794
also from a hundred and three hundred and six that's doubling up sound intensity

119
00:10:56,794 --> 00:11:01,894
as opposed to just three out_of ten. it was a thirty

120
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:07,614
percent increase so that's important to keep in mind. as I said normal conversation

121
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:12,694
is about sixty does the bells. very quiet room. it's down to maybe twenty or thirty

122
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:17,814
decibel ten five decibel is just barely audible for most

123
00:11:17,814 --> 00:11:23,754
people. so just says if you were exposed

124
00:11:23,754 --> 00:11:28,854
to ninety death bills. I never did it's eight hours and that kind of a noisy

125
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:33,994
environment. supposedly that you won't sustain any hearing loss

126
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:39,834
with that kind of exposure. if you turn the noise volume up. so ten ninety five.

127
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:44,890
you have_to now. cut down the time that you're gonna spend. so that's

128
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:49,990
the exchange rate for duration of exposure at various

129
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:55,050
sound pressure levels. so if you uses a five decibel

130
00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:00,290
exchange rate. now I she is more protective and there's literature that suggest

131
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:05,490
that. there's a_lot more people that would lose their hearing. if the

132
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:10,510
OSHA standards were followed. as opposed to the nine dash recommended level

133
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:16,130
so smart and I asked as well the exchange rate should really be three test of bells and exposure.

134
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:21,450
it should be eighty five and said oh shit the same ninety in here just a little chart that shows

135
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:26,970
you the exposure level in the first column. eighty five two hundred and

136
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:33,890
how much time you would be permitted to be exposed at those levels.

137
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:38,990
under old shopper's is now hassle at a hundred decibel for example. so she said you can spend two

138
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:44,644
hours here and I assess fifteen minutes so like a_lot_of standards.

139
00:12:44,644 --> 00:12:49,704
oh shot such a standard that may or may not be entirely protected.

140
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:55,164
certainly if help everybody you might be exposed. if it does require

141
00:12:55,164 --> 00:13:00,264
what's hearing conservation program. eight CP. if you will expose it eighty five

142
00:13:00,264 --> 00:13:05,304
decibel for more the time waited average and there's a number of requirements at

143
00:13:05,304 --> 00:13:11,144
all she has_to for example. you have_to get out there with the sound level meter and do

144
00:13:11,144 --> 00:13:16,176
measurements on site I calculate what the time we did the average

145
00:13:16,176 --> 00:13:21,536
exposure is per job description. you have_to use engineering controls to reduce

146
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:26,696
noise. you have_to do audio gram hearing test on a yearly basis. and

147
00:13:26,696 --> 00:13:32,116
this is medical surveillance you heard about surveillance or the beginning of the course. this is medical surveillance

148
00:13:32,116 --> 00:13:37,416
of clinical assessments on a routine basis to determine if there's a adverse health

149
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:42,576
effects from occupational exposure. in this case and noise voice. and you

150
00:13:42,576 --> 00:13:47,616
also have_to provide a hearing protection.

151
00:13:47,616 --> 00:13:53,076
so also also said that when you do the annual hearing test.

152
00:13:53,076 --> 00:13:58,476
you have_to look at the average threshold at three

153
00:13:58,476 --> 00:14:03,696
Freeman Cesar. first three two and three South two thousand three thousand four thousand.

154
00:14:03,696 --> 00:14:09,056
birds are cycles per second. these are the pictures or frequencies that are sensitive

155
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:14,079
to noise and average that and compare that to what it was before. what a

156
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,339
baseline test showed. and if there is sufficient debt permits and hearing

157
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:24,519
loss and hearing between the baseline measurements and current

158
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:29,639
contest. they call that the standard special shift. and if it persist for long

159
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,719
enough. it can represent permanent hearing loss. so it's

160
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:39,879
a way of determining whether an individual is losing their hearing

161
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:45,239
because of the noise exposure in providing some corrective measures

162
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:50,259
before the noise exposure becomes permanent. so with

163
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:55,659
that. just a little bit more basic about hearing. I hearing loss.

164
00:14:55,659 --> 00:15:00,979
there's two major categories of hearing loss one is

165
00:15:00,979 --> 00:15:06,819
and conduct it simply refers to the conduction of that air waves that are coming out_of my mouth

166
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:11,883
going through your ear canal going in heading to you're drowned in

167
00:15:11,883 --> 00:15:16,983
temporary membrane and those little bones that connect to the Internet here. all those

168
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:22,003
mechanisms conduct. the sound to eventually

169
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:27,483
get to the interview. so if you have a problem like a plug a lapse in you're here

170
00:15:27,483 --> 00:15:32,783
for a hole in your eardrum. that would be a conduct of loss. once

171
00:15:32,783 --> 00:15:37,803
the sound is sense. five D's Harris shells in the

172
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:42,923
interview and the Coakley. if there is damage for the next

173
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:47,923
sensory loss. so after you can break up sensory and early. you people usually put it together

174
00:15:47,923 --> 00:15:53,063
but they're really interesting things so sentry losses here Sales and the Copia. that received

175
00:15:53,063 --> 00:15:58,683
the vibrations and turn it in to an impulse that goes down the auditory nerve.

176
00:15:58,683 --> 00:16:04,663
the problem with that nerve like an acoustical aroma as an example. you can have.

177
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:09,791
you can have normal hearing loss as opposed to sensory loss noise and use hearing

178
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:15,111
loss. has_to do with your ability to Sam's in the interview and that is stands.

179
00:16:15,111 --> 00:16:20,671
since we lost or since your renewal. hey here's the picture that put that together. so

180
00:16:20,671 --> 00:16:26,171
conduct of last year to nail the eardrum and panic membrane.

181
00:16:26,171 --> 00:16:32,111
member those three little bones there that conducts the vibrations from that you're drawn

182
00:16:32,111 --> 00:16:37,271
to the. hopefully. and once you get there and hopefully you know

183
00:16:37,271 --> 00:16:42,291
you're in in the territory of sensory neural lots of Century Lawson the

184
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:48,591
Coakley. and this is the auditory nerve. leading the way to the brain and

185
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:54,431
so different areas. we're lost.

186
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:59,811
so the quote for you. is this Jay. and it's

187
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:05,971
filled with cells that have silly or hairs on them and

188
00:17:05,971 --> 00:17:12,923
there are depending on the location of the cells within the Coakley.

189
00:17:12,923 --> 00:17:18,623
they sent different frequencies and that helps understand help you understand.

190
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:26,063
why for example noise and dues hearing loss affects only certain frequencies. least initially.

191
00:17:26,063 --> 00:17:31,723
so there's a lawsuit filed thousand here sales in the Coakley.

192
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:37,503
and they feed essentially see auditory nerve.

193
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:42,803
have already said that different resource in different areas with locations within the Copia

194
00:17:42,803 --> 00:17:49,083
respond to different frequencies the sound waves and it's between about three and six thousand

195
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:54,543
Hertz or cycles per second. those frequencies that are the most susceptible. so by the way.

196
00:17:54,543 --> 00:17:59,903
if you bought a really good stereo system years ago. the frequency response would be from twenty hertz

197
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:04,983
to maybe twenty thousand heard really high frequencies and what makes the dogs. their heads. where

198
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:10,359
people can't hear any more. we typically focus

199
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:15,359
human speech is about five hundred thousand Hertz. we usually measure up about eight thousand

200
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:20,679
Hertz or cycles per second. so here's a picture for Celia.

201
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:26,439
the actual. so call here's on top of the sales within the Coakley.

202
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:32,539
probably a rodent or something and here is picture

203
00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:38,039
on your left. this is a roll. hopefully with those kind of angle

204
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:43,239
white structures which Christine here sells and

205
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:48,319
if they say on the right. is you're here sales on a_lot

206
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:53,519
lot of noise for a long period of time. so you can see that you can actually get the estimation of the hair

207
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:59,159
cells. once or gone they're gone. those cells to no longer perceive noise.

208
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:04,739
sounds at those frequencies. so

209
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:10,175
when we do surveillance the idea is to measure.

210
00:19:10,175 --> 00:19:15,835
one's ability to hear sounds and we do it by

211
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:20,895
using audio I had heard that measures your ability here. at your

212
00:19:20,895 --> 00:19:26,315
tongs and a pure tone just means that you refuse from the string of the guitar.

213
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:32,015
there's a foundation tone. like the Easter rain. but there are harmonic vibrations

214
00:19:32,015 --> 00:19:37,015
at different pictures different frequencies. at the same time. so if your tone doesn't have those

215
00:19:37,015 --> 00:19:42,075
harmonic to it only has sound fundamental tone and the

216
00:19:42,075 --> 00:19:47,235
way you and Ariana were said you haven't been exposed to it is that they get. the machine plays

217
00:19:47,235 --> 00:19:52,411
at home at a very soft sound and until you get to the farm when you can reproduce

218
00:19:52,411 --> 00:19:57,711
a plea indicate that you hear the pitch sounding. that's when it

219
00:19:57,711 --> 00:20:04,011
determines that you have the ability to be here at that particular specials.

220
00:20:04,011 --> 00:20:09,031
so that's done done for each year from low frequencies typically from about

221
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:14,631
five hundred words to eight thousand Hertz. so that's it. the number of

222
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:20,411
test for each year. different frequencies.

223
00:20:20,411 --> 00:20:25,511
so what normal hearing. typically it's like twenty twenty vision is that normally

224
00:20:25,511 --> 00:20:30,651
twenty twenty five year. probably close to it right. so what they typically the typical

225
00:20:30,651 --> 00:20:36,951
convention is that you can hear at first post up to twenty five. that's called normal

226
00:20:36,951 --> 00:20:42,171
and it's probably asked to say that somebody can hear let's say at forty

227
00:20:42,171 --> 00:20:47,191
decibel and call that threshold of hearing as opposed to hearing loss. because what you're

228
00:20:47,191 --> 00:20:52,327
defining is at what level of sound intensely or loud and if somebody

229
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:57,367
is able to actually hear something. so.

230
00:20:57,367 --> 00:21:02,487
so you don't say you know you got a vision loss of twenty forty say you're Billy to see you soon.

231
00:21:02,487 --> 00:21:07,707
twenty forty which means you know. you can see at twenty feet with a normal person

232
00:21:07,707 --> 00:21:13,687
can back up to forty. so we do this testing

233
00:21:13,687 --> 00:21:19,087
annually. and it allows us to see if there's a significant change. so

234
00:21:19,087 --> 00:21:24,347
this is fine friend. bye. this is actually for Mike Platt and Sherry Cruz is the nurse I just

235
00:21:24,347 --> 00:21:29,567
left about an hour and a half ago. who did least the last test. so what you got

236
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:34,626
is the last year and the right here.

237
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:40,167
each role represents a different test. so this test on here says

238
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:45,327
March second nineteen ninety nine there's two thousand two and all the way up and when I printed this

239
00:21:45,327 --> 00:21:50,371
one office is June fourteenth twenty eleven. these numbers here are

240
00:21:50,371 --> 00:21:55,471
the results of the test. and here is ten decibel at five hundred

241
00:21:55,471 --> 00:22:00,611
hertz on the left ear. I need to see if this number is ten fifteen five ten ten

242
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:05,871
five five. you know we're on the right here. ten ten five ten twenty and five.

243
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:11,051
normal here. alright. so whatever it takes. one roll

244
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:16,071
and just put it in the plot. if this is something I think is probably useful for you

245
00:22:16,071 --> 00:22:21,671
to understand and just be familiar with the case is you know with

246
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:26,731
it allows you to become conversing with someone to talk about our llama tree. so

247
00:22:26,731 --> 00:22:31,911
it's fairly simple. along the accesses. the horizontal axis

248
00:22:31,911 --> 00:22:37,251
are the frequencies that are being tested in this case. the results are from two hundred fifty Hertz

249
00:22:37,251 --> 00:22:42,991
to eight thousand Hertz. I don't see any data for six hours in this case.

250
00:22:42,991 --> 00:22:48,130
the last year is marked by the axes. the graph with the axes and right

251
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:53,346
here with zeros that that line and then

252
00:22:53,346 --> 00:22:58,446
on the Y axis is hearing level. and you can see on the right this

253
00:22:58,446 --> 00:23:03,626
is normal in that colored area that goes between negative ten decibel up

254
00:23:03,626 --> 00:23:08,746
to twenty five decimal. as I said for the conventional designation for normal hearing.

255
00:23:08,746 --> 00:23:14,166
this person's hearing from two hundred fifty hertz or cycles per second to eight thousand.

256
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:19,226
it's normal. alright so this is a normal audit. you can just look at it in a second. you don't have_to look look

257
00:23:19,226 --> 00:23:26,106
at each number in the chart for a table. you look at the graphic. you know the answer.

258
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:31,426
so what we do though is freaking up on this. this

259
00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:36,706
is a test here with us on a metric collection of information from nineteen

260
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:41,886
ninety nine. we would compare the current test to what we can regarded

261
00:23:41,886 --> 00:23:46,886
as the person's baseline test and we calculate the

262
00:23:46,886 --> 00:23:52,391
change. as I said before we look at the average here in fresh old

263
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:57,730
hey averaging three values for each year of two thousand three thousand four thousand. compare

264
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:03,830
that average to. that is the baseline and determine if there has been a threshold shift

265
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:09,070
which the average is ten testicles or more. and I would suggest that somebody

266
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:14,690
has some hearing loss and maybe they play some loud noise loud music on the drive over

267
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:20,950
to work or maybe have a head cold or could be many reasons for that.

268
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:26,350
so of this is from the re reading today.

269
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:31,470
the reason for noise is kind of it's just a statement from American College of occupation permit for Madison this

270
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:36,531
is an easy like three page or something. so I think it's easy to read out and it

271
00:24:36,531 --> 00:24:42,010
will rehash what time. much of what I'm talking about. so

272
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:47,510
I know you just hearing loss. is actually a sensory loss or sensory neural loss.

273
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:52,791
I just said that it's usually bilateral because of response noise it's typically ambient

274
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:59,010
and affecting both years but hey Candy. he's a metric depending on the exposure.

275
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:04,071
and here's another classic thing about noise and who's hearing loss that I've already

276
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:09,331
alluded to and that is the frequencies three thousand to six thousand. purchase are

277
00:25:09,331 --> 00:25:15,051
the ones for you first to see the loss and hearing the worsening of the

278
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:20,291
raffles and typically in the higher frequency is like at six and eight thousand

279
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:25,510
Hertz. you said you tend to see what the call recovery or just better

280
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:30,551
better hearing preference. it's also true that if

281
00:25:30,551 --> 00:25:36,651
you're supposed to continue with loud noise it tends to be more damaging than intermittent.

282
00:25:36,651 --> 00:25:41,711
so here's the grass and you can see. except for this little notch here

283
00:25:41,711 --> 00:25:47,091
at that peaks our or gets mostly four thousand. the numbers

284
00:25:47,091 --> 00:25:52,891
are in the normal range except for that now. so this is sort of a textbook example

285
00:25:52,891 --> 00:25:57,943
early noise and just hearing loss if your ears are filled with wax.

286
00:25:57,943 --> 00:26:03,263
it's not gonna look like this. you have a different pattern. so conduct

287
00:26:03,263 --> 00:26:08,323
lost looks different from since renewal loss. so this is

288
00:26:08,323 --> 00:26:14,662
a classic example. I voice Theresa about continuous noise

289
00:26:14,662 --> 00:26:19,763
over the first ten to fifteen years. that's when most of the hearing loss

290
00:26:19,763 --> 00:26:24,922
tens to occur. so if you're trying to save somebody from hearing loss

291
00:26:24,922 --> 00:26:29,967
from loud noise. you wanna get at them early in the in their experience

292
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:34,987
of exposure and the likelihood is that when

293
00:26:34,987 --> 00:26:40,427
you stop at the exposure. the lost. I did not continue.

294
00:26:40,427 --> 00:26:46,547
never did mention that you can get Ace metric loss. for various reasons.

295
00:26:46,547 --> 00:26:51,647
he said metric exposure in particular. it's

296
00:26:51,647 --> 00:26:56,707
only shoots up gone off fire here or you're working as a plumber on a compressed air

297
00:26:56,707 --> 00:27:01,867
line and it does avail near here. I you can get hearing loss from the cruise

298
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:07,147
did trauma up there. and typically it's conduct of loss I saw a plumber

299
00:27:07,147 --> 00:27:12,387
with just that compressed air injury and he had a ruptured your

300
00:27:12,387 --> 00:27:17,607
drum from that in there if there is sufficient noise

301
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:22,947
single. hadn't can actually call us. Century loss as well.

302
00:27:22,947 --> 00:27:28,087
parts are here to graph it's a little different. in fact it represents testing

303
00:27:28,087 --> 00:27:33,818
of carpenter at different ages and since there's one line for

304
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:38,938
High H. for this individual. I'm not sure I got this from nine

305
00:27:38,938 --> 00:27:44,198
gosh I think it's either the right and left your average or just one year. but.

306
00:27:44,198 --> 00:27:49,218
so you don't see both ears and that's what you do see it in one graph. what happens

307
00:27:49,218 --> 00:27:54,958
to a carpenter from age twenty five to fifty five without adequate

308
00:27:54,958 --> 00:28:00,098
healing protection. and you don't really see the not so much really and sometimes that's just

309
00:28:00,098 --> 00:28:05,518
the case you don't see that the classic textbook notch. the reason debt recovery

310
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:10,538
and well actually this rep only goes to six thousand which anyway. it's possible that it doesn't

311
00:28:10,538 --> 00:28:15,618
hurt. it was something compared to the deal. this

312
00:28:15,618 --> 00:28:20,618
is from where I work and get the same kind of plot but in this case so I've

313
00:28:20,618 --> 00:28:26,278
got in red. this is a fifty nine-year-old. I

314
00:28:26,278 --> 00:29:29,754
get my plant in Romulus. and what we got is the last year and the right here

315
00:29:29,754 --> 00:29:34,994
we do lose here and sometimes just getting older we call that press the two system that can sometimes

316
00:29:34,994 --> 00:29:40,134
look like the voices of hearing loss money to advance and so that can be

317
00:29:40,134 --> 00:29:45,194
sometimes difficult to. so they were

318
00:29:45,194 --> 00:29:50,834
here and protection devices that are available in a noisy environment. go the hardware store.

319
00:29:50,834 --> 00:29:56,274
if you gonna do some gardening or something like that. to protect your hearing. these devices

320
00:29:56,274 --> 00:30:01,434
are rated his house how well they protect you from loud noise the noise

321
00:30:01,434 --> 00:30:06,594
reduction reading and our are and usually in practice. you

322
00:30:06,594 --> 00:30:11,614
don't get it. is is is good degree of protection. if you do

323
00:30:11,614 --> 00:30:18,694
in the laboratory when they actually put the rating on the device.

324
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:23,714
there's a_lot_of reasons for that and sometimes people know where the hearing protection correctly. if

325
00:30:23,714 --> 00:30:28,734
you're pleasure to treat us for being you another sticking out_of that here

326
00:30:28,734 --> 00:30:33,918
can you rather than being in the your canal again and so forth and sometimes you know people

327
00:30:33,918 --> 00:30:38,978
pulling out to thinking here and they don't put it back in and they say they were and

328
00:30:38,978 --> 00:30:44,078
they don't. okay. so. so

329
00:30:44,078 --> 00:30:49,518
I suggested earlier that there's more than just the noise that can cause

330
00:30:49,518 --> 00:30:54,698
hearing loss. enjoy the effects the Coakley. but there are number of chemical substances

331
00:30:54,698 --> 00:31:02,018
that affect the quote. but also wanted just give you a quote for your apparatus.

332
00:31:02,018 --> 00:31:07,438
that is the case and the mechanism in that in the in your ear that helps

333
00:31:07,438 --> 00:31:12,718
the semi circular canal if it helps with your distributor function which is your balance.

334
00:31:12,718 --> 00:31:18,518
we need to maintain balance. and also the new Eastern or

335
00:31:18,518 --> 00:31:23,618
leading to the brain from the from that year here.

336
00:31:23,618 --> 00:31:28,798
so this is review in two thousand nine for listing sentences

337
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:33,952
that we're ready to demonstrate good evidence for photo toxicity received

338
00:31:33,952 --> 00:31:39,312
you've already heard. Doctor Robins. talk about normal text saying that six

339
00:31:39,312 --> 00:31:45,632
train. Alice Patrick Street Chain. Hydro Carbon.

340
00:31:45,632 --> 00:31:51,352
that is have a license form. it is no toxic so it's toxic to nerves

341
00:31:51,352 --> 00:31:56,792
calmed I felt like you've heard about that time and so forth. so there's a number of these chemicals

342
00:31:56,792 --> 00:32:02,092
cover monoxide hygiene side. these are six tens

343
00:32:02,092 --> 00:32:08,192
and some of these medicines as well including the lead

344
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:13,372
and it's flight leaves out. if you have exposure to loud noise and to some of these

345
00:32:13,372 --> 00:32:18,832
chemicals. so you can imagine that in a metal shop where you

346
00:32:18,832 --> 00:32:24,172
are using machines to grind and cut metal and maybe

347
00:32:24,172 --> 00:32:29,632
also have exposure to Sullivan's and so forth. where you can have exposure

348
00:32:29,632 --> 00:32:37,408
to loud noise and all the toxic chemicals can have it added to percentages.

349
00:32:37,408 --> 00:32:42,508
so I think it's worthwhile understanding audio three. if you're towing or llama tree. it's

350
00:32:42,508 --> 00:32:48,168
fairly basic I think you know if it's a little confusing just read about it in again.

351
00:32:48,168 --> 00:32:53,168
and and then the typical pattern for the normal autograph looks like with that classic

352
00:32:53,168 --> 00:32:59,048
really noise induced. hearing loss looks like in the fact that we do

353
00:32:59,048 --> 00:33:04,268
medical surveillance on a routine basis. in an effort to identify

354
00:33:04,268 --> 00:33:09,728
people who have hearing loss end to catch them early on

355
00:33:09,728 --> 00:33:15,368
before it progresses. so any questions about hearing loss

356
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:20,468
any comments. some of you have done audio on the tree. some of you. nurses have done

357
00:33:20,468 --> 00:33:26,448
all the entry any any questions or comments on your experiences.

358
00:33:26,448 --> 00:33:34,488
don't be afraid.

359
00:33:34,488 --> 00:33:39,608
okay. you're here.

360
00:33:39,608 --> 00:33:44,768
okay.

361
00:33:44,768 --> 00:33:49,868
and my spirit are llama tree. you know it's not quite all that simple. when you get down

362
00:33:49,868 --> 00:33:56,208
to the detail. we can talk about eight correction.

363
00:33:56,208 --> 00:34:01,468
of your permits employers to say well. if you get older

364
00:34:01,468 --> 00:34:07,008
you're gonna lose your hearing. anyway so you can apply certain amount of documents

365
00:34:07,008 --> 00:34:13,243
you getting older whether it applies to you individually or not.

366
00:34:13,243 --> 00:34:18,343
alright.

367
00:34:18,343 --> 00:34:23,743
well sometimes you don't get a chance. you know some people get all the sclerosis of little bones

368
00:34:23,743 --> 00:34:28,763
in the middle here. get hard and they don't conduct.

369
00:34:28,763 --> 00:34:33,923
so there's different classes for it but not everybody gets right to like I say

370
00:34:33,923 --> 00:34:39,823
it's a one size fits all correction for hearing loss. I do two

371
00:34:39,823 --> 00:34:45,003
two eight or just reply to something. yes you apply page

372
00:34:45,003 --> 00:34:50,243
correction to somebody who doesn't lose their hearing in fact have the identical numbers

373
00:34:50,243 --> 00:34:55,483
from baseline to twenty years later and you do eight correction. it'll say your hearing is actually

374
00:34:55,483 --> 00:35:00,923
improved because I give you credit. thank you probably would've lost your hearing.

375
00:35:00,923 --> 00:35:06,243
so when you start doing that just wanted actually book all you're hearing is actually improved.

376
00:35:06,243 --> 00:35:19,318
it hasn't changed at all. so so.

377
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:24,479
alright. yeah. so good point. there are certain antibiotics. yeah

378
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:29,578
there's a_lot_of things that and got hearing loss and so there's a class of antibiotics that are

379
00:35:29,578 --> 00:35:35,078
mean like five Drive. that you get ID and can cause hearing loss.

380
00:35:35,078 --> 00:35:40,078
so that's one we have there's a few read articles about hearing

381
00:35:40,078 --> 00:35:46,878
loss and you need to determine whether the hearing loss is due to exposure noise versus

382
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:51,938
any number of other exposures and experiences. then you're taking a much

383
00:35:51,938 --> 00:35:59,438
more detailed history including history of allergies and so forth.

384
00:35:59,438 --> 00:36:05,638
okay. this topic. occupational Texas disease is.

385
00:36:05,638 --> 00:36:10,665
it's really different in the sense that hi is

386
00:36:10,665 --> 00:36:15,705
all talk about. there's a zillion organizms out there and

387
00:36:15,705 --> 00:36:20,825
this is one of those slides just to make you understand that. the list goes on and on and on

388
00:36:20,825 --> 00:36:25,905
and on occupational infectious diseases

389
00:36:25,905 --> 00:36:31,025
tend to be sporadic. fairly uncommon. they tend to

390
00:36:31,025 --> 00:36:36,045
occur in like discreet clusters. just thought

391
00:36:36,045 --> 00:36:41,185
I'd by the nature and so there's all sorts of ways of slicing and icing

392
00:36:41,185 --> 00:36:46,305
the topic. you can get it. you can get an infection from working with other people. I don't need

393
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:51,805
you sharing flu virus. you know with you're in a room like yes I'm talking about

394
00:36:51,805 --> 00:36:56,985
health care workers dealing with sick people who got you on Missus Wright. you can get six

395
00:36:56,985 --> 00:37:02,005
from Anna. you know if you're pregnant and you got a Cathy you think about that supplies

396
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:07,265
most is which can cause congenital health fax. you can get sick from

397
00:37:07,265 --> 00:37:12,545
certain work environment. there's a film crew that suffered Valley fever and some of business in Southern

398
00:37:12,545 --> 00:37:18,385
California. from working out in the desert. so it's a fungal infection. so and

399
00:37:18,385 --> 00:37:23,465
there are certain occupations that tend to be at higher risk so the first and the

400
00:37:23,465 --> 00:37:28,645
last item here catching it from humans and select occupations. really

401
00:37:28,645 --> 00:37:34,605
leaves us to health care workers. we most of the focus and

402
00:37:34,605 --> 00:37:39,685
in terms of engine and problems. most our fashions. tend to occur in

403
00:37:39,685 --> 00:37:44,845
that setting. there's millions of people who work at Medical Centers

404
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:50,465
who are first responders. firefighters law enforcement and so forth.

405
00:37:50,465 --> 00:37:56,025
where you interact with people who are sick and you can get exposed to

406
00:37:56,025 --> 00:38:02,006
passage in's that are in the blood stream of these individuals are in their body. it's

407
00:38:02,006 --> 00:38:07,266
and so when you were closely with individuals who are sick. have an infection.

408
00:38:07,266 --> 00:38:12,806
there's an opportunity to get sick yourself. so during your way to doing that.

409
00:38:12,806 --> 00:38:17,986
you can draw from these blood and start recapping the needle which you shouldn't do and push the needle through

410
00:38:17,986 --> 00:38:23,966
the cabinet your son in my internship at Saint Joe's and eighty

411
00:38:23,966 --> 00:38:30,106
eight. the nurse. after injecting happened to

412
00:38:30,106 --> 00:38:35,146
a patient with HIV. did you asked now and then rattle

413
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:40,286
you to your bones in and make you quite afraid.

414
00:38:40,286 --> 00:38:45,426
but I'll talk more about what can happen and what are he just getting sick or something like

415
00:38:45,426 --> 00:38:50,466
that. so that's pretty change to the skin. you can splash blood or body fluids

416
00:38:50,466 --> 00:38:56,146
into it and not impact skin which is pretty protective but skin that's compromise

417
00:38:56,146 --> 00:39:01,291
you got a rash hit your mail for your eyes where

418
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:06,331
your nose. where you close the service can permit transmission

419
00:39:06,331 --> 00:39:11,491
air born transmission by droplets. there were people who have contamination

420
00:39:11,491 --> 00:39:16,691
on their hands and they go and cut your doorknob touch the door and all of your

421
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:21,731
right. so there's transmission that way and of course you can just

422
00:39:21,731 --> 00:39:26,871
work with someone who's got to see and infected and getting

423
00:39:26,871 --> 00:39:32,051
connected that way. so I just talked about an

424
00:39:32,051 --> 00:39:37,371
occupational pretty can use leave your right direct contacts. there's

425
00:39:37,371 --> 00:39:42,511
hundreds of thousands. these kinds of events that occur every year.

426
00:39:42,511 --> 00:39:48,663
much of them go one hundred forty if you've ever been associated with

427
00:39:48,663 --> 00:39:54,803
Health Care Center. our Health Center and

428
00:39:54,803 --> 00:39:59,983
nursing staff positions. stick themselves. just wanna

429
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:04,983
send you don't wanna believe that it didn't happen and you're not in about getting it checked out. when in fact you

430
00:40:04,983 --> 00:40:10,083
really should do that. so there is a significant amount of under reporting. again you heard

431
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:15,443
early on in the course about surveillance. there two major sources of surveillance

432
00:40:15,443 --> 00:40:21,083
for needle sticks and the health care setting. one is at the Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention.

433
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:26,083
and then there's a few people at the University of Virginia. who

434
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:32,943
have been checking the collection of data and developing

435
00:40:32,943 --> 00:40:38,623
systems for reducing opportunities for exposures

436
00:40:38,623 --> 00:40:44,158
and they have system called. happy net which is significant

437
00:40:44,158 --> 00:40:49,318
repository of data. I need kind of exposure. so

438
00:40:49,318 --> 00:40:54,578
you can get a_lot_of different kinds of infections at least check yourself of the needle after drawing blood. that's a fraud

439
00:40:54,578 --> 00:41:00,038
from the patient. but the big three RVs and these are really knowing

440
00:41:00,038 --> 00:41:06,238
have ties the virus and then you can see the abbreviation HPV hepatitis. see virus

441
00:41:06,238 --> 00:41:11,718
which used to be for the most part. call nine eight nine. even we didn't know that

442
00:41:11,718 --> 00:41:16,718
when we didn't have it identified and then a check. so there's

443
00:41:16,718 --> 00:41:21,778
a_lot_of others if you look through the literature you'll see articles about people getting all these

444
00:41:21,778 --> 00:41:27,618
other conditions. Larry and surplus and all these other things from deal sticks.

445
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:32,618
their generally case reports and not common. it's a big deal when you do get

446
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:39,234
something like this. but as a rule these are tested for

447
00:41:39,234 --> 00:41:45,014
so have a guys me is the most common occupational you inquired acquired infection

448
00:41:45,014 --> 00:41:50,114
in this setting. it's got the highest risk. so you take some blood in the

449
00:41:50,114 --> 00:41:55,234
syringe for and have a speed hospitals patient and you stick yourself

450
00:41:55,234 --> 00:42:00,234
and the range. transmission risk is about six

451
00:42:00,234 --> 00:42:05,814
to thirty percent. depending on the degree of Renee. how much viruses

452
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:12,914
in the source patient. and also the kind of infection whether

453
00:42:12,914 --> 00:42:18,614
there's different ways of measuring the grievance activity for hepatitis_B.

454
00:42:18,614 --> 00:42:23,614
there's millions of people in the US with a chronic infection in the in the general population of

455
00:42:23,614 --> 00:42:28,634
course they tend to be sicker. they tend to be in the hospital and so there's no opportunities to

456
00:42:28,634 --> 00:42:33,894
get stop. if you do get infected. you

457
00:42:33,894 --> 00:42:38,934
can find confession in fully recovered. you can find it in become

458
00:42:38,934 --> 00:42:43,954
a chronic carrier without becoming ill. you actually make it to leave himself a

459
00:42:43,954 --> 00:42:49,634
liver failure cancer and you can die so there's a really broad range of

460
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:54,854
comps. if you do get exposed.

461
00:42:54,854 --> 00:42:59,854
so this is a big deal. yeah that nineteen eighty two. when some of

462
00:42:59,854 --> 00:43:04,874
those for Medical students maybe

463
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:09,914
resting very long. there was a vaccine available. became available

464
00:43:09,914 --> 00:43:15,394
and so that's one significant factor

465
00:43:15,394 --> 00:43:20,714
in turning story around in terms of health care workers

466
00:43:20,714 --> 00:43:25,754
and have a time to speed. we also

467
00:43:25,754 --> 00:43:31,414
developed a way to treat after exposure.

468
00:43:31,414 --> 00:43:36,594
before the session sessions will post exposure Pro full access stairs in the lobby one. you can give

469
00:43:36,594 --> 00:43:42,458
to someone who's susceptible and there are some treatment of infection. although

470
00:43:42,458 --> 00:43:47,618
not so much. effective and secured. so you heard about this I think

471
00:43:47,618 --> 00:43:53,898
in the first lecture at the first session. I think this is important to us because it's been so dramatic

472
00:43:53,898 --> 00:43:58,918
decrease in having high speed infection and health care workers since the early eighties. so

473
00:43:58,918 --> 00:44:03,978
one. I've already mentioned. the development of a vaccine.

474
00:44:03,978 --> 00:44:09,038
to be sure sign and set up being careful. well patient.

475
00:44:09,038 --> 00:44:14,058
hey who's got hepatitis_B. we said let's treat every patient is

476
00:44:14,058 --> 00:44:19,518
if they can get you an infection. so that's the idea of universal precaution

477
00:44:19,518 --> 00:44:24,598
sometimes you come concerned considered a component of standard precautions

478
00:44:24,598 --> 00:44:29,598
basically regard. every person has potential infections. so you have_to be

479
00:44:29,598 --> 00:44:34,718
careful all the time. just when you think you should be because you should be careful all

480
00:44:34,718 --> 00:44:39,812
the time answer the she got into the picture is actually on trade to the

481
00:44:39,812 --> 00:44:45,992
health care setting with this but the passage and standards. so those three issues significantly

482
00:44:45,992 --> 00:44:51,012
affected the story. and this table you saw in an

483
00:44:51,012 --> 00:44:56,072
earlier lecture. and I think it's really going through so this middle road here this

484
00:44:56,072 --> 00:45:02,132
is nineteen eighty three and next year. seventeen thousand health care workers here were getting infected.

485
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:07,452
he read all the time. the VA nurses. we're getting another one this time.

486
00:45:07,452 --> 00:45:12,472
from have high speed I got from legal sick at work. in

487
00:45:12,472 --> 00:45:17,532
nineteen ninety five. only four hundred health care workers. for year in twelve years. from seventeen

488
00:45:17,532 --> 00:45:22,772
thousand taxes per year. at work for four hundred two hundred and fifty health

489
00:45:22,772 --> 00:45:27,892
care workers. you dining from Head. I just be in section eighty three and by

490
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:33,092
twelve years later so. fifty to seventy five. in this instance

491
00:45:33,092 --> 00:45:38,458
compared to the general population in eighty three three hundred and eighty six per hundred thousand versus

492
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:43,758
the general population a hundred and twenty two. so three times the rate

493
00:45:43,758 --> 00:45:48,858
of infection and health care workers compared to the general population in the nineteen

494
00:45:48,858 --> 00:45:54,798
ninety five. specially for the rate and the general population and both

495
00:45:54,798 --> 00:46:00,338
both dropped in on then in the early nineties. it was recommended that there be general

496
00:46:00,338 --> 00:46:05,358
vaccination. of the population and not just cell population is at

497
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:10,598
risk. so this is just a chart that shows you that the vaccine in eighty two

498
00:46:10,598 --> 00:46:16,598
you can see this drop. after that you can see on

499
00:46:16,598 --> 00:46:21,778
at the end of Universal precautions bring practice another significant drop. and as you can see the ocean

500
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:26,920
bottom passage and standard and ninety one and by a ninety three even see

501
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:33,520
another significant drops of dramatic change. dramatic affect Fitness.

502
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,740
set of ways

503
00:46:38,740 --> 00:47:03,700
of managing this pretty significant problems or questions.

504
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:08,720
oh I see so yeah. two hundred fifty Health Care. we're really dying for a year.

505
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,860
you're you're saying is a fraction of seventy thousand verses. so this is a higher

506
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:19,120
percentage. yeah. so it's a chronic disease and so there

507
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:24,799
you maybe looking from chronic inspection.

508
00:47:24,799 --> 00:47:30,079
overtime is supposed to Leslie Foreman's. liver failure you got within you know six

509
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:35,979
months of your needles. make sense.

510
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:41,379
okay. so I have_to be six to thirty percent chance of

511
00:47:41,379 --> 00:47:47,039
transmission with a needle stick. have I see virus is significant.

512
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:52,299
it causes liver disease worldwide. you can see the estimate of all

513
00:47:52,299 --> 00:47:57,719
these restaurants over three million people can't leave package in the US. this is your shot.

514
00:47:57,719 --> 00:48:02,859
only once in the seventies. you have a significant risk of

515
00:48:02,859 --> 00:48:07,859
being have time to see positive in the carrier without even knowing it. so Neil's

516
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:13,019
Neil users for drugs. significantly elevated risk for

517
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:20,459
having Tennessee. there's an exception. you can see the estimates for

518
00:48:20,459 --> 00:48:25,667
the problems in population and of course it's a bad disease

519
00:48:25,667 --> 00:48:30,827
you can have chronic illness in slugger Ville location. there

520
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:36,507
is associated with liver cancer. it's the number one cost for

521
00:48:36,507 --> 00:48:42,067
reason basis for liver transplant today.

522
00:48:42,067 --> 00:48:48,667
so as oppose to that table. compare has be an infection health for workers versus general population.

523
00:48:48,667 --> 00:48:54,387
perhaps to see the rain and health care workers is not any higher. so the risk risk.

524
00:48:54,387 --> 00:48:59,447
but it's not an easy to get his have a Titus to be. there are lot of patients in the

525
00:48:59,447 --> 00:49:04,447
health care setting. sort of patients there. other terms

526
00:49:04,447 --> 00:49:09,607
who are have a child to see virus. so you. there is an opportunity

527
00:49:09,607 --> 00:49:14,987
to sick yourself with having exposure

528
00:49:14,987 --> 00:49:20,227
I should say to someone who have I see positive answer

529
00:49:20,227 --> 00:49:26,295
the risk of transmission is much lower traditionally quoted

530
00:49:26,295 --> 00:49:32,175
risk is about one. eight percent. these are difficult numbers to generate.

531
00:49:32,175 --> 00:49:37,735
there's no vaccine. there are drugs now to treat haven't have high see infection

532
00:49:37,735 --> 00:49:42,795
but there isn't like HIV and have a tight speed the received any post exposure Pro

533
00:49:42,795 --> 00:49:48,435
full access. that is generally accepted

534
00:49:48,435 --> 00:49:53,495
and used to be just a horrible diagnosis with almost nothing you could do about it especially

535
00:49:53,495 --> 00:49:58,615
the type one Gina type in the US. very difficult to treat. but really just the last

536
00:49:58,615 --> 00:50:04,135
handful of years. just sick incredibly effective treatments

537
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:09,735
have been developed and you probably. if you paid attention read about it. they are just astronomical

538
00:50:09,735 --> 00:50:15,315
expensive. but they are incredibly effective.

539
00:50:15,315 --> 00:50:20,655
okay and HIV. all of you know that about each ID about

540
00:50:20,655 --> 00:50:25,683
a million infected individuals in the US so have I see the risk

541
00:50:25,683 --> 00:50:30,943
risk of transmission for needle stick that contains blood from a sore

542
00:50:30,943 --> 00:50:36,363
station that has the infection. alright. six thirty percent. have Casey one. eight percent

543
00:50:36,363 --> 00:50:41,383
HIV about point three percent. so it's in essence as it will be your

544
00:50:41,383 --> 00:50:46,843
fire so it's harder to get it transmitted but of course.

545
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:52,043
if you do get transmission. you get HIV infection and they can progress

546
00:50:52,043 --> 00:50:57,243
to aids. as you know there's no vaccine available. there is posters for

547
00:50:57,243 --> 00:51:02,623
your fall classes that was Cabell. I think probably about nineteen ninety

548
00:51:02,623 --> 00:51:07,883
or ninety one in San_Francisco and has been adopted universal in it's been eve

549
00:51:07,883 --> 00:51:12,923
all through the years is more more anti- HIV drugs have become available. so if you

550
00:51:12,923 --> 00:51:18,363
get a high stick. take high risk needle stick. you can

551
00:51:18,363 --> 00:51:24,223
undergo post exposure Pro full access and all Hospital hospitals small medical centers have a protocol

552
00:51:24,223 --> 00:51:29,377
ready to go for that so

553
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:34,457
having said that. compare this numbers. happy has to be as

554
00:51:34,457 --> 00:51:39,577
of twenty ten there's been fifty seven documented occupational HIV

555
00:51:39,577 --> 00:51:45,497
transmissions and a hundred forty three possible circumstances sometimes our clerk.

556
00:51:45,497 --> 00:51:50,637
so yeah those numbers about two hundred since we started keeping record

557
00:51:50,637 --> 00:51:55,697
since age eight. academic began talking for

558
00:51:55,697 --> 00:52:01,557
here we're talking somehow. so it scared the Dickens out_of you but it's not

559
00:52:01,557 --> 00:52:06,657
very common and there haven't been any reports I've showered and

560
00:52:06,657 --> 00:52:12,857
paid attention but haven't seen the reports of confirmed cases of officially JB transmission.

561
00:52:12,857 --> 00:52:17,977
since nineteen ninety nine. there are other populations. we'll talk

562
00:52:17,977 --> 00:52:23,297
about doing overseas but this message here this is fascinating. this is from

563
00:52:23,297 --> 00:52:28,847
mobility and reality weekly report from February of last year hey Chevy transmission.

564
00:52:28,847 --> 00:52:33,867
I'm on male adult film performers in multiple states. so this

565
00:52:33,867 --> 00:52:38,967
is the report the first well documents is work related HIV transmission among male adult

566
00:52:38,967 --> 00:52:44,607
film performers. so there's an occupational exposure

567
00:52:44,607 --> 00:52:49,907
group that you don't often think about this and and this is a case report

568
00:52:49,907 --> 00:52:56,007
essentially as single individual who transmitted to others.

569
00:52:56,007 --> 00:53:01,047
to others. so. so not just your workers or other

570
00:53:01,047 --> 00:53:07,333
settings in which working populations can be exposed.

571
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:13,433
okay so we'll move on to a little bit of a different topic for health care workers.

572
00:53:13,433 --> 00:53:20,173
infection can be spread by droplets. these are tiny air sliced particles

573
00:53:20,173 --> 00:53:25,493
that evaporator respiratory secretions. less than five microns.

574
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:30,713
the fact that there's so small means that they can remain suspended for a longer period of time. then

575
00:53:30,713 --> 00:53:36,093
larger drop legs and they can travel more distance and so you can see

576
00:53:36,093 --> 00:53:41,673
a couple of viruses measles and your silver disaster. which can cause to different diseases.

577
00:53:41,673 --> 00:53:47,553
chickenpox and shingles. as well as tuberculosis

578
00:53:47,553 --> 00:53:52,713
larger particles. more viruses and flu restoration

579
00:53:52,713 --> 00:53:57,733
social wires are valid mom's in a couple of bacteria. I

580
00:53:57,733 --> 00:54:03,606
guess the area manager Coppell meningitis can also be spread Robert.

581
00:54:03,606 --> 00:54:08,606
this is tuberculosis. this is an astounding fact. I think one third

582
00:54:08,606 --> 00:54:13,686
of the world's population is infected with tuberculosis. and

583
00:54:13,686 --> 00:54:18,866
we say fact. there's two major categories having a fashion with TV. one

584
00:54:18,866 --> 00:54:23,946
is you get an exposure. let's say and healthy bacteria.

585
00:54:23,946 --> 00:54:30,106
it set up shop and start producing your body walls at all. and

586
00:54:30,106 --> 00:54:35,326
also growth and you don't get sick. and that you don't feel sick you don't know you're sick.

587
00:54:35,326 --> 00:54:40,606
unless you get tested. escalation to infection and then there's infection where you

588
00:54:40,606 --> 00:54:46,806
become healed. so between late and an active infection of the third of the world's population

589
00:54:46,806 --> 00:54:51,866
is affected. and one of the ways we get it in the US is the right state we

590
00:54:51,866 --> 00:54:57,434
can important. when people travel. so

591
00:54:57,434 --> 00:55:02,694
with Health Care workers TV. I'll brace has been linked

592
00:55:02,694 --> 00:55:07,974
to exposure to people. when you are generating yourself

593
00:55:07,974 --> 00:55:13,194
when you're sticking to be down there longs and bronchoscopy. when you

594
00:55:13,194 --> 00:55:18,254
are. but say doing an autopsy. if you're trying to get

595
00:55:18,254 --> 00:55:23,594
someone to call folks. if you don't get a collection for returning to the lab. these kinds of things

596
00:55:23,594 --> 00:55:29,834
can call refills action and therefore exposure.

597
00:55:29,834 --> 00:55:34,854
so there's the risk of tuberculosis

598
00:55:34,854 --> 00:55:39,874
the health care workers. really depends on how much of

599
00:55:39,874 --> 00:55:45,234
it exist in you're in your setting right if you. if you're in a setting where in the community

600
00:55:45,234 --> 00:55:50,754
it's very little infection. therefore I'm likely that someone in your hospital

601
00:55:50,754 --> 00:55:57,656
has TV and the risk will be lower and

602
00:55:57,656 --> 00:56:02,756
the risk increased in the eighties and nineties. the number to call meal term refers

603
00:56:02,756 --> 00:56:07,996
to hospital acquired infection and in some cases

604
00:56:07,996 --> 00:56:14,376
some of these house breaks other thing too. for example in the single individual who is in fact us

605
00:56:14,376 --> 00:56:19,516
some people develop tuberculosis with drug resistant infection. in this

606
00:56:19,516 --> 00:56:24,696
one. I'll break lease nine. health care workers to work themselves

607
00:56:24,696 --> 00:56:30,656
in need of a compromise has grown existing illness that made the you a compromise

608
00:56:30,656 --> 00:56:35,776
with failing those individuals. there certain drugs like I tonight. I tonight that

609
00:56:35,776 --> 00:56:40,776
can cause liver failure. the drug itself. so sometimes treatment can cause treatment

610
00:56:40,776 --> 00:56:45,796
for. in this case has officially acquired a tuberculosis

611
00:56:45,796 --> 00:56:51,556
skin calls. CBC says in their Nelson.

612
00:56:51,556 --> 00:56:57,572
that Health Care Worker. the Burke of assistance to be consistently hired in the general population

613
00:56:57,572 --> 00:57:03,032
but it really depends on you're in part. so again and intercity Hospital

614
00:57:03,032 --> 00:57:08,592
in New_York_City probably has a higher rate transmission and higher problems.

615
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:13,652
patients with active TV down then some roof siding that has

616
00:57:13,652 --> 00:57:18,692
a very low for non- existent immigrant

617
00:57:18,692 --> 00:57:23,692
population. so typically you get somebody in your hospital. you're

618
00:57:23,692 --> 00:57:28,952
calling a little bit. no_one thinks TV. they hang around your hospital for a_while.

619
00:57:28,952 --> 00:57:34,252
a_lot_of people interact and then you say oh. we should have known and we have

620
00:57:34,252 --> 00:57:39,712
hundreds of people who are exposed. so that's typically how it happened. so here's

621
00:57:39,712 --> 00:57:44,852
here's an article for from infection control in hospital day from a few years ago.

622
00:57:44,852 --> 00:57:50,352
hey Mister Berkey losses diagnosis resulting in hospital transmission. hospitalize patient

623
00:57:50,352 --> 00:57:56,382
they missed the diagnosis. they didn't hear to national infection control guidelines

624
00:57:56,382 --> 00:58:01,642
eighty three three hundred and eighteen hospital based contacts. has a new positive

625
00:58:01,642 --> 00:58:07,462
skin test for TB nine develop active tuberculosis.

626
00:58:07,462 --> 00:58:13,462
so you really need to develop protocol. especially when there's portals event features the hospital.

627
00:58:13,462 --> 00:58:18,462
for example the emergency department. where you have_to have a high suspicion

628
00:58:18,462 --> 00:58:23,682
for parking losses and actually people. here's a news article

629
00:58:23,682 --> 00:58:28,762
I don't have a scientific records from

630
00:58:28,762 --> 00:58:34,062
two and a half years ago. nursing assistant with fifty offices.

631
00:58:34,062 --> 00:58:39,062
coughing up blood work for six more weeks with the symptoms.

632
00:58:39,062 --> 00:58:44,642
they discovered she had active TV over eight hundred and fifty in since we're exposed in were glasses

633
00:58:44,642 --> 00:58:50,282
and infection control the outcome I don't have feet on two samples.

634
00:58:50,282 --> 00:58:55,322
there were you Missus Zach office and you have both patients as well

635
00:58:55,322 --> 00:59:01,098
as health care workers expose outside of the hospital setting.

636
00:59:01,098 --> 00:59:06,178
this is mortgagee mortality week report from January year

637
00:59:06,178 --> 00:59:11,298
ago. this is diagnosis of tuberculosis. three zero our phones and if human

638
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:16,498
contact in Oregon. and so there was a TV outbreak at a local

639
00:59:16,498 --> 00:59:21,698
supreme bull elephant has active disease. there are a hundred and eighteen. contact human

640
00:59:21,698 --> 00:59:27,078
context people who care for these animals. seven oh ninety six contacts at Layton

641
00:59:27,078 --> 00:59:32,918
tuberculosis. the preference of tuberculosis

642
00:59:32,918 --> 00:59:38,618
in captive patient elephants. for your information is five percent. so

643
00:59:38,618 --> 00:59:44,338
it's not like a third of the world's population is five percent of the African elephant population but

644
00:59:44,338 --> 00:59:51,158
who knew. alright. so

645
00:59:51,158 --> 00:59:56,218
this is also very interesting. how do we test to somebody has TV. well most of you probably

646
00:59:56,218 --> 01:00:01,258
know about a TV skin test. they call it the man to test after this doctor

647
01:00:01,258 --> 01:00:06,298
who developed in nineteen oh seven and it wasn't until two

648
01:00:06,298 --> 01:00:11,318
thousand one that we had new or different test for tuberculosis another

649
01:00:11,318 --> 01:00:16,418
is a blood test and it's a long complicated story comparing whether

650
01:00:16,418 --> 01:00:22,098
one test compares to the other recording or not. but

651
01:00:22,098 --> 01:00:27,718
in over a hundred years. it took before we got another test for TV.

652
01:00:27,718 --> 01:00:34,298
so a_lot_of ways of making mistakes reading TB skin test.

653
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:40,798
okay. so you can also contact her have contact exposures

654
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:45,903
to get infection and usually it's some

655
01:00:45,903 --> 01:00:52,223
room door service or something that has

656
01:00:52,223 --> 01:00:57,323
contact with whatever organization is called the

657
01:00:57,323 --> 01:01:02,563
kids and you can see some examples of conjunctivitis and title common with kids

658
01:01:02,563 --> 01:01:07,883
staff or strap. usually for in the Tyco simplify fires people gotten

659
01:01:07,883 --> 01:01:13,323
infections. people need health care workers infections and their fingers through in tactical.

660
01:01:13,323 --> 01:01:18,883
so sometimes these viruses. to confirm your eight clothes that are not even towards

661
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:24,203
and then you all. I'm sure we're aware of the a bowl of virus outbreak

662
01:01:24,203 --> 01:01:29,343
in Africa. and this is an article also from M W R bowl Iris disease and health care

663
01:01:29,343 --> 01:01:34,363
workers is here at Leone. in that

664
01:01:34,363 --> 01:01:40,443
bullet spread by direct contact. much more efficiently than other

665
01:01:40,443 --> 01:01:45,783
viruses your infection is spread by direct contact in this case the article determined that

666
01:01:45,783 --> 01:01:51,223
the health care workers has been increased we just purchased the general population.

667
01:01:51,223 --> 01:01:57,183
five over five percent nearly thirty over thirty eight hundred left confirmed

668
01:01:57,183 --> 01:02:02,923
he bowl of Iris disease cases. we're in health care workers and so had a raise much higher

669
01:02:02,923 --> 01:02:08,023
than in the general population so again you get that sense that they were great. we kind

670
01:02:08,023 --> 01:02:13,063
of knew that. help your workers were dying alarming to show our caring

671
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:22,823
for caring for a bowl.

672
01:02:22,823 --> 01:02:28,543
so some of you are familiar with infection control with the hospital every hospital as an infection

673
01:02:28,543 --> 01:02:33,763
control Department or hospital if you give me a holler just who's role it is to prevent

674
01:02:33,763 --> 01:02:38,863
help prevent the transmission of infection from patient to patient from the patient to Health Care worker or

675
01:02:38,863 --> 01:02:44,075
for dinner from Health Care Worker. your patients there's personal protective

676
01:02:44,075 --> 01:02:49,295
equipment obviously there's masters gloves and so forth. all

677
01:02:49,295 --> 01:02:54,295
the kinds of things that especially those and does your hygiene are familiar with engineering work practice

678
01:02:54,295 --> 01:02:59,675
controls course immunization. when it's available.

679
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:04,895
anybody who works in Health Care just get have it has been immunized. I think

680
01:03:04,895 --> 01:03:12,435
need to have your head examined because you can save your life. just like giving me.

681
01:03:12,435 --> 01:03:19,115
this is just an FYI. you can get infections from animals. also no seas

682
01:03:19,115 --> 01:03:25,575
beers are not health care workers a. there's a_lot_of health care workers who work in last panel labs

683
01:03:25,575 --> 01:03:30,755
in in Health Center. so when I was at a four digit Hospital employee health at

684
01:03:30,755 --> 01:03:35,815
Henry Ford Hospital. where she had sheets there where you could get to fever so

685
01:03:35,815 --> 01:03:41,015
you never know what might be in your hospital that can be spread.

686
01:03:41,015 --> 01:03:46,215
so hi somebody there familiar to you. Emily had and what a nice house I can't breath

687
01:03:46,215 --> 01:03:51,515
I just mentioned to fever that that I had experience

688
01:03:51,515 --> 01:03:57,215
with it and for set across this crucial losses.

689
01:03:57,215 --> 01:04:02,275
again this is just FYI. some of the groups that maybe exposed to

690
01:04:02,275 --> 01:04:07,495
Renee TA6 class Moses I mentioned that. if your female pregnant

691
01:04:07,495 --> 01:04:12,495
or thinking about getting pregnant. you have a cat. something to think about.

692
01:04:12,495 --> 01:04:18,935
doctors. those are are the parts for the most part

693
01:04:18,935 --> 01:04:24,055
and sex or lights or ticks that can transmit infection

694
01:04:24,055 --> 01:04:29,835
as well. talk city Ortiz. Mission Valley fever. film crew

695
01:04:29,835 --> 01:04:34,915
report last year with infection history class Moses. which

696
01:04:34,915 --> 01:04:40,043
is more common in the Midwest US an in lab

697
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:45,123
workers. you have been the micro lab at the hospital. you got someone

698
01:04:45,123 --> 01:04:50,443
doing analysis. let's say for somebody

699
01:04:50,443 --> 01:04:57,203
with a headache and they're testing them for a minute Cox. the bacteria that causes the manager Coppell meningitis.

700
01:04:57,203 --> 01:05:02,323
and in fact. so this is one of those things where this happens what happens. use a big deal

701
01:05:02,323 --> 01:05:08,163
but it's a fairly where. this is W R from September twenty fourteen.

702
01:05:08,163 --> 01:05:13,703
fatal manager carpal disease and lab worker in California. this is a twenty five year old guy

703
01:05:13,703 --> 01:05:19,323
who died. they were a manager Coppell meningitis. there were several reaches of the recommended

704
01:05:19,323 --> 01:05:25,623
last practices for safe handling. lab workers were not offered vaccine.

705
01:05:25,623 --> 01:05:31,503
the vaccine for manager pass. if you're working with. you should have a vaccine

706
01:05:31,503 --> 01:05:36,643
that will protect you. most likely. and this is a pretty rare event. but

707
01:05:36,643 --> 01:05:41,855
again if you haven't seen you it's a fifty on for all

708
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:46,915
of those who know you. there are three serious OSHA citations with regard to

709
01:05:46,915 --> 01:05:52,615
the infection control practices in this particular situation.

710
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:57,695
there's a number of laboratory required infections. in this particular report

711
01:05:57,695 --> 01:06:03,515
they booked at four thousand over four thousand sections in what

712
01:06:03,515 --> 01:06:08,715
over nearly fifty years maybe three dash a year or so.

713
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:15,617
so these case reports generally from multiple different passage

714
01:06:15,617 --> 01:06:20,797
so in terms of in the hospital occupational infectious disease really is the Health Care Worker

715
01:06:20,797 --> 01:06:25,986
Group. that is at the greatest risk. we talked about the big three

716
01:06:25,986 --> 01:06:31,006
have type PC and HIV. it's. it's a good lesson

717
01:06:31,006 --> 01:06:36,466
to know how we decrease the incidence hepatitis_B infection

718
01:06:36,466 --> 01:06:41,626
and how that happened. and many of these infections. the light

719
01:06:41,626 --> 01:06:46,746
tuberculosis is sick. sporadically. so those are sort of take all messages

720
01:06:46,746 --> 01:06:56,306
on that. any questions about that.

721
01:06:56,306 --> 01:07:09,646
anyway

722
01:07:09,646 --> 01:07:15,866
the question is if you have lame infection you treated it and supposedly till late

723
01:07:15,866 --> 01:07:22,431
late sections of the rely bacteria in your body

724
01:07:22,431 --> 01:07:28,251
even if you don't treat it. it is possible for your skin test to revert to negative.

725
01:07:28,251 --> 01:07:33,291
so you can have a false positive which is why people who come to work at hospital sometimes

726
01:07:33,291 --> 01:07:38,431
get a two step skin test. you do one test. you wait and

727
01:07:38,431 --> 01:07:43,711
if it's negative you wait two weeks I can't remember now. and tomorrow.

728
01:07:43,711 --> 01:07:48,891
you wait a little bit. I need you do a second test and sometimes the first test.

729
01:07:48,891 --> 01:07:54,231
especially wake up the users and assuming there's been no exposure in that

730
01:07:54,231 --> 01:07:59,671
short span of time you know expect to develop a positive response after exposure.

731
01:07:59,671 --> 01:08:04,671
and in just two weeks anyway but if you get a positive test you. you consider

732
01:08:04,671 --> 01:08:09,731
that you can now waking the immune system alright. so

733
01:08:09,731 --> 01:08:14,891
whether you treat like an infection or not. eventually in many people.

734
01:08:14,891 --> 01:08:20,825
the positive response to this contest will go away

735
01:08:20,825 --> 01:08:34,785
excellent. yeah

736
01:08:34,785 --> 01:08:56,105
here.

737
01:08:56,105 --> 01:09:01,445
rest of ECG is. I want to look on founders.

738
01:09:01,445 --> 01:09:06,465
so we do see people who has has historically been tested with her. me

739
01:09:06,465 --> 01:09:11,705
a nice with the ECG. they have been using in the US as an immunization

740
01:09:11,705 --> 01:09:16,965
for a number of reasons but it can cause a positive skin test read. so

741
01:09:16,965 --> 01:09:24,261
which is where the. the new blood test noon God willing.

742
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:29,301
I grow grow the unit essay test.

743
01:09:29,301 --> 01:09:34,361
doesn't result in a false positive skin to skin with

744
01:09:34,361 --> 01:09:39,381
PCG. so that would question any any other questions

745
01:09:39,381 --> 01:09:47,621
or comments. okay. so we'll catch you a little bit of German to logic stuff.

746
01:09:47,621 --> 01:09:52,681
it looks like my skin in the winter kinda gets dry right. so the

747
01:09:52,681 --> 01:09:58,181
skin. you know it's a little bit like to long. so when you learn about the lungs the.

748
01:09:58,181 --> 01:10:03,701
the total service area didn't feel light like the size of a tennis court. you know something.

749
01:10:03,701 --> 01:10:08,801
there's a huge opportunity for exposure to Silver_Lake lease. I mean your skin grease the world

750
01:10:08,801 --> 01:10:14,841
right. so things you can get exposure to your skin. especially your hands

751
01:10:14,841 --> 01:10:19,841
at work so it is a barrier in tax again. should

752
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:25,017
protect you against the sea HIV. if you get flight from

753
01:10:25,017 --> 01:10:30,037
an HIV positive individual. on your in. just wipe it off

754
01:10:30,037 --> 01:10:35,277
we don't consider that a an exposure process or exposure

755
01:10:35,277 --> 01:10:40,297
with any measurable risk. so I just get out_of those other

756
01:10:40,297 --> 01:10:45,697
things it's important obviously for all these different things from

757
01:10:45,697 --> 01:10:50,937
external exposure. just just by definition about it's the most commonly injured.

758
01:10:50,937 --> 01:10:56,197
part of the body. so again one of these things that have in terms of the scope. it is a big

759
01:10:56,197 --> 01:11:01,557
deal. it's probably the most common occupational illness. more common

760
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:06,777
been hearing loss and other seasons including rafters conditions.

761
01:11:06,777 --> 01:11:11,837
you can see the tens of thousands of cases reported in seventy four versus two thousand

762
01:11:11,837 --> 01:11:17,137
four. the fact is it it happens on locked it is clinically

763
01:11:17,137 --> 01:11:22,357
it's very challenging to discern between exposure at work

764
01:11:22,357 --> 01:11:27,863
causing the problem versus some other factor and we'll talk about that a little bit

765
01:11:27,863 --> 01:11:33,383
so now I shot. talks about how many skin injuries occurred in a year.

766
01:11:33,383 --> 01:11:38,403
a_lot is probably like other illnesses. market

767
01:11:38,403 --> 01:11:44,063
bleeding under reported and it's is just a rash like a little bump or something like that.

768
01:11:44,063 --> 01:11:50,283
if you've ever had a bad rash on your fingers like this where the skin is dry

769
01:11:50,283 --> 01:11:55,363
to the point where it's fishers. you get cracks. it's painful you can't even use your

770
01:11:55,363 --> 01:12:00,763
hand right so you can be an extremely painful experience. the bill of lading

771
01:12:00,763 --> 01:12:06,103
and they can significantly interfere with somebody's ability to just

772
01:12:06,103 --> 01:12:11,343
do normal daily activities. let alone work activities

773
01:12:11,343 --> 01:12:16,363
patient at risk and could be those that have exposure to specially

774
01:12:16,363 --> 01:12:21,663
web exposure so agriculture four Street. fishing Health Services.

775
01:12:21,663 --> 01:12:27,743
washing your hands repeatedly through the day. deep fat in your skin

776
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:33,083
defect your skin to skin becomes dryer it cracks it's easier more susceptible

777
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:38,423
to your attendance and so forth manufacturing.

778
01:12:38,423 --> 01:12:43,743
there's an opportunity for exposure to Solomon's degree service

779
01:12:43,743 --> 01:12:49,443
and so forth. so these are the kinds of places where you expect to see this kind of problem.

780
01:12:49,443 --> 01:12:56,023
so contact Titus. this is the definition. at least one definition.

781
01:12:56,023 --> 01:13:02,773
it's a reactive dermatologist which something in sent information for the skin

782
01:13:02,773 --> 01:13:07,873
skin is itchy it's red. it might be peeling and scaling. make

783
01:13:07,873 --> 01:13:12,893
it these little fluid filled blisters called. that's a calls

784
01:13:12,893 --> 01:13:18,593
state losing my heart kinda dry in Crofton so you get these

785
01:13:18,593 --> 01:13:23,673
for cross. it could be hard to actually bend your fingers. this kind of thing

786
01:13:23,673 --> 01:13:29,253
that you can see here. I mean I've seen this it's. it's it's a terrible

787
01:13:29,253 --> 01:13:34,813
thing to experience. so contact him at Harris. it's name. so gas

788
01:13:34,813 --> 01:13:40,053
is from contact with the skin. you can see that the way this

789
01:13:40,053 --> 01:13:45,053
is outlined here where the redness a courtesy to see this. this is home of the straight

790
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:50,133
line at the risk you can imagine. either you stick in your hands or something up to your wrist

791
01:13:50,133 --> 01:13:55,173
or you wearing a glove that contacted you only up here at risk and maybe the club was the source but

792
01:13:55,173 --> 01:14:00,400
it's a discreet area where the contact occurred so

793
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:05,840
most of the skin problems that we see. our contact number Titus. so something touches your skin.

794
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:10,960
Andy either you or take the heck out_of it or it causes an allergy

795
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:15,980
in Scottsdale. your case your skin is more common and it's sort of like that

796
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:21,080
that that price the tops and the double space the poison with

797
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:27,040
and if you were tense. call us. just about everybody is gonna react at some point.

798
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:32,340
you poor something that's enough for you were taking enough. anybody

799
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:37,900
skin and you're gonna get a rash whereas an allergic. contact Erma Titus

800
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:43,080
which is much less common. doesn't affect everybody. some people some people

801
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:48,220
to lay down on a patch of poison ivy and never get a rash from people. don't become

802
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:54,640
sense of Tyson they never have_to worry about it. same thing with Collins and their any number of things

803
01:14:54,640 --> 01:15:00,234
allergic press for emergency use usually occurs in a very small percentage

804
01:15:00,234 --> 01:15:05,714
of those who are exposed. my party professor who were in the Botanical

805
01:15:05,714 --> 01:15:11,154
Gardens in with Aspen. calling after fifteen years of working with

806
01:15:11,154 --> 01:15:17,494
policies started getting ready nose and asthma from exposure. since the Tyson's

807
01:15:17,494 --> 01:15:22,674
little off topic but your confusion contacting the tires. these

808
01:15:22,674 --> 01:15:27,934
are substances that cost some kind of directed injury or damage to

809
01:15:27,934 --> 01:15:33,174
the skin service that the drummers of the dormers. this information

810
01:15:33,174 --> 01:15:38,454
but it's not me not logical it's not an allergic process. you know people coming

811
01:15:38,454 --> 01:15:43,774
to say I'm allergic to. two five five.

812
01:15:43,774 --> 01:15:49,554
well people aren't allergic five classes or five groups director. you know

813
01:15:49,554 --> 01:15:54,634
to look at the material that sticking your skin in their descriptions.

814
01:15:54,634 --> 01:15:59,724
it's not in him in a logic it's not an allergic process and for that

815
01:15:59,724 --> 01:16:06,744
reason it tends to be present. we were something. text you and these things can be.

816
01:16:06,744 --> 01:16:11,804
what you can see listed here the chemicals in it and physical condition so

817
01:16:11,804 --> 01:16:16,964
repeat the grading of the skin. again you get to hand washing and

818
01:16:16,964 --> 01:16:22,044
washing your hands. we have soaps that defect the skin. or if you are

819
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:27,304
like some people who get the tire off your hands by washing your hands with gasoline or tripping

820
01:16:27,304 --> 01:16:32,504
time or something because it's such a great solvent. you're not the fat in your skin and you're causing

821
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:39,824
your skin to crack. you'll be more tolerable. and can cost contact or tires.

822
01:16:39,824 --> 01:16:45,544
red alert. contact the terrace is already sad for the most part. the re action is

823
01:16:45,544 --> 01:16:51,084
a type four. so that's it. gimme a logical. Norman Fletcher. five two one two three four.

824
01:16:51,084 --> 01:16:56,104
allergic responses. you heard about that from this guy we need to talk about hyper sensitivity

825
01:16:56,104 --> 01:17:01,926
when I does it sound mediated. that's the allergic mechanism. so mediated

826
01:17:01,926 --> 01:17:07,006
that's what causes point you know Ivy. it's not answer bodies this it's not like a bee sting. I

827
01:17:07,006 --> 01:17:13,246
GE and about if we get five and so forth. it's type for some mediated problem

828
01:17:13,246 --> 01:17:18,406
and you have_to have exposure long enough and

829
01:17:18,406 --> 01:17:23,446
you have_to be prone to developing since visitation and interaction.

830
01:17:23,446 --> 01:17:28,466
I'm sorry in and check reaction. so once you become said to tell you

831
01:17:28,466 --> 01:17:33,966
can have an allergic reaction. at your very first exposure

832
01:17:33,966 --> 01:17:39,366
because by definition you can have been sent to past

833
01:17:39,366 --> 01:17:44,646
without previously having exposure unless there's some cross reaction from something else. which

834
01:17:44,646 --> 01:17:49,706
is I guess possible. and unlike contacting the charges

835
01:17:49,706 --> 01:17:54,866
from your to response with an allergic response you can actually have reactions that may occur

836
01:17:54,866 --> 01:18:00,026
in sites distance from the area of contact. and and

837
01:18:00,026 --> 01:18:05,168
as I've already suggested. just like with I GE is asking you have_to

838
01:18:05,168 --> 01:18:10,248
have an exposure for a period of time. where your body recognizes the hand

839
01:18:10,248 --> 01:18:15,788
surgeon builds a response you are Nelson Tyson the next time you were exposed

840
01:18:15,788 --> 01:18:21,228
to poison Ivy or whatever happens. you have a reaction. so here's the list

841
01:18:21,228 --> 01:18:26,748
of some candidates for alert to contact

842
01:18:26,748 --> 01:18:31,848
Erma Titus. you know if you get a rash underneath your watch maybe it's the nickel plating or

843
01:18:31,848 --> 01:18:37,108
underneath your belt the nickel plating from your belt buckle

844
01:18:37,108 --> 01:18:42,688
or your watch. the radishes and clubs that are used to manufacture

845
01:18:42,688 --> 01:18:47,808
the gloves confirmation fire and sick can call us in a larger reaction. companies

846
01:18:47,808 --> 01:18:52,848
typically have been failing these kind of things out. around the height

847
01:18:52,848 --> 01:18:58,328
in Health Care environment for stabilizing schools Apache residence

848
01:18:58,328 --> 01:19:03,714
are notorious for causing an allergic reactions

849
01:19:03,714 --> 01:19:09,134
number of cosmetics and fragrances and I mission poison

850
01:19:09,134 --> 01:19:14,794
and we'll just talk about tax passing and then we'll wrap up.

851
01:19:14,794 --> 01:19:20,014
so pass testing is usually the problem to the dermatologist sometimes

852
01:19:20,014 --> 01:19:25,354
I'll just do this as well. usually is a dermatologist. you can buy kits that have all

853
01:19:25,354 --> 01:19:30,374
like I don't know forty or so standard. seems like you can see it listed here. the

854
01:19:30,374 --> 01:19:35,534
fragrances pair of men's hockey season and so on so forth. so these things

855
01:19:35,534 --> 01:19:40,914
coming to kids. you put it on somebody's back large service area. and

856
01:19:40,914 --> 01:19:45,914
you have_to be trained enough to recognize whether reaction is. from the

857
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:50,974
rotation versus a true allergic reaction and so you wait a couple

858
01:19:50,974 --> 01:19:56,154
days after applying have individual come back and you lost can you give another two or a day or two

859
01:19:56,154 --> 01:20:01,354
or three to read it and see if there's. let's say hi. well

860
01:20:01,354 --> 01:20:07,234
for example and make interpretation is whether it's whether somebody is sent to times.

861
01:20:07,234 --> 01:20:13,094
trying to be careful to avoid false negative negative and false positive. so determining

862
01:20:13,094 --> 01:20:19,054
how allergic says this is nation with either blood test or pass test can sometimes be tricky. so

863
01:20:19,054 --> 01:20:25,254
a positive test doesn't necessarily mean clinically possible for them. in in Real Life
