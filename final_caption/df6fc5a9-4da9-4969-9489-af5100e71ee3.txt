1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:07,770
I don't have any more position to say no.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,060
Okay, so hopefully this works. Yeah, you can do do that.

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,700
So when we have a break, I do have everybody's exams.

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:23,820
I but I do need to do this. This would be really helpful if I did this.

5
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:40,940
This makes this go down. No. Thank you for sharing the storm here.

6
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:50,810
Yeah, I actually a my, my, my son usually bikes his kids to daycare and I said, I'm coming with the car.

7
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,760
So it's pretty, pretty icy up there. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,020
No, no, no, don't. I don't want to lose my grandchildren or my son.

9
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,880
Yeah, that would be really horrible. Okay, cool. All right. So we're really delighted to help today with respect to voting,

10
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,640
who does research in geriatrics and in nursing homes, which is a unique infection control situation.

11
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,690
So she's going to tell you about some of, you know, real estate.

12
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:27,260
So this might be a little different. And so if you want to just tell us a little bit about how that where you are.

13
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:34,490
Yeah, no, I can I can sort of. So I've tried to do this as a storytelling way of, you know,

14
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:40,270
my use of different methods and maybe I'll just weaving and you will get to know me pretty well by the end of this.

15
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,640
How is that? Does it sound okay? Ignore the date.

16
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,980
Sorry about that. I didn't change my title, but.

17
00:01:49,370 --> 00:02:01,440
But I'm Lorna Modi. I came here as a fellow back in 19 late 1990s and became faculty here at University of Michigan in 2003.

18
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:07,520
Continued track. So before that, a bulk of my time was spent in both clinical and research training.

19
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:14,690
And what today I want to sort of convey to all of you is the field that I entered at that time,

20
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:22,190
which is infections and understanding of infections and MDR rose multidrug resistant organisms in nursing homes,

21
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:31,550
was a very, very early field, you know, but I looked at multi-drug resistant organisms and tried to pull out papers.

22
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:44,390
They would be coming from C one V.A nursing home where does not apply to a large population of older adults frail living in the community.

23
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:51,469
So it was a really early field, but I had superb role models and mentors to then help me move this forward.

24
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,780
So I think this is the sort of and the methods that are used for a field that was not developed as well

25
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:03,889
is what I want to focus on and how the second focus would be how each project built the other for me.

26
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:10,400
So what you will see through the role through this presentation is going to be developing research questions,

27
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,389
how I develop research questions and a variety of research methods that are used to answer those questions.

28
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,840
And we all live in an academic village. We cannot function on our own.

29
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,780
And so the role of collaboration in our work family and then some reflections at the end.

30
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:35,600
So overall, in my heart as a physician scientist, I am a patient oriented researcher, right?

31
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,959
And what I feel is I like to interact with patients.

32
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:45,600
I like to work with them. I like to understand them and I like to do clinical research.

33
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,180
So that's that's my my basic. But knowing the field, knowing where we are,

34
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:59,030
I know that is incredibly important for me to or for the field to collaborate with those who are in basic science and those doing policy in practice.

35
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:05,329
So that's that's the breadth. And I should say that, you know, if we differentiate public health from policy in practice,

36
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,320
I could add one more, one more piece over there, which would be public health.

37
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:15,680
So I sort of that that's my framework when I think about a particular research project or political problem.

38
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:22,820
And as a result, this is this is sort of the way that I look at my my academic career,

39
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:30,320
that as a result of thinking through the spectrum, I have been able to develop and collaborate with innumerable people.

40
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,510
But these are the most important ones that have influenced my work and my research and

41
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:41,300
my satisfaction of my academic life or my work life includes some of you may know,

42
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,659
Dr. Foxman here, some of you may know maybe Chelsea and Brewster.

43
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,360
I'm not sure that maybe some of you know.

44
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:54,710
But my closest friend, of course, Marco, looks at me quite a bit. Kyle works with me quite a bit.

45
00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:00,920
So just a group of people that really help me understand this field more.

46
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,920
So going through the methods piece and what I try to do and again,

47
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:12,979
I had no idea what I was going to use, what I, what methods I was going to use when I started my work.

48
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:19,080
I just knew that there very little done in this field and I want to fulfill what I want

49
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,910
to fill it up with research and with with answers to the questions that are posed.

50
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:29,780
So when I was a fellow, I mainly I worked with my mentors of their projects and I was one example of one of them.

51
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,639
But the the randomized controlled trial, which will not talk about that I did as a fellow,

52
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:43,969
actually really propelled me to learn about patient oriented research, getting consents from vulnerable populations.

53
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,150
So to go into the nursing homes and getting concerns from older adults and their family members,

54
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:54,480
which is a whole different time consuming challenge of its own and to learn was experimental.

55
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,940
So talk a little bit about that. As a junior faculty, I dabbled a little bit into case control studies.

56
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:05,820
My cohort, which has its own set of I'm sure you guys have learned analysis from cohort studies, which is a little bit different.

57
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,240
Some survey projects as I,

58
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:18,210
I then got really impatient and want to have some action and make a difference that led me to cluster into my studies and then now and moving forward.

59
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,950
Besides as methods, I want to look at implementation projects and large of students.

60
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:28,770
So this is how I have approached many different methods that have then led to the studies that are describing to me.

61
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,110
And you can stop at any time.

62
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:38,429
I don't have to go through my entire presentation, but it's something that you that you want to to think about or to ask me.

63
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:44,940
Just tell me. So do my research fellowship. I wanted to always work with older adults and vulnerable populations.

64
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,280
So that was that was a given as part of my research, my clinical training as an adolescent resident.

65
00:06:50,670 --> 00:07:00,450
When I came here as a fellow in geriatrics, I was told that there are 1.5 million people residing in nursing homes.

66
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:10,590
They have 2 million infections in a year, 40% horrible resistant organism, 40% back in 2003, 2004.

67
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:16,630
There are 300,000 transfers back to the hospital once discharge.

68
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,310
Is this number of people that are transferred back to the hospital each year?

69
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,280
And yet when we talk about the research that's being done, people in this field, there were just very few,

70
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:34,499
very few people were actually going out there and understanding how to how to practice in this location,

71
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,950
how to build up evidence in this location, what are the research questions?

72
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:44,610
And to me, I recognize that there was an immense potential of conducting infection prevention research in aging populations.

73
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,469
So, listen, I learned was that, you know, it was okay for me.

74
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,550
And I felt because of the mentors, because of the infrastructure, the environment that I was in,

75
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,850
to be able to take a step in a direction where there were very few people that have gone that had gone before.

76
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,729
There were some flu studies actually done from School of Public Health before this time and a few from the VA,

77
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:13,650
but really not major studies that I could really sort of point to when I gave talks or when I was listening to talks at national meetings.

78
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,260
So this is Dr. Howard was my division chief doctor, Dr. Bradley, my primary fellowship mentor, Dr. Kaufmann.

79
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:25,950
These were very influential in my early, early career and this was one of the study that I did,

80
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:31,770
really a quasi experimental study that I did very, very early in my fellowship.

81
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:38,750
So this one, all of you recognize, what is this? What is it?

82
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:46,930
What is it? Urine back, urine bag?

83
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:57,940
No, it is drop. So in this particular project B, one of my colleagues in IDY, Shelly MacNeil, right there at that time back in 2001, two at that time,

84
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:05,110
all the research on, you know, hand sanitizers was coming out and people were saying that, you know, this is very portable, very accessible.

85
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,879
We don't know the efficacy outside of lab settings, but let's us study it.

86
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:16,810
Right. And we designed a small, quasi experimental project of going into the nursing homes,

87
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,080
sometimes 5:00 in the morning during shift change and digging these bags.

88
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,590
And yes, there were some older folks who wake up,

89
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:28,690
or at least they were sitting there and watching us coming in with his bags, and they would have a total hoot about it.

90
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:33,489
They would be laughing at us because we asked nurses to dip their hands in this

91
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:39,969
bag before and after hand-washing and talk to the brought back to our lab where,

92
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,300
you know, we tested four different organisms. Right.

93
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:47,170
So there was just one of those fun projects that we did was like early 5:00 in the morning,

94
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,799
some bolstering shift change, but it was a quasi experimental study.

95
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,790
We had one unit randomized to only soap and water and the washing hands with soap and water testing before and after.

96
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,930
In terms of what they were, they were colonized. They had on their hands.

97
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:09,730
The other group used alcohol based hand rub. And what we showed was that the alcohol based hand rubs were more effective in

98
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:15,480
reducing gram negative organisms and staph aureus and east after their hand hygiene.

99
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:22,600
So it was we felt it was effective. It didn't clearly reach the 99% efficacy that you see it on the on the tube.

100
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,719
But but it didn't reach enough. And using the broth, it was it is a more sensitive method, right.

101
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,530
Because you put your hands up there and capture everything and we would grow it overnight.

102
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,600
So even a few colonies would just blow up. So it was a little bit more sensitive method,

103
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:43,660
but at least it would only work to show that these kinds of alcohol based hand rubs can be used

104
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:50,440
and can be effective in nursing homes in order to sort of implement the change in the sector.

105
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:58,450
The research has to come from the sector. So after all of this, you would have thought that nursing homes would adopt this very quickly.

106
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:06,129
Right. And knowing that the hospitals adopted really early nursing homes faced a big a big barrier,

107
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:10,600
what they what the fire marshals would come and inspect nursing homes.

108
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:17,890
They did not want this kind of big things outside of the of the patient rooms, because that was a fire hazard.

109
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:26,439
So despite all the work that was done, the hospitals and some in the nursing home, it was not adopted for many, many,

110
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:33,010
many years almost, I would say 10 to 15 years until it really became a practice to have this everywhere in nursing homes as well.

111
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:41,440
So that's one of the challenges. And then this was a randomized controlled trial that I got involved in as a fellow as well,

112
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:51,160
which was sort of help me learn quite a few things on just getting concerns and and approaching older adults and their families for research.

113
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:02,230
So then it came about leading my own studies as junior faculty in one of the grant mechanisms that we applied for as to become faculty members.

114
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,310
It's different when you're M.D. track physician scientist.

115
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,390
The grant mechanism is different versus a Ph.D. scientist.

116
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,130
For our physician scientist road, we have a mechanism called Gate 23.

117
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:23,890
It's an age mechanism where we have a five year grant and about 70% of our time can be protected to do research.

118
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:34,450
So if I were to say I'm 151 full time, my salary typically or a clinician salary would come from doing clinical work and building and seeing patients.

119
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:39,010
But if I were to go to a research track, I can apply for a grant and protect 70%,

120
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:47,860
but it's 70% of my salary on the ground and thereby able to develop research projects and do your time in that fashion.

121
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:58,540
We call that soft money. So as junior faculty, as I got this proposal and NIH actually, and I in particular, National Institute of Aging,

122
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,570
has been particularly kind for this kind of work because they've funded me for the past 20 years now.

123
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,310
And the reason was it was not much or not many people in this field.

124
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:14,570
So sort of the they believed that research needed to be done over here.

125
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:19,749
They believed that NIH as an institution would be the best institution to fund versus

126
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:25,300
many other NIAID or and it'll be many other institutes that do other kind of work.

127
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:33,130
So they funded me as a junior faculty, and I sort of used a few other methods to then develop my my future projects.

128
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,209
So there was a fellow doing those projects, right?

129
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:45,380
And I realized that the work that was needed, so sort of how I developed my research questions is the second point that I wanted to make.

130
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:49,550
I knew that the work that needed to be done was going to be immense.

131
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,149
I just could see the many different directions,

132
00:13:53,150 --> 00:14:02,030
the many different epi studies or cities needed to be done to really sort of bring it up to the to where it was.

133
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,710
It'd be health care, other hospitals, cities.

134
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:11,929
I used to go to all the ID meetings and I read the work that came out from hospitals and I read the work that came out from nursing homes.

135
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:16,129
And there was like a wide gap. It was it was a wide, wide gap.

136
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,840
And I did not feel confident that I would be able to do everything.

137
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,430
I wanted to have a focus. So that focus became older adults.

138
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:31,610
I began thinking about a population. Older adults in nursing homes were at the highest risk rates.

139
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:39,230
If I developed something, then I would know how that the difference that I can make can be visible.

140
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,139
Right? That is how I'd sort of thought my mind worked, is that I'm going to focus on a population,

141
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:52,490
but within that population to the highest risk and the highest risk based on certain episodes was those who are unwilling devices.

142
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,730
So urinary catheters and feeding tubes were to two subpopulations that are the highest

143
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:03,290
risk of infection infections and highest risk of multi-drug resistant organisms.

144
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,230
So question to all of you, what are the indwelling devices used in nursing homes?

145
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,770
What you're hearing. I gather you really gathered her exactly right.

146
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:24,580
And a second one, the two more.

147
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,940
But it's a good one. Centralized.

148
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,600
Centralized now, right? Yeah, absolutely. Now, there are big prevalent sort of satellites.

149
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,910
The big lines. Big lines. So they're feeding tubes.

150
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,569
Right. The second major group at that time was definitely feeding tubes.

151
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:47,950
Now that has reduced and then it has gone up a little bit, but feeding tubes were the other other so about this is my pet peeve question.

152
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:54,050
Some of you may know, but if you went to an ICU, right, a lot of you are going to be health care epidemiologist.

153
00:15:54,080 --> 00:16:04,030
If you went to an ICU and see a 20 bed ICU, how many people would have urinary catheter?

154
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,740
Indwelling catheter? Yes. Just a guess.

155
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,089
75% close about 70.

156
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,750
60 to 70% would have an indwelling uterine catheter.

157
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:30,930
This is an ICU setting. People are largely confined to their beds and they are, for a variety of reasons, not able to get to the bathroom.

158
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:34,680
And they don't they have a it's easy to put a catheter and monitor the urine output.

159
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,240
If you were to go on a medical or surgical ward. Right.

160
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:44,910
So that is, you know, the step down after ICU. What percentage would have a urinary character?

161
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,540
Just a guess. 43. 40%.

162
00:16:53,640 --> 00:17:03,040
One more. About 20%, you know, about 20 to 30%, but I would say 20% on the north side.

163
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,480
And if you were to go to a nursing home. Right.

164
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:13,830
Nursing home, what percentage? 1660.

165
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,920
Okay. Anyone else? All right.

166
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,190
So when I started, it was about 15% one five.

167
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:28,210
And right now it is about 5%. And people are always surprised at that.

168
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,400
People exact like I said, it's a very surprising statistic.

169
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:40,700
Right. And there are a couple of things behind it. Number one, nursing homes for sale and geriatricians believe in independence.

170
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,060
Functional independence is extremely important. Right.

171
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,950
So a couple of things happen, first of all. And the more.

172
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:54,769
First of all, it limits people having a, you know, all the lines hooked up anywhere.

173
00:17:54,770 --> 00:18:00,049
Limits people. So that may be feeding tube, may be very capital, may be a thick line.

174
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:08,090
It just limits people. But in 2008, CMS came up with a star rating, right?

175
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:13,460
So each nursing home gets a star rating and each hospital now gets a star rating.

176
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,150
And there are some quality indicators go into the star ratings.

177
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,970
One of them was use of indwelling urinary catheter that stayed in there.

178
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,139
Right. So nursing homes really care about their star rating.

179
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:35,080
And they immediately realized that if I remove a catheter early and the number of I have few people having a catheter,

180
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,700
my star rating, at least one of the measures would be better.

181
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:46,190
And that led to changes and, you know, institution of programs and models that would reduce catheter use in nursing.

182
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,969
So it was 15% when I started this work in 2003.

183
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,250
By 2008, it had gone down to 6%, 6%.

184
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,940
So it goes up and down a little bit depending on the population.

185
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,510
But this is an example where a policy like that sometimes ill thought out, does lead to a change.

186
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,910
Nonetheless, at this time,

187
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:12,890
I want to focus on the high risk population and the one that I focused on and road early work was on urinary catheters and feeding tubes,

188
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:21,980
and those first one was a sort of a case control study. The second one was a cohort, a prospective cohort that I called Devices one two.

189
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:31,400
But the framework of both of the studies were that we would go in and and sort of recruit for consent and

190
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:38,030
recruit older adults more to be supportive of research and collect swab many different areas of the body.

191
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:46,189
So Mary's, as you know, staff was in areas or offerings because sometimes the older adults are colonized in their parents,

192
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:52,940
especially with gram negatives. The device site, if they had a feeding tube or a urinary catheter, pubic urinary catheter,

193
00:19:53,780 --> 00:20:01,819
we didn't culture utero because it was meant that was going to be dirty groin area, a better rectal area and any wounds that they had.

194
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:08,420
So we did sort of this kind of a framework, brought the swabs back and tested them for vancomycin resistant enterococci,

195
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,310
ciprofloxacin resistant negatives and MRSA.

196
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,610
And what we share. And this is just boiling down simple papers into one slide.

197
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:29,730
What we showed was that using traditional sort of AP methods was that if you did not have any device right,

198
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:38,780
if an older adult did not have the device, then there would be could culture about 29 and drums 4000 residentes.

199
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:46,700
So we sort of use denominator as resident days because our older adults do stay for a long period of time and the longer bit of time they stayed,

200
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:52,880
the more at risk they are traditional everything, right? And so that's why we use it by 12 resident days.

201
00:20:53,240 --> 00:21:02,180
So they had no device. It was 29. If their feeding to it was about 63 emperors that we were able to culture 4000 resident

202
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:07,940
days if it was a very capital 68 and if they had both feeding tube and the catheter,

203
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:16,099
it was about 91. Right. And if you look at the last column of the infection rates, similarly, we could show that no device,

204
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:24,079
about 2.6 infections per thousand resident days that needed to be treated feeding tubes, about 5.7 urinary catheter was 8.9.

205
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,560
And if you had both, it posed an added risk.

206
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,150
So this is how sort of early work that we started defining, first of all,

207
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,879
and sort of putting fevers out that showed that this is indeed a high risk group,

208
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,460
that, you know, we should put resources, that we should study and we should sort of so intervene.

209
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,780
I'm going to pause here and see if anybody has any questions or thoughts.

210
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,990
Clarification. Oh.

211
00:21:53,020 --> 00:22:01,810
How did the last column compare? Just for example, in like a hospital in terms of the infection rates.

212
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:10,870
Yeah. Yeah. Far less because the difference and the reason we cannot immediately compare is the ICU length of hospital in those days.

213
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:14,450
Three days. Four days. Right.

214
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:21,340
So just very hard to compare those two kinds of data. But it is listen, as you stayed in a nursing home or in a place longer.

215
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,919
Clearly, the risk is going to go up. Right.

216
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:34,060
So so, for example, if you had a urinary catheter for sort of 30 days, 100% in a regular catheter, almost 100% are going to have the diarrhea.

217
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,740
Lot of studies, including Dr. Foxman, studies from have shown that that, you know.

218
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:48,070
Yeah, the thing is with catheters, since you have a portal to the outside and that's the same thing with the feeding tube bacteria get into any

219
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:56,980
body cavity that has potentially had some is colonized with microbes including your eyes and feed on that.

220
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:04,540
But anyway so any any any body sight is but when you put it in half of the room, you just enhanced the ability to go in.

221
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,870
But that doesn't mean that you have an infection.

222
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:13,960
And so this is one of the big things with a urinary catheter, is that you get that through urine really quickly.

223
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:23,590
And we have a study where we looked at the microbiome of the catheter itself, and even in 6 hours it had a nice microbiome on the catheter,

224
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,760
which isn't too surprising when you forget the doubling time is less than 30 minutes in that situation.

225
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:37,390
But in terms of getting clinical symptoms, you have to interact with the host immune system.

226
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:45,700
And so that becomes infection is always not just the bug that kills you, it's your reaction to the bug that makes you sick.

227
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:53,710
And so it becomes a very complex question. I'm not familiar with what kind of illnesses come with feeding tubes.

228
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:59,170
So for feeding tubes, it was we definitely sort of were looking at number one,

229
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:04,930
what we learned from feeding tubes was that there was certainly more colonization around the feeding tube.

230
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:10,080
They were more likely to be colonized there or pharynx with, you know, various organisms.

231
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:13,479
So those are two things that could go into that data too deeply.

232
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:19,000
So those are two major things. We anticipated more aspiration pneumonia,

233
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,229
but the events were lower because the feeding tube itself use a feeding tube was

234
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:28,480
going down by that time and about 3 to 4% had feeding tubes in our cohorts as well.

235
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:34,660
So the pneumonias were few and we could not see a major difference between those who had feeding tubes and those who did not.

236
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:40,810
Again, we are looking at fewer numbers because of the of the changes that were already underway.

237
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:49,810
But those are the main things that could happen is local cellulitis, local sort of infection, skin infection and maybe aspiration pneumonia.

238
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:54,790
But our numbers were to literally sort of see that in the population that we would see.

239
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,309
And you can just contrast that with like the ventilators that we looked at, ventilators, things with ventilators.

240
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:03,350
You have something that's actually going into the lungs. Yeah.

241
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:09,280
Yeah. So and there's a lot of it is the stuff that's just normally found in your mouth.

242
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:18,310
You have a lot of those in your mouth, right? So each of you probably have 200 different species, that sort of thing.

243
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:28,989
Yeah. And plus not only sort of having this microbes, but then you add to it being ill right in in an ICU setting.

244
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:34,090
So you're, you're already compromised from the illness, which really increases the risk monumentally.

245
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:44,670
But the things that I learned from these projects were, first of all, we developed a consortium of nursing homes who were ready to do research, right?

246
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:51,129
So it took quite a lot of legwork going to organizations, learning about them.

247
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:54,370
This is a sector where leadership changes happen.

248
00:25:54,370 --> 00:26:04,080
Staff changes happen extremely rapidly. You have a lot of patients in working with them, in handling those changes and being patient,

249
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,819
be able to go back and sort of explain the study multiple times and get the work done.

250
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:14,410
Engaging them cannot go. They are also very protective of their patients.

251
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:20,110
They're going to go in there and just assume that they are going to be ready to, you know, be working with us.

252
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:27,250
We just have to do a lot of PR and that required the team that I have in keeping it off.

253
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,639
That was the but but having said that, having data coming out from 14 nursing homes,

254
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:40,540
from 12 nursing homes was amazing because you could generalize quite a bit and sort of coming from one.

255
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:45,240
So this kind of work became immediately recognized and with the publication.

256
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:51,280
So I would say that the first 20 papers to in five papers that I wrote, there was no rejection.

257
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,190
So. People actually came and told me that you're not aiming high enough, but I kid you not.

258
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:04,740
None of the papers got rejected. First 25 that I wrote it was because of this feeling that I needed so much of literature to fill it up.

259
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:11,280
But nonetheless, the the the methods that I learned was how to analyze case control studies,

260
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,860
how to set up Google studies, how to get concerns and how to work with leadership at that time.

261
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:21,240
And I realized that the there is enough here for me to think about how to intervene.

262
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:26,820
And so that was the that was going to be my next steps in terms of developing interventions.

263
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:34,950
Oh, one more thing I learned during this time before developing interventions is to look at what we call needs assessment.

264
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:41,250
So it's all well and good for me to look at literature and, you know, say that, oh, you know,

265
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:48,360
these are the four evidence based strategies that have some good basis and I want to go back

266
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,640
and work on these and implement this or sort of develop an intervention surrounding this.

267
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:58,740
But really, it was you know, these are my other two mentors. Sun St instead of crying.

268
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,690
And they sort of held me back and said that, look, you did got to do needs assessment.

269
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:09,520
Where are you starting? What are your healthcare providers starting? Where is the organization started from?

270
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:16,050
And so that's what we did in those four years that I had with Crew Development Award.

271
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:22,500
We to many papers showed that there is an immense within this nursing homes there's an

272
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,840
immense I would say immense variability in adoption of infection prevention programs.

273
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:34,559
Sometimes you enter a nursing home, much like a school you enter and you really realize that this thing,

274
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:40,490
this place is really well, one, it is quiet and there is a little bit of like music playing.

275
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,060
There's, you know, activities going on, but nobody's upset.

276
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:49,620
Nobody is, you know, sort of people know what they're supposed to do. They go around the daily business and then go home.

277
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:56,310
And at other times they go to a nursing home. It's chaotic and there are alarm bells going off and people are hearing about

278
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:59,760
and you just realize that these two organizations are run very differently.

279
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,070
And, you know, translating that to what I was interested in, which is infection prevention programs.

280
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:11,880
Immense variability in how the adopt the development influenza policy or the pneumonia vaccine policy,

281
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,450
or how they investigate their infections or how they report infections.

282
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:20,969
It's huge variability. There were significant gaps among healthcare providers of professional knowledge.

283
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:31,350
FRONTLINE Right. So the reason that this is important is in the hospitals, doctors go and see their patients every day in nursing homes,

284
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:36,810
long term patients, very long term residents, doctors go and see them once a month.

285
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:43,980
And if it is a short stay for, say, you know, after a hip fracture rehab, they go to see their patients.

286
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:47,819
That's requirements once a week. So it's a big difference.

287
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:51,360
Right. And most of changes.

288
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:56,100
So if my patient, who is in a short stay nursing home unit develops an infection,

289
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:01,230
the first person to go and assist that person is going to be a nurse's aide.

290
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:06,690
Right. And they have very little training. Not their fault.

291
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:12,299
Very little training in infection control. Very little. And so there are significant what we realize for gaps.

292
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,110
They're supposed to learn about delirium, how to identify delirium. They're supposed to be about falls.

293
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:20,190
They're supposed to know what functional decline they're supposed to learn about infections there.

294
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,490
And they just have two weeks to become to get the training.

295
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:30,570
So there are significant gaps in health care professionals knowledge and and, you know,

296
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:36,570
frontline staff are very protective about their patients, the residents and what they should.

297
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:43,780
But what they expressed was that they had sort of significant concerns regarding isolation policies and practices.

298
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:50,520
So if I were to have a patient who had MRSA infection in our university hospital.

299
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:57,730
Right, that would be on a contact precaution, isolated people that the patient would not be able to go out and do the activities and such.

300
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:05,130
Whereas in nursing homes, to do that is isolating them from all other outside things that are going on.

301
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,790
And our frontline staff, expressed in one of the quadrant studies,

302
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:13,700
expressed significant concerns regarding isolation practices for a prolonged bit of time.

303
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:22,830
Remember that length of stays really long at nursing homes? So this was what we learned as part of our of these sort of needs assessments.

304
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,559
And the couple of years that I spent doing that.

305
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:33,930
And that led to, again, some really nice so spectrum of papers that help me think through and developing an intervention.

306
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:42,810
So our one is the mechanism where we apply for a major grant at NIH, and that is how we could promote.

307
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:52,020
I have to get a major independent grant, independent of my mentors and everybody else and sort of her five year worth of.

308
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,880
For your support, whatever the project demands a grant to.

309
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:00,410
To advance the field. To support myself, my team.

310
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:06,170
As well as to get promoted for many reasons. To get that during the career development years.

311
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:11,719
And those grants have very little research money or one has substantially large amount of research money.

312
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,760
So I can employ people who can then learn and do the work at the same time.

313
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:24,180
So this was sort of the time when I had done now written about case control studies, cohort studies,

314
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:31,010
some survey work, and I was really, truly getting impatient and wanted to develop an intervention.

315
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:34,850
I was like, enough of all of this observational stuff. I know enough.

316
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,470
I need to I need to move forward.

317
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:46,399
I was I did my master's in epidemiology during those great development years as well, and it was from UK actually University of London.

318
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,180
And one method that I learned at that time, actually two methods,

319
00:32:50,180 --> 00:33:00,169
but one I decided to employ was cluster randomized trials and cluster randomized trials were just emerging at that time over here in the US and in UK.

320
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:04,819
But I just read really nice papers and I feel that the work that I wanted to do

321
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:09,740
at the organizational level would be done with this kind of a study design.

322
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:14,180
So any one knows plus randomized trials. What are they?

323
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:21,580
With you. Rid of it. What are randomized controlled trials?

324
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:27,310
Let's start there that you should know, right? Well, that's what makes it a randomized controlled trial.

325
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:41,870
It's somebody like your. It's a pretty you know participants randomly choosing like these are compulsory for.

326
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,330
Practicing and helping people through treatment and control. Through treatment.

327
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:51,130
The treatment is completely randomized. Something we don't know.

328
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:57,820
Right, exactly. And how what do you do to ensure that this is truly random?

329
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,180
You can use randomized tables that are programs and those data has randomization programs.

330
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:12,310
SAS has I more familiar with Steven and says I know our public health school uses more SAS.

331
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:16,600
So in the past I literally used to have a random table.

332
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:23,050
I don't know if you remember in the books and then you know that if you have an Excel, you can you can have a program to do it.

333
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:29,229
But of course, remember, it's random. So that doesn't mean that you truly have a randomized population.

334
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:35,860
You always have to check afterwards. Exactly right. So by chance alone, you could get two groups that are identical.

335
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:40,149
Exactly. By chance, we're just going to be possible.

336
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:46,480
And by chance alone, you might be measuring 20 variables and one of them is going to be identical, but different from each other are ways around it.

337
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:50,200
But yes, you always have to check no matter what we do.

338
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:53,860
And if you're in a position to lead any of these randomized controlled trials,

339
00:34:53,860 --> 00:35:01,030
remember that I learned about it so that there were several things that I learned in my early years, only to be able to talk to a statistician.

340
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:08,770
That was my only purpose, because my our language was my language at that time was very different from a statistician language.

341
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:17,860
So to be able to connect with them, to be able to work with them and understand them was very important for me to learn, just hands on learning.

342
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:24,549
But for this study and for all of the randomized controlled trials, ideally the PI would not be doing randomization.

343
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:29,379
It would just hand it over to statistician who would be then giving you the randomization,

344
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:34,940
you know, sort of protocol and the numbers b I, I do not get into that.

345
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:40,540
It is their, their, their method of they'll tell me who is going to be the treatment arm or the control arm.

346
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:46,780
But with this, what I realized was that if I go into a nursing home, right,

347
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:58,209
and randomly select one person with a urinary catheter for which the nurses or the frontline staff or the providers would need to do X,

348
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:04,810
Y and Z strategy. Worse is one person that they are not going to do x, y, z strategy.

349
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:08,650
Right? Same provider. One is intervention, one is control.

350
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:17,050
Would that work? Well, what what issues do you see that I'm taking care of two people with the urine catheters for one,

351
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:23,860
I'm told that I should wash hands and I should be careful. I should wear mask and that should wear gloves and thoroughly mask, gloves and gown.

352
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:31,299
And, you know, so that I would prevent infections. A second person next to you, next to that room was in a catheter there.

353
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,330
I can do whatever I want to. That doesn't work, right?

354
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,750
Doesn't make sense. So that is the reason that this design came about.

355
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:46,020
It is called a cluster, randomized trial cluster. Randomized trials were randomized organization to the to the intervention.

356
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:53,229
So if it is an organizational intervention, it has now been used in many different communities, randomized in communities in Africa,

357
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:58,240
for example, a lot of work has done using cluster, randomized methods, gowns and gloves from University of Maryland.

358
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:05,230
Quite a few folks are now used that in ICU settings where you randomize ICU use and not really patients.

359
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,799
And I decided to use that in nursing homes before there was president.

360
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:15,280
Before that there were hip fracture studies done where they would do cluster randomized trials and hip fracture interventions.

361
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,950
So there was some some sort of framework that they could follow, but but nothing that was done in infections.

362
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:27,129
So we approved 13 nursing homes that were part of the other work that we were already doing.

363
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:33,790
And 12 of them agreed to be part of this larger sort of randomized controlled trials we randomized.

364
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:40,420
That is different kind of calculations and analysis for cluster based trials versus traditional.

365
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:44,919
I not go into that. I can come back some other time to to describe that.

366
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,790
But we stratified them by their ownership status.

367
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:56,079
So nursing homes are owned either privately or by by either the for profit or not for profit.

368
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:03,760
So we stratified them by their ownership status and then randomize them six to intervention six to control and and developed.

369
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:16,690
R or, or a sort of study framework for for a cluster randomized trials, I was told, and you should know that 12 is a really low number.

370
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:23,230
People will tell people told me that there was a major critique that I faced in publishing this work that 12 is a low number,

371
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:30,220
but the way that we want to assess our outcomes and the way that we want to be very hands on in implementing our work,

372
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:37,209
there was no way as a junior faculty I would be able to I would take on randomizing 60 different nursing homes.

373
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:43,360
It was just not going to happen. So again, four plus randomized trials, 12 nursing homes on the lower side.

374
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,270
Nonetheless, we randomized six to intervention, six to control.

375
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:51,099
And our goal was to look at the high risk population, those with urinary catheters and feeding tubes.

376
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,120
So most of my work, the point that I'm trying to make is, is built up on something else.

377
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:59,320
When I write a paper there at least three or four research questions that come to mind.

378
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:07,320
So I feel. This particular project did not answer, and I would like to answer the next project and that could be critique from from

379
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,459
that could be based on your own perception of the literature that is there.

380
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,600
It could be based on your own work and poking holes and being critical of your own work.

381
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,140
Or it could be critiques that you receive the new published paper.

382
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,160
But do all of those things inform, always inform my next steps.

383
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:32,820
And so this was one of the works that the trial that was informed by my prior work we randomized there were 380.

384
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:36,690
So basically it was equal in terms of how many residents were eligible,

385
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:42,419
had higher risk of qualifying as high risk population and how many decided to be enrolled

386
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:47,160
and agreed to the to the culturing and the data collection that we were going to do.

387
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,900
And they had similar number of follow up visits, almost double the number of visits.

388
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,620
And this were the places that we visited, right, for intervention and control.

389
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:01,670
So they were not in and a couple of them were in Ann Arbor, but we sort of went far away.

390
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,630
Our father's was in Battle Creek, where my staff would go once a month to collect the data and samples of it to collect.

391
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:16,210
So intervention was essentially a collection of practices in infection prevention.

392
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:24,929
Right. It is believed that instead of implementing just one practice, if you collect three or four, if you do a bundled approach,

393
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:33,190
three or four core practices and implement them together, they are more effective than just doing one practice intervention.

394
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:40,410
So that's how we build this intervention. Keeping in mind that nursing homes can only do so much.

395
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:46,800
You cannot have an intervention that is very intense, that is very, very resource,

396
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:52,500
resource or time consuming or that has a lot of time commitment from the health care providers.

397
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:59,340
So we tried to keep the simple and things that could be integrated within within the normal day.

398
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:09,240
Our intervention was using preemptive gowns and gloves. So nursing homes cannot do surveillance cultures that cannot go in and repeatedly sort of get

399
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:16,680
get swabs as part of their routine to then understand if they have a drug resistant organism.

400
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,689
So what we said was that you don't have to wait for a person to be colonized.

401
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,490
If you have the catheter, fill a feeding tube,

402
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:30,480
there's a good chance that either you are colonized with drug resistant organism or you will be so using preemptive gowns and gloves,

403
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:38,159
active surveillance feedback. So there's active feedback where you sort of go on a monthly basis and give

404
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,100
data back to the nursing home instead of waiting till the end of the study.

405
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:48,030
And education and hygiene, promotion and services, pocket cards, screen and trainer approach and so on.

406
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,540
On the control side, it was standard. We allowed them to do what they needed to do.

407
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:56,160
Surveillance was mainly passive. We did not give so passive meaning that we did go in.

408
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,910
We did collect data on drug resistant organisms on infections,

409
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:06,630
but that data was not given back to nursing homes for any action that they could take and education was as needed.

410
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:14,280
So in doing this, the challenges that we faced. First of all, this is now I'm talking about 2010.

411
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:20,670
We started recruiting this nursing homes. Nursing homes did not stock guns.

412
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:29,470
At that time they did not. So we had to write a supplement to NIH to give us money for guns.

413
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,120
That was number one. Number two,

414
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:43,390
they were reluctant to have alcohol based hand drugs in their facilities because patients with dementia could mistake it for something and consume it.

415
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,840
There was one and then fire marshal code would be violated.

416
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:58,120
There was a second charge. But period. What if I was approached by one of my research assistants that I hired and his wife?

417
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:01,900
His fiancee at that time was completing master's of social work.

418
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:08,740
It was a marine biologist, came to my office and said, Dr. Modi, I need this job and I'll do anything for you to get this job.

419
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,950
And I said, okay, you know, I'm looking for really motivated people.

420
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:19,750
He approached he wrote letters to Purell so that they would donate the small little pocket sized for the study.

421
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,160
So he sort of that that saved us so much of money because despite all of this,

422
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:30,070
I had not really I had not really budgeted for either guns or that amount of,

423
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:33,970
you know, alcohol based hand rub that we needed to do the study over three years.

424
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:41,560
So those are the major. The third major challenge was that there was an immense number of leadership and staff turnover.

425
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:46,720
So we had to go back to the drawing board innumerable times to make this intervention work.

426
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:49,900
Having said that, it's again, a learning experience. We learned quite a bit.

427
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:56,410
The most well-received interactive activity was one of the most simplest ones.

428
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:02,320
We took plates from our lab to to I don't know, 20 guys have done it or not yet.

429
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,920
But this was one of the things that we did. We took place from the lab.

430
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,249
Right,

431
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:16,660
and took it to do the frontline folks and before they started in service all in services were really Ted talk that 15 minutes not more than that

432
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:25,929
before they started in-service we would have them played their hands and then wash them and plate them put plate them again nothing really fancy.

433
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:30,249
It is not broth, it is not anything. Just put your fingers on the plate and reprint them back.

434
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:36,190
Right. It's extremely simple. They were worried that what if my my employer knows what I'm growing on my hands.

435
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:39,820
And so we did not take any names. No names were taken. We just gave them a number.

436
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:42,939
And then there was one plate labeled as B,

437
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:50,769
which is before in one plate labeled as A we just after we brought them in our lab incubate for $40 and then took

438
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:56,050
them back and showed them what they grew so they would remember only their number and they would look at the plates.

439
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:02,050
So if you can see on this, this is reasonably good technique on this not so good technique.

440
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:07,360
And this was probably by far the most effective visual intervention that we had at that time.

441
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:14,620
They really enjoyed it. They came and made the point very clearly, and then they could hone down on how what was the best technique for energy.

442
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,450
And in this, there were some nursing homes where the leadership, the you know,

443
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:25,510
the director of nursing or the physician would come and have this done first so that they would just sort of normalize.

444
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:28,870
And there are other places where the leadership was completely disengaged.

445
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:37,300
In this work, we sort of developed and I did songs of, Have you guys heard the song Hit the Road, Jack?

446
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:41,710
Yeah, yeah. So we had Hit the Road Germs and we modified the lyrics.

447
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:45,150
And this is one of my nurses, Bonnie, and this is Sarah.

448
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:54,370
Both of them were very actively involved in developing some of these simple techniques to keep our keep our frontline staff engaged, etc.

449
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:02,050
Yes, she got her own theater lab. She's now working with the whole department, doing really good work, state level work right now.

450
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:10,450
And then we what we showed and this was just, you know, again with the randomization,

451
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:14,859
we could really for three long, it seemed to be going really fast to me.

452
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:22,210
But in looking back, there were, you know, three years that we spent doing this work and we did not know if we were making any difference or not.

453
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:26,619
There was no way to know that because we were getting the the way that we were

454
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:30,339
doing outcome measurement was we would get the samples of swabs that I mentioned,

455
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:36,850
the framework into the lab, and then the lab person, lab technician,

456
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:43,120
microbiologist would analyze this place and collect data and, you know, input the data.

457
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:49,300
Right, and would have patient level information. The person in the lab would not know whether this is an intervention site or controls.

458
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:56,020
They their job was just to sort of swab the swabs and look at the plates and that's about it.

459
00:46:56,470 --> 00:47:04,480
So we had no idea whether what we were doing for those three years, it seemed to be long, three years, whether we were making a difference or not.

460
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,569
And the as a junior faculty,

461
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:13,600
it is important to keep up with the productivity during those years when you're doing a randomized controlled trials every year,

462
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:18,280
the bar for us is usually 3 to 5 papers per year.

463
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:22,420
So not writing in our staff during this these times and what.

464
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,500
I did three of those times. So as I wrote a couple of methods papers,

465
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:31,690
a few few papers that I had not been able to write from previous data and cohort studies and

466
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:36,370
others that I've collected and collaborate with a few other people to sort of get some work done.

467
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:45,850
And what we shared with this, and when the statisticians took the data set and did the fancy analysis with cluster randomized trials,

468
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:52,210
the analysis is a whole different sort of thing where we have to adjust for the clustering, right?

469
00:47:52,330 --> 00:48:01,360
The clustering being that patients or residents in one nursing home are more similar to each other than those from the other other organization,

470
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,910
other nursing home. So have to account for that clustering effect.

471
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:10,270
And they did their analysis and we went through a lot of papers and a lot of work to be able to create those models

472
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:16,959
because it was a new to to the statistician was working with us near to us and we'll be sure was a modest reduction,

473
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,000
I would say, in drug resistant organisms, about 23%.

474
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,489
It did reach statistical significance despite being a small study and all the judgments that we did.

475
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:31,030
But I would say it was modest. I was hoping for 30%. The smartest reduction, a new acquisition for MRSA,

476
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:36,550
which is what is the most important thing is for new to do prevent new acquisition of a new drug resistant organism.

477
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:40,270
22% reduction, again, that didn't reach statistical significance.

478
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:43,330
I would say that I would have loved it if it was a little bit more than that.

479
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:55,329
But the more surprising, our second secondary outcome was acquiring a new catheter associated UTI or time to forced new catheter associated high.

480
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:59,860
And that sort of we showed a big difference in that between the intervention and the control groups.

481
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:04,330
And one of the things that we did was in the intervention group.

482
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:14,230
I mean, if you ask me what what the most, I'm not sure whether it was the education piece of it or the fact that they were clearly less colonized.

483
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:22,000
That piece of it, it could be both, a combination of two. But the way that our infection prevention education worked was that we really told

484
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,910
them that there's a huge difference between just having bacteria and having it die.

485
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:32,860
And you would think that's a very simple thing, but it's really not that simple to talk about it.

486
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:39,519
And we gave them pocket cards so that we said that these are these are the criteria that are written by thought leaders in the field

487
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:47,530
about what defines a clinical infection that needs to be treated and what is sort of defines as bacteria like Dr. Foxman work,

488
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:57,370
really seminal work that does not need to be treated. And we put that together in a very simple, understandable way to to share with the providers.

489
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:00,639
And it is providers, as I told you, they don't go there too often.

490
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:06,040
So we had to share it with nurses, nurses, AIDS, their leadership, as well as providers.

491
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,490
And we told them, what's the difference between what needs to be treated, what does not need to be treated?

492
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,100
That could be one of the things as well.

493
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:18,490
But nonetheless, we were surprised to show and to know that we could make a dent in reduction of infection, which is a high thought.

494
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:28,059
And then some of you may know, David Hadden, School of Public Health faculty, really nice guy.

495
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:32,290
I mean, I did not know him before. And people ask me, how much does this cost?

496
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:36,160
And I had no idea how to do any kind of economic analysis.

497
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,950
It's extremely patient, extremely patient with me.

498
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:46,149
And he he had a student with him and we looked at the data and looked at, you know, different other studies.

499
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:53,010
And he did this economic evaluation because this is the question that everybody asked and a new,

500
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:58,480
new way of looking at learning again, going to the methods that we all need to learn to make a dent.

501
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:10,570
So if you think about one year, one facility, it takes about 20 K per year to to develop a program that is focused on prevention of you die.

502
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:14,620
This cost is usually borne by the facility, the nursing home.

503
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:27,130
Nobody pays them for this cost. The nursing homes have to have to build this this it takes about 54 K per year in county treatment cost.

504
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:32,830
The most of it is when they're transferred to a hospital or a hospital stays

505
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:37,510
in a sort of catheters was utilized there's a net saving of 34 K per year.

506
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:45,370
Right. But most of this the savings come from, as I said, you know, college related hospitalizations.

507
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:51,580
And those savings are seen more by CMS and the people who fund insurance companies.

508
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:55,390
The nursing homes do not see any of the savings. They just see the cost.

509
00:51:56,410 --> 00:52:01,690
Right. So this is one of the I was I was very happy with the paper was published in jazz.

510
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:08,320
And I think it allowed me to understand that, to understand this concept that sometimes we do things,

511
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:13,210
but nursing homes, we do not really get reimbursed by this at this cost and this programs.

512
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:22,270
And that's a problem. That's the main one. Right. And then in the process, we collected tons of data, you know, when the.

513
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:26,700
We set it up again, culturing them frequently and getting data frequently.

514
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:30,790
It was a lot of data and I was really lucky to have collaborators.

515
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:36,400
Amini. For example, Dr. Mobley was again interested in UTC.

516
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:38,950
We have really good researchers over here.

517
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:45,970
He was interested in Uranus and had done some seminal work by saving humans from way before and looking at really granular,

518
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:56,799
granular data on on prevention. And he had a mentee, Erica Flannery, who was not necessarily interested in UTIs alone,

519
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,540
but was interested in colonization of different drug resistant organisms.

520
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:07,420
She wrote a really nice paper on MRSA and very cool colonization and published in a very nice journal.

521
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:17,079
And what we realized was at that time, community associated MRSA was emerging in and in the communities, but also in the hospitals.

522
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:21,760
And we showed that those trickling down in nursing homes as well. Besides what you want to describe,

523
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:29,880
Josie Armbruster took a look at this data and and and sort of showed that only 50% of what

524
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:34,030
is treated in nursing homes truly meet the criteria that were published at that time.

525
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:41,470
And she's a basic scientist. She she likes to be in the lab and work with the microbes, also mentor her remotely.

526
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:54,400
But she as a result of this work, she wrote her own sort of 99 year old Grant, where she had two in one patient thing and one microbiome.

527
00:53:54,790 --> 00:54:02,109
And she got it funded first as a result of her thinking through the translational bit and then even snickered and Joyce running again,

528
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:05,739
looked at this data. And because we had a spectrum of nursing homes,

529
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:13,090
they could really do some network analysis to show the movement of organisms at a more of a macro network level.

530
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:22,649
So this is I learned from early years was that it's possible to conduct randomized controlled trials in resource poor settings.

531
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:28,570
Such is very hard, as I showed you. But it is possible, it is risky, it is slow.

532
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:32,380
It took me four years to work out the paper, the first paper, five years.

533
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:37,989
But it is incredibly rewarding. It sort of, you know, helps me sort of many other things.

534
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:45,399
And our academic lives are long, so it's okay to take some risk early on and not worry about the next.

535
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:51,100
The person next door publishing 20 papers also completed analysis, which is what I was worried about my own insecurity.

536
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:57,759
It created many, many piles for mentees leading to their own papers, grants and faculty appointments.

537
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,450
But it was very satisfying for me as well. How are we doing with time?

538
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:08,620
So right now it is 956, so about 10 minutes to 10 minutes.

539
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:15,670
Okay. So then just to finish this story, after we published this,

540
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:24,850
we were approached by H r q to scale up our intervention at a national level and sort of going into the implementation framework,

541
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:33,700
going from leaving all the interventions that we did ourselves and taking get elements of it that can be implemented to a national stage.

542
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:46,710
And I think this is sort of again, more you feel worried because you know that what what do you do by being there, being present,

543
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:54,580
having boots on the ground is going to be very different from how an X, Y and Z organization in Colorado is going to do.

544
00:55:55,430 --> 00:56:00,730
Right. And so I think it took us took me a little bit of time to get around that fact.

545
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:06,790
It could be a negative study, in which case the primary data and how I did it would be completely negative.

546
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,730
Right. So it could be a negative studied be positive study,

547
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:17,110
but you have to take that risk because otherwise it just stays in one paper and it does not move forward.

548
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:23,260
Its implementation work takes your sort of patient oriented work into a larger scale.

549
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:33,459
And that's how we we got a contract from a from HQ and we spread this, this project to 500 nursing homes in all 50 states.

550
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:40,810
And again and this was in Dr. St at that time I just finished a similar kind of implementation project in acute care.

551
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:45,490
And so we had that large framework of how we would do this in nursing homes.

552
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:50,379
And the resources that this kind of large framework can bring is incredible.

553
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:54,580
You have a team who just does education. You have a team who just does data.

554
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:59,590
You have a team that prepares all the materials and you have a team that recruits.

555
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:08,950
So what I had to do, what my team had to do in terms of doing the legwork, this was all sort of taken over by a completely different set of teams.

556
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,150
So there was an incredible amount of resources at that time.

557
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:18,790
We approached 568 country based nursing homes through four cohorts.

558
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:22,240
135 nursing homes withdrew from the collaborative.

559
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:34,780
There were 433 active nursing homes, and they then about 71% of the sample that is 404 were included in the analysis.

560
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:40,719
So they were able to give at least two data points to for us to be included in the analysis.

561
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:48,670
Most of the things that we learned from our patient oriented work, we were able to translate that into this this national implementation project,

562
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:51,730
minus the fact that we really could not look at drug resistant organisms.

563
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:56,260
There was no way to understand how they would collect data on MDR roles.

564
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:59,350
And so the tool that that was just not going to be possible.

565
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:07,390
And again, to to our sort of, I would say, difficult to our surprise, because we could not analyze the state.

566
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,740
This was a three year project. We could not analyze it till the end of the third year.

567
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:18,790
And we should be sure a steady reduction in catheter associated duties across all of the states,

568
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:24,809
not only one cause that it was and the reduction was similar to what we saw in our primary data,

569
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:29,630
which is 6.8 per thousand catheter dense to 2.44 thousand studies.

570
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:38,499
And I think here I would say that the education piece made the most difference because again, we implemented the short in services,

571
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:45,460
we implemented train the trainer approach and so and had an active hand hygiene approach in some of the things that we did at that time.

572
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:51,550
So we'll leave it at that because the next story is going to be going into larger

573
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:57,010
from randomized controlled trials to going back into primary data collection,

574
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:58,989
which is one thing that I learned as I was doing this,

575
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:05,860
is that the short stay population was increasing rapidly in nursing homes between 2008 and 2015.

576
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:08,970
And again, thinking about the population approach being, you know,

577
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:14,170
sort of having a public health heart, I felt that we needed to really understand this population.

578
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:20,870
That led to a whole set of studies. I would just mention one that was very important.

579
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:30,440
What do patients carry on their hands? Right. So my staff would come back and told me, as we were doing the previous randomized controlled trials,

580
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:34,730
that they can tell me anything and they do tell me anything they have seen in the lab meetings.

581
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:39,380
They came and told me that now you are just devoting too much of time on health care providers.

582
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:44,510
What do patients do? Who helps them in Washington hands?

583
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:56,120
And so if you were to go in a hospital and culture 100 health care providers and see what they carry on their hands,

584
00:59:57,470 --> 01:00:02,840
and what we find is that providers carry MDR on their hands.

585
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:14,500
What percentage would that be? Any guesses going to 15 or 20, maybe to 20 to 50% because 15 to 20.

586
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:18,070
Okay. So it's about 5 to 8%, right?

587
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:23,080
So quite a bit lower than what we think because they keep on washing hands in between patient care.

588
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:27,310
And so we did a simple project and that was part of the other sort of cohort study.

589
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:33,340
G at that time was also School of Public Health student and she was a CHIP intern.

590
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:42,700
She was a chip intern as well. Exactly. And so at that time, for that particular cohort study, we had recruited about 350 patient residents,

591
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:48,070
short stay residents from a different area, not these 12, but these are different set of nursing homes.

592
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:55,630
And we were we as a result of my feedback from my staff, we had started getting a swab from patient hands, which was not part of my previous studies.

593
01:00:56,110 --> 01:01:07,540
So she looked at the 250 people and their data in between midway through our cohort study and we showed that, oh, let's see.

594
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:17,770
So about that is about 33% of patients at any time during this day nursing home carry a drug resistant organism on their hands.

595
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:26,950
Right. 33 And if that director did that, a quick med search, health care provider and hand hygiene, 15,000 papers,

596
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:32,770
patients and hand hygiene or hand contamination, five feet was barely in that to an outbreak setting.

597
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:40,340
Right. So that that led to a whole set of other sort of papers that I probably have to come back and talk about at some other time.

598
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:46,540
But this was when all of a sudden there are people like from CNN and NBC and all calling us that.

599
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:54,740
What's going on? This was back in what was the year that we published this in 2017, and it was like, Oh, that's busy.

600
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:58,749
But I mean, when you think about it, there isn't that there was no focus.

601
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:01,600
There's much more focus now on giving patients a lecture.

602
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:09,640
And you're kind of a piece of meat, you know, when you're in a hospital setting, you know, like they don't wash your hands.

603
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,730
They don't say, oh, wash your hands before you eat or anything like that.

604
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:19,479
Exactly, exactly. So do I. 16. I want to see more thing on your side table than there is on your hands.

605
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,810
So yeah, it's really interesting. Yeah.

606
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:32,529
So I'm going to stop there. Just a quote from what what reflects all of this work together is from Van Gogh,

607
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:36,819
you know, a weaver who has to direct and to interweave a great many little threads.

608
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:43,570
It's no time to philosophize about it, but rather is so absorbed in his work that he doesn't think but acts.

609
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:50,049
And he feels how things must go more than he can explain it. I really feel that as as these sets of stories develop,

610
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:59,110
that I feel like I didn't at that time have any time to sit down and really sort to comprehend or philosophize or put it together.

611
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:03,650
I can only do that now as I look back towards it. Yeah.

612
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:09,940
Frank, that's a really. And.

613
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:17,610
Oh, just giving feedback back to nursing homes.

614
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:22,510
How is that usually done and how did that go over with the leadership?

615
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:31,420
Right. So first of all, the first lesson that we learned was to keep it extremely simple.

616
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:38,500
No more than three facts on one sheet of paper, no more literally, no more than three facts.

617
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:42,550
You know, we just could not it was very complex.

618
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:49,930
One particular sheet of paper used to be, you know, we would show graphs and numbers and oh, no, it does not work.

619
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:57,850
It is three facts with pictures. And it's sort of almost a script to the leadership that, you know,

620
01:03:57,850 --> 01:04:01,330
these are the three facts that you need to present in your quality improvement meetings.

621
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:08,709
So the number one thing I learned and is that all of these research studies are complex.

622
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:14,290
The work that we do is complex because we have to use complex methodology to be able to answer the questions.

623
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:19,780
When we actually do dissemination work, it has to be simplified, simplified, simplified,

624
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:24,159
because we've capturing them for five or 10 minutes at a time of in services and they

625
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:29,170
can capture their presenting their data or that information in their own cour meetings.

626
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:32,210
They have like 30 seconds. Got a minute.

627
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:33,659
So we had to do that.

628
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:40,080
We had to sort of that was number one, to listen, to simplify, for them to be able to present to their leadership and get attention.

629
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:44,280
The second thing we learned was it was certainly important to give feedback

630
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:50,070
because they needed to know what we were doing and how we were looking at things.

631
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:53,510
So it could not be that just because they're busy, we did not give feedback.

632
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:58,680
We had a meeting that we started. Every service office started was with feedback from last month.

633
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:07,080
You know, we had six people in your nursing home. Five of them acquired a new bug, three of them according to infection.

634
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:11,790
And thereby, you should wash your hands and make sure that the student infection needs to be treated.

635
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,960
So we always start with that. Even if they said they were too busy, we did that.

636
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:20,580
The second thing we learned was to capture, if possible, all ships.

637
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:29,430
And the third thing we learned was it's much better to integrate some of this quick facts within an ongoing meeting that's happening.

638
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:32,900
So all nurses have an in-service meeting all the sudden.

639
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:38,160
So this meeting, they have a 24 hour no, 24 hour report.

640
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:43,470
So morning huddle basically at 9:00 where they would be talking about any major issues overnight,

641
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:50,729
you know, not only infections, but any people transfer to the hospital. Any person was disruptive or many of the things false, everything.

642
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:55,889
And just sort of having a few seconds in that in that meeting that's already ongoing,

643
01:05:55,890 --> 01:06:02,060
that has a tension of many different kinds of people, would be the other time that we would get that that information in.

644
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:07,469
Having said that, there have been many innumerable occasions where my staff would go and prepare everything.

645
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:17,040
They would have their slides prepared. And there, you know, they give out different knickknacks and two people would show up 6:00 in the morning.

646
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:21,590
So it would be drained for half an hour until people show up. Right. There have been many instances like that as well.

647
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:29,040
So I think the in services and giving back results was was always a little bit of a challenge, but very gratifying.

648
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:35,130
The other thing we learned, the reason that one of the nursing homes was not part of our study was that they really did not want to know.

649
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,880
Right. They really did not want to know what they had,

650
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:45,600
because if they that data could be seen by state surveyors and they would say that your site has so many infections.

651
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:49,050
But what we did was we said display this proud.

652
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:53,970
We gave them certificate. We said that display this proudly that you are part of quality improvement projects

653
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:58,500
that are run by University of Michigan funded by an age and be upfront about it.

654
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:05,460
If they ask you this is the binder these other things that we are doing to reduce infections and reduce resistant organisms in nursing homes.

655
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:14,100
So then that feedback became a bit easier for the students to give one of their stories about the feedback.

656
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:18,030
So that and then the culture was changing by the time I was doing within that time,

657
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:20,939
just like the last five years, if you think about it, so much has changed.

658
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:26,309
As I was doing the studies, some of this culture was already changing in terms of being open about things,

659
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:29,880
in sort of bringing nursing homes, moving the floors that they don't operate in silos.

660
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:34,140
All of that was changed already changes. But it became easier with time.

661
01:07:37,310 --> 01:07:42,530
The questions get more of a curiosity and there is question around staffing.

662
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:51,590
So this may be dependent upon this facility, but I guess, would it be like an in-house infection prevention staff?

663
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:53,860
Oh, very good question. Excellent question.

664
01:07:53,870 --> 01:08:00,290
So what is the infrastructure for infection prevention in nursing homes right now that impact life outcomes?

665
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:12,770
Definitely. So studies have shown other work from other groups have shown that the number of hours staffing, basically staffing ratio impacts,

666
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:18,250
infections, many different kinds of infections, floors, other adverse events that we think about.

667
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:25,760
So staffing is extremely important. The infection prevention, what FTE of infection prevention is should be devoted to.

668
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:30,020
This is sort of some work that needs to be done much more than what has been done.

669
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:39,960
It has not been done right now. Overall, there's at least there has to be one person assigned to be the infection prevention list for the person.

670
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:45,290
So that's a more that's new, isn't it? Well, it is partly new, but it was always there.

671
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:51,230
The amount of resources, the amount of hours is something that is more formalized right now.

672
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:56,630
But all the nursing homes that we went from the beginning of our studies that were somebody who would be doing infection,

673
01:08:56,730 --> 01:09:00,230
would be keeping an eye on infection prevention stuff.

674
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:01,940
So that that now, I mean,

675
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:08,120
we're seeing postings for like our students to work in nursing homes which we never knew right then the federal register and you

676
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:18,440
know the CMS codify that to say that they have to be there in the it became sort of policy and so that they could be dinged for it.

677
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,380
You know, if they did not have it in the past, wasn't this formal.

678
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:26,290
But there's always that I don't remember a site where they would not have an infection prevention.

679
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:31,640
Having said that, when you ask infection prevention is, what else do you do?

680
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:34,579
They would be, you know, subbing as director of nursing.

681
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:39,350
So director of nursing for, you know, 70% of the time, 30% of the time for infection prevention.

682
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:45,200
So you you know, this person must be facing so much in the leadership role that infection prevention

683
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:50,219
is definitely one of the ways they will be doing wound care and infection prevention,

684
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:55,430
which is a little bit of an alliance, a little bit of a, you know, sort of complementary work there.

685
01:09:56,180 --> 01:10:00,320
They would be unit manager and then doing infection prevention work.

686
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:08,320
Right. So that is a little bit better now. But they are now assigned states like California now mandate one full FTE for each, etc.

687
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:17,749
I know that there is differences in that. Yeah. Yeah. So now it is after doing pandemic, all of this just came into into focus.

688
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:19,489
People realize that, you know,

689
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:25,729
we are just sending our patients there to reduce the shorts to the entire tourist industry came about because, you know,

690
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:31,730
the hospitals were going to fall and really some of things could be done in in sort of other settings did not need

691
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:37,610
hospital level intensity of care so so short stay in Medicare start paying for short stay in short stay came into being.

692
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:42,860
And so all of a sudden households are discharging people to nursing homes, not knowing what the infrastructure is there.

693
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:49,220
Right. So, you know, over here we have a really solid, amazing sort of hospital at the infection control team.

694
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:52,550
On the other side, there's very few people doing this work.

695
01:10:54,020 --> 01:11:03,350
So so that that's studies have shown, again, the staffing, the how well staffed an IP program is, the immunization rates, for example.

696
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:07,250
That work has also been done, does it? DOWNSAMPLE Yeah.

697
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:13,520
So it's usually part time. Most of the places it's part time at some places now they're requiring some time.

698
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:21,560
The other emerging trend is that many of the nursing homes become part of bigger chains, and there is a person,

699
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:31,610
a more of a senior person at the chain level who then standardizes policies and rules that individual nursing homes.

700
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:39,890
There are pros and cons about it. I would say that some flaws of standardization across a set of nursing homes accounts for profit.

701
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:45,320
So they still look at the bottom line and that within the larger population.

702
01:11:47,890 --> 01:11:55,600
And then there are always local factors and so do the local teams have sort of the power to make any change.

703
01:11:56,170 --> 01:12:02,470
All right. So that is the other side of it. But that what needs to be done as well, that's a whole different body of work needs to be done.

704
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:09,280
It's a very good question. So thank you so much.

705
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:14,770
Thank you for having me. Take a break here.

706
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:22,240
Our next speaker will be here in 10 minutes. So get a chance to have a final break.

707
01:12:22,930 --> 01:12:26,470
And I can also hand out your your.
