1
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,120
And then I'll just wait for Gia to come, and then I'll introduce you.

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:57,080
Sorry. Not this time.

3
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:04,290
It's not that I was teaching. This gives me memories of what I taught.

4
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,790
But then I was more nervous than because I think. Labs.

5
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,200
Oh. So. Which means I had to, like, make sure all the lab stuff was ready.

6
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,430
I become 30 minutes ahead of time to it.

7
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:28,970
Over. I've only ever had a lot of tears. They've always been mean and I tried to be nice and give it back.

8
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:38,930
I remember when I took Jen on camera that I wasn't curiously different, that magical, really strict student.

9
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:50,630
But thing is like, if we have a team meetings once a week that they strive for this set amount of information that all labs have to adhere to.

10
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:59,240
So sometimes it's out of our hands, but which I a lot of the things that they tell us to teach.

11
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,900
The way that I think you understand that you do a lot of work.

12
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,870
Oh, I see. I see. It's snowing.

13
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,350
Yes, it's snowing. It was raining a little bit.

14
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,970
It was snowing. Less rain. Knowing that, it's just like.

15
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,070
Okay. Hi, everybody. Today for our guest speaker is Dr. Penny PEREIRA.

16
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:32,629
She's a research assistant professor in our department. Her primary research interests lie in the field of environmental epigenetics,

17
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:38,060
which seeks to identify epigenetic changes that result from environmental exposures at critical

18
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,920
times of life and limb phenomena to broader implications in human health and disease.

19
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,880
The concept of epigenetics explains how we like it. So yeah.

20
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:55,069
And then Doctor, who's interested in studying highly interacting RNA that regulated or sorry pi RNA,

21
00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:01,790
a class of expertize as a potential biomarker for environmental exposures and a potential tool to edit the epigenome.

22
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,660
She also aims to identify molecular mechanisms associated with toxic exposures that contribute to human health,

23
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,150
says Dr. Pereira's expertize in genetics, molecular biology and RNA biology.

24
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:21,350
She continues her research as part of the environmental epigenetics and nutrition lab, using the mouse as a model organism.

25
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,770
Thanks a lot. And are you looking at asking questions?

26
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,520
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Escalate. Okay. That's very informal.

27
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:37,970
Like, doesn't have to be. Oh, wait till I finish my slide. Since it's just like a few people you can always ask and I'll go through.

28
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:44,180
I have, like, a slide on, like, the overview where I, like, break the lecture into like four parts.

29
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:50,930
So I like break up, break it up into parts and kind of give you some summary and conclusions for each part.

30
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:56,290
That way it's easy for you to follow, and that would be a good spot to kind of overview,

31
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,230
like see whether you understood the material that I covered in that part.

32
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,430
So for the for today, we don't have to go through all all of the parts that's there.

33
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,540
If there's like, if we can only go through halfway through, that's fine.

34
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:24,200
Any questions so far? Just a quick icebreaker to get to know you and for you to get to know me, although you kind of know my background now.

35
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:31,070
My name is I think you saw a really long name because I'm from Sri Lanka.

36
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:38,780
This is not even my entire name, by the way. There's another another another part that comes in-between beneath the NPR pickup.

37
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:49,460
So when I publish, it's B Pop, BP, U PD, and everybody calls me Penny and I'm fine if you call me Penny, too.

38
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,490
And I am from the Department of Environmental Health Sciences.

39
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,740
And what is it? I wrote this up, and I didn't even think about what I was going to say.

40
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:09,980
What is a hobby that I enjoy outside of work? I watch a lot of like Asian dramas.

41
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,750
So a guilty pleasure. It's a lot of Korean dramas and Chinese dramas.

42
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,200
And I love cooking and cleaning for some reason.

43
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,920
That's so weird. A hobby. But that's my introduction.

44
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,840
And what about you? Anybody? I can just go on a word.

45
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,840
Yeah. You all know me. Aurora, IHS.

46
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,830
I like to bake, so I'll actually bring my stress bakes.

47
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,989
Now, if you. I'm there on the sixth floor, I'll usually, like, send an email when I like dump them there.

48
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:51,240
So I've made like or noodles or like various cookies or muffins or like whatever because I generally just want to eat one of it.

49
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,700
But then I don't know how to bake just one at. 24.

50
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,550
It's always a struggle to be like, okay, I have one cookie. That's all I need. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:09,639
I'm Bridget. I'm often here. Just. I'm in each student and outside of school, I'm a knitter.

52
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,740
But recently it's been more like buying yarn with the intention to knit something.

53
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:18,220
So I'm getting back into actually knitting so nice.

54
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:24,610
And Sam, second year HBC students had a lot of hobbies.

55
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:31,299
I think. So my favorite would probably be like just cycling or a little bit of rock climbing.

56
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,700
So is that my two favorite ones? Yeah, I think, yeah, I'm a second year.

57
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:47,030
I just do them. Uh, I enjoy like just doing sports, for example, like lifting weights or playing basketball, family life.

58
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,880
I can't see who's online, but. Oh, oh, okay.

59
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,139
I forgot. I forgot. Nice to meet you all.

60
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:02,500
And I hope, you know, just feel free to ask questions. So here's the outline for today.

61
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:08,770
So like I said, there are four parts I will cover the background for what epigenetics is.

62
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:14,409
So this is kind of like a very CliffsNotes overview of like high school.

63
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:19,809
What is DNA and kind of walking you through some of the the biology behind it.

64
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:25,930
And hopefully you can understand you can take home what epigenetics is by the end of this lecture,

65
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,510
and I will cover central dogma of molecular biology.

66
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:40,090
Don't get scared. I hope some of you are familiar with it and that I'll walk you through all of this in a very simple way and

67
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:47,829
an example of environmental epigenetics in like what we do in the lab is what this tale of two mice is,

68
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:56,260
because I work with mice and then I have two big examples of some mechanisms and some human studies.

69
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:03,850
Both of these are human studies, one with fast exposure and one focusing more on what's called genomic imprinting.

70
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:08,530
Genomic imprinting work is what I did for my Ph.D. thesis.

71
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:14,830
So I'll try to it's a hard concept to grasp, but I'll try to explain it in an easy way to understand.

72
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:22,780
And if you have a lot of questions here, I know it's going to be towards the end of the lecture and I might kind of fly through.

73
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:29,980
So if you have questions, feel free to ask even after class and I'll put my email address if you have any questions for that.

74
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,219
And this is something I will cover.

75
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:40,030
It's what we do right now in the lab, my current project that also relates to all of the things that we talk about.

76
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:44,020
So as I'll get to this, as time permits.

77
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:52,950
Sounds good. Okay. So let's start with the background, starting with DNA.

78
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,300
What is DNA? Can anybody answer that?

79
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,209
What do you know about DNA? Like our code of information.

80
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,230
It's in all the cells. So it's like we get it.

81
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:14,940
And I'm not going to describe it. No, simply. But like it's our code for how we are presented in the world.

82
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:20,580
So it's just like that through the series. It's just kind of it's a driving force for us.

83
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,630
Correct? Anybody else? Any any other interpretations?

84
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,610
I think that kind of describes in a nutshell what the unit is.

85
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:35,669
It's like our information warehouse, right? It tells our body, Oh, you need to function now.

86
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:41,790
We're lacking oxygen to go produce more like like use of the oxygen to make all of those genes and proteins.

87
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:49,680
So DNA encodes information that tells our body what to do and when to do it.

88
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:57,210
So we've heard of like genes, proteins, all of that is made by the information encoded in our DNA.

89
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:09,150
So here's a little bit of history. How have you heard these two names, Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins before?

90
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:18,240
Okay. What do you know about them? Think they created a model of DNA.

91
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:23,590
So what about Watson and Crick? Who's Watson and Crick.

92
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,540
They take her idea, basically. Explain.

93
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:36,130
So that's a I always bring this up because when somebody says who found DNA, it's always Watson and Crick.

94
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,330
They are the that the paper that came out is from Watson and Crick.

95
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,340
But we tend to forget these people is actually Rosalind Franklin.

96
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,399
They did. They are like chemistry researchers at the time.

97
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,110
And they they looked at the DNA as a sodium deoxyribonucleic.

98
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:03,910
The name DNA didn't exist back then. So part of our job as research researchers is to find out what's unknown.

99
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,490
That's what we're doing. That's that's a part of the PSC.

100
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:14,979
When you get a Ph.D., you're trying to figure out how to discover new things, learn the unknown based on what we see right now.

101
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:24,460
Observation. So what they observed in a calf, thymus, the sodium, deoxyribonucleic acid, technically DNA.

102
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,850
What's that? It's like an X-ray. Often it looks like an X.

103
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,230
Then here's Watson and Crick.

104
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:39,940
They. They saw this paper or this the data that came from Rosalind Franklin.

105
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,450
And they were like, well, let's let's try to figure out a 3D model for this.

106
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:51,550
And that's how they found DNA. And that's the that's the groundbreaking paper that came out in 1953.

107
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,910
So that's the story behind the discovery of DNA.

108
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:01,720
So also just to show that we as scientists can read other people's papers,

109
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,700
give that information and make our own interpretation, and that may lead to a discovery.

110
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,980
So here's the double helix structure of DNA.

111
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:17,860
If you look at it from above, it would look like this. So that's essentially what this is.

112
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:27,400
And this is from the original paper. Like, if you look it up, this is the first figure in the paper that came out in 1953.

113
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:34,629
So going with DNA, DNA, we said that it is information.

114
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:41,830
Right. And this DNA, if you unwind the DNA in a single cell, it can cover a football field.

115
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,390
So there's a lot of information, but.

116
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:52,120
But a cell is just like a few microns thick and it's very small.

117
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,560
How is this information compacted into a single cell?

118
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,030
So this is a chromosome, a microchip.

119
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:09,160
If you look at it under a microscope, an electron microscope, microscope, this is how it would look like chromosome example is chromosome 12.

120
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,460
But if you unwind some of this DNA, it will look like this.

121
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:24,250
It's kind of like a we call it a beads on a string. So the beads kind of represent a protein called histones.

122
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:32,680
So what happens is this double helix DNA wraps around these histone proteins and is

123
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:38,950
compacted into it just like entangles itself and is compacted into chromosomes.

124
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,370
And all of these chromosomes are in a single nucleus in a cell.

125
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,320
Does that make sense? Any questions so far? None.

126
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:54,639
Okay. So just for you to understand, like when I talk about we we we revisit histones later on.

127
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,170
And it's important for epigenetics.

128
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:08,050
And epigenetics is essentially how tightly wound or loosely unwound this DNA is that that's kind of a principle of epigenetics in a sense.

129
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,610
So in the human genome, we have this is a question I was going to ask.

130
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,960
How many chromosomes? I give the answer. I always put the answer here.

131
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:25,810
How many chromosomes are there in humans? 46.

132
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,360
46. Right. So it's 23 homologous pairs.

133
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,990
That means 23 came from Mom, 23 came from Dad.

134
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:41,710
So in red, you're looking at the maternal copy. And in green here shows the paternal copy.

135
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,680
So we say, oh, we have two wills, one from mom, one from Dad.

136
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:51,759
So that's where I'm going from for here, just for you to see in humans.

137
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,950
This is also an actual picture of how chromosomes look like in real life.

138
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,530
So yeah, 46 chromosomes and 23 homologous pairs.

139
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:08,640
So now we revisit illegal genotype and phenotype.

140
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,950
Have you heard these three words before? Yes.

141
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:18,950
No. Little bit. Okay. Can anybody explain what an illegal is?

142
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,770
We kind of talked about this before. Can you explain it?

143
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:33,470
If I gave you this and that, just read the information held on the wheel or is like the the structural information.

144
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:37,340
Yes. So that is correct.

145
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:45,320
But the the way that you can interpret it in another way is, like we said, there are two copies.

146
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,280
Right. It's the same information written in two different ways.

147
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:58,700
So we have the information that comes from BOM for the same thing, information that comes from the dead.

148
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,680
So here you're seeing like the actual DMA, GTC.

149
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,410
So you know what those are like adenine guanine, thymine and cytosine.

150
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:15,470
That's that's the DNA code. So the way that the ad are arranged tells us that information that we need to get.

151
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:22,310
So here it's a piece of information that we need to make a certain protein,

152
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:31,880
let's say that does a certain job that we ourselves need to figure out which version of this protein am I going to make.

153
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:40,370
So that's what the LDL means. The different versions, different variations of the same will go to what the team is.

154
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,790
Same information, same gene, for example.

155
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:54,690
Does that make sense? Okay. And a genotype is the the actual information.

156
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,850
So the age orientation is what the genotype is.

157
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,910
So in this case, all the variant nucleotides.

158
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:14,070
CS In the maternal paternal chromosomes, you can have the mom's genotype or the dad's genotype in this case,

159
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,380
but in real life it's not like the otherwise you would look exactly like your mom.

160
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,440
Exactly like your dad. Right. There are some crossover events.

161
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,580
There could be a different variant. Not like your mom or dad because of some events that happened.

162
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,900
If you want to learn about it, come talk to me later. I'll explain that.

163
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,360
But that's what a genotype is.

164
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:40,710
So in any animal or what's the genotype, we're actually looking at this nucleotide positions and the variations.

165
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:49,260
Then what is a phenotype? It's the physical expression of the gene, correct?

166
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,650
What we actually see, physically see. So a phenotype is the physical expression of that trait.

167
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:01,750
Got it. So we know what an illegal is. What's the genotype and what's a phenotype.

168
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:02,650
Right.

169
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:14,200
But so that's that's the background information that you would need to understand the the concept of what a central dogma of molecular biology is.

170
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,120
So what is the central dogma of molecular biology?

171
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:25,300
Looking at this picture, what do you think is the central dogma of molecular biology?

172
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,630
I can I can help you push through. What are the three things that you see in this picture?

173
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,030
Three words. DNA or DNA and protein.

174
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:50,800
Do you know of the relationship of the and the iron and protein? Is DNA codes for RNA, which codes for protein?

175
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:57,610
That's the central dogma of molecular biology. Simple, big words, but a very simple concept.

176
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:01,210
So we talked about the genotype, right? Your age.

177
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:08,769
That is your DNA. So that that that DNA encodes for what's called RNA,

178
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:15,970
which is the message that the short message that needs to that is required to make a protein at the end.

179
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:24,100
So this protein can determine your phenotype. So let's say we're making a protein during pregnancy.

180
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:29,020
There's a protein that breakdowns human milk. So adults don't need it.

181
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:39,969
Babies do great. So then in the baby, there would be a gene that encodes for that protein that and then the babies would make that messenger RNA,

182
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,100
that RNA that encodes for that protein.

183
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:53,250
And then the protein is made, whatever enzyme that breaks human milk, and then the phenotype is the baby is able to drink mom's milk does that.

184
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:59,050
That's just an arbitrary example. I don't know whether that exists, but that's a concept.

185
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:09,430
So, yes, the information goes from DNA to RNA to protein is a central dogma of molecular biology and how to go from a genotype.

186
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:16,010
Defeat aside. So what is epigenetics?

187
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,579
I didn't ask that question. I figured you would not be able to answer.

188
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:26,690
But epigenetics is the changes in gene expression without changing the DNA sequence.

189
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:32,270
So like I said, the example was breaking down human milk.

190
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,200
Do we really need that when we are an adult? No.

191
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:42,610
So our body needs to figure out, oh, when we're babies, we need this gene.

192
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:46,040
We need this protein. But after a certain point, we don't need it.

193
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:52,280
So we don't need to produce that protein. So telling ourselves when to turn on and off genes.

194
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:59,060
It's not like that piece of DNA disappears. Right. To make that that gene and that protein.

195
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:10,940
So what we have is there are different signals in a sense that tells the gene when to turn on a gene and off.

196
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,309
So that's what what we call epigenetics. So the DNA is still there.

197
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:20,130
The DNA doesn't change. The structure is there? The information is still there.

198
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:27,320
But there might be modifications that happens on top of the DNA that can change gene expression.

199
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:37,730
So if you talk about the epigenetics, epi means on top of genetics, your DNA, it comes from grief.

200
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:43,880
So if you if you if you forget what it really means, if you say, oh,

201
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:49,910
there are things that sits on top of the DNA that changes gene expression, that that would be correct.

202
00:21:50,750 --> 00:22:01,520
Any questions so far? No. So this is a quote that I really like, which is from a famous IP geneticist called Denise Barlow.

203
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:07,460
She says epigenetics has always been all the weird and wonderful things that cannot be explained by genetics.

204
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,809
So James mostly explains some of the diseases,

205
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:21,020
but some of the most of the time we cannot explain a lot of the environmental influences that determine human health,

206
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,070
for example, cancer and and other diseases.

207
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,140
So like I said, DNA perception of gene expression is that it's like a switch.

208
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:39,940
You can turn off a gene and on a gene. But then we talked about the central dogma, right?

209
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:45,520
DNA encodes via irony, which encodes for proteins.

210
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:52,240
So either the the sorry, the gene is off.

211
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:59,590
There's no, you know, no Imani or protein when it's on your Imani and protein is made.

212
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:03,790
But how much of that protein is made?

213
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:12,790
How can you explain that? How does a cell decide how much of this gene and protein is made?

214
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:22,640
What do you think? So they're like a star like code in the DNA.

215
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:30,290
Yeah. There's a source code on that, that. Well, in your RNA that says, oh, stop producing this protein, but the protein is still there.

216
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:34,340
How does it know how much of that protein should be produced?

217
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:43,840
The answer is epigenetics. It can tell you it can modulate gene expression.

218
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:47,420
How whether it should be a lot more, a lot less.

219
00:23:48,530 --> 00:24:01,640
So if you if you turn on that gene to, let's say green is less and then red is more, you can have more of that produce and even more produce.

220
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:13,310
So depending on this modulation, if this is a protein that encodes if this is an energy gene that promotes cancer,

221
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:23,030
then that would not be good for health, right? If this is a gene that is a tumor suppressor that is good for you, suppresses the tumor, right?

222
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:33,000
Then having a lot of that is good for you. So the amount of that gene expression can be determined by epigenetics.

223
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:39,649
So what sits on that on top of the DNA can tell you, Oh, how much of this RNA should be expressed.

224
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,650
And late at after that the protein will be expressed for.

225
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:56,470
Any questions so far. Okay. So we we can we briefly touch based on the the system proteins that type unwinds the DNA.

226
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:03,850
Right. And I and I also briefly mentioned that that can be a part of epigenetics, this opening and closing of chromatin.

227
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,850
So that's the concept I'm trying to get to here.

228
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:18,640
So the DNA that so this yellow DNA that's wild in these blue histone proteins can be this is called an open chromatin conformation.

229
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:32,470
So you see that the the proteins that transcribe DNA, so your polymerases RNA polymerases can sit on the DNA and then transcribe, let's say, a gene.

230
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:40,570
So it's accessible. You have these pieces of DNA accessible and that piece of DNA can be important for a gene, right?

231
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:48,430
So this is why a gene can be expressed. So what if it's like this?

232
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:54,860
Kind of compacted. It's difficult to read this. DNA may not be accessible, right?

233
00:25:54,890 --> 00:26:00,610
Only tiny little parts. So then it would be moderate gene expression.

234
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:08,970
Some genes can be expressed and here is a very highly compacted DNA, very hard to read.

235
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:18,650
So most likely those genes are silenced. So this opening and closing of chromatin can determine whether your genes can be read or not.

236
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:23,630
Does that make sense? So this. But but does this really change your DNA?

237
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:34,190
No, it's the opening and closing. The structural change that happens to where this DNA hits a wound is what determines a gene expression.

238
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,180
So this is a this is a type of epigenetic regulation.

239
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:45,740
Does that make sense? So no change for DNA, but this change to physical confirmation.

240
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:56,140
So if you look at it in another version, now I'm going into the field modifications of epigenetics.

241
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,549
So chromatin shape can be controlled by these modifications.

242
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:10,570
We talked about histones, which is right here. But there are two other components to it that we will discuss today, something called DNA methylation.

243
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:15,820
Is is anybody familiar with DNA methylation? Kind of.

244
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:23,680
Go ahead. Explain it this way. It's like when a gene is turned on and or really,

245
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:33,280
does it only happen with environmental factors or does it happen sometimes just generally in general, it's just like there.

246
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:40,510
But yes, this can help turn genes on or off, depending whether it's there or not.

247
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:46,900
What is it? Has anybody taken chemistry courses?

248
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:53,000
Yes. Okay. So it's okay.

249
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:56,230
That's why that's why we're revisiting a lot of the biology behind it.

250
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:02,050
Let me know if you want me to. I can. Obviously, I don't remember how to draw that structure,

251
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:10,540
but once we get some like more like with since you're just laying the foundation for us to get to the psychosocial factors.

252
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:17,820
Yes. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So the the methylation is like actually happens in what a cytosine is.

253
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:24,410
They're adding to the C. So there is a methyl group which is basically a carbon and three hydrogens.

254
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:28,420
It just sticks out of your your C base.

255
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:34,150
So if it sticks out, your other proteins that transcribe the DNA cannot bind.

256
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,959
So that is a form of regulating your gene expression.

257
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:45,580
So if you have a lot of seeds that are methylated, then the protein cannot bind to transcribe that gene.

258
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:51,280
Does that make sense? So more typically, there are always exceptions in biology.

259
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:57,220
Typically, if a gene is more methylated, that gene is more likely to be silenced,

260
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,130
that the gene cannot turn on because the proteins cannot bind to make it turn on.

261
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:07,810
Got it. Turn it on. I'm sorry. Has to go in and turn it back on.

262
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:15,610
Yes. So the the the nice thing about epigenetics is that it is it is highly dynamic.

263
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:21,360
So if it is an environmental change that adds a DNA methylation to the seed usually happen.

264
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:27,460
It's called a CPG C, the cytosine piece, the phosphate backbone that's next to it.

265
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:37,240
Good guanine, CPG. So you will read papers and it will say CPG site, the CPG site that that's what it literally refers to typically.

266
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:44,379
And these genes are kind of together in you typically find a lot of CPG rich regions in

267
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:50,440
promoters where the genes are supposed to turn on and it helps it start make sense.

268
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:55,290
Any questions? Okay. So that is DNA methylation in a nutshell.

269
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,610
Now you know what that is. Now you know what? Epigenetics.

270
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:04,419
And look at all the things that you're learning today and we use and we already know about histone modifications.

271
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:10,150
Well, histones are proteins that can line the DNA. And I won't talk about this as much.

272
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,319
I will most likely talk about DNA methylation for the rest of the talk.

273
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:26,710
So just focus on that. But another concept that is very challenging is this word methylation.

274
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:34,150
In a lot of papers, they say DNA methylation, and there could be methylation happening in histones, too.

275
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:39,730
So sometimes even at presentations, a lot of the speakers make a big mistake.

276
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:44,380
Oh, this was methylated. But then what exactly was middle?

277
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:49,150
Is it the histone or is it the DNA? So it's important to figure out, okay, what are they talking about?

278
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,330
Are they talking about DNA? Then it's most likely DNA methylation.

279
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,680
But if you are talking about histones and how how the chromatin is,

280
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:01,060
positions there have they're mostly talking about methylation that happens in histones.

281
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:09,780
So the concept behind this is that these acetylation manipulations, these are like what you need.

282
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:18,790
Clio is like the, the little proteins that has these, like ubiquitination translation, these agents that can.

283
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:26,230
These are like there are four tails, 4 to 8 tails for four histone tails that are binaries.

284
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:33,910
And the positioning of the tail can, can make the other histones be closer together or far apart.

285
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:39,010
So that's why these histone modifications happening. It's tails, and the tails can determine.

286
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:43,270
You can think of the tail pushing the other one away or bringing it closer together.

287
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:50,380
And another part that I won't talk to. But I work on is what's called non-coding RNA.

288
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:58,089
So it's the second part of the central dogma. You have your DNA that encodes for RNA non-coding.

289
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:02,740
It doesn't code for a protein, but it regulates all of these gene expression.

290
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:07,420
So just it's a little high that that helps all of this.

291
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,630
Any questions so far? Now you've got the foundation for epigenetics.

292
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,460
What modifications like all of this doesn't necessarily change your DNA.

293
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:22,300
It's what happens to your DNA, right? Okay.

294
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,739
So here's how to seem to go through.

295
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:31,780
I'll go through every single concept in the slide. So when you get the slides, you know what we've talked about.

296
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:37,899
So the addition of a methyl group, so like I said, it's a C,

297
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:46,390
H three that it shows in this like it's in this like backbone that's not it's hard to explain the three.

298
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:50,680
It's like sticking out of your C not like your phosphate backbone.

299
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,030
It's like prohibiting the others from binding.

300
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:59,740
But here's a cytosine structure and this is the limitation I'm talking about.

301
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:10,510
And the way the DNA is methylated can affect the phenotype ultimately, because that gene can be turned off most likely.

302
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,190
So less DNA methylation is higher gene expression.

303
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:22,690
More DNA methylation is related with low gene expression or silencing what we call a gene silencing.

304
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,580
Got it. And here's our histones.

305
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:38,019
Like I said, there are tails for the histones and all of these modifications can happen and these tails are called H three.

306
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:47,259
This tail, for example, is H three, this is h four and they say h3k and I'm trying methylation h3k4 di methylation.

307
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:55,959
So it's like K is right here methylation if there's three methyl groups and it's h3k for trying

308
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:04,990
methylation and there's like a code for this too to tell of how the genes are regulated.

309
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:13,570
And we know the code. So if we see a lot of, let's say h three careful try methylation mostly found in promoters and it tells a gene to turn on.

310
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:23,019
So the high presence of that methylation in the histone tail tells us, Oh, that gene is on.

311
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:29,499
So when we do experiments with an exposure, let's say, Oh, this signal is not there anymore.

312
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:36,490
In this specific position, that means that that gene is most likely turned off without seeing the DNA.

313
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:43,570
So like DNA methylation. So it's another independent way to kind of determine whether the gene is on or off.

314
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:53,960
So it's called a histone code. I didn't put it, but there's a big chart, a table with the histone code.

315
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,850
Well, this is this is this signal is found in gene bodies.

316
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:03,920
This signal is found in gene promoters. The signal is found in enhancers and a huge code.

317
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:12,520
But I don't I only know a few for the promoters because I'm interested in gene promoters, but you don't have to memorize it.

318
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:18,829
It's like out there you can Google it. So in a nutshell,

319
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:29,540
epigenetics is the study of changes in gene functions or your phenotype that is not necessarily related to the changes in the DNA sequence.

320
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:35,480
And this can happen in three ways DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNA.

321
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:40,550
Summary And why? Why should we care about epigenetics?

322
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,330
This is the cover of Time magazine like 2010 or something.

323
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,489
Is it 2010, correct?

324
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:52,490
Yes. Why should we care?

325
00:35:55,010 --> 00:36:00,139
Based on what you've learned so far? Well, in relation to this class.

326
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:10,160
Right, we know that environmental exposure and psychosocial factors will change how your genes are expressed.

327
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:18,530
Yes. So that can happen in very critical time periods in your life, for example, pregnancy.

328
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,990
So that helps. So in utero diet.

329
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,610
Prenatal environment. So including psychosocial factors.

330
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:33,560
Stress can change the epigenome at those time points.

331
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,250
They're there, thereby affecting the gene expression.

332
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:49,250
So in epigenetics, whatever exposure or whatever behavioral change that the mom goes through can actually affect the grandchild.

333
00:36:51,100 --> 00:37:00,870
Can you tell me why based on this picture? Because the reproductive cells are already being developed in the fetus.

334
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:13,260
Exactly. Yes. So a change, an adverse change that or an exposure or stress or psychosocial factor can impact the mother.

335
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:20,190
The direct person that it's related to the baby that's in the moms womb,

336
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:26,460
that's also like it crosses the placenta, whatever, hormones or whatever, toxicants.

337
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:33,090
And then and then the developing fetus, if it is earlier or earlier in the development,

338
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:42,270
if there are genes that are programed for like embryo sperm production and egg production,

339
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:48,510
if that's messed up, that's also kind of affecting the next generation that will come out of that baby.

340
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:59,069
So the great the grandchild and if it is later in the pregnancy, the the eggs and the the progenitor cells,

341
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:05,240
the cells that will produce the eggs and the sperm for the child is kind of already set.

342
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,130
So you can kind of mess that up, too.

343
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:15,930
So one exposure during pregnancy can impact not just the generation that's born right after, but the generation after that.

344
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,829
So to see epigenetic. If you read,

345
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:30,180
I think in your first paper that you read the early environment stress and the epigenetic in human health talks about transgenerational epigenetics.

346
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:40,680
So that means a change that happens to the mom that the epigenetic change that persists across generations.

347
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:51,480
So when we talk about transgenerational epigenetics, it's we have to go beyond these three generations mom, baby, grandchild.

348
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,520
But if that change also persists to the great grandchild,

349
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:09,540
that is an apparent transgenerational epigenetic change that's caused by an exposure or whatever the psychosocial factor I'll be following so far.

350
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:20,430
Okay, so it's like this is if zero, if one, if two, until if two, an exposure effect is like normal, anybody can get it.

351
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:26,610
But beyond that, any change that persists is would be considered transgenerational epigenetic change.

352
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:34,830
So again, in I'm going to fly through this because I think you've already grasped the concept of epigenetics.

353
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:45,120
Environmental factors can change the confirmation ofhow these histones and that DNA is tightly wound or, you know, loose.

354
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,080
It is. And so that can be an unknown.

355
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:58,800
Here's an example of unhealthy, unhealthy environments. Unhealthy would be high stress food and less exercise.

356
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:07,680
All of that in a healthy environment is what we consider frequent a healthy diet and frequent exercise.

357
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,510
And, you know, that also leads to being, you know, mentally stress free.

358
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:21,540
That can lead to the genes in the same individual being expressed differently because of how DNA methylation,

359
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:28,650
these histone tail modifications and noncoding irony can change the confirmation of the positioning.

360
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:36,060
So this person, for example, would would maybe able to live a longer life.

361
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:45,930
And this person might not be able to because of diseases that may be turned on because of how the other genes are interacting.

362
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:56,430
So that leads to environmental epigenetics, how environmental toxicants can impact health.

363
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:03,840
And it starts in the womb. So that's why pregnancy is an important time to consider this.

364
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:09,470
And it can have long lasting health effects like we talked about before.

365
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,940
Right. It can impact the baby as well as the the grandbaby and even for the mom.

366
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:22,410
It can actually have effects for the mom as well, depending on what the exposure is.

367
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:34,540
Any questions? Okay. So the overall research goal in our group is to examine methods that modify the epigenome.

368
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:43,780
So, for example, repress genes in a human population with an exposure can be turned on.

369
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:52,750
And this could be an oncogene, for example, a gene that is responsible for cancer formation.

370
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,280
That is an adverse health outcome. We don't want that to happen.

371
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:01,570
So we are trying to come up with ways to edit the epigenome,

372
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:12,850
to try and find a way to turn this active oncogene off on people that were exposed to an environment.

373
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,180
Obviously, we haven't gone to that stage yet. We're still working on mice.

374
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:23,560
My son, 95% similar to humans in its actual genetics.

375
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:29,950
So we it'll take a long time to do that, but that's the overall goal of our research group.

376
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:37,030
But that's background and the general concept for epigenetics.

377
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:49,810
Any questions so far we're following? And now I will switch gears and talk about PFOA exposure about half way through just to let you know your time.

378
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:59,710
Okay. Yes. Should I skip and talk about the the human pregnancy imprinting or do you want

379
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:03,780
to go through previous exposure or does that have to do with psychosocial?

380
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:11,960
Yeah. Okay, that's fine. Let's switch to that one. We can we can do that.

381
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:17,060
We can go back to the firefighter in one week or whatever.

382
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:20,420
It's fine. I mean, it doesn't matter. That's why I laid it out.

383
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:24,110
Separately, we can switch back and forth depending on what you what you want.

384
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:31,280
I could have flown through the epigenetics, but if you don't understand the basic concepts, it's harder to grasp the rest of the material.

385
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:41,900
So going to psychosocial factors and that's why it's very easy to switch to either one flows right through.

386
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:51,410
So we talked about environmental effects and that can be stresses during development that can occur

387
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:58,100
through direct embryo fetus interaction and indirect effects from the mother and the placenta.

388
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:00,650
All combination of the two.

389
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:10,400
So goes right in with this is kind of what we've talked about stress, diet, toxicants, psychosocial factors can affect F0, F1 and F2.

390
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:20,959
So it can be it's a combination. We can't just say that it is purely psychosocial factors or the diet or the exposure.

391
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:31,670
It's a combination of the the genetics. So going from mother's genetics, the DNA that has changed to the child.

392
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:42,410
There are a lot of genetic diseases as well that you're probably well aware of nutrition, stress, placental toxicity, maternal toxicity.

393
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:49,580
All of the combined effect of this is what can cause an adverse health outcome, be it preterm birth,

394
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:59,480
low birth weight, embryonic lethality, you name it, or later life out diabetes.

395
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:13,250
So there are a lot of outcomes that are influenced by the exposures and the factors, the psychosocial factors that impact pregnancy.

396
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:26,410
So here is a picture of a complex picture that shows like all of these factors that we just kind of briefly talked about impacting the mom.

397
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,480
And all of these can change the abnormal development of the fetus.

398
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:43,040
But we also need to think about the placenta. So the toxicants that that pass the placenta can enter the fetus.

399
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:50,480
So the placenta, if the toxicant is highly concentrated in the placenta, that may be detrimental for the fetus.

400
00:45:50,940 --> 00:46:00,050
So that's why the placenta plays a role in a lot of developmental toxicology, developmental exposure in utero exposure studies.

401
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:16,700
So determinants of developmental exposures to chemicals usually from three factors route which the mother is exposed, will beat air ingestion,

402
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:22,280
water timing of the exposure and what time period of the pregnancy is this exposure

403
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,980
happening and the extent to and from in which the chemical reaches the concept.

404
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,470
So that includes it going through the placenta.

405
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:37,100
Same thing can happen with psychosocial factors, even though it's not a chemical.

406
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:40,850
There are other chemicals, hormones, for example,

407
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:47,060
that are produced more than what the mom and the baby needs or less than what the mom and the babies.

408
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:52,310
So that can determine the gene change the gene expression of the baby really needs.

409
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:59,990
So that is a way of regulating genes by psychosocial factors.

410
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:12,790
So we will touch on another kind of difficult to grasp concept called genomic imprinting, which is directly related to psychosocial factors.

411
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:19,900
So does anybody know what imprinting is? What comes to your mind when we talk about imprinting?

412
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,150
To be honest, I think of like baby dogs. That's the example.

413
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:33,060
Yeah, okay. That's the example. I and another example I usually hear is like toilet.

414
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:39,779
Maybe I when I first heard of imprinting, when I was an undergrad and went to grad school,

415
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:45,639
I didn't know about epigenetics when I first started grad school and I was like, Oh, then my, my, my advice.

416
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:53,040
I was like, Oh, I work on imprinting. You can work on the imprinting product. And like we are talking about new series.

417
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:58,080
But anyway, back to imprinting a little bit of background overview.

418
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:06,100
It's not that the baby ducks imprinting, but it's if you kind of think about the same concept when you think about imprint,

419
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:11,940
it is related to mom or the dad determining your gene expression.

420
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,580
But we'll go to that full learn all about it.

421
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:24,810
So genomic imprinting are these genes that are really, really important during pregnancy and early development.

422
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:31,590
It's very highly regulated. Having more of that or less of that can lead to lethality.

423
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:38,490
Embryo being, embryo dying early or having very bad health outcomes as soon as it's born,

424
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:44,670
either being very low body weight and then kind of can, can in mice.

425
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:50,280
For example, I work with a mouse line that had that imprinted gene knocked out.

426
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:53,940
I mean, it was deleted facial malformations.

427
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:59,640
The babies are less are born. For mice, litter size is usually about 8 to 10.

428
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:05,100
But with the gene knocked out, there was about five. And all the babies are born.

429
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:09,210
They are like really, really small and then kind of dies in like a week.

430
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:15,600
So it's a very the health outcomes for imprinted genes, the mess up is detrimental.

431
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:23,670
It's very significant. It's very bad for you. So that means these genes are playing a very important role during development.

432
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:31,950
So an exposure or a psychosocial factor that can impact imprinting may have severe outcomes.

433
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:40,590
So just to give an example, genomic imprinting is controlled by these imprinted genes being on or off,

434
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:45,480
so differential expression of the two parental leaves of the gene.

435
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:50,850
So that's the definition for genomic imprinting. But I'll teach you an easier way to interpret that.

436
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:58,950
You, Terrians, are mammals that have a placenta, so only placental mammals have,

437
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,450
based on what we know, we know a lot about placental mammals, genomic imprinting.

438
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:11,579
So this is looking at monotremes like platypus that lay eggs and then marsupials

439
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:16,260
like kangaroos that have a pouch versus the placental mammals like us.

440
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:27,570
Imprinted genes are there but most and it started being more expressed from from these egg laying and marsupials and placental mammals.

441
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:37,350
And here is like how imprinted genes and genomic imprint and caves millions of years ago coming from here,

442
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:44,640
reptiles, birds and all these monotremes don't really have genomic imprinted the genes for imprinting.

443
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:58,350
And some forms are found in plants and other marsupials, but not very well studied, androgynous and gyno genus.

444
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:11,880
That means having two copies of the paternal genotype and two copies of the maternal genotype can have imbalances.

445
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,640
Don't worry about this definition. I'll explain this in a couple of slides.

446
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:22,559
It's harder to grasp what it's saying. This is a slide I always use.

447
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:27,240
I've been using since grad school. This is the way I understood it, so I'll put it in this slide.

448
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:31,500
So genomic imprinting is an epigenetic process.

449
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:37,150
And, and, and the prime example is DNA methylation that you already know.

450
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:40,920
So this epigenetic process is controlled.

451
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:48,120
This is a process that's controlled primarily by DNA methylation that occurs during the mutagenesis.

452
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:51,300
Do you know what gummy cometo Genesis is?

453
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:55,350
Do you know what gametes are? What are gametes?

454
00:51:55,650 --> 00:52:00,000
They're sex cells, right? Yes. So what is gamete genesis?

455
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:06,050
When those cells are being created? Yes. Yes.

456
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:11,250
Organogenesis is making off the organ. The mutagenesis is making off the gametes.

457
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:16,520
Right. So your sex cells. What are your sex cells? Sperm and eggs and sperm?

458
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:25,580
Yes. So during the development of your eggs and sperm to confirm to certain genes expressed from one color.

459
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:30,770
So like we talked about, we have two copies, two illegals, right?

460
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:34,430
One alien coming from mom and one Alito coming from dad.

461
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:45,760
That means there's out of the two, one of the aliens is expressed and one of the illegals is silence.

462
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:54,560
Right. So you can think about this. Imprinted genes are mono allelic expression of genes, and that's very tightly regulated.

463
00:52:54,590 --> 00:53:02,000
So these are genes that are either only coming from mom or only coming from dad.

464
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:14,000
But this is the definition of the textbook definition of genomic imprinting, depending on their maternal or paternal origin.

465
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,790
So that's what the what I was talking about two areas.

466
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:23,510
And there are certain set of genes that are only expressed from the dad or only expressed from the mom.

467
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:31,579
So if you think about a mom and a dad, both mom and dad have their own maternal and paternal oils.

468
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:36,380
Right. So if you look up here, M stands for maternal, P stands for paternal.

469
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,440
So this is a mom and this is a dad.

470
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:51,799
And there could be this is an example of a methylated DNA will be shown by these like popsicles and active transcription.

471
00:53:51,800 --> 00:54:00,680
When a gene is on, it'll be shown by this arrow. So, for example, in this example, in this example, which Allo is being expressed.

472
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:06,210
Is it the maternal or the paternal oil that's being expressed right now?

473
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:14,820
Let's call paternal Romeo. So if the paternal alleles express, what do you think is happening to the maternal allo being suppressed?

474
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:18,540
Suppressed how? But we learned about epigenetics.

475
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:23,910
What should it have? Methylated? Yes. DNA would be methylated.

476
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:30,060
Right. There is a methylation. So during egg and sperm development,

477
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:38,580
it goes through what's called epigenetic resetting and all the eggs will have this methylation and all

478
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:45,690
the sperms would have this like no methylation so that the baby can ultimately have that same pattern.

479
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:51,780
So that's what this definition is talking about. So it is an imprint.

480
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:57,400
When we talk about imprinting, we're talking about the the methylated.

481
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,780
So this is a this gene, for example.

482
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,650
Is it maternally expressed or potentially expressed?

483
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:17,190
Potentially expressed. So you can say that this is a potentially expressed gene or we can also say that this is a maternally imprinted gene.

484
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:28,560
The two ways to say the same thing potentially express that is maternally imprinted on maternally methylated, maternally silenced.

485
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:33,000
So in this case, we talk about imprinting. That means that that is silence.

486
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,330
It's turned off. I'll be following so far.

487
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:45,330
Yeah. So here's an overview of what we call Megs and what we call pigs.

488
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:52,399
Maternal MiGs are maternally expressed, genes pegs are paternal, the express genes.

489
00:55:52,400 --> 00:56:00,790
So the gene I worked in my grad school was pick free. So I think you kind of grasp the concept here.

490
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:07,770
There are about 30 maternally expressed genes that's known and that is maternally imprinted.

491
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:13,410
That is maternally expressed. You kind of understood that there.

492
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:17,850
So I talked about epigenetic reprograming.

493
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:29,970
So in our in our bodies, the epigenome is completely erased and rearranged at two timepoints in life.

494
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:39,900
So in specific stages. So I'm only focusing on development and in the developing life cycle epigenetic marks,

495
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:45,230
I'm only focusing on DNA methylation for now may be erased and reestablished.

496
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:57,870
So if an exposure, environmental exposure or a psychosocial factor will impact that specific time, it can have detrimental effects later in life.

497
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:03,410
The timing is important. So two stages to time points.

498
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:17,580
The epigenome can get erased. One is what's called a pig, a primordial germ cell, and then another is called the formation of the zygote.

499
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:24,420
So if you look at this picture, it's orient you to this.

500
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:30,060
So here you are going from low DNA methylation to high DNA methylation.

501
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:35,309
PGC is a primordial germ cell saying your x axis.

502
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:41,310
We're looking at E means embryonic day. 7.5 12.5 birth.

503
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:44,400
So this is an example of mouse because I work with mice.

504
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:51,030
They are born in 21 days, so that's relative to their time point.

505
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:57,809
And then they go through puberty and fertilization and then go through implantation.

506
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:05,910
And this cycle goes on and on and on. So in blue we're looking at the blue line represents boys, males.

507
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:16,319
The red line represents females. So the primordial germ cells is the first stage that I talked about.

508
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:32,210
Germline reprograming completely gets their DNA methylation erased and the DNA is reestablished based on reestablish, based on sex specificity.

509
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:36,720
So boys, get that DNA methylation established earlier than the girls.

510
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:43,050
And then when the zygote is formed, it goes through another erasure.

511
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:47,910
This is very important. The genes are important. The imprinted genes.

512
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:54,510
They don't get their DNA methylation, imprint, imprint erased.

513
00:58:54,690 --> 00:59:01,320
They maintain their imprints. So this is an important.

514
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:11,760
A time point fertilization for imprinting studies with environmental exposures or psychosocial factors.

515
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:15,959
Any question so far? It's a hard concept to grasp.

516
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:20,640
So if you have more questions, I just feel like this is so I mean,

517
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:29,180
in a way it feels kind of depressing because it's like essentially the only time you have to reprogram is when you're in utero.

518
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:32,360
Yes. Which you don't have control over. Yes.

519
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:42,059
Oh, it's it's so if we really want to target, like positive psychosocial factors for future generations,

520
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:49,830
essentially we'd have to catch women before they're pregnant or very early in their pregnancy stage.

521
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:57,209
And yes, we need to make sure they're happy. Not my mom, but for so many people.

522
00:59:57,210 --> 01:00:05,520
Right. I don't think that they even realize that sometimes you don't see the effects in the immediate first generation,

523
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:12,920
for example, like the Dutch famine, like all of the effects that happened for the mom and the in utero.

524
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:21,600
You saw it two generations later when they were the the third grand great grandchildren were becoming more obese and more

525
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:28,740
like they were getting diabetes and other cancer that you don't necessarily get to see it right away in human studies,

526
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:34,170
but in mice you get to see it because we can generate mice for, you know, in a short period of time.

527
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:39,000
But there are immediate effects, but also long term effects.

528
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:44,020
I mean, a lot more questions about that, I guess.

529
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:49,530
And, you know, in this case, the psychosocial factors like we focus on things like stress is obviously the big one,

530
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:55,709
but we talk about things that happen in the workplace. Yes. And then you can face things like discrimination and racial discrimination.

531
01:00:55,710 --> 01:01:03,120
And we've talked about like the weathering hypothesis and how like, you know, African American women, yes.

532
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:08,549
Live in the United States, have like higher infant mortality rates, lower birth rates.

533
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:11,459
Yes. But all of these are in mice right now.

534
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:18,850
So obviously, like, you can't go up to a mouse and like racially discriminated against it for it to, like, understand.

535
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:24,960
So I'm trying to think about how that factors into human.

536
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:29,550
The example that I have is a human example so we can see like how the,

537
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:35,580
the income can impact and race is there too, which I didn't put on the slide, but it's on the paper.

538
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:41,340
Okay. Okay. I'm glad that everybody's following and can understand.

539
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:51,750
It's harder to explain epigenetics, but the point of this slide is to say that those to a time points, if there is an environmental stress infection,

540
01:01:51,960 --> 01:02:03,210
toxins that can really impact your later life outcomes for the mom, the baby, as well as the grandbabies and great grandbabies, so on and so forth.

541
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:11,220
So critical time points are these like time points that are subject to epigenetic reprograming.

542
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:28,020
So in when we think about humans, these are some disorders that are cost primarily by genomic imprinting dysregulation quickly tamarin syndrome.

543
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:31,169
Silva Russell Pre-eclampsia behavior in the brain.

544
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:37,050
This is a part that I am mostly interested in and it's also important.

545
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:44,669
Imprinted genes are highly expressed in the brain hormone regulation that is important for hormone regulation,

546
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:50,520
maternal care, fetal development and early stage development.

547
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:59,220
And also there are a lot of imprinting disorders are related to neurological outcomes.

548
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:10,679
So for example, prior to William Angelman syndrome, if you look at the actual phenotype of the the the children that are born with these issues,

549
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:16,049
you see kind of if, for example, one, one of these syndromes,

550
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:24,990
if their physical outcome is like more obese and having neurological disorders, the, the the Angelman syndrome,

551
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:33,990
which is which is a the disorder happens at the same locus, one that's messing up the mom's little one that messes up the dad's illegal.

552
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:39,060
But if you look at the physical outcomes, they're like the plus and minus.

553
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:46,230
If the babies are bigger in one, in the other one, the babies are smaller and have complementary neurological outcomes.

554
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:53,579
It's very fascinating. But that leads to like imprinted genes being messed up depending on what a Leo is.

555
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:57,180
Messed up can give you a different physical outcome.

556
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:04,510
So that's what this is. This is. Genomic imprinting, not because of epigenetics.

557
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:10,329
This is a genetic disorder where typically this is human chromosome 15.

558
01:04:10,330 --> 01:04:13,780
You should have a maternal copy and a paternal copy.

559
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:16,299
So moms are pink, dads are blue.

560
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:31,990
In this case, you could have in error during fertilization, you could have this maternal copy doubled or paternal copy doubled.

561
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:36,999
So if the if the maternal copy is doubled, it is probably syndrome.

562
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,110
If the paternal color copies double, it's called the it causes angel syndrome.

563
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:48,250
So same same gene, depending on which alone can lead to diseases.

564
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:51,430
But this is not epigenetics. This is a genetic issue.

565
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:57,969
But the same thing can like if your epigenetics can cause, let's say,

566
01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:05,860
your paternal l'oeil to be silenced, then it can still causes similar disorder symptoms.

567
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:12,430
So another I won't go through this. It's like any parent all dice.

568
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:20,079
I mean, it's like having two or three copies of the same gene that can erroneously go into the fetus again.

569
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:27,760
Genetics. But now I've got this influence of maternal stress on genomic imprinting, the human study example.

570
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:45,370
So in this study, it's the paper that is from this paper, the paper from middle, and a famous epigenetics that works on genomic imprinting.

571
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:52,089
Randee Journal is one of the authors in there. They look to add what's called a Nest cohort study.

572
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:57,220
It's a human cohort that is in North Carolina.

573
01:05:57,790 --> 01:06:03,729
They recruited pregnant women for this nest newborn epigenetics study.

574
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:09,520
That's where the name comes from in a study from 2009 to 2011 in Durham.

575
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:15,940
So again, keep in mind that this is a very small area, a small population.

576
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:20,890
And they looked at stress.

577
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:32,890
They measured stress by this score and perceived stress scale p ss ten and that's what they they determined for low stress or high stress.

578
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:37,810
So ideally they wanted to look at the stress change.

579
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:43,660
They imprinted genes and are there any adverse health outcomes you can see in the babies?

580
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:51,740
And they also they are one of their focuses was preterm birth.

581
01:06:52,880 --> 01:07:02,060
So they defined preterm birth as PTB as babies that were born beyond the 37 week gestation period.

582
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:09,410
So what they saw was that stress. So looking at this table, here's a variable.

583
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:15,800
I'm only showing two. They kind of discussed a few more household income, maternal smoking, for example,

584
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:28,250
and this is their low stress cohort and is a number of individuals 415 for that and then high stress cohort that had 122 people for that.

585
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:33,440
Keep in mind that they have like high stress school where it is like half the amount

586
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:38,149
of low stress school hard for them and the p value for a lot of our studies,

587
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:42,260
if it is less than 0.05 means there is a significant difference.

588
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:51,050
So here, if you look at the low stress, household income, high stress household income, is there a trend that that you see?

589
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:58,220
Which people tend to be more stress or low income groups.

590
01:08:00,270 --> 01:08:03,660
Yes. And what about high stress?

591
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:09,569
I mean, high income people tend to be they tend to have less stress.

592
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:16,250
And that is significant. The P-value is the standpoint oh five, at least that's from their cohort.

593
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:22,680
And I think most of them were a little bit more educated and they did have.

594
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:31,050
They also said in the paper that more African American females were more stressed

595
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:39,180
and that was also significant based on the P values and and also maternal smoking,

596
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:44,890
smoking during pregnancy. People still do that, apparently.

597
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:50,220
I was surprised that yeah, that's like I mean, ten years ago maybe.

598
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:55,889
I mean, it's a known fact smoking that's why I my example had the the pregnant woman smoking

599
01:08:55,890 --> 01:09:03,810
that is really bad for you and your grandchildren that in the 1970s but like 2000.

600
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:14,969
Yeah and you know so an important point here is that one of the reasons they they showed preterm birth here is because there were other

601
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:29,070
cohorts and multiple other papers that stated that imprinted gene dysregulation is one of the outcomes associated with that is preterm birth,

602
01:09:29,350 --> 01:09:34,499
low birth weight of the babies. But in this study they didn't see that.

603
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:40,380
So I use this example just to show that science, this is how science works.

604
01:09:40,650 --> 01:09:47,850
Sometimes your results don't necessarily match with what's out there, but there might be a reason behind it.

605
01:09:48,240 --> 01:10:00,719
And the way that this group explained is because it might be because of their limited number of in the limited number of people and also the location,

606
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:07,820
too. So all of that matters. And yet they also looked at low birth weight.

607
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:14,330
They defined that as babies that were that weighed less than 2500 grams.

608
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:20,900
So ultimately they wanted to look at imprinted genes.

609
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:22,880
So here are some of the imprinted genes.

610
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:34,740
You see some familiar names, Megs and pegs, and these are very well known imprinted genes that regulate human health.

611
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:40,050
There are a lot of diseases and cancer associated with this export.

612
01:10:40,290 --> 01:10:49,740
This being messed up during development. So here we have a high stress group, low stress group and r p values.

613
01:10:51,330 --> 01:11:03,059
And based on all of the genes that they test, I think it was 79, even though they had hundreds of people for the for their statistics,

614
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:10,050
for the for stress groups, they only tested their DNA methylation on 79 people, Max.

615
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:18,690
Here. Yeah, there, there. In numbers shown here. How many people how many people's DNA methylation was measured?

616
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:23,230
So keep that in mind. Not all of them were tested and they are awesome.

617
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:28,620
It was like a mother infant pair. So they could not only look at the DNA methylation of the mom,

618
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:33,959
but they can also look at the DNA methylation of the baby and consider baby's sex to see

619
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:38,850
whether there are any sex dependent effects with genomic imprinting being messed up.

620
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:43,380
So is there something that you see from this table?

621
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:48,360
What do you think is significant? The take three.

622
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:57,450
Big three. And actually they mainly focus on missed peg 3.0 sorry.

623
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:03,180
Yes, that's right. Yes, miss.

624
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:10,770
Sorry to say it's the P-value is less than .05, but this doesn't mean that the others are not important.

625
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:16,770
It's because the the if we increase this in number, we might be able to see some differences.

626
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:30,510
But they saw that the the people that the missed gene had the DNA methylation was different between the high stress and the low stress group.

627
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:31,680
That's what this is saying.

628
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:41,460
So high maternal stress during pregnancy was associated with increased DNA methylation in the imprinted locus in the babies.

629
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:46,259
So Miss is a maternally imprinted gene.

630
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:55,230
So it's the maternally expressed gene, right, associated with slow or reduced growth and abnormal maternal care.

631
01:12:55,650 --> 01:13:03,299
So it's similar to what I saw with my peg, peg, gene. Lots of the genes that are potentially expressed tend to have reduced growth.

632
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,740
The babies are smaller.

633
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:14,190
So that's also a reason why they they paid attention to low birth weight, but they were not able to the p value wasn't significant enough.

634
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:20,370
So that means you need more, more, more statistics, more higher in number to see whether there is a difference.

635
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:30,329
So I talked about sex of the fetus. Right. So this also shows low stress and high stress in in this upper panel.

636
01:13:30,330 --> 01:13:34,200
It's males in this lower panel, it's females.

637
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:41,160
And here is their p values right here, a p values between these these two groups.

638
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:45,930
What are some trends you see here? What are some conclusions?

639
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:57,280
This. So this is a methylation of that missed gene that we talked about, a percentage of DNA methylation going from low to high.

640
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:05,910
Let's focus on females for right now because you see kind of a big separation here.

641
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:09,840
Is there a difference in their P values, males versus females?

642
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:15,329
Yes. So they're significantly different. What can you say?

643
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:21,420
Are the females more methylated or less methylated with high stress?

644
01:14:21,570 --> 01:14:25,870
High stress is more methylated compared to low stress females.

645
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:30,890
Right. So we see this difference. A differential association with the female.

646
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:36,899
So high stress is associated with increase in DNA methylation at the Ms. locus.

647
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:43,550
Only in females, but not in the boys, not in the the male fetuses.

648
01:14:44,490 --> 01:14:48,470
I know they probably, you know, recruited and they could recruit.

649
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:54,680
Yeah, but like this, the sex seems very low.

650
01:14:55,440 --> 01:15:01,560
Those kinds of conclusions aren't quantitative yet. So is this considered like a seminal paper?

651
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:05,819
Yes. Okay. Because like, if you think about it,

652
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:13,950
we had hundreds and three hundreds when they first did the the the bioinformatics for the demographics and everything.

653
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:19,410
But then when you do the actual experiment for all the fetuses, it was about 70, 79.

654
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:23,720
Now only two or it's it's yeah.

655
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:31,980
It's also based on even though you recruit in the IRP, the, the, the people that get recruited can leave at any time.

656
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:37,589
Yeah. So we're also giving birth like six.

657
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:47,190
We can't really control for that. It's whatever you get. So and all out of that, you can only do the experiments on a certain group of people.

658
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:54,570
So the limiting factor here is like the the availability of your samples and your exclusion criteria.

659
01:15:54,930 --> 01:16:03,000
So if you exclude, let's say, a certain BMI from the entire study, then you have to end up reducing your number in number.

660
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:08,219
Sure. Sure. But hopefully we can summarize this.

661
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:16,320
This is a summary slide to say that regulation of imprinted genes are critical during those two time

662
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:24,480
points of resetting and an important window for of susceptibility for toxicants as well as stress.

663
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:33,150
Exposure to chemicals early in development and during pregnancy can lead to dysregulated genomic imprinting that

664
01:16:33,150 --> 01:16:40,470
can impact on multiple generations and can lead to detrimental health outcomes in the same generation as well.

665
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:48,240
And maternal stress can also change imprinted gene expression due to DNA methylation changes.

666
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:52,320
Based on the example that I provide that we just went through right now.

667
01:16:53,370 --> 01:17:01,019
So epigenetic changes in genomic imprinting can have observable phenotypic outcomes,

668
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:05,460
just like the the diseases that we kind of briefly go over the genetic diseases.

669
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:14,939
And it's very harder to hard to do a human studies on imprinting and and a lot of toxicology work that

670
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:20,700
requires mechanism looking at epigenetic factors because of what we just talked about inclusion,

671
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:23,790
exclusion criteria, availability of the resources.

672
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:32,969
Sometimes, you know, you get blood, but when you actually try to get DNA from the blood in in the lab, some samples are degraded.

673
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:37,340
Like you have multiple things to consider when we're actually doing the experiments.

674
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:49,500
So that's why I work with mice, because I can control for a lot of things and I will stop there and put my last slide.

675
01:17:49,590 --> 01:17:52,620
This is just an overview of what I'm doing right now.

676
01:17:52,650 --> 01:18:00,960
I will say that Dr. Pere does have an evaluation wing, so I'd put that in the announcement on canvas and he's gonna fill it out.

677
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:04,530
But before we get to questions, let's give her a hand. Thank you.

678
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:11,310
You did a great job in explaining that in a very simple, straightforward manner.

679
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:17,640
Do any of you have questions regarding lectures? But I assume this is your class time.

680
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:24,220
I think I've left with the same thing that you've said. I like it.

681
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:28,530
This is this kind of sad. This is right now.

682
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:35,850
I really like the action research. So just like, okay, we can have an action, but like that, in fact, is on our genetic code.

683
01:18:36,030 --> 01:18:44,310
Like, how can we go on that level and fix that which is so deep and deeply ingrained into individuals and like.

684
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:55,550
And it also shows you like the, the second part of the the talk that we kind of skimmed over kind of talked about epigenetic biomarkers.

685
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:58,800
So the main point for that was like, oh, there might be bio.

686
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:08,400
Workers with exposure or stress. It doesn't have to be during pregnancy that can interpret later life outcomes like cancer, for example.

687
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:13,200
So like if you get if you know and find those biomarkers in people, then you can have interventions.

688
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:17,969
Exactly. So that's one of the goals, as I mentioned, that we are interested in.

689
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:23,670
How can we reverse some of these programed epigenetic marks to make it better?

690
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:34,829
It can be an intervention through like, let's say, non-coding RNA, for example, or diet, exercise, supplementation.

691
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:40,440
So a lot of these are modes of intervention. So it's not a very sad black box.

692
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:48,960
And as as public health researchers and people advocates for public health, we are trying to figure out what's wrong.

693
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:52,650
Let's try to fix it. Try to find ways to fix it.

694
01:19:54,150 --> 01:20:02,040
I mean, with that study, the Vidal study, not to like poo poo it because it's it's obviously like important research.

695
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:04,319
But I'm just thinking about how like, you know,

696
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:10,770
for the the Wakefield study where he was like vaccines cause autism like that had a really small sample size.

697
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:14,370
And even for my qualitative work when I have like 30 people.

698
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:17,790
Qualitative work doesn't have a power or anything.

699
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:21,330
You don't need a sample size and I 30 and they're like, this isn't enough.

700
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:35,099
So to think about a study where like a female, you know, how do you color fetuses essentially under high stress in this like seminal paper?

701
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:42,600
There's only six of them. I mean, obviously, they would want to try to replicate this in a larger population,

702
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:49,350
but I'm trying to think like down the line, you know, it would be interesting to look at, you know,

703
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:54,690
we know how in this class we talk a lot about like how work is structured here in the United States

704
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:59,759
compared to countries that are very different with nicer things like Scandinavian countries,

705
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:10,310
for example, where you have women here working up until like literally the week before they give birth, whereas in like the day or the day.

706
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:18,720
Whereas like in Sweden, for example, they have time off before and then they have a year's worth of time off after.

707
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:24,990
But obviously they live in very different countries with different health care systems, environmental factors, etc.

708
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:38,100
So I just wonder if there is a way to figure out, like, I don't know, more of a greater impact of psychosocial factors in the offspring in particular.

709
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:43,260
Like I said, it just feels obvious. So here's a potential solution that I had in the slides.

710
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:50,550
So this is a study I'm not going to go through the the all of the stuff, but it's like this is an example of BPA exposure.

711
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:58,050
So pregnant animals. So yellow shows high diet, low DNA methylation is bad.

712
01:21:58,410 --> 01:22:02,310
Make some mice more big and yellow. It's like a biosensor.

713
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:06,530
If the mice are brown, they're more lean and more healthy.

714
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:07,890
They have a more long life.

715
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:16,229
So BPA exposure to these animals show like their DNA methylation just by looking at the babies, more yellow babies are born.

716
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:18,230
That means there's less DNA methylation.

717
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:27,960
But when we supplemented with a methyl rich diet, so folic acid folate during pregnancy can reverse that outcome.

718
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:32,639
So that that's that's the light at the end of the tunnel.

719
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:36,840
We can we can we can reverse these outcomes.

720
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:41,610
Thank you so much. No problem. Yes, I see the class going up.

721
01:22:41,610 --> 01:22:47,640
And so if you like something interesting very much, in fact.

722
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:55,230
Thanks for having me. And for listening and following and answering all my questions.
