1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:22,610
You know, I know what it's like to live in your area and you know, to it.

2
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:40,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:51,740
You're right. All right. I am happy to announce today's speaker will be presenting a paper on specific cell mediated immunity.

4
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:59,920
Thank you for standing up this. So.

5
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,360
Good morning. Okay. So good morning, everyone.

6
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:12,759
I'm presenting the research of or is it is also virus specific cell immunity but not huma immunity correlates

7
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:21,520
inversely with the incidence of herpes zoster and the severity severity of skin symptoms and zoster associated pain.

8
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:29,620
This study. First let me introduce you with the virus.

9
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,290
It is also virus. It's also called the human herpesvirus three.

10
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:40,139
It's an analog of the virus visteon's DNA. It belonged to the alpha alpha herpes virus and the virus.

11
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:51,650
So virus as only host is human. So in the lesser corner is a varicella zoster virus under an electron microscope.

12
00:01:52,040 --> 00:02:01,550
And it's typical that it first attacked persons in their childhood as the initial stage and caused varicella, also known as chickenpox.

13
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:11,780
After the same symptoms gone, the virus gene were not gone into a hide a sensory nerve ganglia for a lifetime

14
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:21,260
and it will be reactivated by immuno compromised status and causing pain,

15
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:29,360
itching or tingling before rash and a rash. A single strap around either side of the body is very painful.

16
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:41,020
And the onset of herpes zoster is thought to be related to a decline of cell mediated immunity that researchers have shown.

17
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:50,620
Increase contact with the virus patients can reduce the onset of herpes zoster and live attenuated varicella zoster virus,

18
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:56,410
and the original cover is vaccine already used to prevent herpes zoster.

19
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,100
However, no large scale host,

20
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:11,379
no large scale cohort study are presented until recently to review the relationship between

21
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:18,250
the degrees of the cell mediated immunity or huma immunity with the onset of herpes zoster.

22
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:24,550
Now the study can serve us. Now the study is a short for sure.

23
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:39,280
Herpes so shows herpes herpes zoster study and started recruit Japanese persons aged 50 years or older on October 2/1,

24
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:48,399
2008 inches its county, and eventually got 12,522 participants and the cohort last for three years.

25
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,730
From April 2009 to December 2012,

26
00:03:52,660 --> 00:04:00,910
we test 5683 participants a skin test for a virus that has also virus specific antigen at

27
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:06,580
the beginning of the research and we follow up them every four weeks by phone interview.

28
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:13,720
And who ever developed suspected herpes zoster participants will be asked to visit a hospital

29
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,209
or clinic that registered with the study to test the level of cell mediated immunity,

30
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:23,860
humor, immunity, herpes, zoster skin lesions or cells associating.

31
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:34,809
Only 6.4% were withdrew from the study because of death or moving out to test the level of cell mediated immunity.

32
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,100
We used a skin test that we inject 100 milliliters of our.

33
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:46,480
It is also antigen by can under the skin and the to measure it of greatest diameter of areas and measures,

34
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:59,589
changes and extent of edema after 48 hours and the humor immunity we use we use we tested at initial medical test used to enhance the issues as a GP.

35
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:06,370
Those tests are for that and to test the varicella zoster virus specific antibodies.

36
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,340
And to measure the herpes skin lesions, our trained physician,

37
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:24,450
we use a standard 30 form that's considering the presence of underlying diseases or immunosuppressant anti neoplastic therapy.

38
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,829
The date of onset of the rash, the distribution of the rash,

39
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:39,300
the properties of rash or the date of onset of pay have a scale from 1 to 10, and to measure the author should pay on these.

40
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:48,900
There are one, two, three, four, five, six, 13, 20, 27, 34, 41, 48, 55, 85, 150, 145 or under 75.

41
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:54,630
With the face scale, the zero means no pay and five means pain, disturbing sleep.

42
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,979
Also, we use that phone interview every four weeks to follow up for those who have

43
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:08,760
herpes zoster that patients are thought to have the post hepatic neuralgia.

44
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:18,150
If the reported cells are associated pain for at least three months after onset or recurrence of their associate pay after three months or later.

45
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:27,570
So far, the results that are among all of our participants 401.

46
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:34,680
Develop Herpes Zoster during the follow up with an incidence incidence rate of 1.7% and

47
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,070
the mount those who have herpes zoster 19.7% are developed post hepatic neuralgia.

48
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:53,030
The erythema diameter shows no significant difference among males and females, which is not our figure.

49
00:06:53,300 --> 00:07:00,020
But there shows a significant decline when age increases and the erythema nine and her are

50
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:09,620
also inversely related to the incidence of herpes tells her that shows that the age that

51
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:16,069
inversely the age that inversely related to the incidence of herpes also showing a of

52
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:25,790
studies can be related to the varicella zoster virus specific cell cell mediated immunity.

53
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:37,640
But this finding the significance among the varicella zoster virus antibody titers which shows that the,

54
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:45,860
uh, the humor immunity is not where it is, have a noticeable non-significant correlation with it.

55
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:53,440
And also for the severity of pain and the severity of skin condition.

56
00:07:54,040 --> 00:08:03,370
It also shows that with a larger erythema diameter, there is less severity of skin lesions and that's the root of pain.

57
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,240
And it's significant. It shows a significant correlation.

58
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:18,970
So that's the varicella zoster virus, specific cell mediated immunity, but not the human.

59
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:28,629
Another not humoral immunity that shows a negative in all three of the tests can help to reduce after

60
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:41,330
a cat are related to help to reduce the herpes zoster progression and also for the herpes neuralgia.

61
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:51,400
It also shows that for larger erythema diameter and more severe off edema reaction.

62
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,860
That's the instance of post. Her perfect neuralgia are lower.

63
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:02,860
So sure. Also, this finding is insignificant and negative.

64
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:17,200
Among the humoral immunity that's showing the cell mediated immunity is inversely related to the incidence of post delta neuralgia.

65
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:26,409
Sorry. So in conclusion that cell mediated immunity to varicella zoster virus accessed by the varicella zoster

66
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:33,490
virus or varicella zoster virus skin test was inversely associate to the incidence of herpes zoster,

67
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:45,070
the severity of skin lesions, severity of pain, and the occurrence of host post hepatic neuralgia but is not associated with a virus at a virus.

68
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,630
Specific humor immunity.

69
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:58,500
So in future we hope that more effective cell to a vaccine and a immunization protocol to prevent herpes zoster would be provided.

70
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:08,980
And in the end, I would like to acknowledge the corroborating medical organizations and the dry age for science research.

71
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:16,210
So as end of my presentation as thank you or do you have any questions?

72
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:38,269
Thank you, Dr. Yang, for an interesting presentation. Now, with the with the vaccines that we use for shingles, viruses,

73
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:45,590
they're typically approved in trials on the basis of developing commercial instead of science.

74
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,120
Does that does does this data make you concerned about how we're evaluating?

75
00:10:53,780 --> 00:11:04,470
Thank you for a question that I do think that we need to develop vaccines that depend more on cell mediated immunity other than

76
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:17,700
other than or with HUMA immunity to be more more efficient for more efficient to prevent the zoster or herpes zoster that shingles.

77
00:11:22,480 --> 00:13:42,030
Thank you. Thank you. Okay.

78
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,569
Okay. Anything? All right.

79
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:41,560
So the goal for today is I wanted to talk through some basics on understanding enteroviruses and rhinoviruses sort of as a group of viruses.

80
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:51,070
But then I'm going to quickly shift into I'm going to go through some of the history of how how kind of the global we,

81
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:57,580
the scientific community, started to study how respiratory viruses transmit and how rhinoviruses transmit transmitted.

82
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:07,180
So there is I mean, this continues today. There is continues to be debate as to whether rhinoviruses transmit,

83
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:16,360
transmit through direct contact or through either any sort of air aerosol droplet, any kind of air mediated contact.

84
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,909
Um, so these are adenovirus is rhinoviruses.

85
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:31,130
Both belong to the coronavirus. They prepare in a variety as cold as such, the pico is small and RNA itself.

86
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,090
This is a small RNA virus coronavirus.

87
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:43,870
It is very small, it's a spherical virion, it is non enveloped and it consists solely of a protein shell and an RNA genome.

88
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:49,870
It does not encompass any other pieces as it as it assembles and replicates.

89
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:57,670
It is a single stranded, positive RNA can be highly mutable, highly variable.

90
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,980
And with that type of a genome, this virus replicates in the cytoplasm,

91
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:18,550
it does use RNA dependent RNA polymerase as part of the replication process, replicates in the cytoplasm of virus and creates new pro variants.

92
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:23,410
Depending on the processing phase, they kind of get assembled together and then released set of cells.

93
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:37,980
Now Enteroviruses typically used to be classified as polio viruses, perfectly viruses and echo viruses with echo viruses not being human viruses.

94
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:44,640
This original classification had to do with basically what syndromes they caused and what they look like in the lab.

95
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,130
Now, you know,

96
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:56,490
enterovirus is in rhinoviruses were one of the first groups of viruses to really undergo a taxonomy shift based solely on genomic similarities.

97
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:06,030
So we went from this way of classifying the coronaviruses with very laboratory heavy methods into now

98
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:12,570
we just look to see what kind of what kind of identity they have with all of these rules about level,

99
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:18,840
composition, similarity and things like that. And that caused the classification of the enteroviruses.

100
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,350
What this did, though, when they did this do classification,

101
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:28,410
they actually took viruses that previously weren't enteroviruses that ended up becoming enteroviruses.

102
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:37,850
So rhinovirus when we get there, there are rhinoviruses that ended up being renamed as enteroviruses.

103
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:44,729
So, you know, these are so the subtypes.

104
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:51,959
Basically antivirals used to be enterovirus 71 and a rose be used to be October 17.

105
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,630
Anybody see includes then one of the coxsackievirus and polio viruses.

106
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:10,050
One, two and three. We're going to talk about polio virus. Remember next Wednesday and then Enterovirus D became enterovirus 68 or EV-D68.

107
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:19,800
EV-D68 is what it used to be. So you can sort of see how this like matching happened between the segments and with the

108
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,750
new lab labels right here say these are the new right here and these are the old labels.

109
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:33,780
And then during this classification, it also emerged that there was a segment of rhinovirus types that were molecularly defined

110
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,950
but not not discovered in cell culture that didn't fall into any of the other categories.

111
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:45,080
So they were sort of this new group of rhinoviruses that was invented or categorized about ten years ago.

112
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,700
So enterovirus well,

113
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:56,820
but the reason why these rhinovirus numbers get so high in the original classification

114
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,740
system is because the way that they used to classify rhinovirus is remember we just.

115
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,940
I just told you about Sara using serology detection of viruses.

116
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,979
So you set up a cell culture and you see if serum blocks it and they have these panels of

117
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,790
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of sera of people that had been previously infected.

118
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:22,260
And you would order one of these panels and you would type rhinovirus by doing a cell culture and seeing if one specimen one blocked it.

119
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,630
No. Because blood specimen to block it.

120
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:32,069
No, just blood specimen three to block it now and then you get to the right number that blocks the serum or blocks the replication reaction,

121
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,080
and that's how you figure out what number it was.

122
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:44,010
So 89 is they tested 89 samples or 89 different sera to find the one that blocked the the cell culture.

123
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:52,490
Progression. So enterovirus characteristics, we see transmission through fecal oral.

124
00:19:53,540 --> 00:20:02,869
We also see transmission through respiratory droplets. As I mentioned, there is usually also a contact mediated pathway through respiratory droplets.

125
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:10,340
So the the debate is, is that a respiratory droplet that you breathe into your airway like we see with other respiratory viruses,

126
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:16,100
or is it a respiratory droplet where there's sort of goo just deposited on a surface and

127
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:21,080
you self inoculate yourself that way by kind of touching the girl and her jaw mucosa.

128
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:29,060
So better hygiene and this is we'll look at this when we talk about polio viruses.

129
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,960
What we've seen throughout history is that better hygiene hygiene leads to just decreased exposure in young kids,

130
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,870
which means that as that happens, as a community, Hannah has a hygiene shift.

131
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:46,040
You actually have an upward aged shift in the age at which primary infection occurs.

132
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,930
We actually just described a really extreme example of that happening, right.

133
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:57,380
We have extreme hygiene or whatever, extreme prevention of infection and the youngest kids.

134
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:04,130
And so now we're seeing them encounter their first RSV infection when they're two or three years old instead of when they're six months old.

135
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:12,470
So you can kind of see how that's happened in different times throughout history that if we if we delay infection through preventative measures,

136
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:21,230
we have an upper age shift. Now, Enteroviruses often have a higher severity when infections happen for the first time later in life.

137
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:25,400
If you are older at the time of your prior infection, you have a higher severity.

138
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:32,030
And so what will sometimes happen is that interventions end up looking like they're causing

139
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:37,070
more disease because you're getting older people that are infected at a higher severity level,

140
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,400
depending on what you would do if you're looking at kind of a bigger time scale.

141
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,960
And our viruses are very stable in the environment, the resistance will be acid coming disinfectants.

142
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,290
Lipid solvents do not work because they don't have an envelope,

143
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,320
but they can be inactivated by temperature and UV light, surface drying or stronger chemicals.

144
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,360
So Enteroviruses has a big class.

145
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:09,060
We see things from acute flaccid paralysis or acute flaccid myo myelitis.

146
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,440
We see gastroenteritis, meningitis, viral illness.

147
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,450
We'll also see some types causing respiratory illness or pneumonia.

148
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,500
And you also see types in this class that cause multiple syndromes.

149
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,430
So even EV-D68 can cause respiratory illness.

150
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:35,150
It can also cause acute flaccid myelitis. And so, you know, you see multiple syndromes with these.

151
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,589
So notable enteroviruses polio virus.

152
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:43,910
We'll get into more detail later. 88, 71.

153
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:51,150
This is what causes hand, foot and mouth disease or like the bane of the existence of child care providers, that genetic risk.

154
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:59,329
And because it's got this mix of contact transmission and droplet transmission and fomite transmission,

155
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:03,200
like once it's in a child care, everybody's going to get it right because it's spread.

156
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:13,940
It's taking in. Probably take advantage of multiple modes of transmission. IBD 68 has this every other year pattern of spikes that we see in kids.

157
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:22,100
I'll show you. Badia. This actually used to be Rhinovirus 87, but during some historical reclassifications it ended up being recalled.

158
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:27,080
EV-D68 was funny when it first EV-D68 first emerged.

159
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:33,830
There were some very senior people in the field that remembered that reclassification and it had to be like, Hang on, everybody.

160
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:39,440
This used to be rhinovirus 87. We actually have prior data on this virus when after the reemergence.

161
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,139
So it was a picture of a young of hand, foot and mouth disease.

162
00:23:45,140 --> 00:24:01,590
So causing kind of a rash presentation here. Except around here.

163
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:11,249
So enterovirus D68 is important to be aware of the it is a respiratory illness throughout

164
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:19,260
our 87 and the first outbreak of 68 that was really notable was in the fall of 20 1415.

165
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:26,610
And this was the this was a reemergence of the previously known virus for some reason took hold and started spreading in really big ways.

166
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,330
It was causing particularly severe respiratory disease, especially in people who had a history of asthma or wheezing.

167
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:42,150
And the molecular tests at the time were testing for a broad rhino splash and arrow primer set

168
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:48,000
at one cancer premise that they could pick up many types of rhinoviruses and inner ear viruses.

169
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,540
And that was like by design. There are so many types of rhinovirus.

170
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:57,420
You need a pretty conserved primer set to make sure you're getting as many of them in one test as you can.

171
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:06,060
The problem is, when this virus reemerged, it looked like a big wave of rhinovirus and nobody knew how much was EV-D68 and how much was rhinovirus.

172
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,330
And there was a lot of people that sort of jump to the conclusion.

173
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:20,040
Then all of rhino entero detections in the community must have been these massive EV-D68 outbreaks, this kind of this time of year.

174
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:26,220
It's like in the fall when school was starting and a major, major alarm set off.

175
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:39,870
At the same time, there were there started to be reports of acute flaccid mellitus linked to people that are children that were infected with EV-D68.

176
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:46,080
And the problem was you have a really common virus, but a really rare syndrome linked to that virus.

177
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,830
It's very difficult to do that causal question. Right.

178
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,400
Does EV-D68 cause AFM? And what's the association?

179
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:59,850
So there were it took a little while before the initial case control studies came out to really kind of piece that together.

180
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:11,969
But it there definitely is an association there and we do see AFM changing with the seasonality AFM patterns from AFM surveillance in the US.

181
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:19,710
Now follow the lead 68 patterns. If you look at the surveillance data, I'm going to skip over the case definition for AFM,

182
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,229
but you can see this is the surveillance state afraid of them and you can see it's got

183
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:33,110
this every other year pattern happening that also follows the CVD 68 pattern every other.

184
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:41,580
So basically every even numbered fall we have EV-D68 and I believe 2020 we didn't have it, but then this year it's back.

185
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,579
So here is some data from the case control study.

186
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,050
I'm going to skip over this,

187
00:26:50,820 --> 00:27:01,350
but just kind of introduce quickly the fact that they've got this is negative for any enterovirus and all rhinovirus subtypes.

188
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:09,240
This is the EBV 68 positive subtypes and here are all of the other rhinovirus that

189
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:13,110
reverses that fell into that other category that were being detected by the assays.

190
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:20,220
As you can see, there is this shift towards the AFM cases being in the immediate 68 positive category.

191
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:25,620
So this is one of the very earliest phase controls and it was interesting at the time.

192
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:34,260
This is a sign from my daughter's elementary school that was posted at the door about precautions you should take from your kid,

193
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,710
giving it 68 because of the fairly high level of concern.

194
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:50,070
And however, it also causes a very high we learned very early what the what the what scientific reporting looks like in an emerging virus situation.

195
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:55,230
Going to read this at a 34 people from the state of Michigan tested for the infection by CDC.

196
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:04,120
25 cases have been confirmed. Most of Michigan's 68 cases have led to hospitalization, according to NBC.

197
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,830
It as good epidemiologists who are about to take it.

198
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,060
619. What's what is wrong with this sentence?

199
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,920
You don't know who they tested or why. Yes, you are totally missing a day, that denominator.

200
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:25,460
You basically have a whole bunch of people that are hospitalized for a case definition that reflects EVD 68.

201
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,240
But you don't know all of the other non severe cases that are out there.

202
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,340
You're completely missing at the nominator. The same thing happened with COVID, actually,

203
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:43,129
with the with the vaccine once but once the real world effectiveness of the COVID vaccine started coming out and they'd say,

204
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:49,850
like, wow, everybody in this community, everybody hospitalized for COVID 19, this community has been vaccinated.

205
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,720
But it was a highly vaccinated community where everyone has been vaccinated like you need the other.

206
00:28:54,710 --> 00:29:00,950
If you think about this as a two by two table, you're missing at least two squares.

207
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,780
I think you're missing you really kind of think three squares. But yeah.

208
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:18,350
And then interestingly, so we did actually we did a study at the same time where we look to see how much of it was EV-D68, how much was in rhinovirus.

209
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,809
And remember, there were all these like posters that started this figure.

210
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:24,920
There's posters all over my daughter's school saying about how EV-D68 was spreading.

211
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:33,200
And it turns out once we actually molecularly typed all of the specimens from the children's hospital and then from the cohort study,

212
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:38,899
it was actually a big outbreak of rhinovirus C that was happening, not EV-D68,

213
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:43,790
but because it was being picked up by this conserved test, everybody assumed it was even D68.

214
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,800
It actually shut down the like six and under recommended soccer.

215
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:56,450
So you can kind of see you can see a little bit of EBV, 68 taper off here.

216
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:59,600
And then here's this big yellow with this big rhinovirus outbreak.

217
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:04,880
So, okay, so let's talk more about what is rhinovirus.

218
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:09,650
So rhinovirus is a it's an RNA capsid virus.

219
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:18,530
They are highly diverse. They have newly defined types that are emerging or have always been around but are now kind of

220
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:25,520
identified that we have good molecular techniques to do so because they're so high frequency.

221
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,510
There's a lot of difficulty in associating rhinovirus with what it causes.

222
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,970
So we know that rhinovirus causes the common cold.

223
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:39,860
Sometimes there are when there's emerging types, there are debates about whether rhinovirus also causes like asthma or wheezing or pneumonia.

224
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:46,390
In certain groups. There are kind of more reports that in people, you know.

225
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,510
So rhinovirus historically in the virology world has been the virus that

226
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:55,340
everybody ignores because it doesn't really just cause the cold and get over it.

227
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,769
But there is a lot more data saying that the people that were immuno compromised

228
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:04,220
or people are older could actually have very severe infections of rhinovirus.

229
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:09,890
So this is just an example to show how incredibly diverse this group of viruses is.

230
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:18,710
I mean, is skip over this. This is just talking about asthma, asthma, reactivation with rhinovirus.

231
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:24,979
And I'm going to jump into talking about transmission examples.

232
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:35,330
So rhinovirus because so rhinovirus is a very early target for this priority of trying to figure out both how the virus is spread,

233
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,420
but also if we could get rid of the common cold,

234
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,870
if we could get rid of like rhinovirus is causing sixties and then 70% of the illnesses that are happening.

235
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:54,260
Like when you look at when I look at my surveillance data from the the big studies that we do when we shut down for COVID stuff,

236
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,819
rhinovirus just kept going like every all the other viruses went away.

237
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:02,540
Rhinovirus is good, but it causes so much of the common cold.

238
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:07,400
And so if you think about bird in in terms of missed work, the school missed day care just feeling sick.

239
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:13,310
It actually has a really huge burden on society, even though it's not causing that many hospitalizations or deaths.

240
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,750
So very early on there was this idea, if we can get rid of rhinovirus, we're just going to be so healthy.

241
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:24,560
And so it was a really super fast target.

242
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:31,730
So this is a paper from 1968 in the American Journal of Epidemiology, and this is a first paper.

243
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:41,780
So at this point, they're detecting rhinovirus by looking at those antibody tests that I just described, those big panel tests that basically and say,

244
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:48,950
okay, when the study starts among people who don't have antibodies, how many people had antibodies by the time the study ended?

245
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:51,160
And using antibody conversion to do detection,

246
00:32:51,800 --> 00:33:01,100
then what they found was if you were to categorize people by the number of people that they sleep in the same bedroom with,

247
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,650
then you've got a lot more people that are infected with rhinovirus at the end

248
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,500
of the study compared to the beginning of this study as good epidemiologist.

249
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,920
So you now see that there should be some clustering like this isn't really a.

250
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:20,940
Good thing for a chi square test, but you can visually see that you've got, you know,

251
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:28,560
basically more rhinovirus infections happening by more crowded matters than less rhinovirus infections.

252
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:36,270
So basically this idea that something is transmitting somehow in these close contacts.

253
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:44,060
So how was it transmitting as it transmitted through the air or is it transmitting through cellphone accusation?

254
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:49,400
You can imagine if you're sharing a bedroom, you can touch a contaminated surface and you can self inoculate yourself.

255
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:56,960
Right. So the next big study to come out was in 1973.

256
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:02,530
And this is a study that they did actually three different arms of this study.

257
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,910
And I need to pull up my notes because the study always.

258
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:12,990
So they have an arm of the study where he enroll a bunch of State Farm Insurance employees and families,

259
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,460
and they watch to see who gets infected during cold and flu season.

260
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,970
They have a second arm of the study where they have healthy volunteers.

261
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:27,530
And this is where I'm going to end you just the idea that we're going to talk about the rest of this lecture.

262
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:34,630
They experimentally infect that and with rhinovirus and then they have a third.

263
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:43,250
It gets worse, but they then a third. The study where they have secret observation, where it's cold medicine or how much knows picking an IRA.

264
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:47,590
This is like a very early version of like building a model, right.

265
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,800
So that they know how much natural infection happens in regular.

266
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,310
They know what happens if they experimentally infect people,

267
00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:01,070
and then they know how often self and population could potentially happen in these different groups.

268
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,920
And so this is what the data looks like.

269
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,550
So in the Natural Infection Group, so also you could get an American journal or was this so this is a New Englander.

270
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:20,150
Yeah, you can give me like a journal paper with four cases. Joe Adams So you've got he's one, three, three, four.

271
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:26,840
And then so basically they were showing first in the natural infection cases, the people that got infected rhinovirus,

272
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:34,459
they've got more rhinovirus in their nose than they do in other body sets, throat, saliva and then cough.

273
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:41,920
So they were having them cough to the experimental infection people.

274
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:51,440
What they did with these people and they took their they basically had them touch contaminated rhinovirus

275
00:35:51,440 --> 00:36:00,780
surfaces and then they they asked them to touch their their eyes and nose and mouth and like ECOSOC.

276
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,599
And they also asked them they asked them to do it.

277
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:12,709
And then they asked them to do different activities like study or eat supper and then study to sort of see like

278
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:22,160
how many people ended up getting infected after one hour and 2 hours and the eventually not even infected.

279
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:32,399
But like where were they able to recover the virus from? So under macho.

280
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,340
So then this is the third arm of the study where they were just like, okay,

281
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:41,070
so now we're pretty sure that touching virus and touching yourself has the capability to cause an infection.

282
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,760
How much does touching your own mucosa happen in real life?

283
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:50,490
So the Whitney monitored grad rounds at a medical school and then they when they monitored somebody's

284
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:57,150
Sunday school visit and and they calculated a rate of how often people touch their own noses or eyes.

285
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:07,680
So all right. So then this sort of sets up this paradigm that says, now, this is very good evidence that you're in control of this paradigm,

286
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,180
say, rhinovirus, probably spreading and people touching it and then touching their own mucosa.

287
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,710
So still sort of some questions here.

288
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,540
And so in 1978,

289
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:27,420
a piece this is actually a report about a report that actually reported the studies in a book that I've never been able to get access to.

290
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:38,729
But this is a review that was written about whether rhinovirus transmits through the air or through self inoculation.

291
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:49,680
One, if by air to it by hand, is what it's titled. And so they talk here about a couple of the experiments that have been tried for this.

292
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:55,440
And I'm going to read this to you on the right side. That what, Sir Christopher Andrews of the Common Cold Research Unit,

293
00:37:55,590 --> 00:38:01,560
the Chemical Research Unit, actually still exists in Salisbury, England, in one heroic study.

294
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:06,270
He marooned 12 volunteers on a deserted island off the coast of England.

295
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:14,790
The island was just the island was described as just over a mile long and less than a mile wide, surrounded by fairly steep cliffs.

296
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:25,919
After a two month isolation, the volunteers were then exposed to persons from the outside who had been challenged experimentally with a cold virus.

297
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,520
Inoculum.

298
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:35,670
Dr. Andrews designed the experiment to investigate to impossible not to spread dry, coarse droplets and basically short range and long range droplets.

299
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:44,250
So he marooned 12 people on an island for two months to make sure that they weren't infected with anything else.

300
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:52,290
I mean, we all know now that that's unlikely to happen. And and then he experimentally infected two people and sent it to the islands and told them to

301
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:57,990
interact with the people from varied distances to try to figure out what to do with the virus.

302
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:03,420
But what happened was and this is a big challenge with human genome studies, even today in real life,

303
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:11,640
the two people that got said never met said they did board an island and lie to school.

304
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,950
Experiment failed. So what did they play next?

305
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,799
This is where actually I've heard still around. Okay.

306
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,330
So now we're looking at a actually, this is late sixties.

307
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,910
This is 69. So this is about the same period of time.

308
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:40,860
And this is a different group at Baylor that so they were they were actually studying coxsackievirus specifically not not focused on rhinoviruses.

309
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:49,930
And what they did was set up an experiment where you've got these are essentially a military style barracks.

310
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,640
I do actually don't remember if this was done in a lot of these studies were done in the military.

311
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,460
I don't know if this particular one was or not. They just used a military cell there.

312
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:02,550
So right here is they like this dotted line.

313
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:10,770
This is a fence that separates two sides of people that are living and essentially congregate setting on this side.

314
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:16,320
Every guy is a person that's been experimentally infected with Coxsackievirus.

315
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:23,030
They're all living on this side. So you have about half of the people have an experimental effect and half of people haven't.

316
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:31,500
And then on this side, you've got a whole bunch of people with no experimentally infected people living on this side of the barracks.

317
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:39,750
And you've got this group right here. So the study was to see, do these people end up getting in?

318
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,780
Well, so do these people are getting infected. But if any of these susceptible people get infected, it could be contact transmission.

319
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:51,270
Right. They're living in the same space or it could be aerosol transmission if these people get infected.

320
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:54,660
It's definitely aerosol transmission. There's no contract possible.

321
00:40:54,660 --> 00:41:04,770
There's two fences between these two groups of people. Right. They also have various and they're going to get into it in a lot of detail.

322
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:12,770
But they basically they all have big fans and they're shifting the airflow to blow it out of the infected air from these people through that,

323
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:16,950
they get these people right. So what happened?

324
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:25,860
So they have these initial people right here.

325
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:33,750
They were inoculated by aerosol. So they basically were experimentally inoculated and sprayed virus into their nose without hands.

326
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:51,060
And then you see in this tough side that you've got all of these exposures with subsequent infections happening on the right side and then you've got.

327
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:59,760
So basically three out of ten of your. So you have ten inoculated volunteers with Coxsackievirus.

328
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I'm actually going to pivot from Coxsackievirus and tell you what happened with Rhinovirus during this time period.

329
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:11,669
So it turned out that three out of the ten volunteers that were inoculated with

330
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:15,690
Coxsackievirus also had a different rhinovirus infection at the same time.

331
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:20,250
So they didn't they weren't like clean slate donors, right?

332
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:24,840
So they've got very scant rhinovirus. Three out of ten of them do.

333
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:30,629
And so what happens was eight out of ten of the people on site,

334
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:36,540
they were exposed at the same time and that getting and becoming positive for coronavirus.

335
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:43,919
But then also five out of 19 people. And side B, they also end up being exposed to rhinovirus.

336
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,920
And then they were looking for rhinovirus at 21 years. And then you see here, here, here.

337
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:57,840
So you've got here very clean evidence that you've got aerosol transmission of rhinovirus.

338
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:03,360
Right. They were not. It was the same type of rhinovirus happening.

339
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:08,370
You see a delay in when you have people start being positive for rhinovirus after

340
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:12,780
these initial positives and you have people on the other side of society get infected.

341
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,770
So this is happening like late 1960s.

342
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:29,910
Still some still some debate about whether whether or not this was truly an aerosol only pathway happening.

343
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:37,860
So this led to the card playing says that these are very famous studies in the field of virus epidemiology.

344
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:43,660
Most transmission people can tell you exactly like how the protocol worked for the card playing studies.

345
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:49,690
So this in this was kind of the end of the line. This is like the definitive study.

346
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:57,450
So what they did is they noticed that this young man has braces up and down on the right.

347
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:04,590
So they experimentally infected. They basically would experimentally infect individuals.

348
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:11,220
And then they would have them play a card game with people who were uninfected to see if it transmitted during the card game.

349
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:19,320
But in order to try to get rid of close range droplet transmission versus contact.

350
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,330
Kind of lack of clarity,

351
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:28,830
they basically stopped people from doing self inoculation behavior by putting their arms in these braces that they couldn't touch their own face.

352
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,530
So what they ended up doing, there were a bunch of different phases to this experiment.

353
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:44,220
They they do a so they have some people wear the restraining device during the experiment.

354
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:51,750
They have some people not wear the restraining device. They actually actually are going to go to the next slide and show you.

355
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:59,249
So if experience A, B and C, the experimentally infected band played cards uninfected, then for 12 hours,

356
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:06,090
which is a very high level, all the infected men who are restrained, half of the uninfected then more restrained.

357
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:12,540
So what they're trying to get at here is does cell signal that actually should matter on the donor side or the susceptible side?

358
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:18,029
Like who's inoculating? Is it the person infected person putting virus out into the environment or is

359
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:21,130
it more about grabbing virus from the environment and putting that itself?

360
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:32,430
So A, B and C, overall transmission rates were 92% in A, 50% in B and 42% in.

361
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:38,340
Seen sort of different variations and how they did that for Experiment D,

362
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:45,120
they took all of the items from Experiment C and they move them into a second room.

363
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:51,750
So these are all items that had been contaminated during the 12 hours of card playing with infected people,

364
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:59,570
moved to the second room and then 12 new people came in and played cards with it.

365
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:04,500
But they were actually this is the opposite of the braces they're encouraged to have hand to face every 15 minutes.

366
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:07,860
So they are playing cards with the security cards.

367
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:12,920
And every 15 minutes they were supposed to rub their you see what happens.

368
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:22,860
And 0% of them got infected after spending 12 hours with the contaminated stuff that had just been moved from the previous room.

369
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:28,600
Right. So think about like I think it's so fascinating to sort of think about this.

370
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:35,429
I mean, this experiment was in the eighties. Think about all this conversations that were happening when SARS-CoV-2 emerged like, what is it?

371
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:37,320
I do? I wash microbes, that sort of stuff.

372
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:44,050
And think about like essentially people were like real life trying to, in their mind, build these frameworks, right?

373
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,610
If we're in a room. But I don't touch my face. But you touch your face.

374
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:52,680
Right. And they were actually used experimental infections to actually play on all of these in scenarios.

375
00:46:53,590 --> 00:47:00,569
And so it definitely gave us a lot of like understanding on how transmission works in terms

376
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:05,220
of droplet transmission and air versus aerosol transmission versus fomite transmission.

377
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:10,050
These are still like some of the most important studies historically and defining that.

378
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:18,720
However, it did not li I mean, the purpose one of the purposes for doing this was to lead to an art, to a rhinovirus vaccine.

379
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:24,360
Rhinovirus vaccine is one of the major vaccine targets at the time, but at the more of this work that they did,

380
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:30,929
the more was realized that there are so many different rhinoviruses and you can have these coincident infections and you don't

381
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:37,980
get cross-protection between the types that developing a virus or a vaccine that was going to protect against all the types.

382
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:44,870
It's still considered pretty out of range, the vaccine technology. But but now we understand how this translates.

383
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:55,920
So when I was in Atlanta a couple of weeks ago, I actually went to the unit in Emory where they're continuing to do human challenge trials,

384
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:01,210
and they were kind of marking up a space to be able to do it's in the same unit.

385
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:04,560
I brought pictures. I'll show I want to do the Ebola lecture.

386
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,630
It's the same unit where the first Ebola case in they in the U.S. was cared for.

387
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:17,610
It's a it's a unit where they're going to be able to do some of these redo some of these transmission studies, like in a minor context there.

388
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:24,420
And it's interesting. Because the whole unit is encased inside a secondary container inside the hospital.

389
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:28,780
Like you go into the house and it looks like you've just moved from one end of the hospital

390
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:34,380
and you actually move from like a totally plausible container from the main hospital.

391
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:37,760
So if they needed you, they could just lock down the or sector.

392
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:42,120
It's super interesting. It has has the biggest autoclave of seen.

393
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,970
But. All right. And then they took so much time that you don't really have much time for your workshop.

394
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,120
Why don't we rather than having you split into groups.

395
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:59,190
Why don't we move the work we'll do rift. Rift Valley fever.

396
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:06,360
You've already read it. Let's discuss it as part of next week's time.

397
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:13,770
And I think we can wrap up here, but I can. Any questions or experiments that you that you would like to do?

398
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:23,430
Yeah, there is. What became the common cold unit in the UK is now an experimental infection unit where

399
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:27,960
they do a lot of like antiviral studies and vaccine settings and things like that.

400
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:34,560
A lot of like college age students I think.

401
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:35,820
You. Yeah.
