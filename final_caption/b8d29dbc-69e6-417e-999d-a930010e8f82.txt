1
00:00:05,916 --> 00:00:11,273
So thinking about your audience is the
first step of any communication effort.

2
00:00:11,273 --> 00:00:13,740
And I wanna be really clear here.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,500
I mean it when I say first step.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,100
This comes before your
thinking about the content.

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,790
Often what happens is people start by
thinking, okay, I need to communicate x.

6
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:31,346
And they get focused on the specific facts
or messages they need to communicate.

7
00:00:31,346 --> 00:00:33,620
And they're not even thinking
about anything else.

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,140
They're not even thinking
about their audience.

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,120
If you really wanna do this right, if you
really wanna be successful, you have to

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:46,150
start by considering who and why you're
communicating with your audience.

11
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:51,480
How you should think about your audience
depends on understanding the person,

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,720
or the community, or the set of people,
who you're trying to reach.

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,411
The situation or context.

14
00:00:59,411 --> 00:01:00,610
Where are they gonna be?

15
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:05,440
How are they gonna be thinking or feeling
as they're interacting with your message?

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,290
And your goals.

17
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,660
Now, when we go through the audience,

18
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,550
there's a variety of questions
you ought to be asking yourself.

19
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,490
The first one is, what is the audience's
common or salient characteristics?

20
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,140
What are the things that we need
to remember about the audience?

21
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,810
This could be demographics.

22
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:31,200
It could be, I want to reach out
to teens in a high school setting,

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,730
where this community is predominantly,
let's say Latino.

24
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,060
And I might have a different
communication goal.

25
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,330
Where, let's say I'm trying to
reach out to older adults who

26
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:51,270
are needing to think about
influenza vaccination, let's say.

27
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,190
So the common characteristic
there is their age, and

28
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,850
perhaps their health status.

29
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,630
But remember, sometimes the common or
salient characteristic isn't something so

30
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,190
much about the physical person, right?

31
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,820
It isn't their demographics, it might be
their professional or their background.

32
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,398
All right, so
the common characteristic might be,

33
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:17,300
these are people in a community who is
being affected by a natural disaster.

34
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,060
And it's that common location
that's the common characteristic.

35
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:29,160
Or these are, let's say, nurses who
are going through a professional education

36
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,670
about, I don't know, cultural competency.

37
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,210
Again, in that context,
the common thread is these are nurses, and

38
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:45,310
so that common professional background
is the salient characteristic.

39
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,890
And then lastly,
maybe sometimes it's just the situation.

40
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:52,570
These are all people who've been
exposed to an infectious disease.

41
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:57,940
Or these are all people who are at
the same conference on, let's say,

42
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,320
infectious diseases.

43
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,460
Whatever that situation is, even if
these people come from wildly different

44
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,270
backgrounds, if that's the common
characteristic, then that's the anchor

45
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:13,570
that you can use to shape your
communication and to reach the audience.

46
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,300
Now, when we get into this,
we need to pause and

47
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,500
think about, are these people are going to
be interested in what I'm communicating?

48
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,810
And I wanna talk about a distinction
between two different kinds of

49
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,980
communications.

50
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,660
The first one here is what
I'll call pull communications.

51
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:34,030
The audience is already
interested in this topic.

52
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,540
And so
what we need to communicate with them

53
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,950
is to give them a reference communication.

54
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,800
Something they can reference.

55
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,802
They can go back to to get
the information they need.

56
00:03:44,802 --> 00:03:49,524
Because they're already interested, so
they're already going to be looking for

57
00:03:49,524 --> 00:03:50,880
whatever it is we need.

58
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,632
The classic example of a reference
communication is like the frequently asked

59
00:03:55,632 --> 00:03:58,580
questions pages on websites.

60
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:03,520
I have a question, I go looking for
it, I'm pulling the information.

61
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,520
So all we need to do from a design
standpoint is make it easy for

62
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,350
people to find what it
is their looking for.

63
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,330
That's really different than what we
might call push communications, or

64
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,170
message communications.

65
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,620
These are situations where
the audience is not yet interested.

66
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,810
They may have no idea that this
topic is of relevance to them,

67
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,080
or they may not have their attention yet
focused to it.

68
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,810
They may know that they're
interested in it, but

69
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,500
they haven't engaged with this idea or
this topic yet.

70
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,810
In those kinds of situations, we,
we the communicators, have a goal.

71
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,170
But we also need to consider their goals,
too.

72
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,780
We have to negotiate
a relationship between our goals,

73
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,200
our information, and
what the audience needs.

74
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,430
And so the design of message
communications is really

75
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,390
quite different than the design
of reference communication.

76
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,610
Now what's the context here?

77
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,250
You might think it wouldn't matter,
but it really does, right?

78
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:13,200
I can design a communication differently
when I'm only talking to a couple people.

79
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,220
Versus when I have to give
the exact same message to hundreds,

80
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,930
maybe thousands, maybe millions of people.

81
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,880
And, what's the context in terms of when
and how will people interact with it?

82
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:33,680
Is this a TV ad, it's gonna be interacted
with while people are watching shows?

83
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,291
Is this a presentation at a particular
conference, or maybe at a community

84
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:44,820
meeting, or maybe it's a one-on-one
interaction, a conversation?

85
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,040
Either way,
knowing that context is really important.

86
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,870
Now, when we know who it is we're relating
to, and where we're relating to them,

87
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,640
then we can think about
the audience-related barriers.

88
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,822
And there's many of these barriers,
but there's two or

89
00:05:57,822 --> 00:05:59,690
one I wanna emphasize in particular.

90
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,810
First one is attention, right?

91
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,508
You might be sitting right in front of me,
but if you're looking at your phone,

92
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:07,430
[SOUND], what?

93
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,770
The message is gone.

94
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,100
So that's just not gonna work.

95
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,920
You have to think about, how am I
going to capture somebody's attention?

96
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,620
That could be a big deal when you've
got 100 people in front of you.

97
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,629
It could be a big deal when you're handing
somebody a brochure and you're not

98
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:29,930
sure whether they're going to read it or
they're just gonna throw it away.

99
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,190
Either way, being conscience of,
how can I get the audience's attention,

100
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,950
is an important question to ask.

101
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,860
And then the second one, comprehension.

102
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,400
Are they gonna understand it?

103
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,400
That we have good words, pictures?

104
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,168
What's the design that we need to think
of that's gonna overcome this barrier and

105
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:53,490
make sure that they can understand it?

106
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,340
So this is quote from a research
colleague of mine that I just

107
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,040
love when I think about reaching
out to different audiences.

108
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,140
We need to design for the way people are,
not the way we wish they were.

109
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,210
And the way I think this
is really important is,

110
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:14,920
I wish I could just make this course
like an encyclopedia of facts.

111
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,170
I would just, here's a fact, here's
another fact, here's another fact, and

112
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:23,400
you would just absorb them all, and
it would all make sense and I'd be done.

113
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,890
But you don't work that way,
and I don't work that way.

114
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:32,888
We have limits on our attention,
on how much we can absorb at a given time.

115
00:07:32,888 --> 00:07:39,860
We have differences, so that what works
for you might not work for somebody else.

116
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,680
If we take a step back as
communicators and think

117
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,586
that our goal is to meet people where
they are, not where we wish they were,

118
00:07:48,586 --> 00:07:53,920
then we are much more likely to be able
to achieve what we want to achieve.

119
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,670
Speaking of which,
what are we trying to achieve, right?

120
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:03,480
What are we trying to accomplish given the
person or population's characteristics?

121
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,590
Given the context or

122
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:10,580
the moment when this person's gonna
be interacting with our message?

123
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:16,150
So the real question is,
what is actually achievable?

124
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,760
Sometimes what's achievable is I
wanna give you some knowledge.

125
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,970
I wanna overcome a barrier.

126
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,670
You don't know this fact, and

127
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:29,060
as soon as you do know this fact,
your life will be better.

128
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,480
You will prevent some kind of disease.

129
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:38,050
You will know what you need to do in
a particular situation, whatever it is.

130
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:44,590
Sometimes, what's achievable is not so
much about knowledge, it's about beliefs.

131
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,690
I don't care that you remember some fact,

132
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:53,200
I care that you are motivated
to act in a particular way.

133
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,030
Or that you think that
something's important,

134
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,710
that you wanna learn more about it,
let's say.

135
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,780
Those kinds of beliefs sometimes
are our primary goals for

136
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,980
communications, even to
the exclusion of knowledge.

137
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,264
And being clear about whether
it's knowledge versus beliefs,

138
00:09:12,264 --> 00:09:14,950
what we're trying to get at,
is really important.

139
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:20,120
Sometimes our goal is direct compliance.

140
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:26,060
I want you to wear your eye safety
gear when you're in the lab.

141
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:32,220
I want you to throw away the contaminated
food that has been recalled.

142
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:39,120
I want you to make sure that you wear
your mask when you are in the hospital

143
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,160
meeting your clients because you are sick
and you don't want to infect them.

144
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,860
Whatever it is that we want to
ensure direct compliance about,

145
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:55,059
we can achieve that, but
only if we recognize that that's our goal.

146
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:59,687
And then, I'll be honest,
sometimes what's done is that we

147
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:05,360
communicate simply by just sort
of tossing information out there.

148
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,390
We make information available, but
we're not actually thinking about those

149
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:13,170
other three types of goals that
I was talking about earlier.

150
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,920
And the honest truth is, when all we're
doing is just disclosing information,

151
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:25,090
that rarely results in changes to beliefs,
to knowledge, or to behavior.

152
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:29,390
So it's not really an effective
communication, cuz there's no outcome.

153
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,310
There's no end point that
represents the excess.

154
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:36,875
The important point here is that
we do have to choose amongst

155
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,620
those other types of goals.

156
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,945
It's different when you're
focusing on that knowledge

157
00:10:42,945 --> 00:10:47,732
versus when you're focusing on that
compliance or you're focusing on beliefs.

158
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:54,410
So the key takeaway is, communication
is always about audience needs.

159
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:58,510
If you don't care about their needs,
why are you talking to them?

160
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:03,620
But if you don't know who
your audience is and when and

161
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,040
why they will interact with it,
it's really hard to meet their needs.

162
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,230
It's really hard to be
a successful communicator.

163
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:18,640
Therefore, it's a really simple
point here, be intentional.

164
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,150
Think about your audience,
think about your goals, so

165
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:26,886
that you can be
the communicator you wanna be.
