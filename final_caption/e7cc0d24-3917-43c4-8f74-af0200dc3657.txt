1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,980
Where did you get the.

2
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:21,810
So. Not only do we.

3
00:00:43,290 --> 00:01:01,729
Opportunity to interact with. Okay.

4
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,020
So there are some printed materials for these for today's lab.

5
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:13,610
And if you want some like feel free to grab two pages for this whole lab exercise.

6
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,089
And today we will practice,

7
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:29,209
identify mer self frequency in cohort studies and there are like around seven questions and I will give you 20 to 25 minutes

8
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:37,880
to go through these questions on your own first and then we will provide you with the answer for each of these questions.

9
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:47,450
And if if there are like around 15 minutes left, I think he can be served as an office hour.

10
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:57,830
Like if you want to ask something about midterm, I will stay here and answer your questions and you can also even email me your questions

11
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,800
privately so that I can just answer your questions without knowing who is asking the question.

12
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,140
Okay. So you can go ahead with these exercises.

13
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,590
Or it could just be.

14
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,400
I don't think you know that many guys.

15
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:06,380
I don't know. Before that, we just got a look at how many.

16
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:36,520
And. Got it.

17
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:44,190
By the time. I it's.

18
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:58,470
You're like. My parents had.

19
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:06,060
Body and body armor bodies.

20
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,310
University of Toronto.

21
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,490
Right. Yeah.

22
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,560
It's pretty interesting.

23
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,480
Yeah. Yeah.

24
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:53,190
My yeah, I get it all.

25
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:03,540
And we go to the people when they know I have my.

26
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:28,190
Well, roll. Well, let's see.

27
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:57,080
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know what I was gonna.

28
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:10,740
Like I said, I hope. I guess.

29
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:25,080
He. I.

30
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:40,310
And. He was just like, Oh, come on.

31
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,600
It's not reality. But it's six.

32
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:13,610
Oh. First.

33
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:27,570
You. Yeah.

34
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:40,480
But. I'm part. Yeah.

35
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,470
Yeah. Yeah.

36
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:58,610
I just, you know.

37
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:25,150
All right. You think you that?

38
00:08:39,480 --> 00:09:05,990
Well. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

39
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:18,830
I was working through the.

40
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:38,180
Correct can. No, I think.

41
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:52,760
I'm always. I. It just happened.

42
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,910
I have a private memory folder.

43
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:11,920
Mm hmm. Somebody I know.

44
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:22,870
I want you to listen to your mother because I. I know.

45
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:34,750
I know. I know. I to know.

46
00:10:49,660 --> 00:11:03,000
At the. You know it's going to.

47
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:29,580
About that, I mean. I was on the offensive.

48
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:40,830
Good for you. You always make me feel like.

49
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:47,960
Oh, yeah.

50
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,540
Yeah. I don't want to.

51
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:02,810
Are. I was.

52
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,440
I really can't do anything now. I'll try.

53
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:29,380
And there was a lot of criminal harassment arrests.

54
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:58,200
You don't. Oh.

55
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:06,680
It will be useful for you. Lions.

56
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:18,190
We're. To make them. You know.

57
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:41,330
Before Dr. Mary. One.

58
00:13:44,960 --> 00:14:00,010
Yeah, I guess. I'm using to keep.

59
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:28,240
The first. It was a lot easier.

60
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:51,380
So. Hi.

61
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,890
How you doing? Okay.

62
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,930
Yeah. Okay.

63
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:15,510
How many? I mean what?

64
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:23,830
Yeah. I mean, I was.

65
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:34,400
Yeah, I knew what it was like.

66
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:53,070
I was. You know, I don't know that kind of like the problem.

67
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:00,400
Yes. You can.

68
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:09,059
What are you doing?

69
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:17,910
Anything. I. And why would you want to do?

70
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:42,630
Over there we have. That's why.

71
00:16:55,190 --> 00:17:02,940
Know. Do you think you're going to do that?

72
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:28,210
Yeah. You can't trust these. You're asking.

73
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:58,520
How do we. But did you?

74
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:17,410
I strongly support. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

75
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:23,840
You know, you gotta.

76
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,260
So how did drop?

77
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:56,020
I think the picture is.

78
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:07,970
But. Yeah, but you were right.

79
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:24,320
So you just let it go.

80
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,370
Are you doing.

81
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:58,390
You either have to say that's very.

82
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:48,250
What is sense? I think sometimes you just have to wait for.

83
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:12,840
Mr. Yeah.

84
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:22,440
I was like, Oh, yeah.

85
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:32,660
Yeah. Feel like.

86
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:52,030
I like. These practices, for example.

87
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:08,320
I don't know. Oh, yeah.

88
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:28,590
Here. Now know what's going on.

89
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:48,790
Very. Yeah.

90
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:15,100
I to see.

91
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:52,910
I'm. I mean, I feel like, wow, maybe you don't really.

92
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,620
Yeah. Yeah.

93
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,720
People's opinions. Yeah.

94
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:26,690
Who's your job? Right? Yeah.

95
00:24:39,840 --> 00:25:04,880
Microsoft. So.

96
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:28,940
I never knew that. Two years.

97
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:46,770
Right. Think.

98
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:09,500
Okay. So let's get started to go through all these questions.

99
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:22,820
So for the first questions, any volunteers who like to try to answer whether you think it is all below

100
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:28,760
close cohort and exposure outcome and follow up and also there's a frequency.

101
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:57,990
Anyone in tears. I think the first one.

102
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:05,409
Can be relatively easy to recognize compared with other questions.

103
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:10,720
So. And no worries.

104
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,900
Actually, I don't think all these questions have like.

105
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:21,510
Defined, correct or wrong because. It?

106
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:28,709
Well, depends on your elders standing about disease yourself, your background, knowledge, and all those kind of things.

107
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:33,540
So feel free to discuss what you think.

108
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,390
Okay. So I will go through the first one.

109
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:55,190
So the first one is actually a close cohort because we are using already established database like Elex electronic

110
00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:05,420
house trackers and and people in these database are like they become member of this cohort during this period.

111
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:13,819
So after this period, nobody can can enter into this database, right?

112
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:20,480
So it's a close cohort. And I think one thing we need to know is that.

113
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:28,740
Like the how long the recruitment the recruitment period or I mean, the baseline lasts,

114
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:35,040
does it matter for whether it is a close cohort or it aids off open cohort?

115
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:43,560
Like even though like the recruitment toward the baseline last for two years but is still it is a close cohort.

116
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:49,250
And so the exposure would be.

117
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:55,300
As nice to you. Right. And because, like.

118
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:01,760
There are several categories of ethnicity, so it is the normal.

119
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:09,850
I'm a normal skill and type, exposure type.

120
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:20,720
So the type of the exposure is perfect because it is fixed because once a people,

121
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:31,760
a person is born with certain natives, ethnicity will change over time and the outcome is breast cancer mortality.

122
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:45,530
So whether the person died due to breast cancer, it is a binary outcome and is a time to event outcome because we care about like.

123
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:53,070
After a person develop breast cancer. How soon he died from from this disease.

124
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:06,510
And the follow up for members in this cohort will probably be called because.

125
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:13,069
One. One reason is because competing risk, right?

126
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:17,450
People can imagine people are diagnosed with breast cancer.

127
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:27,079
They can also I mean, before they were diagnosed with breast cancer, they can die from other signs.

128
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:32,750
So you probably won't observe whether the person is die from breast cancer.

129
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,700
And another thing is because the baseline period for the study lasts for two years.

130
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:47,210
So for people who joined who joined the like the health care organization in

131
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:55,009
1992 would have like two years more follow up than people who joined at 1994.

132
00:30:55,010 --> 00:31:11,920
I. And also because the follow up for this study last year, quite a long period of end to 2017.

133
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:19,610
So some some people may be lost to follow up between baseline and and follow up.

134
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:34,040
So for a close cohort like these, with any call for a lab, we would use Kaplan-Meier arrays to measure.

135
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,090
Frequency of the outcome, right? Um.

136
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:54,260
Yes. I think that's the answer for the first question. It seems a lot too bad you can grab this information from the prompt here.

137
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:04,530
So for the second. For the second question.

138
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:11,970
Any volunteers? Telstra.

139
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,390
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

140
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:30,660
Um. Mm hmm.

141
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:42,410
City. Changes are.

142
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:52,350
We were be more we. So any hospitality?

143
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:59,740
Mortality. Mm hmm.

144
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,470
And. Okay.

145
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:15,020
Do you think the exposure. Like what the scale of obesity would be a binary or continuous or nominal or whatever.

146
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,720
What is York? Growing options.

147
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:35,920
Binary, continuous, normal, or like even ordinal.

148
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,860
Okay. Thank you.

149
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:53,220
Thank you for, like, asking me on my behalf. Asking this on my behalf and.

150
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:03,500
Would anyone want to try to answer? What do you think the scale of the exposure obesity would be?

151
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:11,830
I said categorically. Hmm.

152
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:18,910
Okay. Yeah.

153
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:23,560
Actually, I think it makes sense to say it as our.

154
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:35,650
Already now, or maybe even continuous, because it depends on how you define obesity.

155
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:47,080
But in this specific scenario, we define we just categorize people as being a base or knowledge base.

156
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:54,040
So it's a binary outcome and we don't even need to know how we define a base or an obvious which as a.

157
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:59,920
Whether the person belonged to the obesity group or not obesity group.

158
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,320
So it's a binary outcome. And okay,

159
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:15,149
I think the actually these these cohort is a close cohort because it is kind of

160
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:22,559
similar like even if the admission of people into the baseline lasts for six months.

161
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:34,840
But once the people were admission into ICU during the six months, like his membership is fixed, like he will not not be lying to this cohort.

162
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:39,389
So that's why we see this is a close cohort because if if it is an open cohort,

163
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:46,650
it means like the president was admitted into the ICU during a six months, he will like some time.

164
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:57,010
Maybe move out of the ICU and not become a member of these cohort and then being

165
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:03,940
admitted into the ICU once again and then become one of the member of this cohort.

166
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:07,090
But I don't think that prompted this much information.

167
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:13,899
So we just think during the six month period, once somebody is admitted and he belonged to the cohort.

168
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,110
So this is are we we think this is a close cohort.

169
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:21,280
But again, I don't think there is a right or wrong.

170
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:31,059
Like you don't necessarily need to stick to what I said here, because it really depends on how you understand the question itself.

171
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:41,530
So. And we just said exposure, obesity, it would possibly say is a binary outcome.

172
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:47,439
And and it makes sense that obesity status can change over time.

173
00:36:47,440 --> 00:37:00,219
But in this prompt, because we only measure obesity at a single time point, that is a time as a baseline when patients were admitted into the ICU.

174
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,580
So always think it is a fixed up exposure.

175
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:17,700
And for the outcome. It is a binary outcome because either diet or not diet and it is true that is a single occurrence outcome.

176
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,020
And we could say it is time to event outcome or not because.

177
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:35,850
Usually we would treat mortality as a time to Iran because at the end of day everyone will die.

178
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:44,850
So we care more about whether people die earlier or later, but in this ICU, because people usually are severely yoed.

179
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:50,910
So like they. I, I think.

180
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,160
I think in ICU, although people are severely, severely ill,

181
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:14,880
but not everyone is expected to die over a relatively short period because they may sustain their life during a quite long period.

182
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:22,290
And so in this case, if that if that is the case, we don't think treat it as time to event outcome.

183
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:26,700
And for the follow up of this question,

184
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:37,480
it's most likely to be an echo follow up because patients admitted in ICU are pretty heterogeneous, like some die.

185
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:42,540
Some may die very soon and some may, like, sustain their life for quite a long time.

186
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:48,870
So. So there is a great variation in the number of days.

187
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:54,490
When people die after their admission into the ICU.

188
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:09,799
So for an outcome for our binary outcome, like all cause mortality was equal for lab attributes.

189
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:17,930
We would use kaplan-meier score rate to measure frequency of mortality.

190
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:26,690
What you're saying. Yes you can use rate or comply mayor risk.

191
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:48,480
So four. So it goes through the US cert classroom.

192
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,880
Anyone interested in providing your answers?

193
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:01,550
And no worries. I really don't think there is.

194
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:05,530
This is not a true or false concern.

195
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:13,560
So. You can just discuss with me or the whole class about why you think.

196
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,300
It is a closed or open cohort and. Yeah.

197
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:51,800
Just discuss your thinking process. Um, can I ask you, why do you think the exposure is?

198
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,330
Time exposure? So what's your exposure?

199
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:01,820
You identified from the problem. Mm hmm.

200
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:15,460
Um, I. Somebody. Okay.

201
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:28,380
And. And what do you think the outcome is and do think it is?

202
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:35,130
Do you think it is a time to event outcome or just to.

203
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:44,110
Binary outcome. Mm hmm.

204
00:41:44,800 --> 00:42:01,180
Losing it is like time to event outcome. Okay.

205
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:08,030
So I think. For this question.

206
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:16,760
It is a close cohort because the entry Iran is having a pregnancy in the register during the study years.

207
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:29,540
So it doesn't matter like the recruitment period of the study last from 1986 to 2011 and the exposure is gestational diabetes.

208
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:41,959
And in reality, it is true that once a person develop a GDM, it can be reassessed and there may be, can be, can develop this disease once again.

209
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:50,990
But in in this prompt we like we I don't think we are provided with this information.

210
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:59,000
So we just think develop the outcome, develop the exposure or not having just gestational diabetes or not.

211
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:06,960
So we think it is a phase two exposure and the outcome is early neonatal spaces.

212
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,460
It is a binary outcome and it happened one.

213
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:14,660
So it is a single occurrence outcome.

214
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:21,830
Yeah. And also, like you said, we define the outcome as whether.

215
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:29,820
Blood poisoning happens in baby within the first 72 hours from birth.

216
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:41,580
Well, there is a time component in this outcome, but actually we don't care about when it happens since birth to the 72 hours.

217
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:46,999
We just care about whether it is developed or not. So we think it is not a time to even outcome.

218
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:55,010
But once again, this is not necessarily like if you answer this is a time to event outcome.

219
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:06,739
I wouldn't say it is false or it's not your fault because you really need to maybe have some background knowledge about this disease.

220
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,799
So that's why you really want you do research.

221
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:18,050
You need to do some literature search to know more about the disease itself you're investigating.

222
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:31,630
And we see in this scenario we see it is it's probably everybody has equal follow up because.

223
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:44,810
Because Lost to fall off is not not expected in this study because because events

224
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,360
virtually nobody can escape pregnancy and birth related surveillance in these.

225
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:54,649
I think this is a country nationwide births registry surveillance.

226
00:44:54,650 --> 00:45:04,460
So once a patient once somebody had pregnancy and birth related outcome it will be captured by this nationwide surveillance.

227
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:20,290
And also like there may be some competing risk due to deaths from other course within the first 72 hours after a burst spot.

228
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:32,690
Like in this country. It has. It has. I think the background is that in these country it has universal, high quality and free health care.

229
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:38,360
It is not like the United States. So. I'm so sorry.

230
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:54,050
So. So, like, even if they the baby had some severe congenital malformations or some extremely severe disease after birth, they may be treated at one.

231
00:45:54,060 --> 00:46:03,020
So like the risk of compete, like the proportion of dying from some competing risk is not high.

232
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:10,170
So we think in these scenarios, probably everybody are have equal follow up.

233
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:20,540
And so in this close cohort, which is a binary outcome with a binary outcome and this is not a time to event outcome

234
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:26,960
and everybody have possibly Ecolab we use the risk to measure disease of frequency.

235
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:43,780
And if you still insist that competing you risk may influence people, have you covered up you can use comply or risk to make your.

236
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:52,430
Frequency of this disease. Okay.

237
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,639
So due to time limitation, I will just go through the following questions.

238
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,130
They're not asking for volunteers and hopefully you won't feel stressful.

239
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:07,580
So for the first question, this is open cohort.

240
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:15,099
It is because. Literally there is no defined baseline.

241
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:26,799
And so during during this 2020 period, the US population can change because there are births and there are immigration.

242
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:35,890
And also like it, the population can become smaller because their people lose due to death or emigration.

243
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:45,130
So it is the open cohort and exposure of the COVID 19 infection and it is a binary exposure and.

244
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:51,490
Recurrent. Recurrent exposure, right?

245
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:58,709
And the outcome is mortality from COVID 19.

246
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:06,300
And again, a binary outcome. Mortality only happened once, so it is a single occurrence outcome.

247
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:14,479
And although like we usually treat mortality as a time to events,

248
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:22,610
but it does matter in this open cohort because by definition in open cohort people have an equal fill up, right?

249
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:36,290
So we use rate to measure disease of frequency because rates are only measure we can use to measure Diesel's frequency in the open cohort.

250
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:51,310
And we will use maybe risk rate difference to measure excess mortality as a measure of association or also a rate ratio.

251
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:01,150
Next question. It is close cohort and.

252
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:14,130
We define membership as the time when the beginning of a school year and exposure is vitamin B12.

253
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:26,660
Sarah status. It is. Binary outcome, whether whether the Trojan had vitamin B12 deficiency or not.

254
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:36,100
But we also think it is a time varying exposure because in the prompt it said the exposure was measured twice,

255
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:42,620
right one at the beginning of the school year and one at a time before that meteor break.

256
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:58,749
For the outcome. It is a respiratory infection and apparently a binary outcome and it can't happen more than once.

257
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:11,060
So it is a recurrent outcome and. In this close cohort we think it is possibly have equal blown up for each individual because.

258
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:20,760
Because the outcome is a recurrent outcome and for and the follow up would continue

259
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:27,660
even after a a children developed vitamin B12 deficiency for the first time.

260
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:39,890
But also you can't argue that using the full app would be ethical across or participants

261
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:45,200
because if some traditional patients do not want to continue in the study and

262
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:52,430
so they drop out or like even the children drop out from the school moving to a

263
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:59,149
different school so that you cannot capture them after they move to different schools.

264
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:07,670
So you can see like children have, they may have different ages of all up to.

265
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:21,030
And in this scenario, although it is a close cohort and we think possibly average would have equal follow up,

266
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:28,110
we use rate to measure the frequency because exposure is time varying and outcome is a recurrent outcome.

267
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:46,950
Yeah. Right. Yeah. For the last question.

268
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:51,740
I mean, the second to last for a second.

269
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:58,350
The last question. We think this is a close cohort because we define membership as.

270
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:10,209
Births because this is a birth cohort. So once the baby is born, it is like he or she is born.

271
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:23,470
And so she stay with the membership. And so this is a close cohort and the exposure will be age at first sexual intercourse.

272
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:31,270
And so it is a continuous outcome and it is fixed.

273
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:40,570
Right. It does not vary with time because once it happened, it happened and the outcome is first pregnancy at a given age.

274
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:52,270
And mention that this is. Binary outcome rather than.

275
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:58,969
Rather than our continuous outcome, although like it, it has a component of at a given age.

276
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:10,400
But we actually care about whether the person had pregnancy or not and whether and when at what age the person had pregnancy.

277
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:14,210
So we think it is a time to event binary outcome.

278
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:26,930
Yeah. Time to event binary outcome. And it is a single outcome because although a person can have pregnancy multiple times.

279
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:30,650
But we only care about first pregnancy in this situation.

280
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:49,090
And we think the follow up is probably echo across all individuals in the study because.

281
00:53:51,950 --> 00:54:01,880
Because the first pregnancy, although it is common, it varies the age of first pregnancy, although it is likely that's a common outcome because.

282
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:10,820
Most of people will like have pregnancy sometime point but it very substantially with age

283
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:19,850
and death and the follow up stops when we know the person had pregnancy and also because.

284
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:30,640
Because of the competing risk, people may die due to something related to pregnancy.

285
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,720
Although like this, it's rare because I think.

286
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,840
Young people have a very low test rate.

287
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:55,080
And we use Kaplan-Meier risk to measure disease frequency in this close cohort with equal follow up across individuals.

288
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:36,680
Here we are.

289
00:55:54,670 --> 00:56:13,150
And we. Hi.

290
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:21,020
I was literally like, this is my first time.

291
00:56:35,200 --> 00:57:04,620
So the first question is, I hope I have good reason to be like, what is the denominator and what are you getting rid of?

292
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:18,150
And I need to make sure I that's what I need to do to look at what you are doing.

293
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:23,130
Right. And I'm crazy because I remember.

294
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:38,090
Hong Kong was divided by China, and this is the greatest of all time.

295
00:57:38,980 --> 00:58:02,290
Miriam, before you go, I think, you know, I think it's sometimes very hard to bring it out.

296
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:14,499
Yes, yes, yes. Um, actually, I'm not sure about how like, whether it be up here in, like, exam,

297
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:23,440
