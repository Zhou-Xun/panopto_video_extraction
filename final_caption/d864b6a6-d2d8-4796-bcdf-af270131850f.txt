1
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:33,910
All right. Hi, everyone. That's started on today's recitation section.

2
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,830
So, uh, today we're going to work on this problem.

3
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:47,290
This is a problem from last year's midterm. So going to got a chance to say what is expected from the exam.

4
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,340
So this problem concerns.

5
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:58,209
What do we just learn that MGM gave me expectation, particularly for this one.

6
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:04,660
It's a continuous distribution. So we're going to talk a little bit about that next Tuesday.

7
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:13,270
But all necessary definitions we have covered in the previous chapters.

8
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,620
So you should be able to work out this problem. So let's take a look at this problem together.

9
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:27,909
So assume AX is a random variable which take the support on the real space and it follows a so

10
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:35,230
called logistic distribution with two parameters minus where it has is a positive parameter.

11
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,000
So the period of this run, a variable is defined in this formula.

12
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:48,190
Okay, so is the ratio between the exponential term and C times squared term.

13
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,960
So both and us, they are parameters.

14
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:58,360
Right. And this C, this additional parameter C is a normalizing constant.

15
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,270
Okay.

16
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:14,850
So that's the first part for us, which defines the logistic distribution and the second part size if language follows the logistics of distribution.

17
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:21,830
With this parameters, we call this Y a log logistic distribution with this two parameters.

18
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:32,180
Right. So then there are four questions. First question asks us to find this constant C so that this is a valid pdf.

19
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,940
The second question asks you to find the moment generating function of x.

20
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,930
Suppose question does not even involve this you know y.

21
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,790
So you only need to you only need the first part to answer the first two questions.

22
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:54,469
And the third question says, if we said of to be this quantity paid out to be this quantity,

23
00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:02,060
namely doing this a change of variables, then what is the pdf of y?

24
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:08,210
Okay. And lastly, it asks what is the case moment of y?

25
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:16,130
So why is the log y is let's just say a distribution y is a logic log logistic distribution.

26
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:22,400
So these are the four questions that were asked from this description.

27
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,010
So let's try to work out each of each one of these questions.

28
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:38,810
So let's start from the first one. Okay. So what is the what is the general idea for solving the first question?

29
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:50,430
How do we calculate this constant? What recommendation or what criteria should we use in order to make this a valid PDF?

30
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,360
What property does a PDF have that can help us determine the constant?

31
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,300
This is a. The basic question right now.

32
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,440
I for it to be. Yes. Very good.

33
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:23,080
The integral has to be equal to one. Right now it's the fundamental property for our PD and our probability probabilistic, uh, density function.

34
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,260
So I'll give you a couple of minutes and we can try to integrate this function.

35
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,670
Set it to be one and see whether we can solve this. Okay.

36
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:53,780
Okay. How many of you have got it? Still working on it.

37
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,670
Okay. You got it? Or do you need more time?

38
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,129
As I mentioned in class, calculus is not the focus of this course,

39
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:13,020
but definitely it's a very important tool that we're going to use we're going to need in this class.

40
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,200
But this is a.

41
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:26,110
Very good example where calculus is heavily used, especially later when we talk about a multivariate extension of what we have talked about.

42
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:36,680
The calculus is going to be even more heavily used. So now is the past time to review the calculus, if anything else, Rusty?

43
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:43,150
Okay. So let's look at this together and see how took on this council and see.

44
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,200
So as we have argued,

45
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:56,960
the condition that we collaborate on is the integration from an active infinity to infinity of this PDA function should be equal to one, right?

46
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,310
That function can give us, um, the expression of see.

47
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:13,940
So if we integrate, if we plug in this, uh, PDA function that's e to the active X minus mu over plus.

48
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:23,390
Over C one plus e two inactive at minus mu over s squared.

49
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:31,780
Yes. So that's what we are trying to integrate, right?

50
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:38,620
So. If you are very familiar with the calculus,

51
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:48,400
you should be able to notice that the original function for this part is one plus E to the negative x minus mu.

52
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,170
Over us. Right. So that's the main functional form.

53
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:07,050
And then the rest is to just to fill in the, the remaining constant that's needed so that the derivative of this function becomes not function.

54
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:14,580
So the derivative, the additional constant that we would need is one three with, uh.

55
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,890
It's. If we take the derivative of this squared.

56
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,570
So it was a see here. And.

57
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,120
We need an active one and we need a.

58
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:59,670
That's right. So if you take the derivative of this function.

59
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:08,490
Yeah. So we can double check that if you take the derivative of C as one quasi to an active.

60
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:17,070
X minus mu over us. Take the derivative.

61
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,930
That's going to give you a sense. And squared.

62
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:28,850
That's my view over cars. And now they've won over us.

63
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,980
Right. Looks like as should be in the numerator.

64
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:53,710
Here. All right.

65
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:19,170
All right. Should the. Okay.

66
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:37,250
And this guy should be equal to one. This is equal to one more than we have.

67
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:45,450
So. Acts stakes infinity. This guy is going to be.

68
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:53,520
Zero. If it's going to be negative infinity, the entire thing is zero.

69
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:57,130
I So that is just equal to us.

70
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,160
Over. See? Which gave you.

71
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:12,070
See. Equal to us. Really the key is just the calculus is to figure out what is the integration of this guy is.

72
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:19,229
All right. And if it's not clear, then another way to do it is to do something.

73
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,030
Change your variable so you can treat this entire than this.

74
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,600
You can set a Y equal to negative x minus mu over us.

75
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,990
That could simplify the original function a little bit.

76
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:39,299
So the original integration now becomes integration again from one axis, not to infinity.

77
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,560
Then it becomes positive infinity and it is either infinity.

78
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:51,590
Then Y is an active unity. Now original function become E to the Y over three times one plus eight.

79
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,980
The Y square and axis.

80
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,400
What axis and equal to.

81
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,180
Active the. Ask me why.

82
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:10,030
So this native son can be combined with this.

83
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,660
So the original integration is also equal to this guy.

84
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:30,630
Right. And then. Maybe you can integrate this one more easily with this in a cleaner, cleaner form.

85
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:39,140
But anyway, the final result is sequel to us. And that is just from the property of the PDA function.

86
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:45,570
It integrates to one right. So now let's take a look at the second question.

87
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:52,110
The MGM fallbacks. And here's a hint that you can take advantage of this equation.

88
00:15:52,470 --> 00:16:04,500
This beta beta function for the beta function is defined as the integration from zero to 1 to 8, minus one and one minus to be minus one.

89
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,299
But it also has an expression of gamma, a comma b.

90
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:16,880
Overcome equals b. So the question is, they arrived at MGM for X.

91
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:50,990
Okay. Uh, I don't know how far we have gone, but, uh, at least I hope you have already gotten this far.

92
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:56,959
Okay, so at least first you can write out the, uh, the general information,

93
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,180
the definition of the moment generally in function, which is the expectation of e to the power of T.

94
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,430
So plugging everything in, you can have this integration.

95
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:13,970
So apparently it looks pretty nasty, but we can do some change of variables to simplify the notation.

96
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:20,930
In particular, we can set this Y to be negative x minus MU over us because that's the common term.

97
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:29,690
I show up here and in the denominator. Right. We can set it to be another notation of y to simplify the expression.

98
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,920
As a result, you got, um. You can cancel this constant.

99
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,400
And what end up is this quantity?

100
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:42,049
Okay. The integration where this e to the mute is a constant.

101
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,920
You can take it outside and inside this integration.

102
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:52,610
The numerator is e to some power of y and denominator is one plus e to the y squared.

103
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:58,770
Okay. So so far everything is, uh, is standard.

104
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,760
But starting from here, how do we further simplify?

105
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,470
This may need some additional thinking.

106
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:15,510
Recall that we already give a hint which you can take advantage of the beta this.

107
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:21,030
The beta function is defined in this way for any A and b any positive.

108
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,750
And B you always have the integration from 0 to 1.

109
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:29,219
This to the the product of T to the power of a minus one.

110
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:36,360
Y minus t to the power of B. Minus one is always a known constant, not constant, as is the beta function.

111
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:43,710
All right. So now the question is, how do we take advantage of this beta function to further simplify, what do we have?

112
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:49,200
Or rather better comes function here for your convenience.

113
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,960
So Peter a b define as 0 to 1.

114
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:59,879
T minus one one minus t b.

115
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:06,140
Minus one e. T. So how do we get from these?

116
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,750
Integration to this. Beta function.

117
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:18,400
As long as you can convert this integration to the beta function, you can further simplify.

118
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:29,970
So how do we come up with something that looks like he two particular power and one minus t to another power?

119
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:43,900
So we are working on this problem for those who just came are now working out.

120
00:23:44,930 --> 00:27:08,660
Question number two. And he any how to change the variable so we think that.

121
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:35,830
This integration from what we have right now. What do we what do we want to achieve?

122
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:42,960
It has a very particular form, right? It's key to one power and a one minus T to another power.

123
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:49,410
In other words, you have to change the variables so that the two variables add up to one.

124
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:55,160
So I can give you some hint of how to do the change of variable.

125
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:24,680
And if not. Yes. T equal to one.

126
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:31,400
One plus E to the Y. One over my very good.

127
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,110
All right, let's take a look. If we set t to be this quantity.

128
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:48,050
Let's see what we can have. Right? If t is equal to its start to be one over one plus e to the y, now what is one minus t?

129
00:28:55,090 --> 00:29:02,580
At this. All right. And if you multiply this to the denominator, going to become.

130
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:10,080
One plus e to the y squared and the numerator is to E to the E to the y.

131
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:21,520
Right. If your father require. If you further calculate what a Y is in terms of t y are going to be quite.

132
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,120
Loss of one over three.

133
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,920
Uh, minus one. Okay.

134
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:01,710
She? It's.

135
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,710
And then you can plug into back into your original integration and see what you can get.

136
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:32,830
Okay. So now original integration limit is from negative infinity to infinity or y, and that corresponds to what he goes from.

137
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,980
If Y takes an active infinity, then this guy is zero, right?

138
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:43,299
This guy zero means this is one and he y takes positive infinity.

139
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:55,150
This guy goes to 041209120 and in the numerator you have e to the mute here, which is constant e to the.

140
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:26,930
One minus as he. So this guy can be rewritten as.

141
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:35,270
T minus T.

142
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,760
To the power of one minus t.

143
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:46,580
And it's this one plus. Okay.

144
00:31:53,390 --> 00:32:16,150
He wants to be close. And then you can reorganize in these terms to further simplify it.

145
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:24,250
The key is really here in this middle part to notice that the original function that is involved

146
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:31,870
why now becomes a function of T and now it becomes a function of T and a function of one minus T.

147
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:40,719
And the reason why we have a power one minus as T. Well, actually, T is not a very good notation here.

148
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,540
And that's here's another one. Z.

149
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:20,920
And the reason why we have this power term to be one minus s t is really because the original numerator,

150
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:27,250
if you look at this Z and Y minus Z, only one minus D has something in the numerator.

151
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:37,540
Right. And that helps us determine the the power term for this one minus term says we need this e to the power of y times

152
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:45,520
one minus s t in the numerator that just tells us we need this one minus s t to be the power term for one minus Z.

153
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:58,090
And once we have this y minus as T as the powerful Y minus Z, that I'm going to mess up with the denominator as well in order to compensate for that,

154
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:05,920
uh, change in the denominator, we need to have this one plus as t for the power of Z.

155
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:13,720
As a result, we have these two quantities to replace the original function of Y.

156
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:19,920
So if you put everything together, now we have to move here.

157
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,730
This is only little able here.

158
00:34:54,890 --> 00:35:08,600
If you simplify this equation, you end up with this one integration from 0 to 1 E to the Z as T times Y minus Z to the power of negative as T easy.

159
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:24,750
Now you can use this beta function. So what is your what is your or a is as te plus one in B is.

160
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:42,680
One minus as t so which means this quantity is equal to E to the new t times 8 to 1 plus as t.

161
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:50,760
One minus as t. And that's your moment in function.

162
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:59,440
And the reason why we can use this better function is because recall that when we define the moment out of a function,

163
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:04,270
we only allow t to be in the neighborhood of zero.

164
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,830
The other words T is very small. If t is small, then as times t is small.

165
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:15,680
So this one minus s t has to be positive. So that satisfied the condition for our beta function.

166
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,740
So you can write it down explicitly.

167
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,800
Okay. So that's the p that's the generating function for us.

168
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:33,640
So so the tricky part is really to notice how to do this change of variable in this step.

169
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:51,470
And the motivation of using this, trying to change a variable is try to convert the original integration to comply with this better function,

170
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,080
to create this T and Y minus T in this integration.

171
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:06,950
Okay. All right.

172
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,310
Any questions so far? All right.

173
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:19,550
So now let's look at the third question. So we already know the first question, C is equal to the second question.

174
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:25,320
The moment generating function of ours is it has not particular function or form.

175
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:29,730
Now, the third question, the fourth question concerns the log of y.

176
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:40,410
Okay. Following is logistic distribution. So if Y is a lot like the logistic distribution, find the pdf of y.

177
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,480
How do we do it? We know the distribution of args.

178
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:54,250
How do we find the PDF of y? Well.

179
00:37:54,280 --> 00:38:01,210
In other words, we know the PDF or log of y. What is the pdf for y?

180
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:09,080
That's a change of heart, right?

181
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:19,260
See, you can write y equal to or log of y equal to x which follow this.

182
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:25,270
Logistic distribution. That's the definition.

183
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:37,420
In other words, you can write y equal to exponential box or as follows The logistic of distribution right is sort of an enormous problem.

184
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:44,980
What we have seen in class for the change of variable, we know the distribution for X, what is the distribution of Y to that?

185
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,280
That's the question is really that's what the question is asking.

186
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:56,400
So how do we get the Pdaf line? Based on the pdaf and this transformation.

187
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:08,990
I hope you have. Derive the final form.

188
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:20,120
So here is the relation. So noticing that this Y is a transformation of X where I follows the logistic distribution.

189
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:26,450
And furthermore, this transformation is a minus one transformation because it's a exponential function.

190
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:33,920
So we can directly apply this formula that we have learned in class to derive the PDF or y.

191
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:44,820
So that is how facts apply to G imus y times this absolute value right derivative of this inverse function.

192
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:49,430
With respect to y, if you're plugging everything, then there is just a calculation.

193
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:57,590
You can simplify either simplify it to these or to a cleaner form, which is the last line.

194
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:02,209
And I give you the PDF for this transform.

195
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:16,660
Right available y. So now it comes to the last question, which is if you know how to do it, it should be.

196
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:24,510
Um. It doesn't involve a lot of calculus, but if you don't know how to do it,

197
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:31,440
you may have to go through with a very tedious road, find the case moment of this.

198
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:38,170
Lot logistic run them out of the way. Assuming the last number.

199
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,900
In other words, we want to get. This guy.

200
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:53,990
You can take advantage of what you have already got from the first three fashion.

201
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,970
So far, we know the kids of our bags. We also know the pediatric why.

202
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:06,870
And we also know that many of our backs. How do we find the case?

203
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:17,380
Moment of why? So what are different ways of finding the case?

204
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,720
Moment of a random variable.

205
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:35,509
Well, we can always go from the definition as we know the PDF of why the most brute force approach would be to calculate it.

206
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:43,100
Using the definition you can integrate a y is a variable from zero to infinity.

207
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:50,390
The pdf of y times this y to the key and try to solve this.

208
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:56,630
Right. That's always a method to calculate this.

209
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:08,720
Or you can try to derive the moment generating function of y and then take the derivative to the case order and evaluate t zero.

210
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:18,980
That's another way to calculate this case molar. But in this particular question, there is a third way to do that.

211
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:27,980
Since we know the relation between one and AX and we have already take all those efforts to find the MJF,

212
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:36,830
all of us think about how can we take advantage of that gap of X to help us evaluate the case moment of Y.

213
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:53,650
Hmm. So that's a hint. How is this related?

214
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:06,480
To. This guy.

215
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:02,600
Do you see the connection? Yes.

216
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:08,120
No. Okay. So what's the connection between one and arts?

217
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:13,670
Just put it in here. Right. So y is equal to E to the acts.

218
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:17,899
If acts is logistic. If you take away. That's all we know.

219
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:27,950
It's a lot like logistic. On the other hand, if Y is a log logistic, we know if we take the log transformation, it becomes a logistic run, a variable.

220
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:37,700
So that's the connection between these two. Now, if you look at this, we know the explicit form for this IMG callbacks, right?

221
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:46,730
So we know e to the tax by close form expression of that and in particular e to the acts is essentially are a Y.

222
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:54,170
So in other words, that is exactly e of y to that he.

223
00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:07,550
All right. So if you particularly sub this key to b k, that will give you the PD of the case moment for this random variable y.

224
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,850
Or alternatively, you can go from.

225
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:28,140
This guy exportation of y to the k is equal to the exportation of E to the power of log y to the k.

226
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:39,540
That's equivalent expression, right? Which is expectation of E to the K times like y.

227
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:45,510
And again, this log y now follows a logistical distribution.

228
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:51,780
So you can change the notation. Use X to represent that new random variable.

229
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:56,970
And we know the expression of this E to the K and from the angle of x.

230
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:07,230
All we need to do is to plug in the replaced T by K and it got the expression for the case moment of y.

231
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:14,490
So you don't need to do any integration in this case. Does that make sense?

232
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:21,450
All right. So and now you can also think about why we have this assumption,

233
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:30,240
why pay has to be less than better because really cannot use this relation to evaluate any order of moment.

234
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:34,350
If K is too large, then that means T is too large.

235
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:42,629
Our moment generally in function. But I recall that our moment in moment generally in function is only defined 40.

236
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:47,690
That's in the neighborhood of zero. So it's now defined for a large team.

237
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:50,030
So that's why we need this additional assumption.

238
00:52:51,670 --> 00:53:02,980
More specifically, if you look at the actual form of our movement generally in function, it require this be this parameter to be greater than zero.

239
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:07,420
In other words, he has to be less than one over us, right?

240
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:15,640
So if he is greater than one over us, then you cannot use the beta function to gather close form.

241
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,990
So that he has to be less than one over and one over as it's just beta.

242
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:33,700
So that's why we we can only use this approach to to calculate the moment up to a particular order and further any higher orders.

243
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:37,599
You have to go with the other two approaches,

244
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:44,380
either using the moment generating function of Y or use the brute force approach by doing this integration.

245
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:48,220
Right. So that's the four questions.

246
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:54,490
So now looking back at this four questions, it does involve some tedious calculation.

247
00:53:55,090 --> 00:54:04,780
But at the end of the day, it's some it involves some trick of using the definition that we have introducing in class,

248
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:11,710
but also some tricky in calculus. So that's sort of what we expect in the exam and homework as well.

249
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:21,100
All right. So let's give you a sense of what is expected, at least this is what is the, you know, in last year's midterm.

250
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:27,709
So you can get a. Real sense of what we saw this year is.

251
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:33,050
Exactly. And also you don't have to panic.

252
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:37,430
This is the last question in last year's exam. So this is the hardest one, of course.

253
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:41,120
So we don't expect all the questions to be based hard.

254
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:47,590
And any question. Okay, great.

255
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:51,430
So that's how I prepared today.

256
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:56,800
And if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

257
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:03,519
By the way, the homework six has been posted on campus and also we have posted a solution.

258
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:07,120
Sometimes you can take a look and you don't have to submit the homework.

259
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:12,880
Six is just for additional practice questions for your preparation for the midterm.

260
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:32,680
I have a question about or anything.

261
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:37,530
So like this one, this discussion or anything, just progression.

262
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,920
Okay. We are calculating generic function.
