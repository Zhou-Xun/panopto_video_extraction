1
00:00:05,193 --> 00:00:08,350
So, we've been talking
about central messages.

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:12,780
Good central messages don't
appear out of nowhere, right?

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,190
They're the distillation of all
of your knowledge on a topic.

4
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,000
Your ability to find the key
thing that you wanna communicate.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,880
So, step one to finding
a good central message

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,930
is to remind yourself of all
the key ideas that you know.

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,590
Now, when you're trying
to generate a new idea,

8
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,580
a new thing that you wanna communicate,
you wanna brainstorm.

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,460
And that term gets thrown around a lot,
but what I mean by that is, literally,

10
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,040
write down a stream of
consciousness of thoughts and

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,570
ideas, facts, points,
concerns, limitations.

12
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,250
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

13
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,060
Write it down.

14
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,370
And the important point
here is don't edit or

15
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,010
refine these or go deep onto certain ones.

16
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,910
The goal is volume, not quality.

17
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,990
We're gonna work on finding
the central message later.

18
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,830
Right now, the goal is to make sure that
everything that you need to remember

19
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,950
as you're working on a central
message is available to you,

20
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,580
is ready at a moment's notice for
you to bring in to your thinking.

21
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,080
Similarly, sometimes when you're
an educator or you're trying to summarize

22
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,720
a body of knowledge into a clear message,
don't brainstorm.

23
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,230
I think of it sort of as brain dumping,
right?

24
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,120
You just list out the key points,
the concepts,

25
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,960
the dimensions that need
to be talked about.

26
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,090
And make sure you get them all down.

27
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,080
In other words,
you flesh out the idea space.

28
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:49,270
The space of all the different
ideas that you need to have ready.

29
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,790
What is the set of ideas that
you need to be thinking of?

30
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,620
What are the, I don't know, ten or

31
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:00,330
15 key points that might be relevant
to finding your central message?

32
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,820
For example, I design tools to help
people make difficult health decisions.

33
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,490
Step one,
when I'm going through that process,

34
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,610
is to make sure that I know
all the relevant options or

35
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,830
dimensions that I need to be
talking about with the patients so

36
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:23,050
if there are, say, three different
treatment options, what are they?

37
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,240
Maybe its surgery and
radiation and surveillance.

38
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,220
Okay, those are the three options.

39
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,050
Is not doing something an option too?

40
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,440
Maybe that's a fourth option.

41
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,210
Either way, I need to think
through what are the options set.

42
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:42,470
And once I've done that, what are all
the different ways that the options

43
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,980
are the same or different from each other?

44
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,490
These are the key dimensions
that I need to be thinking about

45
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:52,550
before I start to generate
my central messages.

46
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:57,570
The key to this brainstorming process,
or brain dumping process,

47
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,390
is to force yourself to not organize.

48
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,880
This stage is about exploration,
not refinement.

49
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,060
That comes next.

50
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,040
By the way, the literature on
decision-making shows that one of the most

51
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,170
important things you can do to make
better decisions, any type of decision,

52
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,897
is to what they call, widen your options.

53
00:03:18,897 --> 00:03:22,757
In other words, to make sure
that you explore the idea space.

54
00:03:22,757 --> 00:03:26,717
So doing a bit of brainstorming or
brain dumping doesn't just help you to be

55
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:31,978
a better communicator, it helps
you to be a better decision-maker.
