1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:17,780
Well, we are here to ask you if you know anything about what you might read, what you think about what you want.

2
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:25,950
Hello, everyone. I am Chris and I will be your GSR instructor for the rest of the term.

3
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:34,260
Since we swap in the middle of the term and this is the first meeting after a fall break I was hoping to do,

4
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:48,060
we will go over seven and complete engage learning number five and class since one of the sections had two fire alarms go off during the exam.

5
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,910
We do not have those back yet to review and that should be gone over next week.

6
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:02,940
Not only have you graded any of them so far, yes, some are graded, but we can't release them back until the other sections take the exam.

7
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:10,290
Do you know how do they look? I don't know that because there's a grading team, but I know they're making progress.

8
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:19,370
I think it's going okay. Okay.

9
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,949
Okay. Quiz seven. Question one. Establishing temporality is never difficult in case control studies.

10
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:41,400
This is very false. Q Series B explanation is a case series to describe unusual occurrences of disease.

11
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,780
One of the hallmarks of a case series is that the presentation is unusual.

12
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,800
Also, a single physician can present a case series.

13
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,930
This is common practice. Hypotheses can be generated from case series.

14
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:03,420
For example, with the first report of individuals for the that appeared in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,

15
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,280
several hypotheses were developed based on the presentation of the cases.

16
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,740
Finally, case theory describes several individuals and not populations.

17
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:23,309
In Case Control Studies participants are recruited based on their disease outcome status.

18
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:33,690
Only you want to recruit cases which are people that have the disease you're studying and controls, which are people who do not.

19
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:45,149
And for which of the following statements is it true about matching and refers to our true a variable that has been matched between

20
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:53,250
cases and controlled cannot be evaluated because the proportion of the matched variable will be the same between cases and controls.

21
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,660
You specifically eliminated that by matching and making sure they both had,

22
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:04,560
and matching on a variable that includes a range may not account for all potential differences between groups.

23
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:12,590
A rare disease is ideal to study using a case control design because the investigator would be

24
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:18,650
able to identify current cases rather than waiting for a small number of new cases to occur.

25
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:25,550
This is true. If it's rare, you can go and find people with the disease specifically.

26
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:32,790
But. And out of these, the true answers are the first and the third community.

27
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:38,730
Population based control should be selected from a well defined geographic population,

28
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,549
and it is most appropriate to select hospital controls who have illnesses that

29
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:49,980
do not share risk factors as the disease under study in a case control study.

30
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:02,580
And which of the following is not an advantage of case control studies, and it is that they are efficient for exposures.

31
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:13,540
That is not an advantage of. The number of cases and controls in a case control study does not have to be the same.

32
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:22,990
So that is false. If we use only the data from a case control study, we cannot estimate the prevalence of disease.

33
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,540
That is true because you specifically cite on cases and controls.

34
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,890
And for the information provided here, filling in the two by two table,

35
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:44,870
an investigator who conducts a study to determine whether there is an association between caffeine intake and Parkinson's disease.

36
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:54,080
He assembles 230 incident cases of Parkinson's and sample 455 controls from the general population.

37
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:02,989
After interviewing all subjects, he finds that 64 of the cases had higher daily intake of caffeine prior to the diagnosis,

38
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:11,120
and 277 of the controls had low daily intake of caffeine prior to the date of the matched cases diagnosis.

39
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:23,840
So as you can see of the cases, you find these with Parkinson's and high caffeine here.

40
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,260
These would be the same like your true positives from before.

41
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,870
And these are done here with low caffeine and no Parkinson's.

42
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,460
And the controls, no Parkinson's would be the controls.

43
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:48,260
These would be those who did not have the exposure and those would be the true negatives in the context of what you'd been looking at before.

44
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,130
In the two by two table above. What does the Greens still represent?

45
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:07,830
The number of controls who were exposed? As I said, no Parkinson's would be the control over and high caffeine was the exposure.

46
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,170
So for you would be controls who were exposed to high caffeine.

47
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,660
And that quickly.

48
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:30,240
But you will be able to find under week nine or under the assignments on canvas engaged learning number five and we should have time to

49
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:39,970
it says if time allows but we should have time since we're not going over the exam to finish and go over this before the end of class.

50
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:50,530
But as you can always do by 30 minutes after the class period, so you can take your time and work on that and we'll go over.

51
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,839
An investigator examined existing data from 83 counties and found a moderately strong,

52
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:15,750
statistically significant correlation between per capita number of color television sets and death rates for cardiovascular disease.

53
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:27,270
For the sort of ridiculous correlation you have, the exposure of color TV sets and the outcome is death from cardiovascular disease.

54
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:38,700
The study design and ecology. Since you're looking at the country level and not any deeper than that and the justification is this group level data.

55
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:46,159
For number two, anthropometric measures for risk of breast cancer.

56
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,530
In Uruguay, women were evaluated.

57
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:57,950
Women were identified from the Guerrero Rosso Women's Hospital in Uruguay who had incident breast cancer or some other non malignancy.

58
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,930
A total of 343 incident breast cancer cases were identified.

59
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,980
686 total women were included in the study.

60
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:12,140
After selection, all women were measured to calculate body fat to muscle ratio.

61
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:20,990
The authors found that muscle fraction was negatively associated with risk, while fracture muscle ratio was positively associated.

62
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:27,589
Stratified analysis by body mass index also showed risk increased for the highest

63
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:33,020
levels of fat to muscle ratio for both normal weight and overweight or obese women.

64
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,820
So your exposure is going to be the factor muscle ratio.

65
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:45,500
The outcome is breast cancer because you're looking at measures or risk of breast cancer.

66
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,040
Your study design is case control, as you can see.

67
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:55,789
You've identified two cases here and you've identified one control for each case.

68
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:05,570
So the number is doubled and the subjects were identified on the basis of having the disease, which is why it's the case control design.

69
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:18,310
For number three, a study was identified completed to identify predictors of uninsurance among children and adolescents with insured parents.

70
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:25,270
A group of 40,000 children or adolescents were identified from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey

71
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,850
who were younger than 19 years of age and had at least one parent residing in their household.

72
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,830
A questionnaire was administered to collect insurance history of the child and parent.

73
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:45,700
Information on age, education, race, income, marital status of a parent and other lifestyle factors was collected using the same instrument.

74
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:54,370
Using statistical modeling techniques. The investigators found that among children and adolescents with at least one insured parent,

75
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:03,880
those uninsured children were more likely to be low income from single parent homes and living with a parent with a high school education or less.

76
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:11,500
The prevalence of children in the US who were uninsured when at least one of their parents was insured was 3%.

77
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:21,730
So the exposure is there are many exposures which go into a statistical model of income, marital status of the parents parental education level.

78
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,370
And your outcome you're looking to investigate is uninsurance among your children.

79
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:38,919
And the study design is cross-sectional because this has been the outcome and exposure data were collected at the same time and individuals were not

80
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:48,430
selected based on basis of exposure or disease or number for disparities in the

81
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:52,200
availability of nutritionally important foods and their influence on health.

82
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:58,060
We're studying inventories of all food stores and to rural New York counties.

83
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:06,010
Were survey. The study area was divided into four regions using 2000 census and geographic information data.

84
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,619
The prevalence of obesity and smoking among adults was obtained from publicly available

85
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:17,919
data for each region by vary correlations among availability of foods and cigarets.

86
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,040
Obesity and smoking were analyzed at the regional level.

87
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:28,300
The authors found that obesity was inversely associated with availability of fresh fruit, vegetables and low fat milk.

88
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:35,560
Smoking was positively associated with the availability of cigarets, white bread, whole milk and eggs.

89
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,540
The conclusions of the study were that differences were found in the availability

90
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,020
of fresh fruits and vegetables and the prevalence of obesity in adults.

91
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,939
These data suggest that greater availability of markets with fresh fruits and

92
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,800
vegetables may decrease the prevalence of obesity in rural neighborhoods.

93
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,510
So your exposure is food and cigaret availability.

94
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:05,919
The outcomes are smoking and obesity in the study design is ecologic because it's

95
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:14,560
at the regional level and the justification is generically group level data.

96
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:24,340
For number five, a study was completed to identify factors associated with influenza vaccination status of children and adolescents.

97
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:31,810
In September 2020, a group of 500 children or adolescents were identified for Green Tree.

98
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,500
Pediatric Quiet were younger than 18 years of age.

99
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:46,390
A questionnaire was administered to determine acceptance of influenza vaccination information on age, education, race, income,

100
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:53,019
education of the parents, and whether a physician recommended influenza vaccination at their previous visits were collected.

101
00:12:53,020 --> 00:13:02,680
Using the same survey, 140 of the 200 children vaccinated received a physician recommended recommendation at their last visit,

102
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,380
and 100 of 300 unvaccinated children received the same recommendation.

103
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,970
So your exposure is the recommendation of the physician.

104
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:22,540
The outcome is vaccination status, and the study design is cross-sectional because it's in one point in time, September 2020.

105
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:34,090
And the justification listed here is that it is a snapshot of that single moment in time for November six.

106
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:42,849
Findings are reported from a community acquired lower urinary tract infection caused by extended spectrum beta

107
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:52,660
lactamase producing and multi-drug resistant E coli and otherwise healthy and otherwise healthy college age woman.

108
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:57,130
This would be one person the patient was an if febrile.

109
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:01,510
24 year old female college student who had visited her university health service.

110
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:07,060
E Coli was isolated from specimens collected from the patient at the time of visit.

111
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:17,540
Urinalysis confirmed criteria. Also, at the time of visit, the patient reported no antimicrobial drug treatment during the previous four weeks,

112
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:26,030
no history of hospitalization, no urethral catheterization, and no sexually transmitted infection.

113
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:35,930
A seven day antibiotic regimen was prescribed despite proper treatment for infection persisted some clinically and symptoms recurred two months later.

114
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:48,200
So your exposure is the extended spectrum, beta lactamase producing and multi-drug resistant E coli very long statement for one organism.

115
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:58,820
The outcome is community acquired lower urinary tract infection and the study design is the case report because it is this single woman.

116
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:10,880
For number seven, although tuberculosis is widely known as a respiratory disease or TB may occur in other parts of the body,

117
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,960
the report highlighted two cases of isolated gastrointestinal,

118
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:23,600
tuberculosis and renal transplant recipients were published to illustrate the difficulty of diagnosing non pulmonary TB disease.

119
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:31,190
The first case was a 53 year old man with end stage renal failure who was on hemodialysis.

120
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:37,550
He was admitted with fever, fever, history of night sweating and weight loss of 10% of his body.

121
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,970
The second case was a 53 year old woman,

122
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:55,250
an active carrier of hepatitis B and ESR secondary to membrane of proliferative of Madeira and the third who was on hemodialysis.

123
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:03,080
The patient presented with high fever, 38.8 degrees Celsius, anorexia and widespread abdominal tenderness.

124
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:07,190
So this exposure is mycobacterium tuberculosis.

125
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,750
The outcome is gastrointestinal tuberculosis.

126
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,759
And this is a case series because it's a description of more than one case report.

127
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,510
You have a 53 year old man and a 53 year old woman.

128
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:31,710
So you can identify it and distinguish from the single case report and the previous question, because there is more than one or number eight.

129
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:38,149
A furniture manufacturing company in Chelsea, Michigan, employed several hundred male workers.

130
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:44,300
100 employees were selected for inclusion in the study because they had a history of back injury.

131
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:52,909
In the previous six months, another 100 employees were selected for inclusion in the study because they had never had back injury.

132
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:59,600
During the previous six month, the 200 employees were interviewed for a history of heavy lifting on the job.

133
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:08,060
30 of the 100 employees with back injury were classified as completing heavy lifting on the job based on self-report.

134
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:15,140
While only 20 of the 140 employees who never had a back injury were classified as heavy workers.

135
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:25,520
So your exposure is the heavy lifting at work. The outcome is back injury and the study design is a case control.

136
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,620
You've identified cases with the back injury and then identified controls without it.

137
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:37,820
And the justification is they're selected on this basis of having the history of back injury or not.

138
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:49,940
For part two, the figure below is generated from data obtained on individuals randomly selected on an annual basis in Michigan between 2011 and 2020.

139
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:58,240
The Y axis shows the percent of individuals who answered yes to the following question Do you have any kind of health care coverage?

140
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:03,230
The x axis shows the time and year the data were collected.

141
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:10,280
The data are presented by gender, which study design was used to generate the data presented.

142
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:21,500
So for each year you have turn points which are broken down by probably more appropriately sex and gender,

143
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:27,950
and it's that one single point for each year.

144
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:34,910
So it's a cross sectional study using data from different individuals collected at different points in time.

145
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,890
But you basically have a cross section and each year.

146
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:53,119
For the figure below. It shows bladder cancer mortality rate in both hundred 100,000 per year by sex

147
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,110
and total consumption of artificial sweeteners and millions of pounds per year.

148
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:01,100
In the US. Between 1950 and 1969,

149
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:10,460
mortality data were obtained from publicly available data and exposure data were obtained from manufacturers of artificial sweetener.

150
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,819
So as you can see,

151
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:24,440
the dashed line is the consumption of artificial sweeteners and the cancer rate by sex is the solid lines of this is ecologic study,

152
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:36,319
which uses data through multiple years, but it's been quite zoomed out group level, which is how you can tell that you know nothing.

153
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:45,140
Besides, these are males and females in the US and artificial sweetener consumption.

154
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,740
You don't know who they are. Nothing beyond this group level.

155
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,100
And that would be it for today. If you're done a mature assignment.

156
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:09,390
If you're not, then go ahead and do it within 30 minutes of the end of the period.

157
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:17,780
Thank you. First.

158
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:33,670
So.
