1
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:14,220
And good morning, everyone. Great to see you again. We're really lucky today.

2
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:24,450
We have a guest speaker joining us. And I'm going to introduce, uh, to come up and talk today about biological exposure, Professor John Meeker.

3
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,390
John is also a colleague of mine here in Environmental Health Sciences.

4
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,740
John also serves as associate dean for research at the University of Michigan.

5
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,399
And I don't think today he's going to have a chance to go into it at the time.

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:45,570
But when he comes back a little bit later in the semester to talk about Biomarker, you'll get a chance to see some of the really,

7
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:56,100
really cool stuff that John spent much of his career doing with regards to environmental exposures and assessment of adverse impacts on health.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,809
So with that, I'll go ahead and ask John to come up and same, same as usual,

9
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:09,510
and interrupt at any point along the way, interject questions, comments and so forth.

10
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,940
Thanks again, Professor Meeker. Thank you. Good morning.

11
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,260
So they're going to be talking about biological exposures or biological hazards.

12
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,080
So, of course, we could just spend the next several minutes talking about COVID.

13
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:33,410
But I'm not going to do that because there's a lot of other aspects to this that, you know, are important.

14
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:42,450
So we will make some references and comparisons throughout the book, but that's not going to be the sole, sole focus here.

15
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,479
So biological hazards, again,

16
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:54,600
this is one of the three primary categories of hazards that we're concerned with environmental health being chemical, physical.

17
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:09,000
So what I'm trying to do is help you to understand the basic types of biological hazards and routes of exposure,

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,340
which is also very important for this and chemical.

19
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:25,260
And then be familiar with examples of the biological hazards company founder, both occupational and workplace and general environment.

20
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,690
So quiz question what animal kills the most humans globally each year?

21
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:48,660
We can just answer that. You guys have a guess on this one.

22
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:55,350
Mosquitoes. Mosquitoes. This one guess like the cow before.

23
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,630
How do you have a sense of in what way?

24
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,919
No, I just feel like it was some weird trivia question and people were like sharks.

25
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,150
And that was like, no, it's a cow. I don't know, sex rings.

26
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,280
True or not? Yeah. Sometimes you get sharks, you know?

27
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,640
Perception counts. I suppose it could be a number of things that we'll talk about today.

28
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:25,050
You know, we've seen a lot of albums that could be any other thoughts.

29
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,730
Some people, but some good guys.

30
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:39,150
But yeah, that first guess was right on, unfortunately.

31
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:50,100
So, you know, it, it seems like, uh, the more I do this, more perception is changing, which is good, where the rest maybe are aligning with reality.

32
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:58,109
But, uh, you know, a lot of times people will say into the big scary animals, but like at the very top that you can see it very well.

33
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:07,890
What it says a shark is there's about ten little lions, elephants, because it's always kind of a surprising one.

34
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:14,160
You know, they're kind of cute and chubby, but they're actually, I think, pretty mean when it comes down to it.

35
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:20,760
Um, different types of other creepy crawlies down there.

36
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:26,340
But, uh, but yeah, mosquitos because of those, uh, mosquito borne viruses that,

37
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,299
you know, unfortunately in this country is under control most of the time.

38
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,940
But globally is, is, remains a huge problem throughout the world.

39
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:46,380
So it's recessive. So you know what we do, environmental science is, again, a lot of we're talking about chemicals or radiation, things like that.

40
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:56,190
But there's tons of historical photos that these days we're just like horrified because this is somebody being just down to the pesticide DDT.

41
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:03,360
And this is one of those situations where you get into competing risks that you guys will do projects on later this semester.

42
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,780
But, you know, you have mosquitoes that are known to be deadly.

43
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:15,300
And this great new chemical at the time this picture was taken that has been proven to kill mosquitoes very effectively.

44
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,939
Um, then decades later, of course, we found out that that chemical doesn't really go away and,

45
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,320
uh, you know, harms a lot of wildlife and is harmful to humans as well.

46
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:33,720
But again, they were trying, it came from a place of trying to reduce risk in mosquito borne illness.

47
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,600
Speaking of deadly animals, what about what about baby owls?

48
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,690
Those are cute, right? There's nothing wrong around here.

49
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,430
But even something is cute like baby goats. You have a child here about to pet this baby.

50
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:58,710
Go to the petting zoo. Maybe, but it's one that goes through one of the primary reservoirs for something called Q Fever.

51
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:10,560
So again, nothing is really safe depending on what the spirit of that animal is and what it may have been exposed to previously.

52
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:23,770
So just to creep you out a little bit more, here's a bigger list of ads and find some examples of things that could be passed along from them.

53
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:31,089
So you have I have at home two dogs and a cat, and they are with those two types of animals.

54
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,860
Make this list, luckily for me. But you have you know, rabies is a big one.

55
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:45,100
It's luckily not very common, but things like tapeworms, cat scratch, fever, which was just a long time ago.

56
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:56,410
But a is a real thing. And for dogs, again, rabies and other parasites that might be brought in or these might be, you know,

57
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,520
anybody who has a dog, you know, and you take them when you first go to be taken to the vet, they get a lot of shots.

58
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:12,940
This is the thing to prevent. We had mentioned earlier cattle are carriers of a lot of different things that people put on somebody's throat today.

59
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,010
Swine as well. Birds.

60
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,290
And we talk about viruses, you know, bird flu, swine flu and things like that.

61
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:33,700
And what's listed here, that's of course, there's a lot last few years and the quite the written word for a lot of different types of things.

62
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:43,750
So again, just a partial listing of a lot of different types of biological hazards that could be carried by it by various animals.

63
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,410
So before we go further, we're just going to get some of definitions and terminology out of the way.

64
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:57,830
So a biohazard is defined as organism or product of organisms that present health risks to humans.

65
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:06,520
So again, could be the animal itself or something that's that's being passed or derived from the animal or

66
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,700
something else about that interaction between the human or other other type of living organism.

67
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:20,950
Organism here is defined as a living thing that consists of several parts with each part specializing in a particular function.

68
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:33,130
And that's where that becomes a bit of a gray area. A microorganism is a mind organism such as bacteria, fungus and virus as well.

69
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:41,380
And then finally, products of organisms transformed. Cell lines affect total tissue cultures, recombinant DNA, blood, bodily fluids,

70
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:57,580
those types of things that can also carry and pass along some of these pathogens and diseases that it's not used interact with but may not like as.

71
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,650
It can also be. Features.

72
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,400
Okay. So quick question. Sorry to interrupt.

73
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:16,720
Oh, no problem. Going back to the micro-organisms aren't viruses.

74
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,600
Not my name. Right. But. You know what I mean?

75
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,820
But they grow and things. So it's it's complicated because I'm not a virologist.

76
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,020
I'm just going to leave it at that. Cool. Thanks. You won't be the only quizzed on that part.

77
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,260
Okay. I don't think that's a great question.

78
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,590
And that's, you know, that's where it gets a little bit confusing.

79
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,430
Any other questions thus far? Yeah.

80
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,990
Sorry to interrupt at any time.

81
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:58,940
So when we talk about biohazards and risk, the paradigms we use can vary a little bit from what we learn about physical hazards to chemical hazards.

82
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:07,460
One being, you know, sometimes it just takes it's more of a yes or no type of question about exposure.

83
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,530
We talk about chemical hazards. We have a lot of this fancy dose response.

84
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:18,410
We're talking about a lot of standards based on concentrations, perhaps, or amounts.

85
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,970
But with biological hazards, we're usually dealing with yes or no.

86
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,859
Again, that can become more nuanced if you're talking about something like viral load and things like that.

87
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,490
But for the most part, it's more of a dichotomy.

88
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,040
A lot of these that we're talking about, they are present in the environment.

89
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:43,530
No matter what people do and how we want to think about it, they are there and they might be even ubiquitous.

90
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:47,640
If you talk about something like this, fungus is everywhere.

91
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:55,170
So that's another reason why some of these approaches we use for other other hazards aren't really feasible.

92
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:05,770
The way we our biological systems respond to biohazards is quite variable and

93
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,819
plays a very large role and it does for the other types of hazards as well,

94
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:16,270
but for biological have been recognized for a much longer period of time that the that interaction

95
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:23,950
with our our biological processes is very important and can do some unpredictable things,

96
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,349
you know, as we've seen with certain susceptible cell populations.

97
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,460
Right. That has to do with militarism, makes it complicated.

98
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,980
And then finally, interaction of host environment to produce effects.

99
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,120
That's not something you always see with physical evidence. For example, radiation.

100
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:49,240
We have pretty good grasp of what it is, where it comes from and how it interacts with tissue.

101
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:56,739
That's pretty you know, it's it's complicated, complex because there's a lot of physics involved.

102
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:04,930
But it's it's fairly on a, you know, high level view, fairly straightforward biological cancers.

103
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,500
So when we're talking about pathogens and biological hazards,

104
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:20,030
a quick mention of what's called the epidemiological triad, where you have the pathogen itself,

105
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:28,010
they're concerned about, well, typically you have some sort of course that's carrying that happens because most of these can't live just on their own.

106
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:34,640
Some can, but with some other infectious pathogen,

107
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,370
a lot of times it does require a host and some sort of environment requirement

108
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:44,930
that is conducive to the host being around the pathogen being left around.

109
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,340
And and those two come together. That's where you might form.

110
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:03,579
So where a lot of these things that we're talking about, again, this is not necessary for everything, but the goal is to occur in Egypt.

111
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:11,200
That is pathogenic a reservoir that's sufficient to mount the ability to escape the

112
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:18,579
reservoir either through a vector or by accidentally coming into contact with it.

113
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,360
One way or another, agent must be able to move through the environment.

114
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:31,600
There must be a portable entry into the host. That's when we talk about exposure routes, and then the host can't just fight it off and be okay,

115
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,070
or at least some subset of the population is going to get.

116
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,680
So that's what becomes clear. That's sort of the way out of.

117
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,930
So some important factors.

118
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:58,590
So for any of these hazards, we're going to spotlight today and consider some of these factors that's going to give you information on,

119
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,460
you know, just how dangerous is it? How much of a risk is that compared to other things?

120
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,230
And how might we approach preventing that happening or at least reducing?

121
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:14,139
So one is the mode of transmission that is contact vector borne by vector.

122
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:20,709
When we're talking about something that's an intermediary between those hospitals that we talked about,

123
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:32,160
this vector borne diseases is how they're so that these could be airborne exposures.

124
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,370
So all of these are very important factors to consider.

125
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:46,040
Early on in COVID, they were talking about fomites, what's on surfaces, everybody cleaning all their surfaces,

126
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:51,560
wiping down the groceries, leaving classrooms with every train, every class was wiped out.

127
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:58,549
But, you know, through work by Professor Dubon and other colleagues and others around the world and through observation,

128
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:05,060
as we get a grasp on the disease, it became clear that it's much more airborne inhalation.

129
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,530
It's much, much greater risk.

130
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:16,600
So these are the types of things that don't help your risk management strategies to try to prevent infection around entry.

131
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,799
We'll talk about the dose. So again, which as I mentioned, there's not really a dose response.

132
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:28,700
But, you know, there are cases where they have shown that the viral load could be an important factor of.

133
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,680
The viability and virulence of the agent, so viability as its ability to replicate and the virulence physically caused disease.

134
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:50,400
Those are two factors that should be how much spread and how it's going to be able to thrive in that human population.

135
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:58,530
And then finally host susceptibility to a lot of different things skin disorders with age, for example, immune system,

136
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:06,930
people who can't get the vaccine, that particular vaccine, maternal fetal considerations,

137
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:14,490
regional exposures, things like work practices are important. So there's a lot of host factors that might play a role.

138
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,070
Um, so this is kind of interesting for if you had seen this, this symbol before.

139
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,710
So it's kind of sort of, you know, I hadn't thought about this, so I looked into it.

140
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,450
So it's a very recognizable symbol. I just assumed it's been around forever.

141
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:43,040
And it was, you know, the thing that was just everyone knew all the time, but actually was developed just in 1966,

142
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,860
which, you know, in the grand scheme of things wasn't that long ago by Dow Chemical of all places.

143
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,860
So as part is hazardous hazard communication, they really like to use symbols.

144
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,370
So, you know, you can go globally. You don't have to think about translating languages.

145
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,069
Something that's easy to see is something that, you know,

146
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:10,370
if you're on the go and you're packaging something that is that type of hazard that you can actually just kind of draw it on there if needed.

147
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,840
So for for biological hazards, they needed something like that.

148
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:22,160
They wanted it to be striking to draw immediate attention because people, hey, this is a dangerous thing.

149
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:28,160
And with a particular symbol, it can tell you it's it's a biological hazard versus something like radiation.

150
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,759
They want to be unique and unambiguous, quickly recognized, easily stenciled.

151
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:44,329
Again, if you need to quickly add that to that warning for other people and then symmetrical.

152
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,460
So it doesn't matter like if you have a sticker, they put it on a package, doesn't matter what directions.

153
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:55,940
So the process they used was they would have a panel of participants or a survey where

154
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:01,219
they had a bunch of different symbols that they had designed for this biohazard use,

155
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:07,310
for instance, specifically. But also a lot of people would probably recognize criminals from elsewhere.

156
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,900
So oil companies, Red Cross, there's Mr. Peanut there.

157
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,300
I don't know if those are the ones they were actually talking about, but, you know,

158
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:21,260
we had people take the survey and they recognized a lot of those, you know, corporate ones.

159
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:29,090
And then they took a retest a while later and added even some more.

160
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:39,470
And it turned out this orange one with the black circles really stood out through this testing so that it became clear to them,

161
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:45,830
you know, some scientific way that this would be a good signal to use for for biological pathways.

162
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:51,610
So anyways, that's just common side of that simple thing.

163
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:59,630
So let's get back into our whirlwind tour of biological hazards.

164
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:09,830
So here are six main types of different biological hazards for agents on top left here we have bacteria.

165
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:19,009
The next one is fungi. We have parasites, viruses, other viruses.

166
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:30,160
And prior and I'll go through each of these. The first one is bacteria and for each of them, if anyone's interested.

167
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:41,830
The holidays coming up. Gift idea. You can find stuffed animals that we kind of accused of.

168
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:52,570
So bacteria or simple ones, an organism, a common example that is people, which is, of course, a concern.

169
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:58,660
So we understand, for example, bacteria can take on three different shapes, which helps.

170
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,170
So it's a it's a very large category.

171
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,390
And one way there's subcategories is how is an appearance and shape.

172
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:17,530
And there's three primary ones. So bacilli, it's gorilla obsession, more of a round shape, slightly more shaped.

173
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,830
And then the sprue, as the name suggests, more of a spiral.

174
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:26,770
And that's one way to categorize. Again, it's a very broad class.

175
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,160
Some bacteria are pathogenic, like people.

176
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:35,890
A lot are harmless in their way and some are even useful.

177
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,820
So can you think of a useful example?

178
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:45,340
Bacteria beneficial?

179
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,880
Yeah. I mean, I don't know the official names, but like the bacteria in your gut.

180
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:56,950
Yeah, gut bacteria for sure. Which is a huge universe in and of itself.

181
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:07,210
The bacteria we use in labs to generate different biological products used for medicines use in the pharmaceutical development.

182
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:12,610
I think there's bacteria on your skin that helps kill harmful bacteria.

183
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:19,840
Bacteria. And like fermented fermented products like Florida or yogurt or.

184
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,460
Yeah, a lot of foods. We eat less. You know their hand.

185
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,980
Yeah. A lot of bacteria. The microbiomes of our bodies has become a.

186
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:38,069
Rapidly developing field because it is such a diverse universe of microorganisms

187
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:43,830
that we live with that benefit from or we're not trying to use that or no one.

188
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:49,920
Environmental related is for contamination remediation.

189
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:57,060
Sometimes they use bioremediation and what types of bacteria as well operate down.

190
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:06,540
So bacteria can go either way. So. So it's a broad class.

191
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:13,110
The next one is fungi. So this is an even bigger class.

192
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:23,250
There's a ton of different types out there that can be broken down as either parasitic sap or phytic.

193
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:30,180
Meaning they need to put a lot of other living organisms or they get nourishment from cooking.

194
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,800
So so springtime, anybody do.

195
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:43,950
It's kind of a it's a fun hobby that we're all after. They taste good.

196
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:52,950
But, you know, if you're out trying to do that, they have pointers on where to look and there's certain types of decaying trees that they like from.

197
00:22:53,580 --> 00:23:05,580
So that's the simple them. And then, you know, ones that we live with that need a living organism when it comes to environmental.

198
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:15,210
One big concern is hypersensitivity. So an allergic reaction that gets developed from supportive agents.

199
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:21,960
So allergies, seasonal allergies is a big one. We talked about higher spores.

200
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:35,490
There's also occupational diseases related to exposure to these, you know, from decaying or improperly stored cotton and other things.

201
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:41,819
It's dry. A list is long. So that's one, you know.

202
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:50,340
And in our everyday lives, things like athlete's foot can go to pharmacy advice, treatment or those are all so much.

203
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:58,970
There's also, you know, the you might hear in the indoor air quality world, Whac-A-Mole.

204
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:05,830
That would be another example of that. The next group is parasites.

205
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:10,870
So we need a living planet animal to live itself.

206
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:17,590
And a big one here is malaria. So back to mosquito borne viruses for mosquito borne diseases.

207
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:30,010
In this case, it's a parasite. Some other examples here are microscope, roundworm, hookworm, tapeworm, toad, etc.

208
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,680
So there's a lot of different types. Again, their level of danger involved is going to vary greatly.

209
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:46,089
A lot of skin conditions related to this scabies I think would be another one.

210
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:50,110
But here we have figures as examples.

211
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:55,400
So that's parasites. Next group is arbovirus.

212
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:09,490
So another one that is this is a vector borne virus and it gets its name from not Ann Arbor.

213
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:15,220
But arthropod borne virus knows what an arthropod is.

214
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,850
They're like insects are like bugs.

215
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:32,410
So that's they get their own class here. And there's a long list of things that we get from arthropods or bugs, mosquitoes being a major one.

216
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:50,610
But there are others as well. Think about ticks. But dengue fever, yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, Zika virus, West Nile disease are worse.

217
00:25:52,060 --> 00:26:00,070
And we have other viruses that don't that aren't classified as being passed on by arthropods.

218
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:06,070
These are the smallest known organisms. Again, I'm not going to get into a list living, I don't know.

219
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:13,930
But these are considered obligate parasites so they're not truly alive and that they can only function.

220
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:22,720
So occupationally or environment.

221
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,450
So chicken pox, apparently. Monkeypox, norovirus.

222
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:33,030
That's a big one. You know, I've kids at school in the every year.

223
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:41,860
Influenza, of course Corona virus and Ebola as well as.

224
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,680
The final group here is around the snow, and it's kind of a combination of words.

225
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:55,140
So it's a protein that causes infection, protein infection.

226
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:01,650
And these are more rare, but typically much, much more serious.

227
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,270
So one example is bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

228
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,310
Anybody know the street name for that? That's right.

229
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:21,840
And so we have these proteins from, you know, don't quite know how that works.

230
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:31,230
But the wrong thing and contain these can cause encephalopathy, brain disease.

231
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:38,340
So these are similar to a viral infection where in this case you have a misfolded protein molecule.

232
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:48,110
So property damage and typically affect the structure of the brain, internal tissues and how to do that.

233
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:55,440
They are primarily fatal once contracted and they're a little bit difficult to control.

234
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:02,880
So it's a good thing that the rare but when they do appear, it tends to be a very big deal for a lot of people.

235
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,930
But that could change, of course, through through a lot of research.

236
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,040
Yeah. Are they common in, like, cannibalism?

237
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,000
Not just with humans, but like what we're seeing in these?

238
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:25,560
Maybe if you trace that tell to be from eating frame that or other also, then they're also one for like people who like.

239
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:30,200
Yeah. Like their dead relatives. Right. Yeah.

240
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,650
So that's potentially a key unifying factor.

241
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:42,350
Yeah. There's there's a range of them historically, some kind of results tails of how they.

242
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,720
It's so kind of backing up.

243
00:28:51,990 --> 00:29:00,210
So those were the five main categories we think about. Now we're going to start talking about exposure now that we've got a sense of what these are.

244
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:05,370
How do we come in contact and what types of situations do we want to be aware of?

245
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:14,400
So for the biohazards that we encounter all the time, you know, we kind of know, but we think about occupational settings.

246
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:18,930
There's a lot of jobs out there that you might be more likely to come across.

247
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,650
Certain biohazards health care of course.

248
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,280
Touch on a little bit here. Research facilities,

249
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:31,799
we're in one right now where we might have some somethings luckily in are very highly

250
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:37,650
controlled biosafety level designations and a lot of controls that come with that.

251
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:47,219
Agriculture is a big one. I grew up on a farm. There's just tons of biohazards around everywhere you look.

252
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:52,860
Basically that facilities, biotech, sort of like the research facilities.

253
00:29:53,770 --> 00:30:01,940
Forestry is a big one. I think about after plant seeds, arboviruses, health care, sewage processing.

254
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:08,100
So this is just a partial list. And there's two things you can think of with all the jobs.

255
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:15,160
Um, you know, people working outdoors, you have poison ivy, other things like that.

256
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:28,720
Um, health care settings are special because sometimes, you know, you bring in people that might have a certain disease.

257
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:36,460
You have a lot going on. So there's three classifications for infections that occur where there's community acquired.

258
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:45,360
So that should be. Things like provenance, occasionally fire resulting from worker exposure.

259
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:58,450
So that's because work as a doctor, nurse or other staff and they get sick from catching something at work and then nosocomial.

260
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,900
This is problematic for the health care facilities.

261
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:06,770
This is hospital acquired infections of patients and that can be from, you know,

262
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:16,510
not properly proper protocols in handling the patients patient's right instruments and sterilization processes.

263
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:22,480
And, you know, this ends up being big money usually for them in lawsuits.

264
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:33,250
If this happens, we want to get to the bottom of it. All of these, of course, health care acquired infections.

265
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:39,940
The cause is unknown, about 80% of them. But of those 20%, they have been able to trace down.

266
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:45,880
A lot of that is from human error, you know, misplacing an instrument and using it again or some other type of.

267
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:54,660
Products that might be contaminated. There's a lot of all of these things that might be made.

268
00:31:55,170 --> 00:32:04,740
So some of our equipment. So there's been a lot of work in this area and other places, too, to reduce these types of guns.

269
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:16,620
Now we're going to get into Roots of Exposure. Again, this is similar to what you'd see for chemical agents.

270
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:22,290
But some differences. In this case, percutaneous is going to be much more common.

271
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:29,310
That's where it goes through the skin with something sharp being injected.

272
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:44,040
Regular dermal exposure will be determined on, for instance, inhalation and just reserved for me exposure or biological agents.

273
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:53,760
So we'll go through each of these. A good example to use to differentiate differentiate them as anthrax.

274
00:32:54,270 --> 00:33:00,180
So this is a biological agent that is caused by a bacterium.

275
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:05,460
So sorry, my Latin is no good.

276
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:17,400
But it can increase your exposure to be skin exposure of inhalation or ingestion.

277
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:29,310
So cutaneous or dermal skin exposure to anthrax, that's the most common type of exposure.

278
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:41,700
Incubation period of 1 to 12 days. And you have a symptom of a small but very small ulcer with black center and some general symptoms.

279
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:47,440
So it's an exposure. You may see that movie out of the dog.

280
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:59,380
Last year won a bunch of awards. Netflix. I'm not going to spoil anything, but Anthrax does make an appearance in that for suggestions about anthrax.

281
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:05,340
Check it out again. So that's an exposure.

282
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:11,250
On the other hand, if you have inhalation exposure, it's going to manifest much differently.

283
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:14,640
So when it's inhaled, it's highly lethal.

284
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:22,620
Incubation period is going to be different 1 to 7, but they've seen as much as two months of an incubation period following exposure.

285
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:29,700
You have different symptoms, sore throat and then eventually potentially respiratory failure and shock.

286
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,680
And about three quarters of people die.

287
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:38,160
So just 911 was just the other day.

288
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,150
So, you know, you have the events of 911. But shortly after that,

289
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:50,340
there are a lot of instances of bioterrorism where letters and packages were being sent to congresspeople or whatever it might be,

290
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:58,139
containing white powder that some of it was actually processed in the lab anthrax.

291
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:05,910
So so to get inhalable anthrax, it does need to undergo some pretty high tech processing.

292
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:11,250
But that's why it's so concerned. Bioterrorism point of view is because it is so real.

293
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:17,490
Yeah. Are the spores, like made by the bacteria or are they made of the bacteria?

294
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,120
They're made of it. But don't quote me on that right now.

295
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:32,670
It's been a while since I really thought about it, but I think it is.

296
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,050
That's why it doesn't. Luckily, it doesn't exist.

297
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:48,610
Inhalation form very often is the reason it's so lethal in your lungs as it forms those ulcers that you get subcutaneous in your lungs or I mean,

298
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:55,020
does is it highly bioactive? So. Oh, yeah, I just wasn't sure if it was the same type of lesion.

299
00:35:55,080 --> 00:36:01,220
Yeah. Your lungs are pretty great questions.

300
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:09,450
So in any event, and then that turned out a lot of them were fake threats because, you know, white powder.

301
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:15,810
So but you have to respond to it as if. And so that created for for a few years there.

302
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:22,590
It got a little crazy. And finally, you can also be exposed.

303
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:28,620
Oh, is there a question over. Oh, sorry. Through ingestion.

304
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:34,590
So the gastrointestinal tract. And that could be from eating undercooked tainted needs.

305
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:43,590
Incubation period again about a one day a week similar symptoms but a different be tolerated a lower fatality rate.

306
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:56,850
So that's just one example, illustrating how a relative exposure can dictate how how risky or how dangerous a particular agent might be.

307
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,740
You may find the answer to the question is four questions.

308
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:12,120
So the little cells that are produced by the fungi, you don't see that they're necessarily the fungi, but it's kind of like pollen.

309
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:20,010
Tiny little. Yeah. Thank you. Okay.

310
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,300
So a little bit more on percutaneous exposure.

311
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:33,630
So occupationally Sharps injuries is a big one among the drug users.

312
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:45,060
It's not pretty minimal bites, but twice as many ones that were quick to know about needle stick injuries that was here.

313
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:50,970
So this has been a problem for quite some time. It's still out there in a high priority area,

314
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:59,580
but there's hundreds of thousands of needles to other related sharps injuries, health care settings each year.

315
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:07,610
And of course, these can be a big mode of transmission for biological agents.

316
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:13,950
So nearly half of these are thought to go underreported by the committee.

317
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:22,889
Thoughts on why? There's a lot of paperwork you have to fill out paperwork.

318
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:35,940
So it's a burden to to report that other people might not think would be embarrassing that like maybe the procedure was done wrong.

319
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:41,850
Yeah. They don't want to be seen as having done something wrong for sure.

320
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:52,330
You know, the thought is the have just in hospital based settings or is it in the general population because of its general population?

321
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:55,440
I would imagine people would be concerned about what this is referring to.

322
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,220
But yeah, let's see what I have here.

323
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:03,989
Just not knowing that that's a problem. Hopefully that's that's becoming less of an issue.

324
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:08,470
But, you know, of where you are, especially if you think globally,

325
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:19,440
maybe there's a lot of knowledge that that is something that should be of great concern, perception of it as a low risk impact event, you know.

326
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:24,640
Oh, I just got caught. Oh, okay.

327
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,809
So I've got a reporting burden, that's for sure.

328
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:31,290
One. And then kind of along the lines of what was said, you know,

329
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:41,340
you're have the perception that you're doing something wrong or you might get reprimanded at work for not doing so.

330
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:46,530
A lot of reasons why a. It's very important.

331
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:51,359
So the major concerns here are any kind of a lot of different types of occasions,

332
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:57,780
but some of the main ones that have been documented are HIV and hepatitis B and C,

333
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,990
and, you know, not every time every needle sticks can result in an infection.

334
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:14,160
But, you know, again, because it is such a common thing that could happen to me very carefully.

335
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:21,320
Health care workers. So. There might be some nursing students in here.

336
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:31,310
About half of all diagnostic injuries occur. Nurses have other technologies phlebotomists, surgery attendant, others.

337
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:38,660
So that's who it's it's happening to. You know, obviously, people are handling these objects the most likely.

338
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:43,860
And then when is it happening? During the use of the item.

339
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:55,790
Here is about half after use before disposal and about 30% that were there and then other disposal related types of activities.

340
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:59,420
And then with what you have, a syringe is about a third.

341
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:04,010
Suture, needle, catheter, scalpel, etc.

342
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,549
So what we've been able to do that.

343
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:12,500
So that is led to some prevention approaches.

344
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:19,879
They've done a lot with technology of different types of needles is how it's disposed of, things like that.

345
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:27,410
So of the needle itself, of the practices used, it's a group of questions or comments or experiences with that.

346
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:34,399
Our question is, is there like 3% of the injuries come from recapping that you've seen,

347
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,570
you know, in my field at least, and that's just like not allowed in health care.

348
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:47,720
Are you supposed to recap? This isn't all the data set. So that might be one of the ways in which they used previous information to improve.

349
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:54,230
So yeah, you would hope that the technology and the needles of the types of different types of needles,

350
00:41:54,530 --> 00:42:01,040
most of them you probably don't need to recap based on that new technology, but there might be some instances, I don't know.

351
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:09,260
But yeah, I agree with Richard because there has been a lot of effort to try to reduce or eliminate some of these events.

352
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:16,170
So if you want, for instance, during use of item because I,

353
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:25,490
I would assume that after use is when the most concerned because the there's a chance for blood between the patient and caretaker.

354
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:35,390
But if they sick themselves before they stick the patient in there, then maybe go the other way.

355
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,960
Right. Well I would hope that they would get the needle.

356
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:45,360
Yeah. Right. So during use I assume it's just sort of the whole act.

357
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,770
But yeah, that's a great point of progression.

358
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:53,000
Well, this also includes scalpels and needles, which you're like.

359
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,320
It's not like a syringe, so you're not just using it in one instance,

360
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:04,100
like you're sewing up some of the use definition of use might very like what that it feels.

361
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:11,860
But but great questions. I appreciate how you guys are thinking about.

362
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:16,000
I ask what it is and where the points of risk may be.

363
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:25,250
It's kind of embarrassing, but I was a full miss and Children's Hospital and I stuck myself with it all and didn't tell anybody.

364
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:34,100
I told my trainer and the little kid just ripped out and it turned to me and instead of reporting it because we wanted to avoid the paperwork,

365
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:38,270
we just looked up all the labs to see if the kid had anything that was worth it.

366
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:41,030
And then we were like, Oh, whatever, it's fine. They look like they're okay.

367
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:47,809
And I think that that's probably why 50% go unreported because that's like what you do.

368
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:53,660
But during the use of the item, especially in the kids that are so wriggly and their brains are so small,

369
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,870
that sometimes I think that's for a lot of the folks come.

370
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,230
But I'm one of those unreported cases.

371
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:03,740
Excellent. First, first, first hand account. Okay.

372
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:11,990
So, yeah, I mean, the fact that we have one here, just suggest it might be even much more common than we think.

373
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,920
It is a tricky one to crack that one. I think that's needed.

374
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:21,920
Like I said, there's been a lot of work with retractable needles and other things, but it can still be there.

375
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:28,520
Yeah, I'll just interject really quickly. I mean, this the slides that Professor Meek is presenting is referencing CDC.

376
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:33,920
So very likely it's us based, right. And that's where most of the data is.

377
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:43,820
But so much of this is still we're focusing on the US and how much of the class does, but there's, you know, the rest of the world.

378
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:49,280
And so when we're talking about different technologies that are available to help mitigate, um,

379
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:54,950
things like this and this is, you know, broadly across the exposure spectrum, not just dealing with needle sticks,

380
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:59,719
but certainly once you go to low income countries and what types of technologies are available

381
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:05,300
will certainly play an important role for safety measures that might be available or not.

382
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:14,910
I also I'm just curious in terms of like labor laws and like the expectations of medical professionals and the shift.

383
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:21,620
Like my partner just came off a 24 hour shift as an intern and like, you know, they're exhausted.

384
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,180
So like, how many of these things also like not reporting as well as like I wonder how

385
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:32,150
much increases like the longer shift like could be related to this fatigue.

386
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:38,600
And you know, when I was talking about hospital, you know, there's real reasons.

387
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:44,660
So it's something that comes with the punches, you know, things, right?

388
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:52,010
Yeah. It does happen in a real sleep deprivation issue throughout the health care industry.

389
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:58,880
As you know, as we've seen the last couple years of overwork, stress, all of those things could play a role for sure.

390
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:06,360
All right. Moving on with some other examples.

391
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,920
These are things that keep my kids up at night, I guess.

392
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:18,930
Well, you know what? I'm okay with spiders, you know? The big the big bad ones I don't like, but I'm a snake.

393
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:24,210
Those guys just can't deal with snakes and scorpions.

394
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:32,910
So these are also examples of certain things because they will treat the skin and the bloodstream.

395
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,399
So that went strictly through the scan.

396
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,290
You can also have exposure.

397
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:54,930
That's not necessarily objective, but it's on the skin and you can have some permeation or other ways it gets through other, other types of things.

398
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:03,870
Example of that is Ebola panic, fever, rising fever.

399
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:09,300
This occurs from time to time.

400
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:17,220
The most recent of large outbreaks was 2014 to 16 in Africa.

401
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:21,600
There were as of they stopped counting, I think, at some point.

402
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:27,230
But for this particular outbreak, about 20,000 cases and 11,000 deaths.

403
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:34,260
So it's highly fatal and it is transferred through.

404
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:43,759
I think you're good with the hemorrhaging. You have a lot of bodily fluids that are expressed in those bodily fluids,

405
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,390
then can get on another person and through the mucous membranes of the skin.

406
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:51,890
That's how it's passed. So it's not like an airborne thing or anything like that.

407
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:57,410
This is through that, not contagious. Transmission.

408
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:05,040
So with that, luckily, it isn't as contagious.

409
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:10,980
You know, when we talk about in the real world how we measure how contagious something is,

410
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:18,360
is by something called the basic reproduction number or not zero.

411
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:24,420
So this is the number of cases that one case generates over the average infectious period.

412
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:30,540
And so fortunately for Ebola, it's not just for every case.

413
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,180
You're going to see one or two additional cases.

414
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:42,360
When you get into some of these other routes of exposure, primarily the airborne ones, you can get much, much higher.

415
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,530
These are not value depends on duration of infectivity.

416
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:56,350
How long are you able to pass them on to somebody else? If it's not the texture of the agent and the number of susceptible people.

417
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:04,840
So does anybody know what four COVID with the R is for that?

418
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:14,480
It's kind of a weird concept because it depends on so many things and it's kind of a lagging indicator.

419
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:19,100
But early on, they're talking in this 2 to 5 range.

420
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,150
But then, you know, when you have a lockdown, you don't have that opportunity.

421
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:27,830
So that's a way to reduce that. Are you actually.

422
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:36,740
So so it's really kind of a weird descriptor because it is it does a number of things.

423
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:46,590
And, you know, some place like Manhattan that's very densely populated, the hour is going to probably look different than maybe the Montana.

424
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:50,430
Right. Because there's just not that number of susceptible.

425
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:56,120
So but it is something that is even to infectious disease.

426
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:03,690
You see why these? Luckily, we've done a great job with vaccines of prevention,

427
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:11,550
but see why they were another reason why they were a great concern that they're more common is that they're much more infectious.

428
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:19,260
Express Is this an art not value for the mode of transmission as well?

429
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:24,629
I notice HIV aids as sexual contact and we also know it can happen through maternal

430
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:29,020
fetal transmission as well as probably just because they have limited or only those,

431
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:35,220
the primary concern for transmission. I just like thinking of like the monkeypox issues right now.

432
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:39,990
Absolutely. Yeah, it can be definitely more complex, that's for sure.

433
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:56,780
All right. The next real exposure is inhalation. So another term that you might become familiar with is bio aerosols.

434
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,670
So we talk about aerosols. We're talking about something dust, dust or particulate matter.

435
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:05,540
Those are aerosols. This could be a fiber.

436
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:12,200
But when it's something that's living or coming from a living thing, we tend to refer bio aerosols.

437
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:16,340
So this could be the microorganism itself. Of.

438
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:31,870
It's something from the original, from a living organism, could be fragments that are pollen spores, toxins that are developed by a particulate waste.

439
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:38,110
So cockroaches cause a lot of issues with allergies.

440
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:42,100
It's not that they all look cells. It's what they're giving off.

441
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,960
They can also have hazardous.

442
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:51,790
This is where you might be into the chemical agents is that some organisms can prevent vapors that might be toxic as well.

443
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:59,180
So a lot of different ways in which you're concerned and a lot of different pieces of debris, you know.

444
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,970
Back to that great question about the best practice for.

445
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:08,470
It's somewhere somewhere out there.

446
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:26,270
An example here is aflatoxin so aspergillus levels so this occurs is can grow crops that aren't properly stored in various parts of the world.

447
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:29,270
It is known to be extremely toxic agent.

448
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:42,170
It's actually been used to bioterrorism as well, but it's the most carcinogenic that we know of naturally forming compound.

449
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:48,410
And as with a lot of things, it hasn't been known about all that long.

450
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:54,920
So discovered in 1968 when they had something called the Turkey X Disease that killed

451
00:52:55,250 --> 00:53:00,380
hundreds of thousands of of them through tainted peanuts that were used in them.

452
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:06,860
So, you know, in this country, peanut butter is tested regularly.

453
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:14,200
But again, when we talk about global health everywhere.

454
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:24,510
Our cultural practices are consistent everywhere, climatic conditions that might be conducive to this system.

455
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:29,040
That's just one example of something that could grow and be.

456
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:37,050
Another one is Legionella bacteria. This dates back to 1976.

457
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:43,800
This is Bellevue, Stratford Hotel.

458
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:47,550
2000 people attending an American Legion conference.

459
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:55,500
And during that conference, 25 deaths and 130 hospitalizations due to this.

460
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:02,430
Legionella and Legionnaires disease.

461
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:14,100
And it was from tainted water in the cooling tower process that we get recycled and start to grow this bacteria that was aerosolized.

462
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:25,170
So. I mean, this is still an issue, but they have regulations based on.

463
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:38,950
Another example is Respiratory Syndrome or Birds Coronavirus from 2015.

464
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:52,790
So this was depicted originated in the Middle East, they thought and had 2591 cases in total yesterday.

465
00:54:54,140 --> 00:55:02,950
They keep updating it, but that sort of 35% case fatality rate, which is quite high.

466
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,120
So how does that compare with SARS-CoV-2?

467
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:15,830
So seeing something that's not as infectious, it doesn't appear that much more serious.

468
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:28,020
So again, the viruses can vary quite a bit from those types of things.

469
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:44,390
The last round of exposure is ingestion. So the concerns here are, you know, biological agents, pathogens in our food and water supply.

470
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:53,960
But you can have it a congestion that could be a concern as well as people do have a lot of hands off contact, particularly children.

471
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:59,719
So you might not take, but these are concerns.

472
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:08,090
This is from the water. So the data show here, again, as is some of these large scale data estimates,

473
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:14,269
there usually is quite a lag getting that information compiled, but I think it gets the point across.

474
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:20,419
So again, sort of us focused here for the moment, we'll see the food supply.

475
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:24,080
But even here we get an estimated 48 million cases,

476
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:35,450
120,000 hospitalizations and several thousand deaths right now with all the checks that we have here.

477
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:51,900
A couple of examples. In the early nineties, Jack in the Box restaurant and we've been to one of these California spring break,

478
00:56:52,710 --> 00:57:00,060
we went to one, but yeah, in this case, 623 people were infected and four died.

479
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:07,920
So this was headline news at the time. You know, and there's some interesting detective work that goes on.

480
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:13,850
They have people showing up with a particular disease, in this case, all of the public work.

481
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:17,560
And you see, of course, then they start doing investigative work to see, you know,

482
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:26,129
what activities did you do, what did you eat, what types of grocery stores or restaurants, the products.

483
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:31,500
Right. So they could trace it back to this restaurant in this case.

484
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:39,000
Here's a good one. Food Safety Summit, Baltimore, Maryland.

485
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:42,820
So this is an international is here.

486
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:48,720
And one of my courses that help pull some of these slides for reasons why I was working there at the time.

487
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:56,759
And she went to this conference and they had a dinner at the conference and it turns out there was contaminated chicken.

488
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:03,990
So most people at this food safety conference after that actually got so ironic.

489
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:12,000
But it does it does happen that yeah, this is a weird one.

490
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:17,720
So this was a bioterror attack in 1984.

491
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:21,540
I think there's actually a documentary on this that I've been meaning to watch.

492
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:32,040
I did not watch it. Yeah, you're right that it could have been shorter because they made it like a whole ten episode series.

493
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:43,980
I should have been like one. So this was the group following this, this man out of Oregon and I had a group of followers,

494
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:51,870
and he was wanting to run in a local election and they wanted to increase his chances of winning that election.

495
00:58:51,870 --> 00:59:02,310
So they went around to restaurants in the area and added salmonella to the salad bars, things, and a bunch of people got sick from that.

496
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:09,570
So it's a very strange setting of approach. But again, through some detective work, they were able to trace it back.

497
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:21,450
That's true. So again, if you're interested, there's a lot of documentation of this about drinking water.

498
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:26,400
So again, the US is very safe water compared to the rest of the world.

499
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:37,140
But even here and recently, you know, or whatever that was in case of illness and so that's just from unsafe water.

500
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:45,930
The numbers, of course, can be higher. Other parts of the world, the example here of an outbreak, again, early nineties.

501
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:50,760
This case in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,

502
00:59:52,080 --> 01:00:06,500
is the largest ever outbreak in the U.S. Our source of parasite results in over 100,000 residents infected and was extremely expensive to produce.

503
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:14,420
How to change their disinfection so the water disinfection isn't a big deal.

504
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:18,350
Saves a lot of lives. But with that, a lot of times they're adding chemicals.

505
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:25,200
So chlorination, disinfection byproducts, that's something the chemical plants are growing.

506
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:29,630
But even though we have a very safe water supply here.

507
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:39,990
They're astonishing. So we've talked about the different types of biological hazards, different ways in which we're exposed.

508
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:52,260
So when we go to the risks and the hazard, we want to think about these issues.

509
01:00:52,860 --> 01:01:04,380
Infectious dose. And that dose response is not sort of the same as we think about with the root pathogenicity and virulence, the host range vectors.

510
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:12,860
It's how we prevent and treat it and the houses and other of.

511
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:20,800
So those are some of the considerations. All right.

512
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:25,060
So then just a little bit more on vector borne diseases.

513
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:34,720
So these are very important. We talked about mosquitoes. Here's a limited set of examples somewhere.

514
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:41,290
Where is a huge one? Plague actually does contain does still happen.

515
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:48,400
Right now, what spreads? Plague rodents, isn't it fleas?

516
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:55,710
Yeah. Rodents, usually prairie dogs is one that you when I was first diagnosed with.

517
01:01:55,790 --> 01:02:01,260
People don't see like feces, I would say a lot.

518
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:08,140
But these days in the U.S., it's going to be almost where there are lots of wild animals.

519
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:19,930
What similar ones? Yellow fever, West Nile Rift Valley fever is a big one.

520
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:24,880
I have a research project in Puerto Rico, and they they still they deal with this one quite a bit.

521
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:29,080
And a bunch of other ones as well.

522
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:45,690
This is sort of older data, but you get the picture, that vector borne disease, you know, in the US it's a concern, but it's not as much of a concern.

523
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,790
Go to South America. Parts of South Asia which.

524
01:02:57,570 --> 01:03:03,430
Concern Dengue fever. Here's just an example of the increase in dengue fever.

525
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:08,280
Again, there might be a lot of reasons for this, but population density.

526
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:13,110
You first. Lecture. That's cool. This is worst.

527
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:19,400
One more people as more and more hosts or against population.

528
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:27,680
I have chances for this. There's also resistance to things.

529
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:34,760
You know, mosquitoes over time can develop resistance to certain pesticides or other forms of control.

530
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:40,700
Is climate a concern about climate as well? Sorry, I forgot that.

531
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:55,010
Yeah. With the, you know, more tropical type of climate is conducive to these types of vectors, I think when we talk about us.

532
01:03:55,970 --> 01:04:00,230
One example is West Nile virus and it varies.

533
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:06,589
But again, over the course of just seven years here, from 2000 to 2006,

534
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:13,340
you can see how it increases and it kind of changes location for some of these reasons.

535
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:25,560
Another U.S. concern and one here in Michigan is.

536
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:34,420
Tick borne disease. So one being Lyme disease, and they're seeing more and more cases of this.

537
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:40,240
Much to my dismay, every spring they're like, oh, the tick population is going to be even worse this year.

538
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,470
It seems like they see that every year and that results in.

539
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:55,290
So they do track this and there's a concern, again, climate change might be conducive to increased.

540
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:03,630
And increase development as well might help solve these issues.

541
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:08,500
Right. Yeah. There's also an aspect of resistance that may be developing.

542
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:14,190
I work in the vet field and we have some of our dogs that will summer with their owners in New England.

543
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:20,160
And they're already on two types of like flea and tick preventatives and they'll still get tick borne diseases.

544
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:23,760
Yep. And that's a fairly good thing. Great point. Thank you.

545
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:28,140
So, yeah, again, an example of resistance to our prevention methods.

546
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:34,180
So. Revising.

547
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:41,740
And, you know, a lot of these prevention treatments have there onerous pesticides themselves are toxic.

548
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:51,839
Again, that balancing at risk. And so just a lot of a lot of issues out there that continue to happen.

549
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:58,500
These are, you know, in the last ten years or so, it happens all the time.

550
01:05:58,510 --> 01:06:08,340
So the Flint water crisis, that was the main focus, but there was also an outbreak of Legionnaires that resulted in several fatalities.

551
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:14,860
That's still being investigated. Labs.

552
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:19,720
As I mentioned, we do have labs here. This is always a concern that they look it out.

553
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:25,960
Biosafety level designations and controls are extremely important.

554
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:31,270
But there are times when they are breached or people don't follow the rules or

555
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:35,380
something even more nefarious is going on where they're trying to do something bad.

556
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:41,970
So that's always a concern. I mentioned I have a study done in Puerto Rico.

557
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:50,640
It's a pregnancy study. So Zika happened right in the middle of our recruitment and was quite disruptive, you know,

558
01:06:50,710 --> 01:07:00,070
end up having to add on some components to our research to look at the Zika virus as a serious concern, especially among.

559
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:10,360
Hi, girls. Circle. I couldn't stop laughing. All right, then.

560
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:14,380
Even here. Every year at this time.

561
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:19,030
Every year or two. But people look out for an article like this.

562
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:26,870
Eastern equine encephalitis is another mosquito borne disease.

563
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:32,550
And it does. You know, like I said, there's an article like this that pops up right around this time of year.

564
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:43,450
So while you're out at your tailgates and your campfires this fall, what is your number two options of clothing?

565
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:53,500
Maybe not be outside early and late times when these eagles are out, you know, be obtuse and be active still.

566
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:58,660
So here's one from last year as well.

567
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:04,510
So that's all I have if you guys have questions at this point.

568
01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:15,590
Early. I teach a class at 3:00 in the morning.

569
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:21,910
I don't know what the rest of this week's five. Anyway, there's some questions.

570
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,310
Thank you all for your attention. I'll be back late October to talk about it.

571
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:37,490
Thank you. Thanks a lot. I do have a question for you.

572
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:42,200
A healthy citizens think because you said that in.

573
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:42,650
Right.
