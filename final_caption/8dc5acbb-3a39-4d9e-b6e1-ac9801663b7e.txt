00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,455
Hello, everyone and welcome
back to nutrition 590.

2
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:15,030
In the previous video,

3
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,580
we learned about
epigenetic epidemiology,

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,230
how we study the effects of

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,650
external factors on the
epigenome of humans.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,480
In this module, we're going to

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,715
learn that what
you eat every day,

8
00:00:26,715 --> 00:00:28,665
or even what your
mother or father

9
00:00:28,665 --> 00:00:31,290
ate when they were
pregnant with you,

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,400
may have significant impacts
on your epigenetic profile.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,385
The first learning
objective is to understand

12
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:42,095
the association between
nutrition and the epigenome.

13
00:00:42,095 --> 00:00:44,139
The second learning objective,

14
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:47,755
is to understand the mechanisms
of the methylation cycle,

15
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:51,100
which is also called the one
carbon metabolism cycle,

16
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,130
and how perturbation of
this cycle can affect

17
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:58,410
disease development through
altered epigenetic profiles.

18
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,610
As shown in this figure,

19
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,270
the epigenome plays a central
role in the interaction

20
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:08,660
between diet and the genome
in determining health status.

21
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,050
Based on a wealth
of animal studies,

22
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,890
researchers have proposed
several biological mechanisms

23
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,875
that help explain how nutrition
affects the epigenome.

24
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:22,330
These include first,
directly affecting

25
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,130
the catalytic activities
of enzymes that

26
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,550
are involved in
epigenetic modifications.

27
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:33,470
Second, metabolically
generated intermediates are

28
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,615
also able to interact with

29
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:39,340
epigenetic marks, including
histone modifications.

30
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,380
Third, epigenetic memory.

31
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,060
Studies have shown that

32
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,850
early life malnutrition
can be associated with

33
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,694
health risks in adulthood

34
00:01:48,694 --> 00:01:52,115
via altered epigenetic
programming.

35
00:01:52,115 --> 00:01:54,080
Here is a list of

36
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,390
epigenetically active
compounds that

37
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,920
can be found in foods,

38
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,280
which further provide evidence
of the impact of diet

39
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,335
on epigenetics and
regulation in modification.

40
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:08,315
First, on the second
line of the table,

41
00:02:08,315 --> 00:02:11,380
you see curcumin, which
is found in tumeric.

42
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,250
This is a polyphenol that is

43
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,574
association with HDAC inhibition.

44
00:02:15,574 --> 00:02:19,729
Remember, HDAC, are histone
deacetylation inhibitors,

45
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:22,325
and these are important
for modifying

46
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:24,170
the chromatin structure
and whether genes

47
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,680
are active or silent.

48
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,060
Second, on the
bottom of the slide,

49
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,565
you'll see sulforaphane,

50
00:02:30,565 --> 00:02:32,765
which is a component of broccoli.

51
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:35,210
It turns out that broccoli like

52
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,030
tumeric also has HDAC inhibition.

53
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,800
Therefore, you can begin to

54
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,990
see that there are a number
of compounds that we

55
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,030
regularly encounter in our diet

56
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,230
that can affect
epigenetic processes.

57
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,050
One of the proposed,

58
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,530
and also well-established
mechanisms by which

59
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,230
nutrients modify DNA methylation,

60
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,940
is by participating in

61
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,295
a cellular process known
as one-carbon metabolism.

62
00:03:00,295 --> 00:03:02,510
One-carbon metabolism provides

63
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,225
methyl groups for
biological methylation,

64
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:06,740
not only of DNA,

65
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,525
but also proteins like
histones and phospholipids.

66
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:12,295
In this graphic shows,

67
00:03:12,295 --> 00:03:14,240
that folic acid intake from

68
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,340
our daily diet is
a contributor to

69
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,860
DNA methylation levels
through a series

70
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,015
of complicated
biochemical reactions.

71
00:03:22,015 --> 00:03:25,640
DNA methylation depends
upon the availability of

72
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,210
methyl groups from
S-Adenosyl methionine SAM,

73
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,540
which is derived from methionine.

74
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,760
Choline methionine, can fully

75
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,860
interact at a point when

76
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,680
homocysteine is
converted to methionine.

77
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,590
On the betaine side
of this cycle,

78
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,070
S-methyltransferases
catalyze the methylation of

79
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:50,270
homocysteine using betaine
as the major methyl donor.

80
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,155
In an alternate pathway,

81
00:03:52,155 --> 00:03:53,805
on the folate side,

82
00:03:53,805 --> 00:03:57,710
S-methyltransferases
regenerate methionine using

83
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:01,405
a methyl group derived de novo
from the one-carbon pool.

84
00:04:01,405 --> 00:04:04,275
Interestingly,
scientists have found,

85
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:07,075
that perturbing one
part of this cycle,

86
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:10,750
results in compensatory
changes in others.

87
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,840
Now let's turn to an example
from the primary literature.

88
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,425
Published in 2018, by
Gitik and colleagues,

89
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,050
the central hypothesis
in this study,

90
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,060
was to evaluate whether

91
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,640
the methyl donor choline can

92
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,370
ameliorate adult
learning deficits

93
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,160
and reverse epigenetic
modifications of

94
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,440
chromatin remodeling
factors that were

95
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,650
related to adolescent
nicotine exposure.

96
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,140
Thus, this complicated study is

97
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,375
not only looking at
dietary effects,

98
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,830
in this case choline,

99
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,710
but also environmental
factors, adolescent smoking.

100
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,280
Instead of going over

101
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,380
the methods and
results here together,

102
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,970
I want to prompt you
with a number of

103
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,060
questions to reflect upon.

104
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,065
What is the study design of this?

105
00:04:57,065 --> 00:05:00,554
Are the study subjects
humans or animals?

106
00:05:00,554 --> 00:05:03,040
What types of methods
do the scientists

107
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,795
choose to use in the study?

108
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:08,310
What are some of
the major findings?

109
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,910
Do you think the findings
support their hypothesis?

110
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,930
Finally, what kind of

111
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,750
future studies would you
want to conduct to better

112
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,225
understand the
association between

113
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:21,055
methyl donors like choline,

114
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:23,230
and whether they can ameliorate

115
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,305
the effects of an early
environmental exposure,

116
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:29,515
such as adolescent smoking?
