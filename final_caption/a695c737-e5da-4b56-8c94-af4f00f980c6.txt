1
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,930
Recording in progress. Okay.

2
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,670
Good morning, everyone. So we are continuing for a while.

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:56,310
The Slutsky topic. As this is pretty instrumental in proving properties of estimates and then in the after.

4
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:02,160
So we will look at introduce the characteristic functions.

5
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:12,870
This is why the table is characteristic functions. I'm hoping to do it in this lecture, and this is basically an instrument to deal with.

6
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,190
We convergence with asymptotic distribution of estimates.

7
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:28,149
It's a tool of weak convergence. So we'll talk about the Levy Theorem that says that convergence and distribution is

8
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:35,110
actually and we convergence is equivalent to convergence of characteristic functions,

9
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:40,060
which is essentially a complex variable calculus objects.

10
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,709
Okay. So, uh, briefly, a recap of the previous lectures.

11
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:56,430
So we had some demos. And the two main facts there was that.

12
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:05,490
So we had the sequence. Sex and converging in probability to x.

13
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,540
Then there exists a sub sequence.

14
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:15,290
Okay. That kind of verges almost surely to X.

15
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:21,100
That was one of the results where we used a couple of lemons and another one.

16
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:30,320
That's the more important. That's when we start looking at Slutsky type statements in a multivariate setting.

17
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:38,740
So we had the theory that. If we have a weekly converging.

18
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,680
Yes. And. Two X.

19
00:02:47,520 --> 00:03:06,670
And both of them are victims. And if I have, it's in sequence being the same, and the probability is some lie in sequence.

20
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,710
Then this implies that.

21
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,960
Why? And also convergence and probability of X.

22
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,050
Ouija. Yeah, which basically means that in terms of we convergence,

23
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:34,590
we can have a substitution of exam by some sequence that's equivalent to it in probability.

24
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,220
That was one of the. Yeah.

25
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,300
So that was the main facts from the previous lecture.

26
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:54,680
And we essentially continue piling up on multivariate statements of Slutsky type, right?

27
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,759
So these are statements where we combine convergence and distribution and convergence

28
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:07,260
in probability essentially to simplify the convergence in distribution statement.

29
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:18,560
And so a much more useful form of that multivariate Slutsky is the following theory.

30
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:29,780
So suppose I have X and Y and X and C.

31
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:44,610
So these are some vectors. And what I have is that so x and converges weekly to x.

32
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:51,610
And Y and converges in probability to a constant.

33
00:04:53,020 --> 00:05:04,239
Right. So the spirit of the Slutsky statement. So I'm going to use the Y and converging in probability to a constant somehow in

34
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,240
a statement that invokes the we convergence of eccentrics and the constancy.

35
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,380
And it's a vector constant. Right.

36
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:28,420
And the theorem says that then if I have if I'm looking at a if I stack X and Y, and so this would be a stack, the vector, a block vector, whichever.

37
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:44,260
It's so used to block matrices and linear in matrix algebra, so you may be tempted to call it block vector.

38
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:56,150
Instead of the stacked one. So this as a vector of rate converges weekly to the vector X and C, right?

39
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,440
So. In this type of statement.

40
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:10,190
So if I have a block vector where one part converges weakly to X and another part converges in probability to a constant.

41
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,970
So in terms of weak convergence, I can just replace both blocks by their respective limits.

42
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,260
And that has consequences, right? Because I, I'm.

43
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,060
I, uh,

44
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:38,690
I intend to utilize this statement and interrogated more because what convergence of the vectors actually mean is convergence of joint distributions,

45
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:49,549
right, of the vector components. Right? So kind of implicitly, these has a statement about convergence of joint distributions somehow,

46
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,680
and I'm going to exploit it to derive some pretty useful control the results of this.

47
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,840
But before we do that so we need to furnish the proof.

48
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:06,400
Well, that statement. Right. So we're talking about the vectors, then.

49
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,820
Convergence. Uh. We convergence means.

50
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,970
So I need to use a bounded continuous function. But this time it's a function of a vector argument.

51
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,060
Um, so let's say and taking F is a bounded.

52
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:37,180
Continuous function. It's since I'm talking about the blog vectors I will consider if.

53
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,100
Is the function of the vector x and Y.

54
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:54,140
Right where it's has. They mentioned.

55
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:00,590
X and X and Y has dimensions.

56
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:11,860
Of Y and C rights of the blocks can be of various sizes, of course.

57
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,840
Yeah. So I'm just tuning the expression for the function.

58
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,840
They have to match those sizes, right? Yeah.

59
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,390
This essentially is like invited this X and Y as well.

60
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:34,810
All right. So a function of a big vector is, uh, a function of two arguments, each of them being part of that fact.

61
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,949
So this is just notation. Okay.

62
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:50,220
So once I do that. So I will consider cause I want this term to go somewhere.

63
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,420
So we'll start with this term and.

64
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,270
And first. So we'll do a partial thing.

65
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:09,840
I will consider the difference between this term and this one, except that they will have a sequence sex in here because this is.

66
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,780
This will be about the way in and see.

67
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:27,710
Intuitively. Right. So if I take X and minus, Y and minus.

68
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,930
X and C. So what is this going to be?

69
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:47,440
So I will consider normal things. A length of a vector.

70
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,940
What? Thinking Euclidean norm here.

71
00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:04,060
So that's going to be norm of a vector that has zero as a first component and white and minus C as a second components.

72
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:13,090
Right. And the norm of that thing is the norm of Y, n minus C.

73
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:33,129
Okay. So and an interesting thing happened in this representation, namely I reduce dimension, right?

74
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:43,800
So I had a block factor that had the dimension of DMX and plus D, y, y, and so now I reduced it to statements on the about the Y end.

75
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,990
Right. Simply by keeping the first element.

76
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,230
The same in in that difference.

77
00:10:51,860 --> 00:11:02,060
But that allows me to invoke the theme that the theory and condition says about the way I am, namely that it goes in probability to a constant.

78
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,290
So that norm then goes in probability to zero.

79
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:25,290
And I will remember them as a loved one because we are going to combine two statements into the result of the theory.

80
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:32,550
Then. So I will leave this aside for a while and work on the other statements.

81
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:47,610
So here is an independent consideration. That does not involve.

82
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:02,000
Why am. So it's only about the accents.

83
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:17,680
And we will remember this. So since f is an arbitrary.

84
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,300
Continuous and bounded.

85
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:35,780
Functions. They?

86
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:44,660
I can consider F of x and instead of y will put C that has the C dimension.

87
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:53,930
Right. And in this statement I will consider C is arbitrary but fixed.

88
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,910
First, but then I will recall that it's on the tree.

89
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:07,409
And so if I'm not changing, see, it's just the six parameter inside the function.

90
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,500
So my function becomes only a function of X.

91
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,730
Yeah. And so I can see that this is something I have to do of x.

92
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:29,340
So it's a deal that depends on cease. So now I have I am going weekly to access them by definition.

93
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:40,180
So if it is an arbitrary, continuous and bounded function, then if Tilde is also.

94
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:49,860
Arbitrary bond. It's. And continuous.

95
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:58,720
Function, right? No is as an argument, uh, as a function of the argument.

96
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:09,380
So then by definition of weak convergence or by the equivalent statements, um,

97
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,900
that's convergence with convergence is equivalent to convergence and distribution.

98
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:24,710
So we have the expected value of F tilde of X and.

99
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:32,750
And verging to. Expected value of F of X.

100
00:14:42,990 --> 00:15:02,010
And then so I will recall that they have tilde is actually F of x in and see that convergence to expected value of F of x c.

101
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:16,480
Okay, then. So we can treat this thing is one vector.

102
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:25,390
And this thing is the. Limits of to.

103
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,540
So we could say that this is that the first one is new X.

104
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,440
You expand on. The second one is the new X.

105
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,500
Them because CS was arbitrary.

106
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:59,000
The and this would I will again look at this as a definition of weak convergence.

107
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,879
But now it will apply to the new X converging weekly to new exam.

108
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,570
Converging weekly to the new x right.

109
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:22,550
So this is again by definition of convergence that so my interest in and see will converge weekly.

110
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,560
To. Yes. Let's see.

111
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:36,440
And this is, again, a thing. That I will note.

112
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:46,490
Then I will now carefully look at the first statement one and then the other statement too.

113
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,570
So what I had. So summarizing.

114
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:04,290
One want to. I have.

115
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:18,220
So what do I have? So my, uh, so let's say my new y m is going to be x and.

116
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:23,640
And Y and. So the one on the right is the old one.

117
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,670
And my u. S.

118
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:35,410
And will be. It's An and C.

119
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,410
Then. So as I'm looking at one.

120
00:17:45,760 --> 00:18:04,000
I have. So the.

121
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:11,910
Norm of X and minus y, and so meaning the new ones.

122
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,390
So that goes to zero. In probability.

123
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:33,229
And. The tax.

124
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:43,220
And so the new one. Bills weekly to expand see.

125
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:07,880
Right. So this is from two. And this is from one.

126
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:24,610
So I'm just writing one and two in terms of somewhat different notation because I want to make the connection.

127
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:32,430
To. This theorem from the previous lecture.

128
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:43,650
Right. So when I have one thing weakly converging to limit and that one thing is equivalent in probability to another one,

129
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,720
then I have weak convergence of that other one to the same limit.

130
00:19:50,850 --> 00:20:01,150
So if I now apply these star. So these two things.

131
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:09,240
Right. So I have on the one hand, they have the new accepted converging in probabilities, converging weekly to something.

132
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:18,419
Right. I have an exam being indistinguishable from why it and in probability so them using

133
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:26,520
the star so I can replace and this week convergence the new X and by the new Y.

134
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,150
And as I do so, I will have.

135
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:39,200
So my wife and the new ones, these X and Y girls.

136
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:51,530
And this would be converging in probability to the same limits as the new exam converges to which is X and C.

137
00:20:52,720 --> 00:21:00,990
Right. If I look up there. This is just what we wanted to show, right?

138
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:13,570
So that's the end of the proof. Okay.

139
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:22,030
So now I want to do a couple of corollaries to this statement and now that we mention a constant in here.

140
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:33,190
Right. So I want to recall what is it about the distributions where a random variable degenerates into a constant?

141
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:44,610
And. So these.

142
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:54,719
So let's look at a. Right. And in particular, I am interested in the joint distribution that's that's behind this week convergence.

143
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,340
Right. So we have that the week convergence was equivalent to convergence of the CDF.

144
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:14,340
Now what does it mean about a CDF that is for a joint random variable or read the vector part of which is a constant.

145
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:31,890
And so. Random variable x is independent, always independent of a constant.

146
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,110
I mean, this, by the way, is.

147
00:22:51,460 --> 00:23:02,320
Kind of a useful statement, not only as an instrument to some proofs, but it's also useful in general understanding where the dependance comes from.

148
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:07,510
Right. So one of the key instruments of reducing dependance, if you're modeling something.

149
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:11,680
Right. And you have X and Y too dependent on the variables.

150
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:18,900
So it could be longitudinal measurements on a subject that I've done on the same subject, and that's why they are independent.

151
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:25,220
And the typical device is to assume that there is a random effect on something unobserved but random.

152
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:29,330
They have had a share effect on both X and Y.

153
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,690
Then because it's unobserved, you have to integrate it out.

154
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,890
And the as you integrate it out of the joint distribution of X, Y and Z, third random variable,

155
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:47,000
the distribution of X and Y, even if they were independent, conditional on that random effect, they become dependent.

156
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:55,400
So that was a key a key tool across statistics and probability, actually more statistics than probability.

157
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,850
That you are using to model things that are dependent for it.

158
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,370
So and then observed effect. Yeah.

159
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:14,300
And, uh, so if if the variance of that observed effect goes to zero, then the dependance will vanish and they will again become independent.

160
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:20,440
And this lemma gives us a key to why that happens. Right.

161
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,240
Because then the variable is a constant when its variance goes to zero.

162
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:32,440
And then so both X and Y will be independent of that constant.

163
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,490
And then the mechanism by which the dependencies induced will evaporate.

164
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:43,780
Okay. So with that, so let's just look formally of that statement.

165
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:51,920
So if I have a constant as a random variable. So we have a degenerate.

166
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:01,770
Random variable. Let's see. Right. That is equal to a constant.

167
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:16,180
With probability one. So if I and my rent the variable X so we now kind of fall back on our sigma algebras.

168
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,920
So x. So I can see that.

169
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:30,200
Induces some seed may algebra. Yeah, right.

170
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:43,000
So they're in a constant and C induces a very special sigma algebra, a very primitive one, let's call it F zero.

171
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:50,030
That consists of what. So it's either an empty set or the former different.

172
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:01,220
And both the empty sad and the full army.

173
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:10,420
The. Are by definition part of any sigma algebra.

174
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:21,990
So that's going to be part of that, of course. So then suppose I take some event E in the F?

175
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:31,890
And some of and be in the if not so to show independence so I need to show that.

176
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:43,950
The joint probability of A and B in this context sector arises for any AVF and any B in the as not so.

177
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:52,830
And with that in mind, I will write the joint probability of A and B, so that's probability of a intersection b.

178
00:26:54,410 --> 00:27:03,470
Yeah. And it's going to be equal to. So I want it to be equal to P of E times B of B.

179
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:20,290
So we're just checking that this is true. And to do that.

180
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:25,150
So my, uh, I can have two things, right?

181
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:33,790
So the first option is, uh, so my B can be then empty set our the.

182
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:46,810
And he said, Oh, the Fulani guy, right. So is the these.

183
00:27:46,940 --> 00:28:00,169
And then she said. So what happens to the probability of a intersection B?

184
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:04,610
So intersection B will be an empty sense. So this is going to be a zero, right?

185
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:11,330
And their POV eight times P.O.V. so p of me would be is an empty sir.

186
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:18,370
There's also a zero. And then the whole thing is.

187
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:25,080
Zero. On both sides.

188
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:31,530
Right. The left parts and the right parts. And we don't care what this guy is.

189
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:37,840
So when we do Time's zero, so it's going to give me a zero, right?

190
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:42,930
So definitely works when these times when these are the full omega,

191
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:50,250
then the intersection is actually a so this is going to be the probability of a the left part.

192
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:54,440
Right. This is going to stay the probability of a.

193
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:00,490
Uh times and probability of b is going to be one right vs the formiga.

194
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:06,880
So I have p of e equal to B of a.

195
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:19,750
So that's again true. Right. So we just checked that the probability factor rises for the events in the not in they have not.

196
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:27,440
So then this is the. End of the. Okay.

197
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:34,250
So we are now ready for yet another theorem.

198
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:45,530
This would be Slutsky. For the conditions.

199
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,040
I'm just inventing names here, so don't look for.

200
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:05,840
They simply accept the term. Statistics and probability rates may have a name, but I'm just unaware of its.

201
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:17,710
Uh. So X and the ability to x, y and z goes.

202
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,990
The Girls weekly to the X and Y and Girls and from ability to us.

203
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:33,980
Right. So by the previous theorem. So what they want to show is that.

204
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:45,370
My half. Of X and Y and we'll go to X.

205
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:54,930
Now. We never introduced the conditional random variables, but it's intuitively clear what it means.

206
00:30:54,930 --> 00:31:02,560
So I can say that random variable x in conditional on the way goes weekly to x.

207
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:15,690
Even though we never used that notation. So put it in quotes.

208
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:24,200
It's. I'm sure we can define it rigorously, but we don't need that.

209
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,580
It's enough to have a statement about the seeds.

210
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,020
So prove now by the previous theorem.

211
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,920
So I had the same conditions. Right.

212
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,880
Where is it? There it is. Right. So I have the same condition.

213
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:05,350
And this implies convergence to the weak, convergence to a vector where we replace both components by their limits.

214
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:21,220
So we'll do just that. So the vector x and y and will converge to x and C.

215
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:41,010
No, this is equivalent. By the equivalence of convergence and convergence of CDs there and because.

216
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:50,700
Equivalence of weak convergence and divergence and.

217
00:32:52,070 --> 00:33:04,090
Convergence of CDs. And also so another thing I'm using here is the joint distributions.

218
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:17,850
Define everything about the joint system and the variables, including the conditions.

219
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:34,890
Distributions. And the conditionals for the first part is going to be X and.

220
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:51,740
Given. Why am. And as will converge by the equivalence to if we are these are replaced by the limit.

221
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:56,680
So X conditional on C. Right.

222
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:05,800
But so my ax is independent of C because C is a constant.

223
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:16,210
By the lemme. Right.

224
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:20,090
So then conditioning on c doesn't change anything about the x.

225
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:28,550
So this is same as effects. Because of that I'm having that's the CDF of exam given.

226
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,110
Why am I the Virgin to the CDF effects?

227
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:38,770
So that means. The F, x and even.

228
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:48,510
Why and go to. X.

229
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:04,490
This is what we intended to prove. So the words,

230
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:15,500
if you are doing conditional inference and air conditioning on some statistic in your data that is so

231
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:22,450
excellent is your statistic of interest and why it is something you have a consistent estimate of for now,

232
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:31,220
because that estimate is consistent. It converges to syntactically to a constant in this emphatic distribution of exam will be.

233
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:41,110
Effects. Now we can restate.

234
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:56,520
So there's a bunch of corollaries. The weekend, we states we have an independent proof of at least one of them.

235
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:09,240
So if I have. So it's in the weekly to X and Y and B.

236
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,280
Going in probability to constant.

237
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:28,680
Then we'll have a bunch of things that it's there that just follow from the joint distribution of X and Y and, uh, having a weekly limit.

238
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:39,450
Uh. That's X and C. So then so x and Y and will converge to x plus C.

239
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:48,040
Events and times why and will converge to see times x, right?

240
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:52,890
This is all from the convergence of the joint distributions.

241
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:15,400
And then X and poles of Y and converging to its own C, and that's when C is not zero.

242
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:28,180
And there's more. Right. So you can easily expand this type of statements now that you have a multivariate version of the Slutsky to essentially.

243
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:34,150
Expressions that are composed of these and.

244
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:43,410
So you can. And. And the continuous mapping theorem.

245
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:59,870
So if you have some continuous functions that combine not only plus product ratio

246
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:05,150
but also other continuous functions that you can build out of X and Y and Z.

247
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,630
So that's going to work throughout.

248
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:18,129
And so you will have kind of a generic statement of Slutsky, namely that if you are interested in asymptotic distribution,

249
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:23,050
then anything that converges in probability inside your complicated expression,

250
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:30,820
assuming it still follows the sum joint distribution and continuous function.

251
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,979
So then you can just replace the random thing,

252
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:42,400
the convert interest in probability to a constant by that constant without altering the asymptotic distribution.

253
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:59,290
And so let's do one other kind of interesting statement.

254
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:15,720
That's also in spirit about the weak convergence and convergence of probability, and that is when I have it.

255
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:22,900
And so it's sometimes useful. Solve X and converges weakly to a constant.

256
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:32,170
Right. So we haven't looked at that yet. So we convergence was so far always to the random limits.

257
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:42,370
But if it does converge to a constant, then it's an, uh, convergence in probability to that constant.

258
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:52,850
Right. So we know that in general, we convergence is actually a weaker type of convergence than convergence and probability.

259
00:39:53,780 --> 00:40:02,900
So you wouldn't expect from a weak convergence, uh, uh, uh, in statements that would imply convergence in probability.

260
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,370
But if the limit is a constant, that is the case rate.

261
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:11,780
So it's not weaker. In the special case, where when the limit is is a constant.

262
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:23,360
Let's do the proof. So I will consider the thing that implicates convergence in probability rates.

263
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:28,210
I want to prove these things, so I'll start with the definition of this thing.

264
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:34,390
So that would be the probability that X and minus C.

265
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:40,310
Let's say less than equal epsilon. So that's supposed to.

266
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:46,440
To go to one, right? If everything is correct in the statement of the theorem.

267
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:53,330
But I don't know that yet. Right. So I will spell this out.

268
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:59,879
So that would be X and minus. So it's.

269
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:11,340
And needs to be. Between C plus Epsilon and, uh, c minus epsilon for this to happen.

270
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:22,340
Then. So I have x m converging.

271
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:30,910
Converging weekly to see. So this.

272
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:37,490
Would then be so derived from the distribution.

273
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,200
So that would be the end source and.

274
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:47,010
So Jackson has a CDV. And.

275
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:52,220
Well, it's this would be a fan of C Plus Epsilon.

276
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,750
My illness and. C minus epsilon.

277
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:12,600
Right. And because. So my exam goes weekly to its limits.

278
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:21,390
So if. And then. It was weekly to see.

279
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:27,030
So then. And we'll though in each point of.

280
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:36,530
Continuity to a. Function on a constant and that thing is the indicator function.

281
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:43,990
That looks like this, right? So I have a C.

282
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:47,680
So that's how I see you looks like.

283
00:42:54,130 --> 00:43:06,940
So then I have these girls. As a calculus object, right?

284
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:15,590
The seeds are just numbers functions. So this would go to a see that's.

285
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:23,500
Going to be indicator of epsilon. Minus indicator.

286
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:33,380
Minus Epsilon. So that's see.

287
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:38,530
That's. C. S minus.

288
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:55,180
So. And this is a one, right?

289
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:25,149
It's not absolute C minus. So I'm just taking C plus epsilon.

290
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:29,530
That's a one. And C minus Epsilon, that's a zero. The difference is one.

291
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,620
Right. And so just summarizing.

292
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:41,030
I have. My ex and the ability to see.

293
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:47,450
Right. Because of. Because my left part right there was in probability two one.

294
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:51,630
That's by definition X and. I would be waiting to see.

295
00:44:54,840 --> 00:45:02,970
And that's the. The proof. Okay.

296
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,200
So let's have a break and look at characteristic functions after the break.

297
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:16,100
Okay. Let's continue. So we had to.

298
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:24,430
So if you look back at your courses, probably in 6 to 1, you had things like moment generating functions.

299
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:30,160
Did you ever have the characteristic function? No.

300
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:37,990
That's what I thought. So, uh, just recall what MJF is.

301
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:47,940
So in general. So this was expected value of e t times x.

302
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:54,030
So you may have heard of some other. Things like these.

303
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,950
For example, the probability generating function.

304
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:08,280
So most likely use it on discrete random variables of T taken to power x.

305
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:16,730
So this is the function of tea. Right. Once you take the expectation, t is just the parameter.

306
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:23,590
Then some of you may have heard about the last transform.

307
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:38,020
And this is e two minus.

308
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:53,700
Two times x. And the way you probably, if you used any one of them and the way you used them was probably to find.

309
00:53:55,370 --> 00:54:06,400
Moments of random variables. It's by differentiating.

310
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:15,880
Either one of them its fans setting.

311
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:22,200
T equals zero, at least for the MJF.

312
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:34,940
They to transform. But you probably never use them to characterize distributions and never use them

313
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:40,370
in the context of weak convergence because you did not have that thing defined.

314
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,840
Right. So the value of the characteristic function.

315
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:51,560
So we will use them. So our immediate purpose of introducing them.

316
00:54:56,270 --> 00:55:01,700
They aim to find. We claim it's.

317
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:08,750
Of some sequence six. Right.

318
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:18,790
And most often of especially. Yeah, it's.

319
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:24,829
And B. Sums of random variables.

320
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:30,220
Let's say y y la plus y two plus song plus y.

321
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:41,730
You can make it one over and for example, and some other normalizing constants.

322
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:59,440
That seems. So and what we will so we will have some statements that will enable us to do so.

323
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:04,330
And one of them is will be that convergence and distribution.

324
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:10,030
We convergence is equivalent to convergence of characteristic functions.

325
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:15,070
We before we can get to that. So we need to define them.

326
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:26,140
Uh, now, why can't we use any of the examples of, uh, so what these are if we.

327
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:30,530
These are kind of probability theory names for these things.

328
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:37,680
So the MJF and the TGF plus transform is close to how these things are called in mathematics.

329
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:42,490
But in mathematics, these are all integral transforms.

330
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:52,240
So why they are transforms.

331
00:56:52,780 --> 00:57:04,270
Because you had a function of X rights of some kind and you are converting it or a function related to x like a PDF for x for example.

332
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:16,660
And you are doing some integral operator with it that has a parameter and that will leave no trace of x anymore except in the form of the result.

333
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:20,980
And this will be a function of that parameter.

334
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:28,330
So you are basically transforming things from one functional space where everything depends on the x,

335
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:37,840
like a PDF of x to another functional space where functions are of a different targeting the T and there's no X in them anymore.

336
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:43,190
The reason why people do that is because.

337
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:49,790
So it's useful when in that other functional space of t the problem has a simple solution.

338
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:57,530
Then you can solve it there and use the inverse transform to come back and find out what your solution is.

339
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:07,550
And one example outside of probability theory is when you have ordinal differential equations, for example.

340
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:17,330
With constant coefficients they are doing an transform will convert them to an algebraic equation for.

341
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:28,120
Your solution and then inverting that algebraic equation, you will get a solution to your ordinary differential equation.

342
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:33,340
Things like that. Because it turns derivatives into a polynomial.

343
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:37,540
Okay. So.

344
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:54,590
The thing now the main tool to deal with some of the independent identically distributed ram the variables or independent trend the variables

345
00:58:54,980 --> 00:59:06,560
that are not necessarily identically distributed is that so the you can imagine so if we were to compute this thing the way we have so far,

346
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:15,440
this would be a convolution, right? So we have reasonably clear how to computer convolution of two numbers of two random variables.

347
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:22,100
That's just one integral, right? But if you have three random variables, that's already a double integral.

348
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:27,920
And this thing is an integral event in minus one integrals, right?

349
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:33,100
Nested within each other in a syntactically it's an infinity dimension.

350
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:40,880
Think. All right. So completely intractable situation mathematically if you just approach it head on.

351
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:42,280
Right.

352
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:55,960
So the nice thing about it is that if you use any of these transforms, it would turn the distribution of this thing into a product of the transforms,

353
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:01,210
respective transforms of the marginal distribution of each such random variable.

354
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:11,410
Right. And they have clear forms. Then out of a product, you can see how you can simplify it and then recognize something about the result.

355
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:17,150
So that's that's how it will be used.

356
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:26,540
Now, the reason why the transformers I've listed so far are that you may have been exposed to at least a subset of them.

357
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:37,160
The way the reason why they're not very useful in general is because you need this, because these expectations are integrals, right?

358
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:49,400
And you need the function under the integral to basically go to zero fast enough on both ends so that the integral converges.

359
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:56,360
And if you have a general random variable that can be positive or negative, like a normal random variable, right?

360
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,140
These will not exist because of one of the ones that will diverge.

361
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:08,660
Right? So if you are doing a plus transform of a normal random variable, it will divergence negative end of x right?

362
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:15,620
And these will diverge on the positive random x so they will all not exist.

363
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:27,800
So how do you term? The and the trick with characteristic functions is that they exist everywhere.

364
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:31,940
Regardless of what your random variable is. For any random variable, it does exist.

365
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:39,770
And this happens due to the fact that the idea of a characteristic function convert,

366
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:48,380
uh, transforms the and converts the thing under the integral to a bounded function.

367
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:59,820
And, you know, a bunch of bounded functions and some of them comes from trigonometric calculus, right?

368
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:03,980
The sign and the cosine. Yeah, we will see that.

369
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:12,600
So they're basically considered the transformers, considered of a complex argument.

370
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:17,860
Um. So who had a complex variable calculus?

371
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:22,300
Did anyone have it? Okay, just a few.

372
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:32,750
I was actually surprised because when my kid was going to school, so in high school they were introduced to complex numbers.

373
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:41,450
Not, of course, complex variable calculus, anything. Uh, but that was very surprising to me.

374
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:48,260
So in our schools teach complex numbers. Okay.

375
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:55,640
So. Let's talk about the complex numbers first.

376
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:11,299
So they come into play. So there could be various introductions to that topic.

377
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:16,550
But the brilliant idea was. To say that.

378
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:22,540
The pretense that it's there exists a square root of minus one.

379
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:30,910
So we know that in real calculus it doesn't exist.

380
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:34,479
Right. But if we pretended that they.

381
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:40,000
And so the high square will be minus one, right?

382
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:49,420
And the eyes to the fore will be plus one and so on.

383
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:58,180
So that's one step then.

384
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:05,410
So let's say I want to consider E two II times x.

385
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:23,580
And I want to use a Taylor series for that thing. Now I know that the team is serious for the exponent and from zero to infinity.

386
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:29,640
So the arguments taken to end over in Victoria.

387
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:38,880
And that will split into two series.

388
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:50,880
So the one, so the, uh, the even powers of m of that argument will be the plus or minus six according to this.

389
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:56,310
Right. And the odd powers of and will have the I to it.

390
01:04:57,060 --> 01:05:03,330
So this will split my series into two one that will have it to it and the other one that won't.

391
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:08,630
So the one the one that does not have item it.

392
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:14,110
So that would be even. And.

393
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:30,460
So that will generate that Chris will be X minus X to three over three factorial plus x two, five, five factorial minus and so on.

394
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:42,310
This kind of series then. And we'll have eye to every term times.

395
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:49,810
And this will be one minus X squared over two plus x four.

396
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:54,350
Over four factorial miners and on.

397
01:05:56,110 --> 01:06:06,749
Right. So two things happen. Right. So because the evil powers in these series when applied to I will leave I intact.

398
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:13,620
So there will be an I. And splitting of this series into terms with the eye in terms of without.

399
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:22,410
And the second things that is occurring is that out of a series that has positive coefficients because of the eye,

400
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:34,950
uh, alternating when we take it to even powers, uh, then we will have an alternating series for each one of those.

401
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:42,060
And intuitively so if I have a series with positive coefficients, that's becomes unbounded.

402
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:48,390
If I make it a series of alternating sides. Uh, that has a chance to be bounded.

403
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:53,010
And that's true. If you look into the table of.

404
01:06:56,360 --> 01:07:03,630
Taylor's series. Four different functions.

405
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:10,740
You will actually find this series like this in the series like this.

406
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:21,610
And they are for the sine and cosine. So this is a sign of X that this series.

407
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:30,010
And the one with the eye. Is the series four sign of its.

408
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:46,380
It's this one. This is the sign of.

409
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:58,390
Okay. So this brilliant idea actually gives us two trigonometric bounded functions out of E or something.

410
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:07,250
Right. And we can look at the transforms that we introduced.

411
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:11,219
So all of them I eat or something. Even this one.

412
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:15,880
Right. So this is just the change in their argument.

413
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:19,800
So we can say that this is e to x times.

414
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:26,290
Natural log of tea. So they are all eat or something.

415
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:33,400
So if I make. So if I replace x by x now, I will suddenly be able to take all of them.

416
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:44,559
Because I will only have. Bounded functions under the integral weighted by the probabilities that converge because the

417
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:49,060
integral over the probability is less than one and because these functions are bounded,

418
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:57,700
right? So they will integrals will be less than the constant by which they are bounded times integral with the probability that's less equal one.

419
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:02,650
Right. So all of my transforms will suddenly start existing.

420
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:10,150
And. Now, by the way.

421
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:15,610
So this formula e to i x equals.

422
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:23,910
Cosine of x. Plus I.

423
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:32,800
Sine of x. This is called u r formula.

424
01:09:39,490 --> 01:09:53,480
Now this. So he was an Austrian. And so most of the time he actually worked most of his life in the Russian Academy of Sciences in Petersburg.

425
01:09:53,500 --> 01:10:01,600
I still remember his house on the bank of the river. And so depending on what you want to give credit to.

426
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:05,770
So if you think he's Austrian, you could say you should say the Euler.

427
01:10:08,190 --> 01:10:13,729
So if you pronounce him in English, it's probably Hitler. You pronounce him in Russian?

428
01:10:13,730 --> 01:10:20,520
That's Salem. So very some fantastic guy, right.

429
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:27,149
So contributed to a lot of fields in the mathematics and by the way, the the E and the exponent.

430
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:31,440
That's the first letter of his name, by the way. Okay.

431
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:45,959
Um. Having done the tribute so we can look at other properties of complex numbers, since they now have two things to them at least.

432
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,840
Right? There's a sign of X and the sign of X, right?

433
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:55,120
And it takes both of them to define a complex number E to an x.

434
01:10:56,490 --> 01:11:01,470
But we know that sine and cosine actually define the point on the unit circle.

435
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:09,570
So that gives us a picture of the complex plane because we can identify them with the vectors.

436
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:24,690
So that's why this. So I have one minus one.

437
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:30,280
Everywhere. I have a unit circle.

438
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:37,070
It doesn't look like the circle in my case. So, Mr. Potato.

439
01:11:39,310 --> 01:11:44,330
But this is. A complex number, right?

440
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:49,600
Yes, that's. So X is actually the angle.

441
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:58,230
Right. And it has. Sine of x is the x coordinate and.

442
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:02,900
Outside of access the Y coordinates.

443
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:12,070
So that's what this point is. There's also the radius of that circle that within is actually one.

444
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:25,140
So the. Length of the back to E ax because it's on the unit circle.

445
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:34,030
So that's a one. But in general, the complex number.

446
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:42,960
Has some radios. So it's going to be our times.

447
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:51,180
No sign of an ax. Plus.

448
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:57,240
Sine of x. Right.

449
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:10,210
And then the length of that number. Is poor.

450
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:17,500
And is the. Right.

451
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:31,920
Square or of the so if the complex number is Z so it's a square of the Z times the conjugate Z and Z is just like this conjugate one.

452
01:13:31,930 --> 01:13:40,850
You just do a minus to it. Minus three times.

453
01:13:42,410 --> 01:13:45,980
It's kind of X rights then if you do these.

454
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:54,959
That's going to be r squared and then cosine squared plus nine squared because

455
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:59,490
the square of the I will give you a minus one and there is another minus.

456
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:10,290
So that will give you a plus one. That's our square at Times Square sign squared.

457
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:16,500
It's going to be a one. And this will give you an.

458
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:25,800
Right. So the normal length. And the scalar product.

459
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:30,720
So you can call this the Z Times, the conjugate Z a scalar product.

460
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:38,690
Two complex numbers. Scale zee with its.

461
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:42,870
It's by definition these types of conjugates.

462
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:50,310
So we won't get into the algebra of complex numbers deep into it,

463
01:14:50,970 --> 01:14:55,920
because what the approach of this course will be to just do the intuitive facts

464
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:00,390
that you know from calculus while recognizing that the square root of minus.

465
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:07,250
That eye is a square root of minus one, and that's it.

466
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:22,570
Okay. So I will continue the next lecture and we will look at the properties of the characteristic function.

467
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:29,720
I can define it though. So the characteristic function.

468
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,990
Because I have characteristic function as the name of the lecture. So I have to define that.

469
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:44,250
So that's e two times.

470
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:52,540
Two times that's. And with that, I'll leave it at that for now.
