1
00:00:09,772 --> 00:00:13,328
After watching this video, you will
be able to use PROC FREQ to calculate

2
00:00:13,328 --> 00:00:15,678
chi-square test for categorical variables.

3
00:00:15,678 --> 00:00:20,147
And we're going to demonstrate how
to report categorical variables

4
00:00:20,147 --> 00:00:22,065
in your Table 1.

5
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:27,250
Before going into that, let's remember
this algorithm from the previous video.

6
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,938
We were outlining here all the statistical
test that you can do if your

7
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:34,246
outcome is binary depending on
how your data was collected and

8
00:00:34,246 --> 00:00:37,240
what type of variables you have.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,097
In this video, we're going to focus
exclusively on this part the not much data

10
00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:46,310
for categorical variables.

11
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,033
To illustrate the use of PROC FREQ
analyze categorical variables,

12
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:53,060
we're going to use the following stuff.

13
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:58,100
Our outcome is going to be
a dominant obesity, yes or no.

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,812
To give you some background,
we have used waist circumference to create

15
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:07,680
these variable using the cut offs for
the metabolic syndrome which are more

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,569
than 88 centimeters for women are more
than 102 centimeters for men.

17
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:16,686
The idea here is that a large
waste reflects accumulation of fat

18
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:19,636
in the abdominal area
the apple shape which is

19
00:01:19,636 --> 00:01:24,607
supposed to be a cardiometabolic risk
factor, as opposed to accumulate fat

20
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:28,590
in other areas which does not
confer risk namely pear shape.

21
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,980
So our outcome is abdominal obesity and
our exposure is going to be smoking.

22
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,915
Smoking because of nicotine being
an appetizer present is usually

23
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:43,200
associated with lower weight, so
our hypothesis will be that smoking is

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,890
inversely associated
with abdominal obesity.

25
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,925
By the way we'll talk more
about this study in the future.

26
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:51,442
I will give you more details.

27
00:01:51,442 --> 00:01:56,710
For now, let's just say that this
analysis is a cross-sectional analysis.

28
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:01,146
So considering that we have a binary
outcome abdominal obesity yes or

29
00:02:01,146 --> 00:02:04,051
no, and
a binary exposure smoking yes or no,

30
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:07,840
we will use PROC FREQ to
build a two way two table.

31
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,360
By adding the option chi-square, SAS is
also going to give us a chi-square test.

32
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,387
When we run this code,
we get our usual two by two table.

33
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:24,042
Here we can see that among people with
no abdominal obesity, we have about 32%

34
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:29,710
smokers and among people with abdominal
obesity, we only have 7% of smokers.

35
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:35,105
And on top of that, we can see that those
differences are highly statistically

36
00:02:35,105 --> 00:02:41,680
significant since the P value from
the chi-square test is less than 0.0001.

37
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,639
Therefore, our hypothesis that smoking
was inversely associated with abdominal

38
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,350
obesity seems to be true
in this population.

39
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,380
Now note that out of the three
percentages that SAS gives me,

40
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,518
the cell percentage, the row percentage
and the column percentage, I chose

41
00:03:00,518 --> 00:03:06,400
the column percentage here because that
is how I want to report it in my Table 1.

42
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,474
My Table 1 is going to have to columns,
one for people with abdominal obesity and

43
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:14,609
the other for
people with no abdominal obesity and

44
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:20,760
therefore what I want is to report
the percentage of smokers in each group.

45
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,136
Note that you only need to report
the proportion of smokers because clearly,

46
00:03:25,136 --> 00:03:29,050
the proportion of nonsmokers
is redundant information.

47
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,545
So there is no need to report also
the proportion of nonsmokers someone

48
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,860
among the two groups.

49
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,754
Also note that you don't want to report

50
00:03:38,754 --> 00:03:43,496
the row percentage because that
would be interpreted this way.

51
00:03:43,496 --> 00:03:47,999
Among smokers 95.5% don't
have abdominal obesity and

52
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:52,939
4.5% have it, which may be
perfectly okay in other contexts,

53
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:58,430
but not if you want to build your
Table 1 with the outcome on top.

54
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:03,160
So don't report that one.

55
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,151
Finally, note that reporting row or column
percentages will depend in which order

56
00:04:08,151 --> 00:04:11,945
you put your variables in the table
statement, so be careful.

57
00:04:11,945 --> 00:04:16,165
In this example, smoking is first and
abdominal obesity second, but

58
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:20,740
if you reverse the order, then you will
want to report the row percentages as

59
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,976
opposed to the column percentages.

60
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:27,925
So in general, don't try to remember if
it's row or column, just look at your two

61
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:33,400
by two table and report what makes
sense based on your Table 1.

62
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,224
In summary, in this video we learn
how to use PROC FREQ to calculate

63
00:04:37,224 --> 00:04:40,027
Chi Square test for
categorical variables, and

64
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:43,674
we learn how to report categorical
variables in your Table 1.

65
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:47,808
In the next video,
we will move into continuous variables.
