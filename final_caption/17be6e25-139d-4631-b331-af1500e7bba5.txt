1
00:00:49,580 --> 00:01:01,390
Okay. Good morning, everyone. So we are continuing our basic probability stuff.

2
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,910
Let's take a quick look at the last lecture.

3
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:22,250
So we we had the axioms of probability.

4
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:32,420
There was one that was different from the general measures, and we found that this had consequences,

5
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:44,959
namely that it was instrumental in proving that probability is continuous so that the limits of probability of a sequence of sets,

6
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:52,550
if that sequence of cells has a limit, is the same as probability of the limit set for the sequence.

7
00:01:53,930 --> 00:02:03,440
Uh, we looked at probabilities of probabilities that are largely familiar to you from, uh, the Venn diagrams, and the six are one.

8
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,780
So we won't spend much time on it. It's just a refresher.

9
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,920
Then we looked briefly at the construction of the probability space.

10
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:34,710
So starting with Bamaga, then an algebra, then an algebra expanded using countable operations into a sigma algebra.

11
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:42,479
And then we discussed what happens to probability that define on an algebra when this expansion is going on.

12
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,250
And we mentioned a theorem that there's a unique, uh,

13
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:54,630
kind of continuation of probability from in the algebra when it's defined in an algebra into a sigma algebra.

14
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:08,580
And then, so finally there was just an appetizer for, uh, the topic random variables and we haven't really defined them.

15
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,739
So this is the stuff for today.

16
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:21,390
So today we start talking about random variables and uh, so this story will be a little different from 601, so from 601.

17
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,960
Uh, so there, you probably haven't defined at all what a random variable is.

18
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:35,810
Uh, but the perception there was that it's kind of a thing that that has a distribution and so on.

19
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:44,399
So we are basically taking that perception apart and there will be two parts to it because we already have a distribution,

20
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:53,430
we have a probability space, right? And that probability space was so we started with uh, so-called measure of measurable space.

21
00:03:53,430 --> 00:04:00,050
So that was and the sigma algebra built on it then.

22
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:10,730
So this was measurable space. Then we had a probability space.

23
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:24,480
Where we took this measurable space that was ready to be measured.

24
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:40,379
So we equipped it with a measure and that was a probability measure and adding that so made it into a triple that we called probability space.

25
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,740
Right. And so pay attention.

26
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:52,170
At this point, we haven't defined random variables, but the distributions are sort of already there in the form of a probability measure, even though.

27
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:59,930
Indirectly, right. So I can tell what the probability of all the different states are.

28
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,050
It's not just related to any random variables.

29
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:19,640
So the role of the random variable will be to actually address the SATs in the Sigma Algebra F through some sets defined using that random variable.

30
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,190
So it's mainly a kind of a pointer type thing.

31
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,830
So let's say let X.

32
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:52,430
Be a function of a mix of Omega. Oh, my God.

33
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,890
That I've taken from the capital on that go.

34
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:04,570
So it could be a usual calculus function if your omega is a real line Capital One, but it could be anything, right?

35
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,730
That's the point of of the theory here.

36
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:17,709
Right. So then we can refer to it like that and the values.

37
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,730
Well, generally in our or a subset of our.

38
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,550
Okay. And they already have sets.

39
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,390
Yeah, there are parts of.

40
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:49,070
My Sigma algebra. Right. So what if I consider SATs?

41
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:02,490
B that will be part of the but l sigma algebra that is built on r.

42
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:20,040
So what I want to do is I want to use the x, the function x just defined to connect the sense e and the sense be.

43
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:35,270
So the goal. In that sense.

44
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:44,260
He and. B so built some correspondence between them using x.

45
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,870
So in order to do so, we first need to kind of turn acts of Omega into some kind of sense, right?

46
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:13,090
And we can say, well, suppose I take Omega, does that belong to A and then I act by the acts of Omega on them.

47
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:20,320
And this will belong to some other set.

48
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,680
And we will define the image of the city.

49
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:49,180
Of asset the. As a said of.

50
00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:07,750
Instead of acts of Omega. Well, Omega, he's an E, meaning that this is any omega.

51
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:24,670
Right. So the story here. So instead of taking, uh, uh, a function of Omega, I'm looking for Omegas in a certain set, eh?

52
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:31,000
And I'm sampling all of them acting by a function and I'm collecting the results into a different set.

53
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,780
And that's going to be the B. Okay.

54
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,170
And I can have an inverse procedure.

55
00:09:54,430 --> 00:10:02,620
So we try all honey go in a and collect.

56
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:13,010
Acts of comic. To a different set.

57
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:30,610
Be right. So the Omegas I'm trying are, uh, in the capital Omega, um, said and the, the ones I get as a results, they are on the real line in general.

58
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:37,480
So the inverse procedure, so I could say well suppose I have sent me.

59
00:10:51,150 --> 00:11:06,710
And then looking for. On figures such that packs of omega E's in the B.

60
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:21,340
So the notation for that so this is equals by definition will be X minus one of B.

61
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:44,850
So here we try. Some numbers let's say are in the B and find.

62
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:56,560
Army girls that are the results.

63
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:17,840
Of inverse sex. So that thing is called a pre image of the.

64
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,850
Right. So how would this look on on a picture?

65
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:46,810
So let's take just some functional. Like that.

66
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,860
So we understand it in the usual calculus sense.

67
00:12:51,370 --> 00:13:07,180
So for any value on the x axis, which is my omega, I'm taking equal to R and this is the R, that's range of X.

68
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:22,020
Right. So we started with, uh, taking some kind of a step and say a, uh,

69
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:38,489
from the Omega and we took different omegas from we from it and we looked at what would be the values of my function that correspond to that omega.

70
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:45,590
And it happens to be. So they.

71
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,040
And it happens to be this set, right? So that's the B.

72
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,059
That's so the bees the image of a right. So I'm taking all lawmakers from AIDS.

73
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:27,170
So this is let's say, an open interval in the and I guess I'm looking at the values of X of mega that are induced by taking an X on these on figures.

74
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:31,879
And so as a result, they get another open interval according to this picture.

75
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,170
And this this is the B set in the range of X, right?

76
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:42,230
So I can also look for the opposite procedure.

77
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,420
It's according to the other definition. So these the imagery.

78
00:14:47,630 --> 00:15:04,500
Uh, uh. Of key that we get using the function x.

79
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:08,630
So that's the x. Okay.

80
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,389
My inverse question would be, well,

81
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:25,490
suppose I take an interval B and I want to find what the army does that when I act on them by X would give me a value in the B.

82
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:40,730
And as I do that, I actually get not only the E, but I also get another opening interval right here.

83
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:49,460
Let's say this is a C, so a union C is the pre image.

84
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:08,520
It's X minus one of the. Now, of course, for the nice function I showed.

85
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,830
Uh, so it's continuous. Uh, then.

86
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:27,990
So I always have. So for any open interval, uh, on the y axis, I will find some kind of a union of open intervals on the x axis or a single one.

87
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,650
Right. So for this nice function.

88
00:16:46,530 --> 00:17:03,130
For any the. There is a subset of are the pre image the x.

89
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,590
Pretty much. Of the.

90
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:21,220
That would call. I would use the letter E, so I'll just leave words for it.

91
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,280
The XP image of B is a subset of F, right?

92
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:38,049
Because I have with re-align b both the range of x and the omega being very aligned.

93
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,530
So my sigma algebra is defined on them by both barrels.

94
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:47,050
Except that they are different barrels. Right. So we have.

95
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:59,290
So it's part of F which in this illustration.

96
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:26,330
He's also another barrel. Right. So and the goal here is to be able to write something like this B X of B and to define that.

97
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:34,130
Right. And when I have these correspondence so that for any B in the range of X,

98
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:49,310
I can find a set in Omega that corresponds to those omega values that give me x of all the range in this set in the range of x.

99
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:57,020
So then I already have my probabilities from the probability space for any set in the sigma algebra.

100
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:15,360
So if it happens to be. So if X minus one of B is some 70, that's also in the sigma algebra that's defined on my probability space.

101
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:19,910
So I have all made the F and P.

102
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:31,430
Then I know that I can define. Yeah.

103
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:39,890
X of B is the P from here it's evaluated.

104
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:47,000
Yeah. E. So in other words, I can now.

105
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:54,800
So if my function happens to be such that the pre images are in the sigma algebra f,

106
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:04,760
then I can refer to probabilities related to my functions by first finding that pre image and then taking the probability of that pre image.

107
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:21,330
So if that seems complicated to you, think about six or one where you repeatedly used stuff like that.

108
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,500
Right. So you have random variables under the probability symbol.

109
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,450
So in six or one, it was typical.

110
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:42,790
Two years. Let's say, probability that the tax is less than five.

111
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:55,810
Right. Some of you remember writing things like that, or X less than Y where these were random variables and it was strictly speaking,

112
00:20:55,810 --> 00:21:01,270
not well-defined over there unless you say that.

113
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,660
Well,

114
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:13,600
I have the probability p rigorously defined in some probability space I can find the sample that corresponds to this inequality x less than five.

115
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,220
So that would be the set of on it goes to such that x of all is less than five.

116
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,480
I'm collecting all of those on it goes. Find what that set is.

117
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:27,310
It happens to be in the sigma algebra from my probability space that I'm acting.

118
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,390
Then I'm finding its probability by taking P of that sense.

119
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:39,820
Right? So that was the chain that was in place in the six or what we can now give a formal definition.

120
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:51,510
So function X. He's called measurable.

121
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,290
And a different name for it will be the random variable.

122
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:16,490
He is for anybody in the sigma algebra.

123
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:25,420
I can find the.

124
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:36,540
So the e that is a dream of B is part of the F.

125
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:51,820
So if that logical chain breaks down, then I can't, uh, use P on the premium pre images.

126
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,630
Right. Do you have a question? Yeah.

127
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:01,040
Can you clarify one? I. So.

128
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:09,150
So strictly speaking, I have to write here.

129
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,420
Right. Because I'm not addressing it. So I'm in.

130
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,020
I'm addressing it through the X. Right.

131
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,290
And the notation for it will be, uh.

132
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:28,500
Well, let's say. So I want to know.

133
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:36,840
So he and here is something related to x x less than five, for example.

134
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:53,340
Right. That's going to be and we start with the probability space, the sigma algebra, the P, that's all part of my probability space I have.

135
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,370
X is a measurable function.

136
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,410
We're in the variable, which is going to be the same thing right then.

137
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,889
So will the notation be x x.

138
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:21,610
Less than five years of p of the set of army is such that x of omega is less than five.

139
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,459
So meaning all lawmakers in the Capitol.

140
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:42,710
All may go right. This is the case.

141
00:24:42,740 --> 00:25:02,819
This is how we understand the. So if I have my d defined on this Burrell's Sigma algebra with this omega being our whites,

142
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:13,560
then the probability that X falls in this interval would be the p i define in this probability space of the union of CND.

143
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:34,930
Right. And we could say now that P tax of B is equal to P without the ex of the union c and E, right.

144
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:09,020
So let's now give one of the most common definitions when you mentioned random variables.

145
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:17,540
So that's the CDF. That stands for cumulative.

146
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:40,440
Distribution function. Now, having defined the cumulative distribution function and having looked at all the properties,

147
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:51,239
you will see why it was natural in six alarm to understand random variables through that distribution function,

148
00:26:51,240 --> 00:27:00,450
because we will show at some points that actually a distribution function is enough for us to construct the probability space,

149
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:07,140
the random variable, and build all these correspondence between images and images.

150
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:15,720
So there's no contradiction in that sense with your prior courses.

151
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,250
So the definition is quite short.

152
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:30,990
So the CDF of X is the X of.

153
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:42,770
The parts of the realign from minus infinity to x.

154
00:27:45,680 --> 00:28:01,890
Right. We just defined how we understand this and it's also p x x lasso equal x right using the notation we just described.

155
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:22,239
And this presumes that I have measurable function or a random variable in the sense that I can

156
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:32,980
find a all along it goes that give me the values of x x of omega in that piece of the real line.

157
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:41,940
And then I'm acting by the probability P from my probability based on the set of such omegas.

158
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:59,220
So we can keep the notation sequence that would be p o the set of all those such that X far farmiga.

159
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:23,980
He's the last week. All X. Now, once we kind of get comfortable with the way things are addressed in this piece of logic,

160
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,160
we can actually drop the X Index and understand things based on the context.

161
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:40,239
Right? So if the sad inside the probability is somehow related to a random variable and it's a sample from the range of that random variable,

162
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,200
so we understand the it is a X in this form.

163
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:56,800
If this is happens to be a set in the omega, then it's just the good old T from the probability space acting on a set on a subset of omega.

164
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:01,050
Right. Yeah.

165
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:11,310
Basically the definition of around the variable says that we it's a function of automakers such that I can do all this without.

166
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:21,150
Right. So it would I would be in trouble. And there are examples that I probably won't give you because they are pretty complicated to look at.

167
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:27,000
But there are examples of functions that are not measurable that uh,

168
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:33,210
well where the pre images are sets that are not in the sigma algebra and can not be measured.

169
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:40,880
Some of the non-trivial stuff we will take a look at.

170
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:57,200
Okay. So another definition.

171
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:12,850
That's so suppose like in all of my examples above, uh, my army is actually are.

172
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:23,160
So then the function.

173
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:30,920
Acts of armored vehicles from ago.

174
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:58,740
So this is identity function. So I'll say take.

175
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,240
Access? Yes. The identity function.

176
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:11,100
Right. Then the resulting space.

177
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,820
He's called. The sample space.

178
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:46,650
And this is the the kind of most simple choice for the lawmakers.

179
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:52,950
So if you are defining probability space for a certain phenomena, you're building models.

180
00:32:53,190 --> 00:33:01,140
So for all you can define, X is an identity function that's going to be the simplest way to go forward.

181
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:23,280
Okay. So let's look at the properties of CDs.

182
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:41,960
Now, you already know, and this may seem trivial to you, but you actually never proved them rigorously in six or one.

183
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:50,340
You know, the techniques to prove things like that.

184
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:59,130
So here we will actually make use of what we had before with the probabilities,

185
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:07,490
so namely the limits of sets of different kinds and the continuity of probability.

186
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:12,360
Right. So if I want to find the limits of my seed, for example,

187
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:19,440
I will build SATs that converge somewhere and then infer the limits using the continuity of probability.

188
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,790
That will first start with the moment any city.

189
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:34,210
So you know that CD4 decreasing functions, right?

190
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:40,360
So how do you show that? From the definitions we have just given.

191
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:50,640
So let's say I have x1x2 such that x one is less of equal x two.

192
00:34:54,010 --> 00:35:00,430
And so then if I have a CDF, then my CDF.

193
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:07,540
Of X one will be less equal CDF of x two.

194
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:22,120
So let's prove that. So we have sense.

195
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:27,160
Right. So, first of all, we have the logical statements, right?

196
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,579
So X equals x.

197
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:36,040
One means that x less or equal x two.

198
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:40,210
Right. Because X one is less equal x2. Uh.

199
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:44,560
Now pause for a second and think what this actually means.

200
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,270
Because X is a function. Right.

201
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:57,310
So that actually means that for any army that I can take from the capital one effects of omega happens to be less than x one.

202
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,650
Then that same omega will give me a one and go less than x two.

203
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:08,260
Right. So this is how I can get to actual events that I can measure.

204
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:25,690
So what this actually means is that the set of the such that x also equal x one is a subset of the set of omegas that give me x of omega.

205
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:42,930
When I say equal x to. And we know from properties of privilege these.

206
00:36:54,330 --> 00:37:03,690
No fee. So we had a property that, if one said is a subset of another, then probability is of this subset is less of equal.

207
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:25,520
Probability of the set. Last week.

208
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:31,940
The one to the right when it got such that I saw my guys less.

209
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:39,310
Well, thanks to. Right.

210
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,940
And this is by definition F of X one.

211
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:52,350
And this is by definition F of x two. Well, that completes the proof.

212
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:10,200
And we will use this kind of logic a lot of the times going from logic to subsets.

213
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,670
So whenever we have this symbol, then it corresponds to something going this way.

214
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:25,140
Of course, in this case it's almost trivial, but we're going to have more complicated situations, so it's good remembering.

215
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:37,400
That if we have one relationship between random variable that implies another one, then the set of lawmakers are a subset like this.

216
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:47,910
That's behind that relationship. Okay.

217
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:56,430
So before we get to another property, which would be limits of CDs.

218
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:11,599
So we. Okay.

219
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:26,070
Let's start with limits right away. So the property we're looking at.

220
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:32,430
So we do know what right and left continuous functions are.

221
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:41,550
So what? Let's define just in case. Um, so let's say I have a calculus function F of x.

222
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:58,400
So he's right, continues. It X if.

223
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:09,010
For any sequence. Yeah.

224
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:23,050
And such that X and convert just from above to x, we will have the induced function values.

225
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:32,780
Converge. To have of sex.

226
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:56,030
You know, if he's left continuous. And if for any second sex and such, that exam converges from below to x.

227
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,330
So this just means all values of X and remain less of equal x.

228
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:12,800
As this happens, we will have F of x and I'm referred to F of x.

229
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:37,360
So we will later show that CDF Right continues.

230
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,760
Yes. One of the properties then.

231
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:59,710
So once we mentioned continuous functions. So we will also show in the next minute that how the F have limits, right?

232
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,260
So it's bounded because it's a probability, right.

233
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:12,530
So it has to be between zero and one and zero is the limit on the left and one is the limit on the right.

234
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:26,120
So F is bounded by definition. Definition with values.

235
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:45,390
In the interval zero one. So that follows because if is probability of something great, that's how it was defined.

236
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:50,879
Probability of a central minus infinity to x prematurely.

237
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,830
That's still a probability and as a probability it must be between zero and one.

238
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:02,820
We also just found that F is monotonic.

239
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:17,510
So we just proved it. So it belongs to the class or space or functions that are bounded and monotonic.

240
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:23,720
Yeah. And I will just simple. A few properties that will be helpful later on.

241
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:32,390
So properties. Of bound and monotonic functions.

242
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:54,000
And because is such, it will satisfy those properties.

243
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:59,550
So this is from calculus or real analysis.

244
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:18,790
So the first one is that such functions can have.

245
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:24,590
Its most comfortable number of discontinuities.

246
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,680
So at any point, that's.

247
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,120
Including plus minus infinity.

248
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,730
The left and right hand limits.

249
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:16,870
And these are the limits we just used when we defined the continuity from the left and continued from the right.

250
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:30,410
Limits exist. Right.

251
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:39,920
And we interpret the existence of limits as, uh, any converging sequence induces, uh, also a converging sequence of function values.

252
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:49,940
And then so another property is the discontinuities.

253
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:17,719
Can only be of the jump type. Meaning that the function was continuous, continuous, continuous.

254
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:23,690
Then it jumps, uh, a finite amount and then it's again continuous.

255
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:44,270
Okay. So these were kind of low hanging fruit that we can just borrow from calculus as the properties of CDV.

256
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:53,750
And by the way, the, the consequence of it is that so these are properties for any sequence of X.

257
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:57,590
And so if, if I'm trying to find, for example,

258
00:46:57,590 --> 00:47:10,880
the limit of a CDF in a certain point that some statement about that limit because it's a bounded and continuous bounded and monotonic function.

259
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:24,680
Yeah. Then this implies that for any sequence the either converging to X from left on or right, the limit exists.

260
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:32,630
So it's enough for me to build the specific sequence and look for what the limit of I have is for that specific sequence.

261
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:40,400
Right. And because it's bounded in monotonically, it will carry over to any sequence like that.

262
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:47,290
So that simplifies my life a little bit.

263
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:57,100
The existence of such limits, you know, the fact that I have belongs to of the class of bound, of monotonic functions.

264
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:06,040
So talking about the limits. CDs.

265
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:21,870
Now you probably got used to the fact that zero was the limit on the left and the one is the limits on the right.

266
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:35,550
That is not always the case. So I will first prove the a little more general statement and then gets the conventional one as a corollary.

267
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:43,659
So we have limits. Yeah, it's going to minus infinity.

268
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:52,150
So all have X, that is the probability.

269
00:48:54,010 --> 00:49:02,770
Again, I said we will drop the x. So I am dropping it from the p symbol and you know how to understand it.

270
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:17,670
So what I really mean by the right part is the set of Vanegas such that X is a negative infinitive for all such ideas.

271
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:25,440
Right? And then the probability might not be zero, actually, maybe something.

272
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:37,230
And then my limit of a CDF as x goes to minus infinity is going to be is going to be this this probability.

273
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:40,680
Right. Like I said, it's not always zero.

274
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:52,750
In general, whenever you have in mathematics, some operations with infinite limits does not include the infinity points.

275
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:58,300
So if you write an integral, for example, from minus infinity to infinity,

276
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:07,000
that integrals do not include items that may be sitting at exactly minus infinity and plus infinity.

277
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:27,110
Same with limits. Right. And there is another one, similar one where I take the right hand movement on five x.

278
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:33,550
That's going to be probability that an x is equal to plus infinity.

279
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:14,100
Okay. Shall we continue so we can formulate this as a theorem?

280
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:23,380
And there are two parts of it. So the first one is the limit on the left.

281
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:27,550
And the second one is the right hand limits.

282
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:45,420
Uh, but before we go into it, I will just to make a short, uh, note on, uh, the significance of X equals plus infinity by statistics.

283
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:57,110
So this is related to a survival analysis.

284
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:01,870
So some of you may have already taken courses in survival analysis.

285
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:17,830
So let's say my axes are survival time. And I'm treating, for example, cancer patients at TIME Zero and I'm having a follow up study.

286
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:26,590
And the goal of my treatment is to never to make it the case that patients don't recur.

287
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:37,210
If they find successful, then the fraction of my population of patients that I'm treating will never experience the event of interest.

288
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:54,880
So, for example, I'm having a clinical trial. Trial of cancer patients.

289
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:11,410
I have two treatments. Let's say A and B.

290
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:19,260
I have x defined as time to recurrence of cancer.

291
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:37,990
Well, death from cancer either way. And nowadays treatments for a lot of cancers are pretty successful.

292
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:42,940
So there is a sizable fraction of the population that never recurs.

293
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:48,010
So if I have a picture of one minus CD4.

294
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:54,340
Well, thanks. That is called the survival function.

295
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:08,840
Is this just the entertainment for you? This is not really part of the course.

296
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:21,950
So a survival function describes so in the ideal situation where we can observe events on every subject and there is no missing data.

297
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:26,420
So what fraction of my original cohort will be still alive?

298
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:35,180
Uh, at type x, where x is the x axis and it starts from one.

299
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:49,040
And a typical picture would be something like this where this one minus CDF is not going to go to zero and it's going to settle with an asymptote.

300
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:55,970
So for those of you who are used to clinical data on cancer and you see survival functions in medical papers,

301
00:54:56,330 --> 00:55:03,770
there's an estimate for them, let's say a couple of Meier estimate, and you can read a smooth form into it.

302
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:08,600
And then you can see that oftentimes it tries to save a lot of blood.

303
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:18,380
So you interpret these blood so as the fraction of the population that has been cured.

304
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:43,340
They are killed by treatment. And if if the goal of treatment is to make this as large as possible,

305
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:50,330
then for the treatment and treatment B, we can compare we can estimate what this is and compare them.

306
00:55:50,450 --> 00:56:01,909
Right. And so the link here is to say that so the the recurrence that kept that cancer,

307
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:09,560
the event of cancer never coming back is mathematically expressed as X equals to infinity.

308
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:14,300
So the time to recurrence is infinitely large.

309
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:25,140
This is the event. And so never comes back.

310
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:40,170
And we certainly hope that this is the case. In this case, we will have a situation where Kdf will not go to one.

311
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:45,060
It will settle at something less than one, and we'll stay there all the way to infinity.

312
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:48,840
And that infinity will carry on.

313
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:55,300
So some mass, some probability to it. That is the goal.

314
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:55,590
Right.

315
00:56:55,590 --> 00:57:08,190
That's why I'm giving you a somewhat more general view of the properties of allowing for art to be discontinuous at infinity, either one of them.

316
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:15,290
Um, so this is not always done in the classical probability theory.

317
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:19,890
They will probably just overlook this opportunity when they talk about.

318
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:28,820
CDs in general in the class of models, the class this is called few models.

319
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:38,210
So I spent quite some time researching those.

320
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:48,820
Okay. So we can now. Start with the proof of the first one.

321
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:55,720
That's the limit when x goes to minus infinity.

322
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:04,490
So by definition, so define the limits.

323
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:12,800
So let's take the sequence. Sex and the girls from above to minus infinity.

324
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:17,900
I can define SATs and.

325
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:26,010
Is sets x less or equal.

326
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:35,020
And when I say something like this and I express the senses through the expert,

327
00:58:35,330 --> 00:58:41,140
what I really mean is the sad of all lawmakers such that I find that there is less or equal accent.

328
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:53,350
Right. But now that we're comfortable with notation either way, so we can use a shorthand just like it did in six or one and write events like this.

329
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:59,360
So this means write it once again.

330
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:06,330
But then stop doing that. Sad of all this.

331
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:10,660
Such that acts of OMG use less equal accent.

332
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:27,560
Okay. So since my exam is a monotonic sequence going to minus infinity, we have each next member of the sequence less equal.

333
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:38,180
The previous one. 4 a.m.

334
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:42,010
So what? What does that make of my sets?

335
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,920
That makes a sequence of decreasing sense.

336
00:59:46,460 --> 01:00:05,460
Right. And to show that they are decreasing, we can use the same piece of logic that we used early on when we showed the necessity of the CDF.

337
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:11,000
Right. So for any two numbers, one less than the others.

338
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:24,000
So there's x less or equal exam and plus one right will from x less or equal x plus one and plus one.

339
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:30,090
It would follow that x less equal. So that creates a nesting of the two sets, right?

340
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:38,130
Just in the same way. So they are decreasing because the exam goes left and left.

341
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:45,690
So there's less and less on figures that satisfy this inequality and for the decreasing sets.

342
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:53,080
So we know how to define the limits.

343
01:00:55,910 --> 01:01:05,860
And then it goes to infinity. And so that would be for decreasing sets, the countable intersection and from one to infinity.

344
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:13,770
And. And that intersection.

345
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:19,440
Uh, there's only one point there because, like, Sam goes to minus infinity.

346
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:24,500
That's it's not one point in terms of army.

347
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:32,180
So there may be several. But for all of those omega x of on, it is going to be minus infinity.

348
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:43,070
And so we use and it's it's a typical techniques, right, whenever I'm talking about limits.

349
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:49,070
So I'm using some sites that have a limit, some sequence of sets that have a limit,

350
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:57,200
and then I use continuity of probability to convert that limit of sets into some fact about the probabilities.

351
01:01:57,770 --> 01:02:01,160
So here, um, I have a limit.

352
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:10,550
Uh. Continuity of probability.

353
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:23,050
So I can say that limit when x goes to minus infinity of the probability that affects is less equal.

354
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:50,670
X and. So that we will go to the probability of a by continuity in the probability of a is the probability that X is equal to minus infinity.

355
01:02:51,300 --> 01:03:04,620
And that's the end of the proof. I am also using the properties of bounded monotonic functions here.

356
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:12,900
Because what I have here is F of x and by definition, right.

357
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:16,260
And I took one specific sequence,

358
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:25,470
even though arbitrary and I have shown that this is the case and because it's bounded in monotonic functions and the limit exists.

359
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:30,640
So for any sequence like that, I will have this happening.

360
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:44,459
So then we can write this guy as simply the limits of F of x with the x goes to minus infinity without any sequences.

361
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:48,580
Right? Because the limit exists. Exists even on leave.

362
01:03:49,320 --> 01:04:00,020
All sequences and that limit. So I'm also using properties of bounded monotonic functions here a little bit.

363
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:08,440
So that was one limit. Yeah. It's similar for the other one.

364
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:14,320
When. So this is proof of two.

365
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:26,850
That's when X goes to plus infinity.

366
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:40,910
And we want to know where F goes. So just a similar in a similar fashion.

367
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:46,250
I have ex go from below to plus infinity some sequence.

368
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:59,030
And because the limit exists, it's enough for me to just take it for one sequence and find what it is to find the limits.

369
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:05,130
Then we can define say it's been is um.

370
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:11,210
X and x less equal x and.

371
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:18,300
But this time this is an increase in the increasing sense.

372
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,500
Right. Because as XM increases.

373
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:35,450
So here are my facts. And plus one is greater equal access.

374
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:42,840
There's more and more omega that satisfies the relationship that X is less equal.

375
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:52,400
And so inequalities become less and less restrictive with increasing access that makes these sets increasing.

376
01:05:55,460 --> 01:06:04,400
Then for increasing SATs. My limit of B is in girls to Infinity is going to be a union.

377
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:07,550
Right. So they are still nested, but.

378
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:19,860
The other way. So that's the talent of a union of bands.

379
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:31,420
And here. It's the very image of the whole hour without.

380
01:06:39,500 --> 01:07:01,960
In the Senate. You. But these at the same time, uh, the omega, the full omega without the parts of it that makes x equal to plus infinity.

381
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:20,239
So we already defined at some points what the probability of a difference between what

382
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:25,450
the difference between two sets is and what the probability of that difference is.

383
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:37,520
So let me just for reference, uh, give these formulas again and specifically give them for the example where I have a nesting,

384
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:45,410
let's say I have a set of a nested within the set of be in the hive, have a partition.

385
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:58,790
US Army go into A and T with the bar.

386
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:05,150
So we had B without the E.

387
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:10,260
So that's the intersection of B, C and E complements.

388
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:18,090
That's how it was defined. Then we can use the formula of total probability.

389
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:39,940
With this partition for the probability of V, that's going to be probability of A plus probability of B without the E.

390
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:54,080
Because and there's a probability of e I actually have, uh, the, the probability of a intersection.

391
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,140
B And that's, that's the E, right? Because of the nesting.

392
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:16,360
And then the section of D with a complement is by definition the uh, probability of us B without the a the difference between sense.

393
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:29,930
Now from this I can express the probability of B without A is probability of B minus the probability of A.

394
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:38,499
So it's enough. If you just look at the Venn diagrams and just use your intuition for this last statement without

395
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:49,329
actually filling in the blanks between the Venn diagram and this relationship on the last line then.

396
01:09:49,330 --> 01:09:52,960
So coming back, uh.

397
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:06,000
So I'm using this understanding, uh, in a, in a different way, so you can read it either forward or backward, right?

398
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:15,589
So if you have a difference between two probabilities and this is what I'm going to use repeatedly and one of the sets is,

399
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:23,420
is nested in the other one, then that difference can be converted to a probability of a single set.

400
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:30,980
That's the larger one without the smaller one. And this is how I'm going to use it.

401
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:37,160
So then by continue each of these, I'm coming back to the chain.

402
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:48,160
Uh, before I made this note. By continuity.

403
01:10:52,040 --> 01:11:01,700
Of probability I have the limit. X goes to infinity f of x.

404
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:09,440
That's the probability of the set made without.

405
01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:15,790
The one that gives X equal to infinity.

406
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:30,530
You can also express it if you address it through X, that's a probability that X is strictly less than infinity.

407
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:36,650
So that's including excluding the point at and CDC.

408
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:43,140
Now I'm reading this last relationship backwards or forwards?

409
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:48,940
Forwards right there. This is a difference between two probabilities.

410
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:59,520
And one of them is Omega. So that's a one. And another one is the probability that X equals two plus infinity.

411
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:46,360
Okay. So I misspelled that thing. Okay.

412
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:51,340
So that's the end of proof.

413
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,190
And that's it for today.
