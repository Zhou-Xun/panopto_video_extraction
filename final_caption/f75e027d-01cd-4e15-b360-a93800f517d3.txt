00:00:05,229 --> 00:00:09,378
Hello this is the second of a series
of two lectures discussing summary

2
00:00:09,378 --> 00:00:10,640
statistics.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,730
This lecture will cover the quantifying
the amount of spread in your data or

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,620
variability on your data.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,512
As we have discussed,

6
00:00:17,512 --> 00:00:22,300
we have now estimated the signal in our
data using either a mean or a median.

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,590
We now want to assess how
strong that signal is.

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,460
Now, your statistic,

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,530
your signal, is really the opinion
you have reached from your data.

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,130
You now want to think about how well
your data support this opinion,

11
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,710
how much of your data
support this opinion, and

12
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,880
how much of the data might
differ from that opinion.

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,430
So really what we wanna know is how much
each of the data points are expected to

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,150
vary around your signal.

15
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,210
This is important to consider.

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,208
If someone else were try to replicate
your study by doing everything that you

17
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,863
did except collect a new sample of data,

18
00:00:55,863 --> 00:00:59,940
we would want to know how close
their result would be to yours.

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,960
We refer to this noise in your data
as the spread or the variability.

20
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,290
Now, as I have discussed,

21
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,290
we often use the sample mean as a measure
of a summary of the location of our data.

22
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:17,820
We are now curious how each value in
a data might differ from this mean.

23
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,540
My example is a set of 30 patients
who have received antibiotics

24
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,510
while being hospitalized.

25
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:29,045
We'll let X sub i denote
the length of stay in days for

26
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:32,351
patient i, and i goes from 1 to 30.

27
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:36,910
The 30 ordered values for the lengths of
stay of these patients are listed below.

28
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,210
The lowest number is 0, indicating
this patient was in the hospital for

29
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,630
less than a day.

30
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,360
Up to a maximum of 49 days for
one of the patients.

31
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,720
The sample mean, x bar, is simply the sum
of these 30 numbers divided by 30,

32
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,960
which results in a number of 12.

33
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,230
So on average,

34
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,550
we expect a patient receiving antibiotics
to stay in the hospital for 12 days.

35
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:04,080
But we can see that only three people in
my data set had an actual length of stay

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,650
of 12.

37
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,260
Some were below that number, and
some were above that number.

38
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,090
So we might consider looking
at exactly how much of

39
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,140
each of these values of length
of stay differs from this mean

40
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,020
of 12 by taking the difference
between the length of stay and 12.

41
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,988
We might then consider taking the average
of all of these 30 observations as

42
00:02:22,988 --> 00:02:27,728
a measure of how different the average
observation is from the sample mean.

43
00:02:27,728 --> 00:02:30,570
However, for any set of data,
and any sample size,

44
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:36,190
by the definition of the sample mean, this
average deviation will always be zero,

45
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,810
giving us very little information
about spread of the data.

46
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,440
As an alternative, we consider taking each
of these deviations and we square them.

47
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,850
Because we are not interested
in the actual number of units

48
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,680
away from the mean on the left or
the right.

49
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,970
We simply want to know the magnitude.

50
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,590
So a value three observations
below the mean, and

51
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,460
observation three values above the mean,
would connote the same information.

52
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,730
So we square these numbers to get rid
of the negative signs because three and

53
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,190
negative three are both
squared to be nine.

54
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,630
I add up these 30 squared deviations,
I take their average.

55
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,870
Now, I divide by 29 instead of 30 for

56
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,160
numerical reasons that are not
important to this course.

57
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,000
This average squared deviation,

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,570
however, is in a squared unit,
in squared length of stay.

59
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,730
And I would like to make inference
on the original unit of the data,

60
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,500
which is length of stay.

61
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,650
I do that by taking the square root
of this averaged squared deviation.

62
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,970
This number ends up to be 9.2 in my data.

63
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,860
So on average, I expect a length
of stay to vary about 9 days

64
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,390
from the average of 12.

65
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:49,880
This number, which I call S sub x ,is
known as the sample standard deviation for

66
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,940
the length of stay in our data.

67
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,980
We could also square this number, and
this is known as the sample variance.

68
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,200
The sample variance will prove useful
in computations in later lectures.

69
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,330
So again, the sample variance is the
square of the sample standard deviation,

70
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:13,240
and the sample standard deviation is
the square root of the sample variance.

71
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,188
Again, I emphasize, in the calculation
of the sample standard deviation,

72
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:18,598
that I square the numbers.

73
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:23,068
So that a number, say, three units below
the mean and a value three units above

74
00:04:23,068 --> 00:04:27,380
the mean both contribute a value
of nine to the computation.

75
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,820
Thus values that are the same distance
from the mean contribute equally.

76
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,500
This implies an assumption of symmetry
in the distribution of the values, so

77
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,450
that observations are fairly equally
distributed on both sides of the mean.

78
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,510
If the data have a skewed distribution,
then the sample standard deviation

79
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,840
is not a useful summary of
the spread of the data.

80
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,770
Instead, we will use
two numbers to connote

81
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,030
how much spread there is in the data.

82
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,630
Again, recall for
data that has a skewed distribution,

83
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:03,570
we prefer summarizing the signal with
the sample median instead of the mean.

84
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,430
And as I said, we will not use a single
value, but rather use a specific pair

85
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,360
of values to connote on how much
spread there is on the data.

86
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,962
Now, these two values will not necessarily
be symmetric around the median.

87
00:05:14,962 --> 00:05:19,540
And will therefore demonstrate how
skewed the distribution might be.

88
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,620
The first pair of values I'm going to
present is simply using the smallest

89
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,170
number in your dataset, the minimum,
and the largest value in your dataset,

90
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,720
the maximum.

91
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,720
These values are known
collectively as the sample range.

92
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,390
Now, sometimes you might see
the difference between the maximum and

93
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,100
the minimum being reported
as the sample range.

94
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,030
But again, this is a single number,
and by itself,

95
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,340
we cannot determine the skewness
as being right or left.

96
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,880
So again, recall the 30 lengths of
stay for the patients in my sample.

97
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,830
I ordered these observations
from lowest to highest.

98
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,710
The sample median will lie in the middle,
which is between the 15th and

99
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,070
the 16th observation, which are both 10.

100
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:00,260
I take the average of those two numbers,
which is 10,

101
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,390
giving us a sample median of 10.

102
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:08,300
Now, the sample mean of 12 and the sample
median of 10 suggest a slightly right

103
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,820
skewed distribution because the mean
is on the right of the median.

104
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,776
The sample range, as I said,
is simply the smallest number and

105
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:21,370
the largest number in our data set,
which is 0 and 49.

106
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,047
This sample range again denotes
a right skewed distribution because

107
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:33,484
the distance from 0 to 10 is much
smaller than the distance from 10 to 49.

108
00:06:33,484 --> 00:06:36,192
We could also visually see
this through a histogram,

109
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:40,090
which is a method we have
presented in previous lectures.

110
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,170
Again, this picture is a demonstration

111
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,300
of the distribution of the lengths
of stay of the 30 patients.

112
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,420
The x-axis demonstrates
ranges of lengths of stay.

113
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:56,170
And the y axis shows us how many people
have lengths of stay in that interval.

114
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,578
I have included a line to
indicate the median of 10.

115
00:06:59,578 --> 00:07:03,850
And again, we can see the right skewed
property of these data with the one

116
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:10,791
person with a length of stay of 49 days,
far from the majority of the data.

117
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:14,754
A complement to reporting the sample of
range is another pair of numbers known as

118
00:07:14,754 --> 00:07:17,640
the sample interquartile range.

119
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,235
Again, 50% of the data
range from 0 to 10 and

120
00:07:20,235 --> 00:07:25,970
50% of the data range from 10 to 49
by the definition of the median.

121
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,030
We now find the medians of
these two ranges themselves.

122
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:34,860
The median of 0 to 10 is
known as the lower quartile,

123
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,430
it is the 25th percentile of the data.

124
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:43,230
The middle of 10 to 49 is known as the
75th percentile, or the third quartile.

125
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,420
Combined as a pair, the 25th and

126
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:50,770
the 75th percentiles are what
we call the interquartile range.

127
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:56,040
Again, we call the 30 values in our
dataset ordered from smallest to largest.

128
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,898
The median is the 50th percentile,
right in the middle at 10.

129
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:04,390
The lower quartile is the middle
of the first 15 observations.

130
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,890
That number is seven.

131
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,310
The 75th percentile,
or the third quartile,

132
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,430
is the middle of the upper 15
observations and that is 14.

133
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:19,487
Therefore, the interquartile range for
these data is 7 to 14.

134
00:08:19,487 --> 00:08:23,541
Again, the sample interquartile range,
when compared to the median,

135
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:28,393
shows a right-skewed distribution, because
the distance from 7 to 10 is slightly

136
00:08:28,393 --> 00:08:33,043
smaller than the distance from 10 to 14.

137
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:36,971
Now visually, we can look at the median
and interquartile range through another

138
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:41,520
plot known as a box plot,
which is an alternative to a histogram.

139
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,980
In the box plot we see a box that is
colored and a line inside of that box.

140
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,707
The interquartile range Is the box.

141
00:08:50,707 --> 00:08:53,134
The lower end is the 25th percentile and

142
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:58,070
the upper end is the third quartile or
the 75th percentile.

143
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:03,180
The solid line inside of
this box denotes the median.

144
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,360
There are whiskers attached to this box,

145
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,390
therefore also giving the box plot
the name box and whiskers plot.

146
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:14,130
The length of these whiskers denote the
5th percentile and the 95th percentile.

147
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,700
Again, the 5th percentile is
the value at which only 5%

148
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,570
of the data could be below that number.

149
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,270
And the 95th percentile is the number
at which 5% of the observations

150
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,380
are above that number.

151
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,810
Anything outside of the 95th and the 5th
percentile are known as outliers and

152
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,630
are denoted by dots.

153
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:36,570
Here in these data, we have two outliers
for the person who stayed in the hospital

154
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:42,230
for 27 days and for the person who
stayed in the hospital for 49 days.

155
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,970
So at this point,
we have discussed both numeric and

156
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,789
visual approaches to summarizing
the variability in your data.
