1
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:10,440
I see the message again if this is Norm. just trying to make sure.

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,400
love you. bye-bye. love you.

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,400
you know don't you

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,700
capture whatever. okay.

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,740
alright.

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,120
so that so that was that was my first announcement. the second announcement

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,360
is I just wanna point out to you for this coming Thursday two days from now.

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,300
there's something new you've been asked to do. you already.

9
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,580
listen to a presentation on your own. before you come by.

10
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:59,800
and then also for the Missus Johnson_Controls case.

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,001
which is a little bit shorter and easier to look at the this

12
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:11,301
is the rebate but we'll do something similar on Thursday to what we did with the EEG.

13
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:18,241
spend most of our time. I think on that. see.

14
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:23,241
I guess the next. I think I was working on this and we talked but

15
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:28,941
we're gonna also give you short faces.

16
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:35,561
and to remind you. you're supposed to complete quizzes with elections.

17
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:40,741
they're not great. so just a question of completing them. but let's try

18
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:46,701
to get the main line and help to make sure that you you understand what you listen to.

19
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:57,561
so I think the person are gonna post this problem with metal. are you gonna do both.

20
00:01:57,561 --> 00:02:02,641
so she will be posting a set a question. what I'm talking about

21
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:07,741
today and also for the metal. which is what you supposed to bring for Thursday. we're gonna go back

22
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:12,985
and get

23
00:02:12,985 --> 00:02:18,105
yeah

24
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:23,745
I'm glad to hear last time.

25
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:29,385
I love you. okay.

26
00:02:29,385 --> 00:02:35,165
anyway we're also gonna give you quizzes from

27
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:40,225
the previous lectures. but those long. you don't have_to complete those are sort of complete at your

28
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:52,385
leisure. like complete them by the meet time.

29
00:02:52,385 --> 00:03:14,995
so I'll holler on the home page got the message. it's not there

30
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:20,435
alright yes I like I said

31
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:26,555
for the after the fact.

32
00:03:26,555 --> 00:03:31,655
do before you said. I mean you wanna do this for the midterm anyway. I hope this doesn't make

33
00:03:31,655 --> 00:03:40,615
time. okay. I'll leave anything out.

34
00:03:40,615 --> 00:03:46,955
I didn't say that. okay. what's up Stacy Quail for the end of the class today.

35
00:03:46,955 --> 00:03:56,175
yeah. yeah.

36
00:03:56,175 --> 00:04:01,195
okay or you know you say you need a break from me

37
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:06,637
from you. maybe we'll closer. alright. so this is

38
00:04:06,637 --> 00:04:11,657
this is pretty dance with live but I'm gonna try to stick to the high place and not

39
00:04:11,657 --> 00:04:16,737
have everything's on every five. so we're gonna talk about. especially

40
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:21,817
I guess it's an issue close to my heart because this is very very

41
00:04:21,817 --> 00:04:28,297
prevalent. we must have an occupational disease. and

42
00:04:28,297 --> 00:04:34,257
everyone's are you aware sometime I have not the extra large percent of the world population.

43
00:04:34,257 --> 00:04:39,257
including in the US. and we think

44
00:04:39,257 --> 00:04:44,517
you need you at least three percent of all at or actually call.

45
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:49,577
bye. something at work. so that's like about half a million

46
00:04:49,577 --> 00:04:54,577
cases of ads that are actually directly due to work and I

47
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:59,757
think I have a slide on it. but if you can. if you or someone you know

48
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:04,993
never had highlights including whether your child adolescent Andy

49
00:05:04,993 --> 00:05:10,073
developed asthma. just told by the doctor maybe you go to the doctor said. you know you have that.

50
00:05:10,073 --> 00:05:15,293
I want to do that as dog in that situation. so

51
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:20,753
if that works but in that situation. the probability that it

52
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:27,193
work related that. so that new is all done. that goes way.

53
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:32,513
it depends on what that is you look at it probably be twenty five or thirty percent maybe even close to fifty

54
00:05:32,513 --> 00:05:42,253
percent. so in that situation quite late from work. alright.

55
00:05:42,253 --> 00:05:47,393
talk to you about this but I think there's been hired since then and you heard me say

56
00:05:47,393 --> 00:05:52,593
that last time I parked it again once or twice but part of the reason it's so important

57
00:05:52,593 --> 00:05:58,273
to make this diagnosis correctly. because if you read people working.

58
00:05:58,273 --> 00:06:03,693
we actually have occupation last mother actually Doctor Tyson something at working. so they can be repeated.

59
00:06:03,693 --> 00:06:09,291
he supposed to see if they continue on the same job I

60
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:14,671
doing that. we really bad out there including like

61
00:06:14,671 --> 00:06:20,191
it never matter. even I finally left work after a couple of years putting up.

62
00:06:20,191 --> 00:06:25,731
so it's quite important. just figure out if something occupational because the invite.

63
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:31,071
it would be really good idea. you do not keep working on this situation. it's important. no

64
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:36,111
terms of the person to tell you about a change

65
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:41,775
job the labor that this is a typical story.

66
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:46,975
give yourself a half of my life that has an occupational asthma. I

67
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:51,975
also give you an idea of all the things that clinician.

68
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:58,015
as a group of people responded that might do wrong or make mistakes.

69
00:06:58,015 --> 00:07:03,355
so just wondered where is panel. actually deal Road Road. she's not really given much

70
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:08,775
training on a job. me not about safety on the job. or maybe you might

71
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:13,975
have a tour and what happened to her. well she start she after a few

72
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:19,115
months on this job she starts noticing that she's getting her eyes

73
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:24,115
are red and irritated and she wakes up with laptop on them and that kinda thing and she's got

74
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:29,295
a running nose and she also start noticing having what we call a lower

75
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:34,855
respiratory. we been chat. feeling short of breath.

76
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:40,050
when he tried to exert yourself the way that was going on before and here this is sort

77
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:46,010
of a giveaway. this is getting better. she only works Monday to Friday. bye.

78
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:51,090
Sunday. she feels a_lot better. she goes back to work and since it's repaired. so

79
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:56,450
that like huge it's related to work right. if you noticed that

80
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:01,970
she also notices that she's get scratch my roseman. you get these raised

81
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:07,010
red patches. they have white vendors that we call the carrier. higher

82
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:12,230
would be common term for them. so she react that as well. so she doesn't

83
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:17,330
see her own doctor and that person. all that

84
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,330
team dance the occupational because it does the usual.

85
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,890
take the bronco die later. they help a little but she's still

86
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:33,210
having symptoms and then finally this file is the real story. five eight.

87
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:38,298
after about a year on this job. this is continued for months with that she has an after

88
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:44,378
service call Angela. shit. serious is probably reading this is where you get that

89
00:08:44,378 --> 00:08:49,838
reaction. an allergic reaction. where she's getting swelling in her throat and Silver

90
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:54,998
Airways. one of the potential life threatening. and

91
00:08:54,998 --> 00:09:00,058
so she does the ER. she gets treated and she just

92
00:09:00,058 --> 00:09:05,138
died. we got the position to tell her not to return to work. she decided she can go back to this

93
00:09:05,138 --> 00:09:10,418
job. okay she resigned. so we're gonna come back today at the end of day.

94
00:09:10,418 --> 00:09:17,198
if any problems with that story. alright. so

95
00:09:17,198 --> 00:09:22,518
she's part that. they had to do the occupation occupational at new.

96
00:09:22,518 --> 00:09:27,938
that never happened before versus work aggravated also called words activated

97
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:33,078
out which is quite common with the person that does have a history of that. you know many

98
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:39,674
people. this is their brother Brown. I got older but

99
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:45,974
very either heard or if it was ready dear gets much worse.

100
00:09:45,974 --> 00:09:51,194
you're the definition of occupational asthma. so the first part of that. very prayerful

101
00:09:51,194 --> 00:09:56,394
limitation and or airway hyper response with that

102
00:09:56,394 --> 00:10:01,614
general definition of that was gonna make occupational. the fact that it

103
00:10:01,614 --> 00:10:07,514
do this particular patient condition. so what we need but it's very both very close invitation.

104
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:12,554
so when we talked last week I talked about how when you

105
00:10:12,554 --> 00:10:18,934
have an athletic packet. when you try hale. you have a_lot_of instruction there. alright.

106
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:24,294
so that's what we're talking about your presentation it's variable because typically with that.

107
00:10:24,294 --> 00:10:29,334
you have good days and bad days in between episodes you may have heard the normal lung function. so it's

108
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:34,434
very not there all the time or not at the same level. I will talk more about

109
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:40,058
the airway Heights response of that. I think I showed you that. later this is basically

110
00:10:40,058 --> 00:10:46,118
if you take a person that has that. whether or not. and you exposed

111
00:10:46,118 --> 00:10:51,758
to it. your cheating agent. hasn't held it. what we usually use.

112
00:10:51,758 --> 00:10:57,298
we use this as a test actually to diagnose that. what we usually use or something I'm at the polling.

113
00:10:57,298 --> 00:11:02,638
so what happened. so they're not allergic to metric calling. it's just in here. what happened did

114
00:11:02,638 --> 00:11:07,658
you get even a person with Norma Long. hi I got those it. we'll start to have

115
00:11:07,658 --> 00:11:12,798
him drop in there at the one. well work as well. bye. people that

116
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:17,938
McKenzie. visit Lisa. so that's what's not my have. so they'll take up

117
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:23,618
those breathing my floor concentration. that would be needed to sector person without asthma.

118
00:11:23,618 --> 00:11:29,038
and I'll actually get the process out_of them around there. Ross feels

119
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:34,378
and have that to drop in there at the one four six. thanks Tori five one seven.

120
00:11:34,378 --> 00:11:40,052
so this is actually a test. you can do for how to respond. call. calling

121
00:11:40,052 --> 00:11:45,332
okay.

122
00:11:45,332 --> 00:11:50,872
we're deactivated here. you got pre- existing conference

123
00:11:50,872 --> 00:11:56,112
typical symptoms. it's a combination of the chest type. we think.

124
00:11:56,112 --> 00:12:01,312
okay. which which just so people are away. which one of those for the classic

125
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:06,472
symptoms. if you only have one phone. you would say to me. you don't

126
00:12:06,472 --> 00:12:11,552
need to be a connection another is just happy with what you would say to me which

127
00:12:11,552 --> 00:12:16,612
one of you only had that you would say. well you don't know whether that person is

128
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:22,572
actually having respiratory problems lung problem or something out

129
00:12:22,572 --> 00:12:27,972
right. because you get half from all kind of things like post nasal trip. doesn't actually have

130
00:12:27,972 --> 00:12:33,232
the problem is actually take up there. call start actually affecting your chest.

131
00:12:33,232 --> 00:12:38,392
but the other one. chest tightness reason shortness of breath. that's pretty

132
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:44,804
much it. know that there's something more. so

133
00:12:44,804 --> 00:12:51,004
when we talk about occupational asthma. basic goodbye. between

134
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:56,064
what's called occupational at Mosley agency. which is also called the type

135
00:12:56,064 --> 00:13:02,264
of asthma which is more the most common type and. if you read

136
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:07,344
that. if you gonna get for an agent in your work place. you're gonna get

137
00:13:07,344 --> 00:13:12,554
occupational asthma with late fees. reason I said with late fees. because

138
00:13:12,554 --> 00:13:18,254
you won't have an ass contact the very first time you're ever exposed to the chemical or proteins.

139
00:13:18,254 --> 00:13:23,614
you've never been exposed before. what happened the first time is required for your body mountain

140
00:13:23,614 --> 00:13:28,774
in your logical response to the exposure. later. closer. where

141
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:35,494
you actually have you know the symptoms and a drop in your phone and function.

142
00:13:35,494 --> 00:13:40,774
so that's why it can be started that late fees and deposit.

143
00:13:40,774 --> 00:13:46,934
give me a logic for one set of agents will talk about a minute. we can't understand

144
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:52,014
quite well. not like that in the knowledge is more complicated. alright.

145
00:13:52,014 --> 00:13:59,314
so I look at your own screen. I'm guessing you can't really read that. alright.

146
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:04,534
you have it on your screen. so basically what it says here. is that used

147
00:14:04,534 --> 00:14:10,474
to talk to the agent that. since it ties in Tuesday.

148
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:15,667
high molecular weight agents which almost always seen and usually

149
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:21,287
non- human processing postings from planet or other species of animals

150
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:26,727
or bacteria and so on. it's usually their proteins

151
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:32,047
or there's low molecular weight agents. Anthony's high molecular weight agents.

152
00:14:32,047 --> 00:14:37,287
so let me see it's a good classic example. thought about

153
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:42,287
and sign. so you know there is a fee of a big pot of that. like a_lot_of the

154
00:14:42,287 --> 00:14:47,287
chairs and see if they they say and sign active or something like that. it's supposed to work

155
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:52,307
better with the break up that's better. so I'll talk to you soon. see

156
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:57,387
you on that. so what happened with that. pick up that branch out and I guess it doesn't

157
00:14:57,387 --> 00:15:02,487
help with removing some kind dirt. they didn't really think about it didn't know

158
00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:07,527
about that they were concerned about the work place and actually what happened at the first facility.

159
00:15:07,527 --> 00:15:12,595
to start using that rent it out right the patient had

160
00:15:12,595 --> 00:15:17,715
because they were people are getting very high in relation of those enzymes which

161
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:22,795
is with the foreign property not in payment processing. just the kinda thing that can do today.

162
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:28,155
if you can the athletic and sensor ties. they were getting exposed to what

163
00:15:28,155 --> 00:15:33,195
turned out the way high level. allow the first. take it easy and do that.

164
00:15:33,195 --> 00:15:38,835
so. so time to elect a new agent. that's

165
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:43,995
what we time out here by the way. for case we just talked about the woman who's working in

166
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:49,215
animal lab. she gonna be exposed to high molecular weight agencies.

167
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:55,735
the I still very low molecular weight.

168
00:15:55,735 --> 00:16:00,935
high right. it's gonna be on the road. to talk

169
00:16:00,935 --> 00:16:06,095
to problem. but some of some variety. okay. and so

170
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:11,227
we'll talk more about this but I did love the likely wait agent one of the top

171
00:16:11,227 --> 00:16:16,367
of the list. it is very important in general but also very important for this part of the world

172
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:22,407
because of the state dialysis site. so

173
00:16:22,407 --> 00:16:28,307
when we built party today. the

174
00:16:28,307 --> 00:16:33,807
job goes on it. now is the base of that

175
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:39,867
is the polyurethane and the reason people use polyurethane for pain car.

176
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:44,947
because polyurethane. other places you could use a prepaid one very cheap

177
00:16:44,947 --> 00:16:50,507
resistant. so it doesn't shift. he's leaving us down two.

178
00:16:50,507 --> 00:16:55,707
it's very sunlight with this and it doesn't say. so it's preferred where you make

179
00:16:55,707 --> 00:17:00,747
a polyurethane from scratch. if you can. probably alcohol with the direct

180
00:17:00,747 --> 00:17:07,047
client. if this is something that has_to be see Andrew on it and

181
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:12,153
and the doctor sign it. it's quite exquisite we've reacted and

182
00:17:12,153 --> 00:17:17,193
so there's been a_lot_of outbreak with disease.

183
00:17:17,193 --> 00:17:22,393
so save me back. bye. bye. T H.

184
00:17:22,393 --> 00:17:28,373
so on and a_lot_of connecting. so

185
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:33,773
in the you know like the big three around here they have all the fancy way to control

186
00:17:33,773 --> 00:17:38,913
and that and trying to make sure that non- of that actually reaches the breathing zone of any work. this

187
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:43,933
is Ross. I hate that. I think you did. I'm

188
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:48,973
on told. damn it going on. people getting

189
00:17:48,973 --> 00:17:54,173
high dialysis. getting bad occupational body shop.

190
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:59,493
a_lot_of body shop. you know that they don't have they don't have huge D small

191
00:17:59,493 --> 00:18:04,813
operation. they have both driving way it may work it may not work

192
00:18:04,813 --> 00:18:10,505
but you got people that are missing. bye. whatever

193
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:15,885
with the Polly out. make polyurethane a_lot_of time. so that's it that's the big issue

194
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:21,185
here and there's other agents as well as including some of the agents like acid in high drive

195
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:27,185
that you can run into an epoxy. so that you know two component

196
00:18:27,185 --> 00:18:32,345
and there's a_lot_of other ones not gonna bore you with. let's observe the night with

197
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:37,405
something. think about. okay. so that was application last

198
00:18:37,405 --> 00:18:42,865
with latency. that's the type and do the application last. other time you can get it.

199
00:18:42,865 --> 00:18:48,005
I was just talking for Carlene Feeney and you can ask not from the first

200
00:18:48,005 --> 00:18:53,625
time you're ever exposed to this agent but not as reactive airway dysfunction Central.

201
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:59,085
and that happen. so like bye. give you a story about somebody I saw

202
00:18:59,085 --> 00:19:04,385
in our occupational medicine one time. he with skill

203
00:19:04,385 --> 00:19:09,545
trades for pennies repairing things in the factory. and I think it was

204
00:19:09,545 --> 00:19:14,671
doing. making refrigeration products so one otherwise busy at least commercial

205
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:20,571
refrigeration. they often use ammonia. agent they actually you know

206
00:19:20,571 --> 00:19:25,891
and then get the refrigeration. so he was working on

207
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:31,171
- some valves. so we got this huge bird of ammonia. straight in Tuesday.

208
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:36,671
a quite high concentration. and he he would see

209
00:19:36,671 --> 00:19:42,051
it didn't feel well. right then and started having chest tightness

210
00:19:42,051 --> 00:19:47,891
and wheezing and so on. but what happened was from that date forward.

211
00:19:47,891 --> 00:19:52,903
he had you know you would react to other years.

212
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:59,283
Sonya always a problem not single exposure very high exposure.

213
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:04,883
so this is this is Taylor from one of your readings and the reason it's that criteria

214
00:20:04,883 --> 00:20:10,583
for raspberry. there was a message on the last and has

215
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:15,803
had modifications the criteria on the right. because the original packet came out.

216
00:20:15,803 --> 00:20:20,883
have a_lot_of situations where this is happening. bye. activation I have

217
00:20:20,883 --> 00:20:26,803
about late fees. but if they had more more cases they realize it. hi Terry this is be a little bit broader.

218
00:20:26,803 --> 00:20:31,923
so real estate happy new month that be new that

219
00:20:31,923 --> 00:20:36,923
parent child. and so I won't read all this to you. but if you

220
00:20:36,923 --> 00:20:42,243
say update for what is it currently you should look right.

221
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:48,758
although these two don't count. every hyper response. this is an

222
00:20:48,758 --> 00:20:53,978
I decided on you. in terms of the house. what are the most recent agents

223
00:20:53,978 --> 00:20:59,138
that are involved with this kind of activation last night. the other one that I'm involved

224
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:04,558
floor. you know the combination of what use while away. my call as well

225
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:09,578
at room temperature. and and how the agent is

226
00:21:09,578 --> 00:21:16,078
apparently. so if there's any other agents can do it the first time in Florida.

227
00:21:16,078 --> 00:21:21,118
so. so we have a application. again just to survey things out. you got all

228
00:21:21,118 --> 00:21:26,198
that non- work related course mostly out in the world. we're focus

229
00:21:26,198 --> 00:21:31,678
on work related. I know we talked about we're aggravated with the

230
00:21:31,678 --> 00:21:36,818
existing asthma versus true space last night. never had that before.

231
00:21:36,818 --> 00:21:42,078
now I do because it's not it work. and we said they did the application last night with

232
00:21:42,078 --> 00:21:47,442
late this evening. teachers actually an agent if the application

233
00:21:47,442 --> 00:21:53,582
last without Lacy. we're single high bills and do.

234
00:21:53,582 --> 00:21:59,862
so the one that we have talked about yet is we haven't talked and we talked about long.

235
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:05,222
I specialize in a little late repeated. the difference between. I GE handed

236
00:22:05,222 --> 00:22:10,822
ID and you know go out and one. E I G had an asthma.

237
00:22:10,822 --> 00:22:16,062
and I GE independent that and I had up in the next five or.

238
00:22:16,062 --> 00:22:22,022
so. so we're talking about is been exposed to Rosen proteins.

239
00:22:22,022 --> 00:22:27,182
she's gonna have the ID depended out for all Ohio rate agents which are basically

240
00:22:27,182 --> 00:22:32,262
mostly proteins you. I keep mediated for IG independent

241
00:22:32,262 --> 00:22:37,522
asthma. other more. my cousin is going on. I

242
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:43,036
decided. so that you can see some changes ideas not driven but I G

243
00:22:43,036 --> 00:22:48,256
and Western red seater which actually. this is a big issue in the North West post

244
00:22:48,256 --> 00:22:53,436
the US. we actually use Western Red Cedar area there. you probably know. you can use it for things

245
00:22:53,436 --> 00:22:58,976
like tacky and outdoor area in fact resistance apparently and so on. but unfortunately

246
00:22:58,976 --> 00:23:04,396
had an agent. had classes. you know I see AC. this is a

247
00:23:04,396 --> 00:23:09,496
test of hygiene agent but not using it Angie. bye.

248
00:23:09,496 --> 00:23:15,576
alright. so brought back to me.

249
00:23:15,576 --> 00:23:20,596
I just told you that we have two different yesterday. so

250
00:23:20,596 --> 00:23:25,716
here is left like we looked at before and again all have

251
00:23:25,716 --> 00:23:32,036
like everyone's gonna be ID mediated. maybe not office any longer like to

252
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:37,156
wait agents like I can sign it. well you lucky.

253
00:23:37,156 --> 00:23:42,176
you can look at your leisure not through. I wanna ask I wanna ask you

254
00:23:42,176 --> 00:23:47,176
a question seven five eight. this is a little too much data you are all commissions in the room but the

255
00:23:47,176 --> 00:24:01,236
service shows you how you can. yeah.

256
00:24:01,236 --> 00:24:06,536
yeah there. you're right there is. it's not it's not really complete because

257
00:24:06,536 --> 00:24:11,796
it was sort of like we dealt with work there. but you're

258
00:24:11,796 --> 00:24:16,976
right. you can have verification from different types of agents that acting

259
00:24:16,976 --> 00:24:22,416
differently. goodbye. alright. so

260
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:27,716
I just told you about. nine eight. so polyurethane phone. thanks.

261
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:32,876
bye. I just talked those animals. so this is used to clean our streets.

262
00:24:32,876 --> 00:24:38,016
so okay. I tell war stories because I don't want want to stay at least a little bit

263
00:24:38,016 --> 00:24:44,404
away. I'll tell you about another person I saw. very unfortunate situation. by the way

264
00:24:44,404 --> 00:24:49,404
the legal limit. for dialysis I need twenty part for Billy and how

265
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:54,644
much you have an area that's quite low. and but the recommended limits like the nicest

266
00:24:54,644 --> 00:24:59,844
little five parts of the building because we clearly cases of people coming. that's the time. even

267
00:24:59,844 --> 00:25:05,204
that low. so this person was working

268
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:11,644
and what his job is on the line what his job was was that they were making like.

269
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:17,144
would you be resting your arm on a car like hand in the door and the way it was made

270
00:25:17,144 --> 00:25:22,544
is they with support. direct sign eight and it's probably alcohol

271
00:25:22,544 --> 00:25:27,784
together into metal Mall. the molder close and we go through Ferguson repeated.

272
00:25:27,784 --> 00:25:32,944
so that they react to each other. and then we come out and do it. they're both in in his job.

273
00:25:32,944 --> 00:25:38,064
use some little stick or something or he was very hot. he would basically pull

274
00:25:38,064 --> 00:25:43,284
the resolved out_of stack behind. that's all you doing all day. bye. think what open

275
00:25:43,284 --> 00:25:49,588
space so they didn't have the time to control you need. if you could you guys decide.

276
00:25:49,588 --> 00:25:54,608
you should have a fail safe thing. if this is the poly alcohol runs

277
00:25:54,608 --> 00:25:59,948
out. the alarm goes off and then shut down. power alcohol ran out

278
00:25:59,948 --> 00:26:05,428
ran out someone failed to replace it. so it's Gordon. only the dialysis sign eight in.

279
00:26:05,428 --> 00:26:10,608
he did it up. just in case you didn't have behind a paper pressure already got it nice and hot.

280
00:26:10,608 --> 00:26:16,048
came out and opened it and he said that he never returns that work environment

281
00:26:16,048 --> 00:26:21,068
and had actually had had a dozen years by the time we saw from

282
00:26:21,068 --> 00:26:30,074
that one in just. okay

283
00:26:30,074 --> 00:26:35,554
to talk about that. you wanna see it. bye. bye.

284
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:41,014
use one series. I space last does wanna thing

285
00:26:41,014 --> 00:26:46,014
trash. bye. I mentioned Center. Michigan State University here in

286
00:26:46,014 --> 00:26:51,334
track station home owners track my poison out. track special last

287
00:26:51,334 --> 00:26:57,474
night. this is older data this is Joy. there's cases of recurring and

288
00:26:57,474 --> 00:27:02,834
what they'll do is that like if someone usually might be an occupational position

289
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:08,194
back in another condition reports in case you're in theory. I position

290
00:27:08,194 --> 00:27:14,074
I'm required to report any suspicious case in the State of Michigan to

291
00:27:14,074 --> 00:27:19,134
to assess the Michigan Ocean. and what happens is the

292
00:27:19,134 --> 00:27:24,134
people doing the Southeast Delco out interview workers at the

293
00:27:24,134 --> 00:27:29,151
same ability. we're someone's been identified this last month this is

294
00:27:29,151 --> 00:27:34,531
me. they just sent the report recently. they

295
00:27:34,531 --> 00:27:39,551
looks like actually have is more than enough time. not just one person. this is only

296
00:27:39,551 --> 00:27:44,891
one person is been reported. so this is Paul that part. sort of in

297
00:27:44,891 --> 00:27:50,911
terms of hotel dishes. it's good thing you're doing.

298
00:27:50,911 --> 00:27:56,091
I got this is really interesting. but I'll get through it anyway. so there are some

299
00:27:56,091 --> 00:28:01,251
metal part that platinum is really good at it.

300
00:28:01,251 --> 00:28:06,671
otherwise you can see at the bottom. one thing that's interesting.

301
00:28:06,671 --> 00:28:14,211
in the next time when I get interesting about platinum.

302
00:28:14,211 --> 00:28:19,291
it's the only and I don't know if it's well it's still white but it's about the only the

303
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:24,431
thing now. we're help with your cigarette smoke cigarette smokers the

304
00:28:24,431 --> 00:28:32,171
last night since it's not recommended to you later. love you

305
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:38,391
hi Drive Terry mentioned needing the name. they they actually.

306
00:28:38,391 --> 00:28:43,511
this is actually ID mediated even though it's a small knowledgeable. so I guess I

307
00:28:43,511 --> 00:28:48,631
must have your number but this is concept. you should be aware of what happened is eight eight eight

308
00:28:48,631 --> 00:28:54,231
p.m. happened. mom all the skills that can attach.

309
00:28:54,231 --> 00:28:59,691
in this case. shuman proteins like help human which is the proteins

310
00:28:59,691 --> 00:29:04,891
and the highest concentration certainly in the blood. and once it's attached. that combination

311
00:29:04,891 --> 00:29:10,091
of it it has_to be human out_of human. this recognizes form and can triggered the cascade

312
00:29:10,091 --> 00:29:15,131
of in your logical reaction. we do have that part

313
00:29:15,131 --> 00:29:20,731
of the mechanism of how small knowledge you. in some cases can do so.

314
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:26,091
I did mention Western red seater. it's been a particularly bad would be exposed

315
00:29:26,091 --> 00:29:32,595
to because it has been

316
00:29:32,595 --> 00:29:37,835
activation work latency. the Bronco hyper responsiveness and you do. calling to tell us

317
00:29:37,835 --> 00:29:42,975
if we talked about. so this is Paul. Paul and think the one from baseline

318
00:29:42,975 --> 00:29:48,195
when you're exposed to. calling to pass the race. so this

319
00:29:48,195 --> 00:29:54,195
is just showing you what I told you. actually on the lawn. I guess it's

320
00:29:54,195 --> 00:29:59,295
time. yeah. so like a normal person. basically

321
00:29:59,295 --> 00:30:04,455
I don't respond about the calling. maybe in a very high concentration.

322
00:30:04,455 --> 00:30:09,495
we're the people that have as not respond to it quickly. this is

323
00:30:09,495 --> 00:30:14,775
at eighty one level. basically dropping one hundred percent whatever your mind was.

324
00:30:14,775 --> 00:30:20,195
just before you get the message call me. so so the first one have the most of your ad.

325
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:25,275
because at a very low does business with Dell. the concentration of what you're

326
00:30:25,275 --> 00:30:30,555
calling. very low Joe's prices are twenty percent draw you one

327
00:30:30,555 --> 00:30:35,715
which is one stop study. just time first after that. you don't have_to

328
00:30:35,715 --> 00:30:41,055
put them in really bad. you wanna have that happen. we

329
00:30:41,055 --> 00:30:48,175
a done in the field actually I'm calling

330
00:30:48,175 --> 00:30:53,175
you. you're hard to respond can say. if you got activation ass and you stay away for

331
00:30:53,175 --> 00:31:01,735
a long time it doesn't always come back and get worse again if you'd be exposed to agent.

332
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:06,895
there are. you can do specific innovation challenge test.

333
00:31:06,895 --> 00:31:12,015
but because they're concerned about hurting

334
00:31:12,015 --> 00:31:17,095
people that are positive and it's important to actually know and completely control. what

335
00:31:17,095 --> 00:31:22,475
is the exposure consultation you giving someone and you worry about exposure

336
00:31:22,475 --> 00:31:27,875
to agent. we can do that. staff that are working in

337
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:32,923
whatever the facility is very very few places even here at University Michigan we

338
00:31:32,923 --> 00:31:38,423
don't actually do a direct chance testing. they do it at.

339
00:31:38,423 --> 00:31:43,463
we do in Montreal. I think your university place. please don't do this I think you need

340
00:31:43,463 --> 00:31:48,543
to do it in Cincinnati. that's about it. you don't

341
00:31:48,543 --> 00:31:53,663
know about this fight. you should know one thing which is that. you can be

342
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:59,123
on a_lot_of different pattern. how someone who says type an agent and then get exposed

343
00:31:59,123 --> 00:32:04,163
to that agent at times zero. we can be a_lot_of different patterns of how they

344
00:32:04,163 --> 00:32:09,343
react when they get the deck and he wants. and the reason that's important

345
00:32:09,343 --> 00:32:15,163
to know if some people have a late reaction. so that means you can have a worker

346
00:32:15,163 --> 00:32:20,543
from workers can actually work in eight hours shift. not have a problem. go home

347
00:32:20,543 --> 00:32:25,923
and wake up out please. this is so short of breath I can't breathe and it's actually from work.

348
00:32:25,923 --> 00:32:31,463
just be aware that it doesn't have_to happen immediately or in fifteen minutes or even an hour.

349
00:32:31,463 --> 00:32:37,343
be work later

350
00:32:37,343 --> 00:32:42,603
hi Jason Larry. I'm not gonna try to go through this because it's gets

351
00:32:42,603 --> 00:32:47,663
a little bit complex. I wanna ask you questions about this. this is the

352
00:32:47,663 --> 00:32:52,783
basics license. I need the eight eight nine nine eight eighty eight eight

353
00:32:52,783 --> 00:32:58,583
send to type an agent. if there's some something's wrong with Emily.

354
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:04,583
she's not actually in the lodge at all. so you know the basics with you on it. you know in this tire.

355
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:09,745
I already said I like anyway Pensacola.

356
00:33:09,745 --> 00:33:16,505
I see anybody. here's whether that would happen.

357
00:33:16,505 --> 00:33:22,845
I heard mention this as well. this is Cascade.

358
00:33:22,845 --> 00:33:27,865
that's not the type of people. I'm trying to keep it for

359
00:33:27,865 --> 00:33:33,205
here. okay. so yeah this is good to know something back out the patience.

360
00:33:33,205 --> 00:33:38,725
the problem. the problem is someone who has asked that vacation

361
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:44,325
time. probably three exposure. is that you got all

362
00:33:44,325 --> 00:33:49,505
these mass cells really always inflammatory agent. once it triggered

363
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:54,865
and they're they're sort of sitting here waiting. right proteins

364
00:33:54,865 --> 00:34:00,445
for example present itself. hopes up with their service they recognize that.

365
00:34:00,445 --> 00:34:05,885
I really know you. go under line. calling to see what's happening

366
00:34:05,885 --> 00:34:12,098
with. basically all of that. not this not the patient. information.

367
00:34:12,098 --> 00:34:17,358
but this is information is being due by you around you.

368
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:22,999
you know it's good to have information on your fighting on some virus or bacteria that they said.

369
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:28,318
bye. this is not a good

370
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:33,799
idea. not important for loma Whitley.

371
00:34:33,799 --> 00:34:39,918
there's other things to do it. some of the other things you can see.

372
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,958
again I think I'm not gonna go in to of. I wanna ask you a question this level of detail

373
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:50,019
about the path of physiology. this is a more complete discussion on how things can

374
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:57,499
present with you. bye-bye. stop and play with different types

375
00:34:57,499 --> 00:35:03,039
and more the same. okay without latency.

376
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:08,338
so that without Steven. that's not senses nation. this

377
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:13,387
is Brad fisher and Tennessee. I just said

378
00:35:13,387 --> 00:35:18,767
he's striking fibrosis and sanitation. but there's clearly

379
00:35:18,767 --> 00:35:23,847
not a single in any logical action that's

380
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:28,867
up in this corner. yours and Angie's dancing on the diagram.

381
00:35:28,867 --> 00:35:33,947
okay. so at the genealogy to get the activation at your level

382
00:35:33,947 --> 00:35:39,547
of exposure is most important. if you have a topic yesterday. that means you have a history

383
00:35:39,547 --> 00:35:44,747
of childhood asthma or eczema. or you get you know irritated.

384
00:35:44,747 --> 00:35:51,267
again I can be hygiene even inside your elbow Jorge.

385
00:35:51,267 --> 00:35:57,847
so three that. so eight. talk to you. basically you're having your response.

386
00:35:57,847 --> 00:36:03,127
external agents and people that get that clearly

387
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:08,527
increase for having IDE mediated at work.

388
00:36:08,527 --> 00:36:14,091
this is agent that. never been exposed to before so it's reasonable.

389
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:19,171
if you're hiring someone to work in the laboratory with rodents and I

390
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:24,231
asked him been appointed to with clinician with get into all the legalities of

391
00:36:24,231 --> 00:36:29,510
what you can or can't ask people. so I but terms of protecting people's reason all that

392
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:34,731
people. have you had before. have you ever had as a child. you have paid

393
00:36:34,731 --> 00:36:39,750
either because the people that are answer yes or those are more likely to be sent something

394
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:44,911
my brother. if you're hiring someone to work in a body shop

395
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:50,031
where they're gonna have_to use dice signage tonight. polyurethane top

396
00:36:50,031 --> 00:36:55,951
coat. it's not reasonable to ask him that because it's not ID needed and there's

397
00:36:55,951 --> 00:37:01,031
no there's no relationship between whether or not you have an eight hope in a topic

398
00:37:01,031 --> 00:37:06,750
history. and whether you're gonna have a problem with the guy. bye. so it depends on what

399
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:13,068
is going on. I need what agent you're gonna be exposed to whether it's important

400
00:37:13,068 --> 00:37:20,868
Nike needed. they told me before. it's not not

401
00:37:20,868 --> 00:37:26,128
smoking. I actually pre- disposed people

402
00:37:26,128 --> 00:37:31,469
ration of exposure is not important. this is also important to know we saw

403
00:37:31,469 --> 00:37:37,868
making a diagnosis or being suspicious.

404
00:37:37,868 --> 00:37:42,868
you can have people that work at the same agent. no change in the

405
00:37:42,868 --> 00:37:48,028
work place for ten years. and have a ad without the pass story

406
00:37:48,028 --> 00:37:53,068
I just told you like some high version of exposure like the guy

407
00:37:53,068 --> 00:37:58,168
that had to to sign it over nothing say that even all I've been

408
00:37:58,168 --> 00:38:03,469
at this job we're in ten years for some reason we don't understand if I need triggers

409
00:38:03,469 --> 00:38:08,508
and they develop as an agent. so just be aware. you can't stay.

410
00:38:08,508 --> 00:38:14,548
they've been working there too long be from work. you can be from work. you know

411
00:38:14,548 --> 00:38:22,088
you know they've been exposed for years. and

412
00:38:22,088 --> 00:38:27,208
yeah we haven't really cared about exposure is more important for. about

413
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:32,248
the person. so what in

414
00:38:32,248 --> 00:38:37,828
Boulder there. it's important. I think I sort of said it before but there's actually nicely done. sorry.

415
00:38:37,828 --> 00:38:43,088
bye now. you know the one who actually does challenge. your child

416
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:48,328
is testing. the majority in the meeting date is just

417
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:53,748
eighty percent majority of patients with occupational asthma

418
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:59,128
with Lacy. that's the type the something. don't recover completely.

419
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:04,128
even if they've been removed from the exposure for years. never had go

420
00:39:04,128 --> 00:39:09,188
to work. you get exposed to something you could talk about the tires off that you have asthma. you

421
00:39:09,188 --> 00:39:14,383
leave work and you never get over here. you continue

422
00:39:14,383 --> 00:39:20,483
to have problems you know you know expose that agent any more and

423
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:25,503
have me on the next bye. so the first two

424
00:39:25,503 --> 00:39:30,623
bullets there are what are very fictitious who that's gonna happen. so if

425
00:39:30,623 --> 00:39:35,643
somebody when somebody first about that early on and before it becomes really

426
00:39:35,643 --> 00:39:40,783
severe. if you remove them from work permanently. they have a quite decent chance of

427
00:39:40,783 --> 00:39:46,160
recovering completely and no longer having at if you wait while they continue to have symptoms

428
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,281
like what happened to our case. much love. bye. wait to recover and

429
00:39:51,281 --> 00:39:58,400
much more likely to have a problem with that test with the rest of your life. that's why

430
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,620
the difference in sensitivity. why we occupational conditions are very sensitive

431
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:09,061
to. you have_to pay attention this message is done on that and consider

432
00:40:09,061 --> 00:40:14,561
agents in the work place or to be responsible. if it is work related

433
00:40:14,561 --> 00:40:19,700
and you fail to figure that out. just treat it like a garden variety I love

434
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:24,720
you giving you know rescue inhaler like albuterol having people and he'll be

435
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:30,521
right to settle the information that might finally improve the sentence

436
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:35,801
but which is likely to happen. is this the person will end up much worse. at

437
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:41,120
this time when they were removing the exposure. so that

438
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:46,476
that's important now

439
00:40:46,476 --> 00:40:51,855
okay. yes established today and that

440
00:40:51,855 --> 00:40:58,276
you guys know and headed from work and I know you expected it to compatible

441
00:40:58,276 --> 00:41:03,436
example we had but getting better on the weekend. that's typical with people first

442
00:41:03,436 --> 00:41:08,556
get occupational asthma. to send the title agent

443
00:41:08,556 --> 00:41:13,676
from the six times agents. as it progresses it gets worse. you maybe in the situation.

444
00:41:13,676 --> 00:41:18,996
they don't really tell the difference between a working weekend. so

445
00:41:18,996 --> 00:41:24,056
look for an occupational call. everyone I have memorized for tomorrow.

446
00:41:24,056 --> 00:41:40,355
twenty five questions about this diagram. yeah.

447
00:41:40,355 --> 00:41:45,449
okay. so. so here's what should have an ideal world I gonna

448
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:51,269
sorry I was asking. bye. what should happen is you are

449
00:41:51,269 --> 00:41:56,289
established. hopefully you get here early. so the person has some reverse ability to

450
00:41:56,289 --> 00:42:01,309
like I'll get better. they're away from work for two days. to be taken away for a week. so what you can

451
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:06,469
do. if you can get them without the flow meter which is basically you have_to do that

452
00:42:06,469 --> 00:42:11,569
same maneuver. you call me do your only. they

453
00:42:11,569 --> 00:42:16,649
don't have_to go in for six I can schedule a time to get well test as well as in the first second.

454
00:42:16,649 --> 00:42:21,669
so you basically what you do is you say every two hours. when you're away. you don't be

455
00:42:21,669 --> 00:42:26,709
waking up and doing whatever you are going your way from when you first get out. when you have a go please

456
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:31,909
watch the ball on this device. we will take three time. try today do

457
00:42:31,909 --> 00:42:37,389
as well as you can and then keep doing that even when you're at work. weekend versus work today

458
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:42,449
because I saw your sign. you looking for a patter to establish that.

459
00:42:42,449 --> 00:42:47,476
yeah just give their their lung function deteriorate. when I

460
00:42:47,476 --> 00:42:52,496
go to work and Bruce gonna stay away from work. so that that

461
00:42:52,496 --> 00:42:58,036
helps you make a diagnosis and the advance is that. you got need

462
00:42:58,036 --> 00:43:03,276
other than telling you you can't blow that. you don't need to direct cooperation

463
00:43:03,276 --> 00:43:24,496
of employer to do that. alright.

464
00:43:24,496 --> 00:43:29,656
so in principle. this is because you know you got it yet

465
00:43:29,656 --> 00:43:35,056
this position is diagnosing an occupational disease. that diagnosis is May fifth but was supposed

466
00:43:35,056 --> 00:43:40,296
to have is that you. if you say you have_to be at work. you can't work here.

467
00:43:40,296 --> 00:43:45,298
I need you to offer of all realize that sometimes it's a big operation model building you

468
00:43:45,298 --> 00:43:50,758
maybe sent to type an agent I this movie to another building everything's fine. bye. but it's small

469
00:43:50,758 --> 00:43:56,317
mama pops off there is no possibility that I was supposed to happen. what should happen

470
00:43:56,317 --> 00:44:01,357
is that you are eligible for Worker's_Compensation. which there's fifty varieties in

471
00:44:01,357 --> 00:44:06,478
Michigan. I think you can get something like where they keep changing it. but I think it's

472
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:12,058
like maybe three quarters of your regular salary. and

473
00:44:12,058 --> 00:44:18,038
you're supposed to have your medical processing is covered by workers comp and you're supposed

474
00:44:18,038 --> 00:44:23,478
to be able to get re training to do with different kind of job. when you done before

475
00:44:23,478 --> 00:44:29,518
covered other workers. so that's what supposed happens when someone

476
00:44:29,518 --> 00:44:35,157
goes to work and

477
00:44:35,157 --> 00:44:40,758
they usually have

478
00:44:40,758 --> 00:44:47,857
like all over the place very

479
00:44:47,857 --> 00:44:53,177
important and will be held this month. so bye.

480
00:44:53,177 --> 00:45:11,317
yeah.

481
00:45:11,317 --> 00:45:18,017
well it might be bitch another critical question here is.

482
00:45:18,017 --> 00:45:23,557
if you have a medical physician saying. you need to leave work.

483
00:45:23,557 --> 00:45:31,737
okay. and then that triggers all kinds issues and there how Miles is not about it.

484
00:45:31,737 --> 00:45:36,938
if you have a position I need in real life. you know what I would do is I said done

485
00:45:36,938 --> 00:45:42,288
then laid out everything I just been telling me. I will be saying that

486
00:45:42,288 --> 00:45:47,347
today individuals unlike like the treating physician. I've been asked for another position. tell me what is it this is

487
00:45:47,347 --> 00:45:52,367
work related. if I think it is. I say you know there's a problem with you

488
00:45:52,367 --> 00:45:57,587
continuing to work. it's gonna get worse. you may recover. if you leave now.

489
00:45:57,587 --> 00:46:02,768
probably never recover if you're gonna be exposed. bye. you should

490
00:46:02,768 --> 00:46:08,147
get compensated but I can't guarantee you that you will. and even if you are. I can't guarantee

491
00:46:08,147 --> 00:46:13,208
it's gonna happen quickly. because if it turns in a court case. I can drag on. I'll talk to talk

492
00:46:13,208 --> 00:46:20,724
that. that's the real life balance of a estimate

493
00:46:20,724 --> 00:46:25,823
you can have it on TV our dial sign eight. it was

494
00:46:25,823 --> 00:46:32,124
a small company. I think about fifty people. I thought the vice_president of the company.

495
00:46:32,124 --> 00:46:38,184
you know like masters in engineering. he he could

496
00:46:38,184 --> 00:46:43,224
he he we got a quarter six today. especially when they were like lease and stuff.

497
00:46:43,224 --> 00:46:48,384
so you got time. and

498
00:46:48,384 --> 00:46:53,563
even his office. if you stayed away from the floor. you know

499
00:46:53,563 --> 00:46:59,083
his office at seven Ash and separate ventilation system. but with the same

500
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:04,364
part of same building. if you went off without going anywhere near where

501
00:47:04,364 --> 00:47:09,983
the work was going on. he would have

502
00:47:09,983 --> 00:47:15,444
been to work and to see if you get away from us. bye. so he was probably

503
00:47:15,444 --> 00:47:22,064
reacting to part for your trip seven five one seven. that was you. much love.

504
00:47:22,064 --> 00:47:31,604
see you soon. big problem. alright.

505
00:47:31,604 --> 00:47:37,524
so these are the things you left for Dorothy that you'd want to

506
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:42,665
cancel is only working for the weekend. I wanted you about after the work shift can be from

507
00:47:42,665 --> 00:47:48,044
work. I got we get worse over the worst week.

508
00:47:48,044 --> 00:47:54,744
Bruce if you change the work environment alright. I'll have_to go with the diagnosis yet.

509
00:47:54,744 --> 00:48:00,544
they should occur within forty eight hours work place but watch out for very late reactions.

510
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:07,165
so on. you would take a complete history.

511
00:48:07,165 --> 00:48:12,405
make sure that I needed. this is just five dollars and activation

512
00:48:12,405 --> 00:48:17,807
on of any sort that sort of thing you're buying industry.

513
00:48:17,807 --> 00:48:23,087
people get something. I've been here by the street and just

514
00:48:23,087 --> 00:48:28,487
this is important now. the list of things that are known because our special ad ever expanding.

515
00:48:28,487 --> 00:48:33,627
I think it's well over a thousand agents. this point. so the fact that has been reported before does

516
00:48:33,627 --> 00:48:40,007
improve it's not from work. so it really should be looked at. the

517
00:48:40,007 --> 00:48:45,327
reason kinda thing is you go to. usually we do permanent function testing. you

518
00:48:45,327 --> 00:48:50,407
usually would do in testing any logic blood test to see if someone says the type of

519
00:48:50,407 --> 00:48:55,627
specific agent you might be interested in the right way to do it. have someone like an industrial

520
00:48:55,627 --> 00:49:00,627
hygienist is not here he's looking for to go look at the work place and hopefully be able to

521
00:49:00,627 --> 00:49:05,807
get see this individual. sorry. I think it might be a big

522
00:49:05,807 --> 00:49:10,927
bonus to inquire if somebody things are going. I think this is the problem. he just

523
00:49:10,927 --> 00:49:16,191
changed this and that's about it. I don't think you're gonna have more workers my

524
00:49:16,191 --> 00:49:22,951
phone now.

525
00:49:22,951 --> 00:49:28,391
alright. good skin test. testing actually works pretty well. this is basically

526
00:49:28,391 --> 00:49:33,731
you've gotten Standard Solutions. very agent. and you just take a little

527
00:49:33,731 --> 00:49:39,091
bit of it put it on the first. usually they're either back or the inside of their four

528
00:49:39,091 --> 00:49:44,151
and he's great they put enough they can penetrate the first deadline here. yeah but not

529
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:49,651
non- of the re slot and then if they're if they're set up a time that agent.

530
00:49:49,651 --> 00:49:54,971
they were asked by you. bye. usually with a matter matter of minutes. they have read it real

531
00:49:54,971 --> 00:50:00,131
with. my raise. alright because when we when you get in.

532
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:05,271
you don't buy it because your sense of high proteins and the mosquitoes alive.

533
00:50:05,271 --> 00:50:10,531
which of course you know didn't check that first. so that your Volvo. actually got any

534
00:50:10,531 --> 00:50:15,571
clients in there. so that is actually Nike reaction

535
00:50:15,571 --> 00:50:23,688
just every almost everybody

536
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:28,828
you can also do a blood test for test actually

537
00:50:28,828 --> 00:50:33,828
Saturday to get you in for a test maybe you can be more protective blood test in this

538
00:50:33,828 --> 00:50:41,009
particular case. thank

539
00:50:41,009 --> 00:50:46,028
this is Saint Bernard Roscoe hyper as possible that that's the method calling challenge that you have an abnormal

540
00:50:46,028 --> 00:50:51,688
result. this is. if you can wait for two weeks.

541
00:50:51,688 --> 00:50:58,128
usually and you don't have any prompt response to

542
00:50:58,128 --> 00:51:03,128
that. basically ten. I'm sorry you've

543
00:51:03,128 --> 00:51:08,648
work for two weeks. I did the usual conditions and you don't have a bronco I heard about

544
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:13,888
that. pretty much ruled out. that you like to visualize.

545
00:51:13,888 --> 00:51:18,928
there are exceptions and clean direct side. unfortunately but it usually wrote it out in most

546
00:51:18,928 --> 00:51:25,200
cases the problem here.

547
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:30,720
you seen people workers are sick and then playing.

548
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:35,960
they need loser bronco harbors. an employer may not agree to them coming back. see

549
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:41,081
you bye. this is a test. so I

550
00:51:41,081 --> 00:51:46,240
mention that. alright. well monitoring diagram of what I was

551
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:51,321
talking about that you asked about. so this is what they've done here today.

552
00:51:51,321 --> 00:51:58,301
this is a different day and they're basically in different.

553
00:51:58,301 --> 00:52:03,920
what this guy Ramey this is bit higher. say happy birthday.

554
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:09,680
the best peak flow was on and we're needing between the two

555
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:14,680
and so this is the person you been off work for quite a_while. we suspected

556
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:19,932
of having occupational asthma and you go back to work. we started

557
00:52:19,932 --> 00:52:25,552
there at work. okay to go back to work. five day work period. and you noticed they have an immediate

558
00:52:25,552 --> 00:52:31,472
decline and when they go out_of work. just over weekend. Andrew

559
00:52:31,472 --> 00:52:36,712
and I go back to work. I have a declined out_of work. that we're declined.

560
00:52:36,712 --> 00:52:41,772
so that will be a five out_of five but three times about the work. there people

561
00:52:41,772 --> 00:52:47,873
suddenly went down the two tires and they went back home. so that's. bye.

562
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:52,932
so almost be on the smoking gun thing. this is work related if this is happening

563
00:52:52,932 --> 00:53:00,747
like that. alright. I'm not go to

564
00:53:00,747 --> 00:53:08,527
nothing is wrong. I wanna do

565
00:53:08,527 --> 00:53:13,967
this is basically I've been doing repeated people managers is probably

566
00:53:13,967 --> 00:53:22,167
about something to but. if you could get. you know especially compared.

567
00:53:22,167 --> 00:53:27,207
alright. yeah bye. you wanna return versus the work. you can have problems

568
00:53:27,207 --> 00:53:32,287
getting that to make your time. just buy one. okay. verify

569
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:37,347
everything else in the world you preferred substitution or closure local

570
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:42,427
consultation referred over personal protective equipment.

571
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:48,227
for clothing for part of every individual. everything on moment there

572
00:53:48,227 --> 00:53:54,267
two two five. you have_to be the right person. the right respirator.

573
00:53:54,267 --> 00:53:59,273
what it is carbon filter

574
00:53:59,273 --> 00:54:04,313
changed out. just too high. person like me

575
00:54:04,313 --> 00:54:14,413
with the beard. we we're are you. bye. yeah.

576
00:54:14,413 --> 00:54:19,953
yeah I talked to tuition. so this is in so much about

577
00:54:19,953 --> 00:54:25,553
that the other problem people have talked that example is where people are using.

578
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:31,013
again it's call maybe have Central nervous system affect to decrease things to keep

579
00:54:31,013 --> 00:54:36,854
everything be cleaned. be super clean just before the and

580
00:54:36,854 --> 00:54:42,073
there's and I'll. sometimes you can go to church and water

581
00:54:42,073 --> 00:54:48,053
and get things out and then you get all the problems all stuff again.

582
00:54:48,053 --> 00:54:55,981
if you could do that. so I'll be in sample of the substitution

583
00:54:55,981 --> 00:55:01,401
this is just Charlene. you know my way do several things. course you don't

584
00:55:01,401 --> 00:55:06,521
that person is developing radio graphs. if they're doing

585
00:55:06,521 --> 00:55:11,661
it all the way. I just looking at digital output. different

586
00:55:11,661 --> 00:55:16,741
things that can be exposed to a sense of type two and this is showing set up worry

587
00:55:16,741 --> 00:55:23,221
everything is basically seal. not like we can reached individual

588
00:55:23,221 --> 00:55:28,421
meeting. this is not a pharmaceutical process worker who's working with something it's such a house

589
00:55:28,421 --> 00:55:34,102
in Sunset Kaiser. they decided. this is like you know it's

590
00:55:34,102 --> 00:55:39,181
here. bye. it's raining and fresh air. so on. so the very

591
00:55:39,181 --> 00:55:47,461
high tech person for the Cornerstone team and we knows removal.

592
00:55:47,461 --> 00:55:52,692
no one's really really recorded great didn't work

593
00:55:52,692 --> 00:55:58,292
very well. you therapy for this is like what people do for being allergic to be staying with

594
00:55:58,292 --> 00:56:03,552
a series of injections treatment. bye. it's not. people are really recommending.

595
00:56:03,552 --> 00:56:09,412
trying to do that for application case is

596
00:56:09,412 --> 00:56:14,672
probably in health care right. which is standard

597
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:20,192
the treatment of that. but you usually go to first to be very effective

598
00:56:20,192 --> 00:56:26,072
conservative occupational siding. you may have down

599
00:56:26,072 --> 00:56:31,132
your system. but we don't really know all on the line profit. it

600
00:56:31,132 --> 00:56:36,472
cost me to have worse and worse test a big disadvantage

601
00:56:36,472 --> 00:56:41,472
of it and make you back. if your symptoms are you. they have about half

602
00:56:41,472 --> 00:56:47,031
an hour. bye. sometimes your ass is getting worse and I need to press

603
00:56:47,031 --> 00:56:52,038
zero. okay. okay sorry minimal

604
00:56:52,038 --> 00:56:57,458
training this happened that happened and

605
00:56:57,458 --> 00:57:03,137
the problem is solved. calling about. that's it. she left work. she's no longer being exposed.

606
00:57:03,137 --> 00:57:08,258
she is now as you know it may turn out to year for life. she was exposed to it

607
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:13,357
for so long after she came symptomatic. if we talked about. but how she

608
00:57:13,357 --> 00:57:20,018
did and well

609
00:57:20,018 --> 00:57:25,357
positioned and bother you know not whatever it was. didn't ask enough questions

610
00:57:25,357 --> 00:57:30,677
about voting. you know your position should have a physician

611
00:57:30,677 --> 00:57:36,698
should you know this one. they should know that. some people get some type of road and

612
00:57:36,698 --> 00:57:41,758
I've never had asthma. I'm having always problems where you were. we're gonna have

613
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:46,817
a tour you can might have. take care tonight. that should make

614
00:57:46,817 --> 00:57:54,293
your average position have a little like office. this could be what's causing

615
00:57:54,293 --> 00:58:00,174
call. bye. didn't do all the things we talked about the in the place and what that

616
00:58:00,174 --> 00:58:05,193
is being handled right she wouldn't giving people meter to see whether

617
00:58:05,193 --> 00:58:10,273
what what was happening with her. if if you want payment issue that

618
00:58:10,273 --> 00:58:16,073
working out at work. I appreciate it in more investigation.

619
00:58:16,073 --> 00:58:21,313
this is recently written in my body in my occupational position

620
00:58:21,313 --> 00:58:26,594
for employment verification position. position. be at the patient mission. maybe

621
00:58:26,594 --> 00:58:32,114
maybe not. hey was really try to Matt has overall problem.

622
00:58:32,114 --> 00:58:37,293
so for example they

623
00:58:37,293 --> 00:58:42,374
didn't deal with her social well being they didn't offer compensation returning e-mails and

624
00:58:42,374 --> 00:58:47,833
knows what happened to her. but also

625
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:53,333
this is if I had thought about going back and interviewing people find more people something.

626
00:58:53,333 --> 00:58:58,582
the fact that sheet is out as well from work means there maybe problems with this whole set

627
00:58:58,582 --> 00:59:03,602
up that's causing much higher than their exposure is. okay she's gone now. bring in

628
00:59:03,602 --> 00:59:10,261
the next person is gonna get that time. not how you want us line problem. alright.

629
00:59:10,261 --> 00:59:15,461
I so all the usual things educate people

630
00:59:15,461 --> 00:59:21,021
said you're getting close. the only person to take. you have_to talk to you soon.

631
00:59:21,021 --> 00:59:27,241
if you can do it again tonight. bye. she didn't get Worker's_Comp.

632
00:59:27,241 --> 00:59:32,641
even though she lost her job and so on. alright. so I think I'm gonna

633
00:59:32,641 --> 00:59:37,839
stop there and turn it over to you. to demonstrate to make

634
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:42,859
sure you know that I processed new not as yet. to see if Sean

635
00:59:42,859 --> 01:00:32,319
was work.

636
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:37,443
just mention that we'll be doing this periodically

637
01:00:37,443 --> 01:00:42,843
and they will be graded. the fact that you do account that due great.

638
01:00:42,843 --> 01:00:49,423
so it's really for your benefit.

639
01:00:49,423 --> 01:00:54,483
generally will cover two lectures so we'll get one out this afternoon that will close

640

647
01:01:32,003 --> 01:01:37,919

survey. alright this is the format

689
01:06:54,341 --> 01:06:59,421

please call. bye and.

693
01:07:17,198 --> 01:07:22,858
so basically you Chris is intended to

694
01:07:22,858 --> 01:07:28,338
maybe highlight basic principles. find out some more important

695
01:07:28,338 --> 01:07:34,858
information to remember know I would say probably

696
01:07:34,858 --> 01:07:40,358
maybe one question and six or seven. my name is Amber. later.

697
01:07:40,358 --> 01:07:46,158
possibly. so give you a little bit of a bone. I haven't paid attention that way. bye.

698
01:07:46,158 --> 01:07:51,398
most of the bottom of that.

699
01:07:51,398 --> 01:07:56,498
alright. I don't know how Harvey this is but let's do this. six or seven minutes.

700
01:07:56,498 --> 01:08:01,498
see if we can. so we assist

701
01:08:01,498 --> 01:08:06,677
special out which is type like this message you

702
01:08:06,677 --> 01:08:12,514
know. I don't know. I heard in your logically. bye Determine

703
01:08:12,514 --> 01:08:17,634
you become such a style. I will talk about different.

704
01:08:17,634 --> 01:08:22,774
not common the general public by any means but still a big issue. I called

705
01:08:22,774 --> 01:08:28,714
hyper sensitive meeting tonight.

706
01:08:28,714 --> 01:08:36,054
well. okay. we're start start.

707
01:08:36,054 --> 01:08:41,474
so now we're gonna talk about agent that

708
01:08:41,474 --> 01:08:46,774
is in the logic we mediated the part of the respiratory type in target

709
01:08:46,774 --> 01:08:53,594
is D one tissue exchange region. as opposed to the airway.

710
01:08:53,594 --> 01:09:01,194
all information the Hallmark of Albany.

711
01:09:01,194 --> 01:09:06,234
so little bit of a comparison between occupational at Patterson Cindy Newman I

712
01:09:06,234 --> 01:09:11,660
did an agent. what you're being such a time to

713
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:17,000
in general. can be similar. most space last

714
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:22,920
night. his idea immediately. not all of it. we will have a sense to renew and I did

715
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:29,380
not mediate a type of person. you can look for different e-mail.

716
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:35,500
which is more more to do it. I've got a meeting. there's been exposure

717
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:40,700
to the body. not really connecting. you don't get it. when you text

718
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:45,900
this direct response. that mean not just something going on with the direct organ

719
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:51,100
system or the main problem is but other types of problems associated with it.

720
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:56,640
so usually Friday's after you don't have a systemic response but you do very often perhaps

721
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:01,900
giving him a nice quite typical people to get fever chills.

722
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:08,720
even my house is my house is torn out. so like you were developing.

723
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:14,176
okay. pretty similar

724
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:19,676
other than maybe hyper aeration. so much air traffic but you don't really see the exit

725
01:10:19,676 --> 01:10:24,756
rate changes. dot diagnostic where you frequently do with. call

726
01:10:24,756 --> 01:10:29,855
HP with HP. and we'll talk about the rent

727
01:10:29,855 --> 01:10:35,196
tomorrow and I made mention our order and we kinda have more information here.

728
01:10:35,196 --> 01:10:40,196
talking you. I'll be calling

729
01:10:40,196 --> 01:10:45,815
you case for example. and I just need a record this is Mimi. just calling

730
01:10:45,815 --> 01:10:51,256
me. not immediately but maybe few hours later.

731
01:10:51,256 --> 01:10:56,636
you become very short of breath and with the therapy

732
01:10:56,636 --> 01:11:01,976
avoid in signing agent for both of. you can use quarter steroids for about another year. we can use it

733
01:11:01,976 --> 01:11:08,016
and help clinical request you arrive for HP because it would have a trade.

734
01:11:08,016 --> 01:11:15,250
bottom director is only for alright. so

735
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:20,310
yeah. right in extreme allergic bronchial. I love you. bye. this

736
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:26,349
is Wesley calling you today. again parent particles of a very sick

737
01:11:26,349 --> 01:11:31,609
patient that she wanted particles wanted you to make with drop those or solid

738
01:11:31,609 --> 01:11:36,849
papers of course meet on the left you later right. not one about the size of the.

739
01:11:36,849 --> 01:11:41,849
the smaller three for right choice track. so I like what we discussed with. call me here or you

740
01:11:41,849 --> 01:11:47,250
have any logic responses to issues. so basically less than five microns

741
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:54,609
and anything anything that anybody.

742
01:11:54,609 --> 01:12:00,889
bye. dash disease process. so need to talk with community.

743
01:12:00,889 --> 01:12:06,129
so if I get an agent. you can call the regional things just got this far

744
01:12:06,129 --> 01:12:12,488
as long. so let me. so here's here's the typical start

745
01:12:12,488 --> 01:12:18,028
you're on a farm on with Mark on. hey Ross this is Gail.

746
01:12:18,028 --> 01:12:23,488
sitting in some corner of the bar for the entire winter and spring.

747
01:12:23,488 --> 01:12:28,608
and you need to move it or do something with this tickets for. start popping around.

748
01:12:28,608 --> 01:12:34,208
so that records release is always particles in the air of anything in it

749
01:12:34,208 --> 01:12:39,228
and if it's been down and warming up. you often get

750
01:12:39,228 --> 01:12:45,248
growth. these types of bacteria like them

751
01:12:45,248 --> 01:12:50,268
acting on my CD. which Candice be access to

752
01:12:50,268 --> 01:12:55,554
read every night. so you don't notice anything you've read all this in several hours later.

753
01:12:55,554 --> 01:13:00,734
four six eight hours later. you start feeling very short of breath. maybe

754
01:13:00,734 --> 01:13:07,374
you're coughing a_lot but mostly short of breath. having real problems with that. with your breathing.

755
01:13:07,374 --> 01:13:16,414
in any logic reaction to what you got exposed to when you're teaching.

756
01:13:16,414 --> 01:13:21,694
so can also be animal products at this location. these were

757
01:13:21,694 --> 01:13:26,794
people develop HP to the pro teen and the pigeon droppings. so you

758
01:13:26,794 --> 01:13:31,874
can have a driver. we'll talk about it and I have HP but she could potentially develop

759
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:38,454
that as well and some of the same agents. small molecular agents because

760
01:13:38,454 --> 01:13:43,714
I finished last. also because HP. I just signed

761
01:13:43,714 --> 01:13:48,914
very high guys. so how long gone.

762
01:13:48,914 --> 01:13:54,175
I will look at a little more than later. my last four story

763
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:59,555
Verizon Michigan. we the automotive industry. this is huge problem

764
01:13:59,555 --> 01:14:05,995
with HP. great facility. the machine

765
01:14:05,995 --> 01:14:11,815
part and it's very just about to deal. so apparently

766
01:14:11,815 --> 01:14:17,275
this is actually over grown in the machine by the way.

767
01:14:17,275 --> 01:14:24,055
you don't throw away the machine. it's very expensive like you got a big machine

768
01:14:24,055 --> 01:14:29,255
drains and re process. by the same stuff over and over

769
01:14:29,255 --> 01:14:34,295
again. they're always worried about biological growth and. if you

770
01:14:34,295 --> 01:14:39,315
get very lucky. it has_to do with the buyer. she's very lucky. you

771
01:14:39,315 --> 01:14:44,595
get Michael bacteria growing in it like a bacteria and eight a.m. if not

772
01:14:44,595 --> 01:14:49,775
that's not like you my back as a causes tuberculosis is a different species. here

773
01:14:49,775 --> 01:14:55,095
the problem was not in evening in fact a human being that you're gonna inhale it. and have this message

774
01:14:55,095 --> 01:15:00,299
patient reaction. so there has been an outbreak. where would

775
01:15:00,299 --> 01:15:05,359
you know on a particular machine I'm really high tax rates you like maybe eighty percent

776
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:10,379
of the all. I just been sitting in the night. and if it's

777
01:15:10,379 --> 01:15:16,759
really a problem for everyone concerned because it's extremely difficult.

778
01:15:16,759 --> 01:15:21,999
once you got in organ is like that established to get rid of it completely because you got all these.

779
01:15:21,999 --> 01:15:27,039
I got this huge processing of the machines with all the things that go through. call

780
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:32,279
me back at eight o'clock sharp thing. you know bacteria for bio

781
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:37,479
film. so on and so sometime. Phyllis have repeated over

782
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:43,399
and over again. even though they tried to treat it. quite topical for this part

783
01:15:43,399 --> 01:16:12,046
to talk about HP. okay. thanks
