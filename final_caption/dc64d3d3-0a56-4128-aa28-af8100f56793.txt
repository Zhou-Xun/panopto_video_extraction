1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:16,200
Thursday after the announcement that they will no longer be trying to get their car to hire their car and everything.

2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:25,139
Right. You just got to give up what you. That's not what this means.

3
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:36,210
That was funny when she found out that it was like w similar.

4
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:45,600
We don't know how you feel about that.

5
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,970
Yeah, I, I mean, this.

6
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,760
It's a way to chill out now.

7
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:18,250
Yeah, like, I'd like you like do.

8
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,470
Yeah, sure.

9
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,100
Yeah. Okay.

10
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,710
It's just three interviews, and I don't know her.

11
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:46,250
I know you didn't like your class.

12
00:01:47,400 --> 00:02:01,530
I was not aware that I said it with the education mostly just like that.

13
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,640
Oh, no. That was your mom's.

14
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:24,450
I think, you know, I have no idea what you're talking about.

15
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:32,660
It's really hard to out here.

16
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,050
It's okay.

17
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:57,280
It's okay. I was like, what? I want this to happen with my grandpa.

18
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:29,670
And I think, oh, she said that there was like, you know, like herself.

19
00:03:29,670 --> 00:04:11,700
And this the time I saw that all the things that I did yesterday that people should look forward to considering within the next few months.

20
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,438
And I was like, it's probably like, you guys are like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

21
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:21,194
Of course it's okay.

22
00:04:21,204 --> 00:04:33,804
We are recording this now. Okay, everybody. Okay, so if you come here, you are great to sit in this class.

23
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:38,184
You are agreed to take this class. You must agree this two dates.

24
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:44,454
Okay, so first the date. First time is for our midterm exam.

25
00:04:45,414 --> 00:04:50,064
Okay. And then the second date is for our final exam.

26
00:04:50,484 --> 00:05:04,794
Okay. So just my personal advice. If you want to take the booster only Karen or whatever, try to avoid that.

27
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:09,684
Okay. I mean, you've a long day or two days or otherwise, you will have some reaction.

28
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:16,734
So I, I suggest to you, you take it off that monitor to always follow your doctor's advice.

29
00:05:17,214 --> 00:05:21,254
But I tell you my reaction if I want.

30
00:05:21,294 --> 00:05:26,284
Also, I always got the request because this is large task.

31
00:05:26,364 --> 00:05:31,224
You know, students need to attend a friend's weddings.

32
00:05:31,674 --> 00:05:42,743
Okay. Tell your friend about the two dates and ask them to reschedule, because we know that you are already legally binding advisors to date.

33
00:05:42,744 --> 00:05:47,664
Right. Okay. So I know that two days are very important.

34
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:53,064
Just make sure you follow those two dates so.

35
00:05:53,694 --> 00:06:02,864
Well. Welcome to my far class and I just want to go over this.

36
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:08,514
Yeah. So this actually is our campus website.

37
00:06:08,814 --> 00:06:15,434
I think this is a this is a website contains every information about this course.

38
00:06:15,924 --> 00:06:24,024
Okay. So if you do not have any access to this website, you should let me or our to know as soon as possible.

39
00:06:24,054 --> 00:06:30,234
Otherwise actually it's impossible to survive without being able to access to this campus.

40
00:06:32,904 --> 00:06:43,944
Okay. So every day, not every day, every Tuesday and Thursday, we meet here from 10 to 1130.

41
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:50,184
Okay. And then we probably will not take a break.

42
00:06:50,484 --> 00:06:58,164
Okay. In the middle. Okay. So if you and you that use a bathroom or you depend on bio break for whatever, just go ahead.

43
00:06:58,164 --> 00:07:03,474
All right. And then most likely, we are going to just end at 1120.

44
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:08,184
Okay. So this way you will be able to go to your home, your next appointment.

45
00:07:08,424 --> 00:07:19,224
And so I am your cylinder to just do some administrative, the usual matter if I want to go over with you.

46
00:07:19,224 --> 00:07:23,754
So I'm Dr. Lee and I'm a fellow member with the department.

47
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:28,434
So I have been teaching this course for some four of seven times.

48
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:38,844
And again, I feel like this is a very interesting class and the people feel actually this is a very useful for their it to have someone available.

49
00:07:40,674 --> 00:07:44,274
And so people feel actually this is a very useful class.

50
00:07:44,274 --> 00:07:49,194
I hope you will feel the same way. Okay.

51
00:07:49,284 --> 00:07:53,364
And then on our website, we have our syllabus.

52
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:59,304
You know, again, you should read this set of us, you know, very sorry.

53
00:07:59,304 --> 00:08:04,313
And I hope that, you know, I require you to follow the syllabus.

54
00:08:04,314 --> 00:08:09,864
Exactly. Okay. So this is our basic this is this is our contract.

55
00:08:11,664 --> 00:08:23,694
Okay. So we will have two excellent s who will help us in this in this class.

56
00:08:23,694 --> 00:08:29,274
So Lee Young Grant, can you just stand up so just to let people know who you are.

57
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:35,274
So this is our first to know you and you also stand up.

58
00:08:35,394 --> 00:08:41,894
So this is our another to so you're not going way we are.

59
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:54,474
We're going to have office hours. Okay. I'm going to have my office, our ying every every Tuesday from 12 to 1 p.m. in my office,

60
00:08:55,224 --> 00:09:00,614
my office actually using speech to just across a bridge of 21,

61
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:09,724
go to the second floor of the office and then she you are going to have your office hour Wednesday, right?

62
00:09:09,804 --> 00:09:13,403
12 to 1 p.m. to the window.

63
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:16,564
The location of. Ideas and is.

64
00:09:18,144 --> 00:09:22,584
We've learned that it's in your lap. Where's my lap?

65
00:09:25,254 --> 00:09:38,874
I don't know. I never remember the room down here. Just give me one year, just like I never do my, you know, my phone number.

66
00:09:39,084 --> 00:09:43,734
Right. So it's kind of funny for you.

67
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:50,204
Well, you will be 42, 14 and 14, right?

68
00:09:50,784 --> 00:10:07,074
Yeah. So this is our teacher office hours every Wednesday from 12:01 p.m. on you and

69
00:10:07,134 --> 00:10:17,844
2214 escapes to the second floor of the S two and also the will have his lap.

70
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:24,624
We'll have his office hour every Thursday from 12 to 1.

71
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,064
Can also live in the same location.

72
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:31,374
Okay. And 22 for his speech, too.

73
00:10:31,374 --> 00:10:38,214
So maybe we are we need to update the set of us. So you okay.

74
00:10:38,214 --> 00:10:42,174
So okay. Good. And not are sent here.

75
00:10:42,204 --> 00:10:46,794
Okay. So people have any questions for this, right?

76
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:55,014
Okay. I think the most important thing here is for people who are a little bit late, you remember those two are two times, right?

77
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:59,364
The first time you are returning them date the second.

78
00:10:59,374 --> 00:11:02,984
The date is our final exam date.

79
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:07,584
Okay, so we must do the follow those two dates.

80
00:11:10,164 --> 00:11:13,644
Okay. And then we also talk about our office hours.

81
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:21,983
Okay. So basically actually Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, we are going to have office hours, you know, from from 12 noon to one.

82
00:11:21,984 --> 00:11:26,604
Kim So the first office hour is going to be held,

83
00:11:26,664 --> 00:11:39,414
is going to be held by me in my office space to 2102 and then our T.A. will have their office hours, you know, Wednesday and Thursday, right?

84
00:11:40,924 --> 00:11:52,774
Okay. So now I will briefly talk about I know actually we have a full room here and then I have a brief talk about to introduce this class.

85
00:11:52,774 --> 00:12:02,614
And in the end, I hope some of you will find, okay, you probably already know the materials and today you don't have to repeat this class.

86
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:13,474
Okay? And then we have our office, we have our textbooks, we don't have the required textbooks.

87
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:27,274
But the first book I like the book you'll not get because we are going for the homework most a lot of homework

88
00:12:27,874 --> 00:12:38,644
problems from this textbook and fortunately this this is not going to cost you a dime because if you have your,

89
00:12:38,644 --> 00:12:46,743
um, I.D., uh, you can just click this link and then you can access this book for free.

90
00:12:46,744 --> 00:12:57,844
Okay? So you can download the book. So I think this is going to be, you know, as long as you don't post it on YouTube as you will find.

91
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:09,784
So if you use this book, okay, so, so this book, I strongly suggest to you you adjust some of this thing as soon as possible.

92
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:15,364
The second thing here is the second one. Here is just some intro for some F for reading.

93
00:13:15,364 --> 00:13:28,984
Right? So this is just the you know, you can read this book to gain some even deeper understanding of the materials covered in class.

94
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:38,794
Okay. So the third book is, is the Paul Addison book talking about the saliva analysis using SAS.

95
00:13:38,824 --> 00:13:52,174
Okay. So most of our year in this class, we are going to go over working on use some command but mostly mostly the command will be are okay.

96
00:13:52,184 --> 00:13:58,264
But for people who would like to use SAS, this is a very excellent book people have.

97
00:13:59,884 --> 00:14:04,863
Okay, so and then this book, The Handbook of the Survival Analysis.

98
00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:12,933
So for example, in the future you want to devote your research to survival analysis.

99
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:17,583
You want to do more, right? You want to you'll write your thesis is survival analysis.

100
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:25,354
Or you, if you want to more research, use survival analysis. This action tells you all kinds of survival analysis topics.

101
00:14:25,774 --> 00:14:35,944
So I think this is going to be good. The this book I just enter this is a book that I have been reading I find actually quite useful.

102
00:14:36,364 --> 00:14:44,134
It actually talks about the some some models that you you have been using as a file status do that.

103
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:48,134
Right. So now attitudinal data analysis, right.

104
00:14:48,184 --> 00:14:53,494
So some longitudinal data models and then of the survival models and as any talk about

105
00:14:53,564 --> 00:14:57,834
how to model them on utility of data and the survival of data segment tenuously.

106
00:14:57,874 --> 00:15:07,634
So I think this is also a very good book or maybe for your bedtime reading this book.

107
00:15:08,044 --> 00:15:20,673
So, but anyway, so as I think people are clear, right, so most likely I want you to download this book and design for the other books.

108
00:15:20,674 --> 00:15:28,804
I also highly suggest you you download all of them here actually can be downloaded for free from our library.

109
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:44,943
So I think this is this is a great you know again our for our homework you can use these are SAS and to some people say a cat was a python I had

110
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:56,253
or you can I use MATLAB be my guest okay okay we are gonna then keep our concern ways you know in the end hollow how are we going to be graded?

111
00:15:56,254 --> 00:16:04,504
Right. Okay, so we are going to pass out our homework every one or two weeks.

112
00:16:04,624 --> 00:16:17,304
Okay. And then you are sub you you are allowed to work you groups but you are required to write, copy your own solutions.

113
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:21,804
Okay? You cannot say okay, you know.

114
00:16:23,954 --> 00:16:34,304
You know student a you you do first the through homework and I do the system you know the next two exercises and we Xerox

115
00:16:34,304 --> 00:16:40,304
you know answer she had no that's not good right so you when you if you work together you come up with some answers.

116
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:49,624
You should still write your own solutions. Okay, uh, so you have two options, right?

117
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:55,484
You you either submit your hard copies to our to the mailbox.

118
00:16:55,954 --> 00:16:59,624
You have to have a mailbox. Where? On the first floor.

119
00:16:59,804 --> 00:17:04,614
On the fourth floor. So. Or you can submit online three cameras.

120
00:17:04,764 --> 00:17:08,024
Okay. So if your finances are easier for you.

121
00:17:08,204 --> 00:17:16,304
Okay. And I also want to remind you, we we are under normal circumstances,

122
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:22,903
we will not accept that homework because we are going to pass out our solution should letters.

123
00:17:22,904 --> 00:17:26,054
So, you know, after you submit your homework. Okay.

124
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:30,814
So that's why I. I really require you to submit the homework online.

125
00:17:30,824 --> 00:17:36,824
Okay. So for each homework, we are gonna specify the deadline for submission.

126
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:43,414
Okay, then we are going to have to find a few examples.

127
00:17:43,484 --> 00:17:53,344
Right. So the those two exams are going to be a ying class is going to be here, is going to be closed book.

128
00:17:53,804 --> 00:17:59,444
You you are not supposed to bring anything to us to fulfill here.

129
00:17:59,834 --> 00:18:09,854
Okay? Only a single lot here is just as a one piece of this A4 emphasizing just this, just this.

130
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:17,624
And here you cannot bring like a poster to here. So and the people say, Can I do a lot of fun?

131
00:18:17,654 --> 00:18:22,784
I don't care as long as you can read. So whatever you can do, but only just one piece.

132
00:18:23,984 --> 00:18:32,924
But for the for the second exam you can a breakthrough pieces basically you can use one piece plus another piece right.

133
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:39,224
So well, you can make up your to to new kidney sheet.

134
00:18:39,314 --> 00:18:46,064
Right. Okay. And we already highlighted those on the midterm exam date.

135
00:18:46,274 --> 00:18:51,734
And this is our final exam date. Right. So, okay, I'll be clear.

136
00:18:52,244 --> 00:18:55,874
Do we have any questions? Right. So I sure.

137
00:18:57,164 --> 00:19:01,464
Please need a leader for the good question.

138
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:08,414
So, you know, when I make my exam, I'm try to be very considerate.

139
00:19:08,464 --> 00:19:14,584
Okay, so even if you do not bring your calculator, it's not gonna be the end of the world.

140
00:19:14,794 --> 00:19:18,514
But if you do have your calculator, bring it with you.

141
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:24,304
Right. But you must be. You must know how to use your cabinet calculator.

142
00:19:24,424 --> 00:19:32,524
You cannot ask me how to use a calculator. And also, you must make sure your calculator has enough battery power.

143
00:19:32,984 --> 00:19:39,784
You know, I cannot go to Target to buy batteries for you as I write songs and.

144
00:19:40,384 --> 00:19:45,804
Okay. Hopefully, that's where the pessimism and reflections go.

145
00:19:46,864 --> 00:19:59,494
Thanks. Okay, so, so, so here now I want to talk about the, you know, the discipline of this class.

146
00:20:01,624 --> 00:20:05,524
I, I understand that, you know, Michigan has a very large campus.

147
00:20:05,864 --> 00:20:10,804
So, you know, people would really have to travel from afar to go to your next appointment.

148
00:20:11,164 --> 00:20:20,374
But I really hope, actually, you'll love it here. You know, I'm kind so that we can start our cars on time and not our thing.

149
00:20:20,374 --> 00:20:24,564
Here is I only. Please. Yeah, that's.

150
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:31,624
I know it is sometimes, actually, you know, it's.

151
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:40,984
We rely on our cell phones, right. But I really I really hope you'll not look at your cell phone during the class.

152
00:20:41,044 --> 00:20:46,384
Okay. You've just got to. This is where it's hot in your large class, right?

153
00:20:47,134 --> 00:20:50,434
Unfortunately, every move of yours is.

154
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:54,484
Yeah, I know exactly what you are doing.

155
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:57,663
So sometimes a student. I decided not to.

156
00:20:57,664 --> 00:21:03,384
Ever since I'm fortunate to have workshop so become so.

157
00:21:04,324 --> 00:21:07,534
So. Yeah. Please do not. I'm not.

158
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:15,714
You know. Please do not. You know. Look at your cell phones. I realize it's kind of a distracting to you, to your ears, and also to me, so.

159
00:21:17,824 --> 00:21:22,114
Oh, another thing here is. Please don't.

160
00:21:22,204 --> 00:21:25,894
Because, again, we still have to money.

161
00:21:26,344 --> 00:21:32,834
We still because we have a very large class. Please do not talk to your fellow students during the class.

162
00:21:32,854 --> 00:21:38,514
Right. And as if you if you have any questions, just call me immediately, okay?

163
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:42,994
You know, I can assure you, no questions. Ask more questions.

164
00:21:43,024 --> 00:21:52,114
No questions asked are stupid questions. Okay. If you think you are confused, most likely the other students, you are not alone.

165
00:21:52,384 --> 00:21:57,904
Okay. So. So. That's why. Do not hold your questions and feel free to ask me.

166
00:21:57,934 --> 00:22:05,634
So if I don't know how to answer questions, I will try my best to look up the answers and try to get out,

167
00:22:05,674 --> 00:22:11,344
you know, try to get back to you next time for, you know, either through emails or just talk to you in person.

168
00:22:11,404 --> 00:22:20,674
Okay. So and also, I think this is a way where you establish our connection and so so that's why, you know, and ask the questions.

169
00:22:20,824 --> 00:22:26,474
But do not talk to your other students. Okay.

170
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:36,864
Okay. So I hope that you really are okay with my request, but.

171
00:22:38,104 --> 00:22:42,274
Um, so we, we are gonna.

172
00:22:42,274 --> 00:22:45,484
And our thing here is we are gonna have the.

173
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:49,644
Okay, so I think this is a yeah. Oh.

174
00:22:50,154 --> 00:22:58,694
Also I want to make sure we because actually in our exam so we're not gonna follow this university

175
00:22:59,354 --> 00:23:05,503
and damage integrity so our lives actually it's going to be very difficult for us right.

176
00:23:05,504 --> 00:23:13,244
So make sure you read this and then you'll fully agree and then you've to stick to this.

177
00:23:13,424 --> 00:23:17,444
Right? Okay.

178
00:23:17,624 --> 00:23:23,654
So let's see. Okay.

179
00:23:23,864 --> 00:23:36,014
So in this class mostly, actually, we are going to use our course notes, but also you will see a lot of times I'm gonna write on the blackboard.

180
00:23:36,324 --> 00:23:49,754
Okay. So that's why I tell you the front side terrorism is the most capricious seeking place, is based on my personal experience myself.

181
00:23:51,104 --> 00:23:55,164
Okay. But again, actually, I'm very concerned with all the people sitting in the back.

182
00:23:55,364 --> 00:23:59,564
So if you see actually, if you cannot see what's going on here, you should know.

183
00:23:59,804 --> 00:24:14,884
Okay. I try to enlarge my file. Okay.

184
00:24:14,904 --> 00:24:22,194
Now, let me just do a little bit and reveal a little bit to reveal.

185
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:33,984
You know, it's not an yet. It's not just a brief outline, the material.

186
00:24:34,164 --> 00:24:42,214
And. Okay, so so you general, we are we are statisticians, right?

187
00:24:42,234 --> 00:24:50,604
We focus on random variables. Right. So for the gradual variables we use, lives would be note the random variable.

188
00:24:50,694 --> 00:24:55,524
Okay, then how would you quantify the behavior of a random variable?

189
00:24:56,444 --> 00:25:01,254
What would be the concept? It's a delusion, right?

190
00:25:01,614 --> 00:25:14,603
Okay. So we introduce but we use the F to calculate to calculate this.

191
00:25:14,604 --> 00:25:17,484
Right. So this is what this is a CDF function, right?

192
00:25:18,144 --> 00:25:27,514
So once you know the CDF function, you basically you know how to characterize the behavior of air.

193
00:25:29,424 --> 00:25:35,993
So can people hear me? That will always tell you, right?

194
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:40,884
So I can yell, I can just assurance. Okay.

195
00:25:41,184 --> 00:25:50,804
So, you know, again, you here for this, for this, for this and here remember, this function actually is not a read.

196
00:25:50,994 --> 00:25:54,534
It's not a written content. It's it's a nonrandom function.

197
00:25:54,534 --> 00:26:01,494
Right. And this, you know, why here actually is is overlap a fixed constant sort of right.

198
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:06,924
So the only thing here is like only the only thing that is random here is this capital Y, right?

199
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:12,204
Okay. Analyze everything here. Actually, this is actually this actually is nonrandom function.

200
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:15,864
So this is a concept that people should be perfectly okay.

201
00:26:16,134 --> 00:26:20,453
Then how would you estimate this guy here? You want to do this?

202
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:27,084
So for example, you given the data, why last rule, I know this is my data, right?

203
00:26:27,354 --> 00:26:45,174
So you would estimate this thing here if here computer does that function right.

204
00:26:45,594 --> 00:26:52,464
Okay. So this is a very simple estimate for estimating the distribution function of a random variable.

205
00:26:52,884 --> 00:26:58,134
Okay, I you we have we have hovered as in in some other course.

206
00:26:58,134 --> 00:27:04,134
It's most likely, you know, sex alone with some other probability or a statistical analysis.

207
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:08,424
Okay. So this is just suppose a single random variable.

208
00:27:09,084 --> 00:27:13,733
Okay, now we can make this thing a little bit more complicated, right?

209
00:27:13,734 --> 00:27:17,784
So now you want to compare to go, right.

210
00:27:17,784 --> 00:27:28,074
So I have a clinical trial. I try to test whether a drug can know or p post blood pressure.

211
00:27:28,344 --> 00:27:36,294
Right. To do this, I assign one group of patients to receive a very aggressive treatment for low blood pressure.

212
00:27:36,594 --> 00:27:41,003
And I read them, I say, and another group of patients were receiving placebo.

213
00:27:41,004 --> 00:27:46,704
Right. And they you know, and I compare the, you know, the blood pressure across those two groups.

214
00:27:46,704 --> 00:27:50,454
Right. Okay. So for one group, we have this.

215
00:27:51,584 --> 00:27:57,274
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why and why?

216
00:27:57,294 --> 00:28:02,513
Okay. So this is a group that receives, you know, shot food for lower their blood pressure.

217
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:08,724
And then this is a pressure obtained for the first patient, right?

218
00:28:08,724 --> 00:28:12,533
This is for the in one patient for the first group. Right. Okay.

219
00:28:12,534 --> 00:28:16,523
Now, I want to consider the placebo group.

220
00:28:16,524 --> 00:28:22,583
Right. Okay. So this is why to throw line two and two, right?

221
00:28:22,584 --> 00:28:27,323
So this is my second group who received the placebo.

222
00:28:27,324 --> 00:28:32,694
Right. Okay. You got and I'm trying to compare them.

223
00:28:32,724 --> 00:28:38,724
So essentially when you do this to come to group comparison, what are you comparing?

224
00:28:40,954 --> 00:28:46,374
Come here log not compare means they are mean like a plague.

225
00:28:46,534 --> 00:28:50,224
So your hypothesis basic theory is solved.

226
00:28:53,044 --> 00:29:01,894
So I think the goal here is you are basically, I assume, why this first group here, of course, you know, the broad pressure is that broad pressure.

227
00:29:06,994 --> 00:29:10,294
Okay. Maybe after some transformation, right?

228
00:29:10,294 --> 00:29:13,323
This part, a normal distribution, right? Okay.

229
00:29:13,324 --> 00:29:20,494
And then this is are the first group here follows a normal distribution and idea, right?

230
00:29:20,734 --> 00:29:27,564
But the first group. Right. Is I y y I follows a normal distribution way is being below one.

231
00:29:27,754 --> 00:29:31,994
And where is Sigma Square? Right. Okay.

232
00:29:32,014 --> 00:29:35,014
And then as I go from one to and one. Right.

233
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:44,194
Okay. And then the second group here, y to my right, it follows again for the second book here,

234
00:29:44,194 --> 00:29:51,724
the ideas are identically and independently, identically distributed.

235
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:59,984
Right? So this follows no one gets a huge numbers is being able to and various sigma plus square.

236
00:30:00,004 --> 00:30:06,304
Right. Okay. And as in your when you do the comparison, you always know Robert your best.

237
00:30:06,334 --> 00:30:10,474
Now, here he is. You'll come here, you'll want to know the full right.

238
00:30:10,804 --> 00:30:14,764
And of course, you'll start with your hypothesis if you are not with you,

239
00:30:15,394 --> 00:30:23,504
if you are doing a two sided test or you can you can do a one sided, one sided testing if you have to compare ways.

240
00:30:24,844 --> 00:30:34,024
Okay. So you want to do the last half. Okay.

241
00:30:34,324 --> 00:30:40,854
So. My father, Bill.

242
00:30:40,854 --> 00:30:45,144
Here he is. You'll calculate the live on bar, right, for your first group.

243
00:30:45,624 --> 00:30:54,743
And also you'll calculate the sigma hat, the the sample standard deviation for your first of all.

244
00:30:54,744 --> 00:30:59,874
Right. And also, you do the same thing here for your second group as well.

245
00:31:00,384 --> 00:31:05,994
And then for you'll also calculate the sample standard deviation for your second group as well.

246
00:31:06,174 --> 00:31:27,864
Okay. We'll also have this. You can you can formulate your test the statistically y y bar minus y to a bar and then divided by the sample variance.

247
00:31:27,864 --> 00:31:30,924
Right. Okay. So this crosses. Okay.

248
00:31:31,164 --> 00:31:37,464
And then there's actually a of follow up, some key distribution by way, some certain degree of freedom.

249
00:31:37,464 --> 00:31:41,574
I put it if again, it was lots enough areas, but you should know this, right?

250
00:31:43,374 --> 00:31:47,603
Okay. So you just got to follow some kid. There's a billion waist down, a certain degree of freedom.

251
00:31:47,604 --> 00:31:51,924
Right. Okay. And then you did reject this.

252
00:31:52,224 --> 00:31:55,694
You were the rich after null hypothesis for what you go for.

253
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:59,764
That's absolutely valuable. This guy here is too large, right?

254
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:03,414
So this is the way you can to the so called a blue sample.

255
00:32:03,474 --> 00:32:07,704
Key test. Key test. Right. Okay.

256
00:32:07,854 --> 00:32:11,423
So you know that, too, for how to categorize,

257
00:32:11,424 --> 00:32:18,534
how to estimate the distribution of function for a homogeneous population where you do not have covariance right.

258
00:32:18,924 --> 00:32:23,614
And then when you have two groups to compare, you know how to use you.

259
00:32:23,994 --> 00:32:34,794
True sample t test. Right. Okay. And a sometimes we have a, you know, your reality situation is not always so simple, right?

260
00:32:34,794 --> 00:32:37,884
You always have very complicated situations.

261
00:32:37,884 --> 00:32:50,724
You may have many, you know, now you'll have only not only you'll have the treatment assignment, you'll also have people's age, gender, race.

262
00:32:51,534 --> 00:32:57,624
And as an either, you know, your income or many other confounders to control for right in this situation,

263
00:32:58,014 --> 00:33:04,044
if you want to control for the effects of confounders, what would you do?

264
00:33:05,674 --> 00:33:08,784
Regression. Who are much? We are going to go to regression.

265
00:33:09,894 --> 00:33:13,154
So now we have a many covariates.

266
00:33:13,164 --> 00:33:18,354
So for example, do x. Y is your primary covariate like your treatment assignment, right?

267
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:26,154
There are one. Right. And then you also have age, gender, race, whatever result.

268
00:33:26,184 --> 00:33:32,064
In the end, you'll have to keep covariates to to worry about right or to deal with.

269
00:33:32,514 --> 00:33:36,614
In this situation, you are gonna do a regression.

270
00:33:36,624 --> 00:33:42,464
So you are going to have the so-called yo yo you adjust the setup of the regression which is going to.

271
00:33:43,704 --> 00:33:52,224
So this is that why is your, I mean, your observed outcome, which is continuous and hopefully follows a normal distribution.

272
00:33:52,224 --> 00:33:59,864
Right. Okay.

273
00:33:59,874 --> 00:34:03,954
So this actually is gonna be your regression, right?

274
00:34:03,974 --> 00:34:10,674
And the same here. You assume this absolute zero of course follows on a normal distribution like for company this model.

275
00:34:10,764 --> 00:34:14,484
This is your this is the model. Okay.

276
00:34:14,634 --> 00:34:17,934
So two questions here.

277
00:34:18,984 --> 00:34:25,134
How would you estimate the behavior? These are the squares, right?

278
00:34:25,854 --> 00:34:29,064
Okay. And then how would you draw inference? Right.

279
00:34:29,154 --> 00:34:33,914
Okay. Do you think that when your pay when you are absolutely terrified of the fact

280
00:34:33,954 --> 00:34:38,183
of the moment is Abuja and actually whilst you have the as animator actor,

281
00:34:38,184 --> 00:34:44,304
you can also you'll you'll you can also get the distribution of your estimate.

282
00:34:44,484 --> 00:34:48,894
So which means the actual you can also join inference. Okay.

283
00:34:49,104 --> 00:34:52,584
So I think I should add this is a linear regression.

284
00:34:52,594 --> 00:34:59,664
Hopefully people have, um, I don't know, 650 Ryan covers this linear regression stuff.

285
00:35:01,524 --> 00:35:10,194
Okay. So, of course, you know, so, you know, the things are not always so easy, right?

286
00:35:12,124 --> 00:35:15,144
This perhaps this is the easiest model.

287
00:35:15,144 --> 00:35:21,294
You'll probably you'll have all the ways. But the what happens if this a y is not continuous?

288
00:35:22,104 --> 00:35:25,614
But what happens if, like these are these create a parallel.

289
00:35:26,214 --> 00:35:31,044
For example, instead of marrying people, subtract pressure.

290
00:35:31,914 --> 00:35:39,174
I just try to study whether that's whether the people will develop heart disease.

291
00:35:40,274 --> 00:35:43,934
But I Sonnenberg that I have that food to Google people, right?

292
00:35:44,294 --> 00:35:46,144
One people want.

293
00:35:46,454 --> 00:35:55,514
One group of people take the pick the drug to lower their brain, pressure them, and then another group, of course, just to use the placebo.

294
00:35:55,724 --> 00:36:03,374
And then I want to compare which group develops more incidence of hypertension.

295
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:08,863
Okay. So now my way is what, binary?

296
00:36:08,864 --> 00:36:13,004
Right. Zero and one. Right. Okay. In this situation, what am I going to use, guys?

297
00:36:13,484 --> 00:36:17,474
Just extreme logistic regression, right? Okay.

298
00:36:19,874 --> 00:36:23,264
So think about another situation.

299
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:34,274
This is the cancer case, right? I'm tied to both groups that you are cancer patients and that I give them, you know, treatments.

300
00:36:34,364 --> 00:36:40,094
And I try to study whether or how many times the cancer recurred.

301
00:36:41,414 --> 00:36:49,194
This is sort of like it's a cancer recurrence, right? So, you know, cancer kind of recurred once, twice, three times or so long.

302
00:36:49,214 --> 00:36:52,634
Right. I try to do the same thing for the Kobe the situation.

303
00:36:52,634 --> 00:36:55,333
Right. How many times after you can get it right?

304
00:36:55,334 --> 00:37:04,214
So before I you know, I was under the cover the first few days, I saw that people can only get one call it only once.

305
00:37:04,544 --> 00:37:10,484
But it turns out the name one of my friends got three or four times already.

306
00:37:11,804 --> 00:37:19,813
Okay, so in this situation, you want to come here, how many times, you know, people will have this repeated events in your life?

307
00:37:19,814 --> 00:37:23,384
Mother, you're kind of us here. Some of them are so right.

308
00:37:23,684 --> 00:37:26,804
I heard something started with here. I hope that you do.

309
00:37:28,064 --> 00:37:35,024
Okay. So you this situation, you're. Why after you go from zero one, two, three, four, prevent it.

310
00:37:35,114 --> 00:37:39,134
Right. Okay. So in this situation, you are doing the process of regression, right?

311
00:37:39,464 --> 00:37:48,284
Okay. So you all the situations here we are talking about what you see no end, right?

312
00:37:48,704 --> 00:37:52,124
Generalized linear model models.

313
00:37:52,124 --> 00:37:58,214
Right. Okay. Then how would you estimate the theta and how would you draw inference of the data?

314
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:01,934
Okay. Now you don't have these squares to work with, right.

315
00:38:02,594 --> 00:38:05,624
How would you do that? Guys, I.

316
00:38:06,174 --> 00:38:10,993
I need to hear something. Starting with M in Hamlet.

317
00:38:10,994 --> 00:38:20,374
Right? You establish the likelihood and then the what you you use the likelihood to draw a

318
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:26,684
to draw you first estimate you maximize the likelihood to get your point estimate.

319
00:38:27,164 --> 00:38:32,144
And then you you take the log of your likelihood, right?

320
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:37,273
And then you take the second derivative and then you put the negative sign there and the you, you,

321
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:43,814
you work hard right then this way you look at the estimate for your variance of your estimate.

322
00:38:44,294 --> 00:38:49,364
Okay, so this is what this is what you want to do here. Okay.

323
00:38:49,504 --> 00:38:53,974
So why I'm doing this here?

324
00:38:54,664 --> 00:39:03,074
Because. This actually is gonna be our roadmap for survival analysis as well.

325
00:39:04,034 --> 00:39:10,284
Okay, so for the survival analysis, I think there are just three components right now that.

326
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:22,254
Yeah. Just like I did for the for the bios that there are three basic courses.

327
00:39:22,254 --> 00:39:32,274
Right. You know, there's a requirement that extreme courses, book three, three forces, you know, carries a cart, which is a 92.

328
00:39:32,334 --> 00:39:36,354
You know, they have analysis, categorical data analysis and the survival analysis.

329
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:41,464
Okay. And then within survival analysis, there are also three forces here.

330
00:39:41,964 --> 00:39:46,074
The first horse here is how the estimate is the survival.

331
00:39:46,314 --> 00:39:50,454
It's a bulletin based on the homogeneous population.

332
00:39:51,604 --> 00:39:59,914
Okay. So in this situation, instead of estimating the distribution function, we are estimating the survival function.

333
00:40:00,654 --> 00:40:03,934
Okay. Second, the setting here is.

334
00:40:05,254 --> 00:40:09,484
When you have the two groups to compare. Well, we.

335
00:40:10,084 --> 00:40:24,804
How would you. So for example. Yeah.

336
00:40:24,804 --> 00:40:29,994
So let me see. I have nothing to do with me.

337
00:40:30,314 --> 00:40:34,974
I don't. Okay.

338
00:40:35,554 --> 00:40:54,824
So. Well, let's just give you a very quick overview of what's going to happen in survival analysis.

339
00:40:55,154 --> 00:40:59,924
Hopefully, people will pay attention here. Okay.

340
00:41:00,044 --> 00:41:03,184
So now back to survival class. Right.

341
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:08,173
So now baby safety. Now this is the DNA of it.

342
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:17,584
So in survival analysis, we do not deal with why we deal with English letters, starting with what's.

343
00:41:19,464 --> 00:41:22,714
What do you think? Tea time.

344
00:41:24,384 --> 00:41:27,594
He actually is gonna be the most popular word.

345
00:41:28,014 --> 00:41:37,434
So up in survival analysis, we most likely are not going to use a Y to denote our response.

346
00:41:38,284 --> 00:41:44,174
Instead, we use our we use team to denote our major response.

347
00:41:44,514 --> 00:41:52,884
So she if here actually is the time neck between last starting point until an event happens

348
00:41:53,604 --> 00:42:02,753
so to you here actually is you're stock here until this kind happens some event happens so

349
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:10,163
for example you know so for example for you know so my warehouse is about that called on

350
00:42:10,164 --> 00:42:17,364
people on can survive right so you start from you know your first date until your last time.

351
00:42:17,364 --> 00:42:21,714
Right. So this this does compress the whole lifecycle of the patient.

352
00:42:23,404 --> 00:42:32,304
Okay. So. So in these situations here, how would you can categorize that behavior over the survival time?

353
00:42:32,694 --> 00:42:36,794
Right. So I can start with something here.

354
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:40,014
So for you that you can do that it's abuse and. Right.

355
00:42:40,254 --> 00:42:43,784
You can use a distribution like a CBF. Right. Okay.

356
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:47,564
And then you can also use what? Then say it right.

357
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:52,884
You can also use density. Okay.

358
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:59,544
I think these two concepts were introduced in six a lot.

359
00:42:59,564 --> 00:43:04,544
Right. All from your from your private.

360
00:43:04,554 --> 00:43:11,714
With your class. Right. Okay. But we in this class, we are gonna introduce some new concepts.

361
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:18,914
Okay. So in particular, we are going to use the survival function.

362
00:43:20,174 --> 00:43:30,614
Okay. We are gonna use the hazard function that can use a hazard function.

363
00:43:31,004 --> 00:43:35,424
And then we are gonna also talk about cumulative kind of functions.

364
00:43:41,654 --> 00:43:50,624
Okay. So the that the last the three concepts are especially reserved for survival analysis.

365
00:43:51,164 --> 00:43:56,414
Okay. So, so for example, the these two are just generic.

366
00:43:56,654 --> 00:44:04,004
Okay. But for survival analysis actually is we are most uncomfortable with the latter three concepts.

367
00:44:04,244 --> 00:44:18,404
Okay. The catch here is mostly actually the items the for convenience of interpretation can mathematically if you know one of them.

368
00:44:19,424 --> 00:44:22,544
You also know the other four. Okay.

369
00:44:22,574 --> 00:44:27,514
So if you know the distribution function, you can derive the other for you.

370
00:44:27,544 --> 00:44:31,603
If you know the survival function. You can also derive the distribution about the intestine.

371
00:44:31,604 --> 00:44:36,614
Function has our function also that rival if you know the has a function you also know the.

372
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:40,934
So those concepts you know they can derive each other.

373
00:44:42,704 --> 00:44:48,104
But you can survive on assets just for the sake of interpretation.

374
00:44:48,374 --> 00:44:56,684
We stick to, you know, survival function listed to have their function listed to not to build a human vehicle of functional survival.

375
00:44:59,404 --> 00:45:08,224
Well, the complication here is, well, so far, nothing actually is so bad.

376
00:45:08,224 --> 00:45:18,514
Right. Those factories, the old loss I half of this year on I probably I can just use my old techniques to try to to derive all the concepts here.

377
00:45:19,564 --> 00:45:26,764
Part of the complication here is this team is not fully observable.

378
00:45:32,164 --> 00:45:35,254
Okay. So think about this.

379
00:45:35,284 --> 00:45:45,384
In a clinical trial, you tried to study how long patients can survive after surgery for a group of cancer patients.

380
00:45:45,394 --> 00:45:53,364
Right. So you you do the surgery and then you'll follow up the people and then you you just a study, you know how long they can survive, right?

381
00:45:53,394 --> 00:45:58,923
So you will have like 20 people to stargaze and you just to see, oh, people just die one by one.

382
00:45:58,924 --> 00:46:03,484
Right. Okay. But the point here is no matter.

383
00:46:04,684 --> 00:46:08,733
Because your final time here is only is always limited.

384
00:46:08,734 --> 00:46:15,694
Right after the end of your final time at the end of your study, not everybody dies.

385
00:46:15,694 --> 00:46:18,774
Right. And this is good news. You'll us.

386
00:46:19,084 --> 00:46:23,464
I sound a little bit of pessimistic, but I think it's good news for patients.

387
00:46:23,794 --> 00:46:31,474
But statistically, this is a challenging right, because you try to study this team for the patients.

388
00:46:32,404 --> 00:46:37,384
But for a lot of patients, you do not fully observe their t right.

389
00:46:37,894 --> 00:46:46,983
In this situation, we we would call that the T is a sensor, which means you only know that for this patient.

390
00:46:46,984 --> 00:46:51,004
This patient probably you say, oh, yes, got to be survive more than five years.

391
00:46:51,694 --> 00:46:55,654
But you do not know exactly when this patient is going to die.

392
00:46:55,684 --> 00:47:04,954
Right. Okay. So in this situation where you say that the data are censored or the data are subject to a censoring.

393
00:47:06,344 --> 00:47:15,294
I've got it here. Okay, so our path here is telling you eventually because they know it is going to be like possess humor,

394
00:47:15,344 --> 00:47:19,214
observe on the the first two patients die in one year.

395
00:47:19,244 --> 00:47:24,454
The second patients die each year. And on a patient die, you three, you're looking at another patient.

396
00:47:24,734 --> 00:47:29,354
Okay. After a full year, you know, the patient suddenly drops down from the study.

397
00:47:29,354 --> 00:47:35,144
And maybe you can move out from this country and move out from Michigan to some other places.

398
00:47:35,774 --> 00:47:41,593
And then there's another patient die and a 4.55.

399
00:47:41,594 --> 00:47:46,664
There's another patient inside that self-identified five and five year.

400
00:47:46,694 --> 00:47:50,804
Okay. So this entry is going to be the survival data.

401
00:47:51,374 --> 00:47:55,234
You are going to observe. Right. Okay. Yeah.

402
00:47:55,254 --> 00:48:04,784
I was for this first patient. I observe the key for this patient of the is you collect a lot for the second patient.

403
00:48:05,984 --> 00:48:10,664
The tease. You got to to write for this patient.

404
00:48:10,784 --> 00:48:14,284
Here's what. I don't know.

405
00:48:14,344 --> 00:48:18,814
But I know only those that cheese grater that felt right. So that's why I say full pass, right?

406
00:48:20,154 --> 00:48:25,724
And then for this patient, what is a. I don't know, but I know that he is greater than five.

407
00:48:25,734 --> 00:48:28,764
Right. Okay, so what is this?

408
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:34,014
Are you able to help me estimate this guy?

409
00:48:36,174 --> 00:48:40,884
This actually is going to be my survival function. So how to use this data?

410
00:48:41,484 --> 00:48:47,174
So estimated this. Okay. There are two options you can have.

411
00:48:47,184 --> 00:48:52,764
Right? Why are you here? He is okay. Because the people are censored, right?

412
00:48:52,914 --> 00:48:56,814
They don't give me that. The the exact answers.

413
00:48:57,744 --> 00:49:01,494
Can I just drop them? Can I just leave them out?

414
00:49:01,504 --> 00:49:08,484
If I just say, oh, I just took my time just to take them all straight.

415
00:49:08,644 --> 00:49:12,144
You know, approach. I pretended they never happened here.

416
00:49:13,754 --> 00:49:17,214
Okay, this is our approach and our approach.

417
00:49:17,214 --> 00:49:23,544
I think, actually, it's like a criminal approach. I remove this heart and remove this.

418
00:49:24,024 --> 00:49:29,744
People say this is like a theta. Let's have a look at this.

419
00:49:30,284 --> 00:49:33,984
I [INAUDIBLE] up anyway. So what do you think of this approach?

420
00:49:35,214 --> 00:49:41,214
Both approaches are just horrible, and I think that the second approach is like a criminal act.

421
00:49:41,954 --> 00:49:48,154
You cannot do this. Okay, so. So you are in this class.

422
00:49:48,684 --> 00:49:56,994
We are just going to talk about how to use our foothold because of how to use all of this data focus.

423
00:49:57,054 --> 00:50:02,364
Of course, always some certain assumptions to estimate this.

424
00:50:02,904 --> 00:50:08,694
Okay. And then we are gonna talk about the so called Kaplan-meier estimate.

425
00:50:09,054 --> 00:50:12,834
Okay. So Kaplan-meier estimate, it turns out, will be something out of this.

426
00:50:21,114 --> 00:50:24,354
So it's just gonna be like a step function.

427
00:50:24,924 --> 00:50:34,974
But if you, if you define this leg, having a minor function is going to be rather continuous parted ways with the left hand side limit.

428
00:50:35,904 --> 00:50:42,934
So. Okay.

429
00:50:42,934 --> 00:50:46,594
So no one actually in the the. Yeah, but just the American.

430
00:50:47,104 --> 00:50:53,854
Right. But you should know that actually it is actually this continuous step function.

431
00:50:53,854 --> 00:50:59,764
It's right. Continuous, rather continuous because actually we define this survival function this way.

432
00:50:59,944 --> 00:51:12,634
Right. Right. Continuous means actually if you approach this t from the right hand side, this edges up front is equal to this.

433
00:51:14,264 --> 00:51:20,804
But this is not even close to the Super Bowl this long here.

434
00:51:22,784 --> 00:51:27,104
This is the one this is a 9.8.

435
00:51:27,714 --> 00:51:31,334
So think about this. This is a full year. Okay.

436
00:51:31,514 --> 00:51:40,454
So in this situation, my answer to here is going to be you put 1.8.

437
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:46,124
Right. But not as too negative here.

438
00:51:46,544 --> 00:51:52,974
If you approach this through here from the left hand side is going to be what we want.

439
00:51:52,994 --> 00:51:53,744
Right. Okay.

440
00:51:55,154 --> 00:52:05,384
And then what happens to as to plus two, just take any value just a little slightly, you know, like Hernandez to just kind of be here, right?

441
00:52:05,684 --> 00:52:09,994
Point eight. Okay.

442
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:17,384
So this is just some calculus stuff, right? I hope that you people are still I still remember this, but I just want to quickly go over this.

443
00:52:18,944 --> 00:52:22,054
Okay. So this is actually how to construct this.

444
00:52:22,144 --> 00:52:26,654
This is kind of just is going of be our kaplan-meier estimate here.

445
00:52:27,104 --> 00:52:31,934
Okay. And we're going to, um, we are going to study this very intensely.

446
00:52:34,244 --> 00:52:40,994
Okay. So for the calorimeter estimate, are we just a study of this based on this homogeneous population,

447
00:52:40,994 --> 00:52:47,204
which means that we think actually our population are very homogeneous.

448
00:52:47,324 --> 00:52:52,714
All right. Okay. But but the actual are not so simple, right?

449
00:52:52,724 --> 00:52:56,704
Well, you have two groups, so compare what is which means.

450
00:52:56,804 --> 00:53:01,914
Okay. So in this situation, this.

451
00:53:11,264 --> 00:53:14,954
And so, for example, you this situation here you put a have another.

452
00:53:22,634 --> 00:53:32,714
You can just do it right here. So, for example, I halau, I have another group of patients who started to kill patients for studies.

453
00:53:33,114 --> 00:53:40,104
This one here is my placebo group. And then this group here is my treatment group.

454
00:53:41,994 --> 00:53:44,994
What you what you can do. Here he is.

455
00:53:45,134 --> 00:53:50,574
Now you have a clinical trial so you can apply the countermeasure to you to group separate.

456
00:53:50,604 --> 00:53:53,814
Right? And then in the end they try to here it is two groups, right.

457
00:53:54,714 --> 00:54:00,623
But how would you come here also?

458
00:54:00,624 --> 00:54:10,114
Would you do that full group comparison? Okay.

459
00:54:10,254 --> 00:54:17,094
So for example, yes, here you try to study whether the two curves are exactly the same, right?

460
00:54:17,094 --> 00:54:27,743
So the null hypothesis here is going to be s why we see this actually is just the survival

461
00:54:27,744 --> 00:54:32,664
function for the first group is equal to the survival function of the second group.

462
00:54:32,664 --> 00:54:39,714
Right. Okay. So this is a null hypothesis. You try and also here this is pulled and okay, anything.

463
00:54:41,934 --> 00:54:47,663
Okay, so this is actually you can see the counterpart here is a true sample test right by

464
00:54:47,664 --> 00:54:51,594
the product whose amplitude has you are testing whether the means are the same.

465
00:54:52,464 --> 00:54:58,884
But you know, survival setting we are testing the true survival curves are exactly the same.

466
00:54:59,604 --> 00:55:06,984
Right. Okay. So to do that, here we are gonna talk about the so-called low ground test.

467
00:55:08,994 --> 00:55:18,114
Okay? So, so this he is talking about outcome. Talk about what happens if you have a full survival curves to compare rates.

468
00:55:18,414 --> 00:55:24,564
Okay. And then in this situation you are gonna use the so called log rank test.

469
00:55:25,284 --> 00:55:32,813
Okay. So you can see here the counterpart of this is going to be the true sample T test right by we don't have that he'd

470
00:55:32,814 --> 00:55:40,254
had he does a P distribution so compared to the instead we have the so-called low ground test that will deal with.

471
00:55:41,904 --> 00:55:46,094
Okay so finally. Be.

472
00:55:46,244 --> 00:55:54,884
For example, you will have many confounders to account for right then in that situation we are going to talk about right how to do regression.

473
00:55:54,884 --> 00:56:00,013
But I think I think actually our statisticians are we aggressors, right?

474
00:56:00,014 --> 00:56:06,454
We like to do regression. We throw everything to the to the model and then you then you know, the output to give us a lot of things that we can see.

475
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:13,273
Okay. Now if we are that right. Okay, great. So he actually you in our survival situation.

476
00:56:13,274 --> 00:56:17,194
Theodor we are going to talk about ABC.

477
00:56:25,254 --> 00:56:37,714
We are gonna through the regression so. Okay.

478
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:43,534
So. So here our survival time is here, right?

479
00:56:43,804 --> 00:56:47,974
And now we have a lot of confounders.

480
00:56:53,644 --> 00:57:03,124
Confounders Z. Okay, so remember, is that his days where normally we use X to denote the.

481
00:57:04,814 --> 00:57:12,134
The covariance, right? But this use of our analysis, we use Z normally we use Z to the, you know, the covariance.

482
00:57:12,614 --> 00:57:16,454
So in all of these P and I yeah.

483
00:57:16,454 --> 00:57:22,814
So, you know, actually X has been reserved for the, for, for some other things here.

484
00:57:22,934 --> 00:57:28,784
So. Okay.

485
00:57:28,844 --> 00:57:32,374
So you that situation, you know, Zyban can be as a treatment assignment.

486
00:57:32,384 --> 00:57:37,213
You know, they two here can be age these three gender therefore you know,

487
00:57:37,214 --> 00:57:44,674
raise the five prasugrel or whatever that values you want to use in your survival models.

488
00:57:45,744 --> 00:57:56,134
Okay. So my personal theory is how a colleague how would you please this cheat for Z?

489
00:57:56,524 --> 00:58:01,174
Okay, there are two ways you can do so. Just two options here.

490
00:58:04,624 --> 00:58:10,474
Two options here. The first option here is you use directly name because it's cheaper to Z.

491
00:58:10,474 --> 00:58:19,384
So for example, this actually is going to be public about to the directly directly linked to Z.

492
00:58:19,804 --> 00:58:26,253
So then we've talk about the so called accelerator.

493
00:58:26,254 --> 00:58:32,494
The failure to model A is like accelerator failure time out of empty model.

494
00:58:33,694 --> 00:58:42,634
So basically we are going to talk about this later on, why we call this accelerator failure and why do we need accelerating?

495
00:58:49,664 --> 00:59:05,334
Okay. And on her way. Here he is in. Well, it turns out this indirect way becomes the most popular way to link the survival time to recovery.

496
00:59:05,914 --> 00:59:14,704
So you start off with directly in the wrapping being kind of survival of, you know, the the survival time closing.

497
00:59:15,034 --> 00:59:22,354
We actually we introduce we link the hazard function through the to the covariance.

498
00:59:22,624 --> 00:59:27,183
So when you introduce at least time here,

499
00:59:27,184 --> 00:59:36,814
here they constructed a given the year we have the so called had their function and then talk about how we define that as a function.

500
00:59:37,264 --> 00:59:45,994
Our course probably has been that for two or three. I mean, next time and then we are going to leave this here to the.

501
00:59:52,034 --> 00:59:56,983
Okay. Actually, this is so close to the Cox model, probably.

502
00:59:56,984 --> 01:00:01,094
This is the most important model. It probably is in statistics.

503
01:00:01,544 --> 01:00:07,184
Okay. So this actually is you can see this actually is our condition of hazard.

504
01:00:07,694 --> 01:00:14,804
Even the the and now we constructed this after you cause the baseline had a function based on how their function is.

505
01:00:14,804 --> 01:00:17,804
What happens if you said ever z appear to be zero.

506
01:00:18,464 --> 01:00:20,684
This is this is that reason has a function.

507
01:00:20,864 --> 01:00:29,794
And then the Z approach turns out to matter to have this so called multiplicative impact and that has our function right.

508
01:00:29,804 --> 01:00:33,853
So exponential beta transpose the transpose here.

509
01:00:33,854 --> 01:00:46,154
If you put RZA here, he is a bad term. Okay. So in this course here we are gonna talk about for the empty model and also for the cost model,

510
01:00:46,784 --> 01:00:53,233
how to estimate this data and also how to estimate that this name does zero.

511
01:00:53,234 --> 01:00:56,654
Right. And also how to draw inference. Okay.

512
01:00:56,744 --> 01:01:04,874
So at least once you have this data estimate, can you quantify the uncertainty of the data?

513
01:01:05,224 --> 01:01:12,314
Okay. Can you get the P value? Can you calculate the the confidence intervals for for you for your estimate?

514
01:01:12,454 --> 01:01:17,384
Right. This is something we are going to talk about in this class.

515
01:01:18,554 --> 01:01:23,324
Okay. And another thing I want to talk about here is we will.

516
01:01:26,794 --> 01:01:32,794
This actually just as a so-called disagreement and forgotten room.

517
01:01:32,794 --> 01:01:39,604
And it has double in one single event. Women's gymnastics agency.

518
01:01:49,714 --> 01:01:53,914
We must tell you. You could go. Okay, so this is something we talk about.

519
01:01:55,204 --> 01:02:01,894
I usually don't. If you don't know this here, you should just try to search as I like to try to catch them.

520
01:02:02,584 --> 01:02:13,244
So you in particular. So, for example, we have this. Okay.

521
01:02:13,634 --> 01:02:19,244
So f that's scary. Is that how you keep around? Okay, our final scary is that integrator.

522
01:02:19,274 --> 01:02:24,733
Okay, so, so, so if I go off so many of you are afraid that scary just X right?

523
01:02:24,734 --> 01:02:32,114
So that's actually at these as continuous. So what happens if this X is is this continuous is a discrete function.

524
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:36,943
Well, so we should know how to calculate this integral.

525
01:02:36,944 --> 01:02:40,874
And then in particular, you can however s here is a step function.

526
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:48,914
Then this actually is got you close to the. All the if.

527
01:02:49,194 --> 01:03:04,834
If you just calculate the junk junk size of this on finance at each add the each junk and the then you you multiply by of acts.

528
01:03:05,244 --> 01:03:11,514
Okay? And then you'll stand in the ark, and then you take this ads go from A to B.

529
01:03:12,464 --> 01:03:15,804
Okay. So this is a this is how you calculate. This is roommate integral.

530
01:03:15,984 --> 01:03:23,604
Remain state. Yes, integral. Okay. Going from from here for here is it's it's easier.

531
01:03:24,054 --> 01:03:32,014
But once you have this all you can go back to here this also this is this is something I require you to you know,

532
01:03:32,574 --> 01:03:38,754
probably you should to know how to do this, you know, later on. Okay.

533
01:03:38,844 --> 01:03:43,644
So actually, basically, this is what's going to happen in this semester.

534
01:03:43,644 --> 01:03:47,294
So we know that we are going to we are going to study that.

535
01:03:48,234 --> 01:03:55,464
We are going to study is a compromise estimate are we are going to study the law grammar test.

536
01:03:55,794 --> 01:04:00,854
We are going to study the cops model and a few models.

537
01:04:00,954 --> 01:04:10,014
Okay. And design. And also when we are we are going to talk about how to use R and and also these proposals.

538
01:04:10,224 --> 01:04:17,753
You can also learn how to use a SAS to to fit all those models or to forget all those estimates.

539
01:04:17,754 --> 01:04:32,484
Right. Okay. So I've hope actually keep on the stand this and then I, I'm trying to give you more applications, you know, when we deal with this.

540
01:04:32,634 --> 01:04:38,993
But also in the meantime, there are still a lot of technical technicalities we have to deal with.

541
01:04:38,994 --> 01:04:47,483
So hopefully that you you will also pay attention to what's happened on the class note and also what's going to happen on the blackboard.

542
01:04:47,484 --> 01:04:50,924
Right. Okay.

543
01:04:50,924 --> 01:04:55,574
So. So any questions, guys?

544
01:04:55,694 --> 01:05:00,154
I'll be okay. Sure. Please. So is that the integral about.

545
01:05:00,164 --> 01:05:04,404
That's separate from the different links, right? That's like a fourth step. Or is that another indirect.

546
01:05:04,754 --> 01:05:08,294
Well, that you're talking about, this room is digital integral.

547
01:05:09,164 --> 01:05:13,464
That's just some technical skill.

548
01:05:13,514 --> 01:05:16,994
I hope you will. You are you are.

549
01:05:17,474 --> 01:05:21,734
You will know how to do it. And this is going to be very helpful for you.

550
01:05:21,744 --> 01:05:22,784
For example, later on,

551
01:05:22,784 --> 01:05:33,584
we are going to talk about how to how to write the Kaplan-meier estimate for how to write the log and to test in terms of the counting process.

552
01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:38,714
Okay. In order to do that, we have to use this room tested stage as integral.

553
01:05:39,074 --> 01:05:44,174
So I because actually we are just starting this new semester.

554
01:05:44,444 --> 01:05:48,134
You probably you have a little, little bit of free time.

555
01:05:48,434 --> 01:05:52,124
I want you to do the Google search.

556
01:05:52,334 --> 01:05:56,504
You know, do the look at the Wikipedia just to understand what's going on.

557
01:05:57,044 --> 01:06:02,174
I think this can be helpful just from a technical skill.

558
01:06:02,324 --> 01:06:06,584
I hope people will will, will understand.

559
01:06:07,244 --> 01:06:11,804
Okay. That's that's a very good question. So any other questions, guys? I will do it.

560
01:06:15,744 --> 01:06:20,894
You know, I'm a right hand person. I keep looking and I'm like, I didn't get people here, right?

561
01:06:20,904 --> 01:06:26,304
Someone said, okay, so okay.

562
01:06:26,304 --> 01:06:34,494
So for the remaining time now, let's just briefly go to our course note number one.

563
01:06:34,524 --> 01:06:46,884
Right. So we we've I just very briefly, I just mentioned that a lot of things here have already been covered actually in my in my overview here.

564
01:06:47,814 --> 01:06:53,934
You know, again, I watched a lot of people to download this download this book.

565
01:06:53,934 --> 01:06:59,634
Right. So this is this is the first book on my syllabus, which is the highlight here.

566
01:06:59,964 --> 01:07:05,124
You know, just go to the library website and adjust the catalog.

567
01:07:05,634 --> 01:07:13,014
So and as you will, you'll be able to download this book, read the chapter one, chapter two, chapter three.

568
01:07:13,044 --> 01:07:19,824
Okay. So and then we'll talk about the survival analysis lectures.

569
01:07:20,124 --> 01:07:25,673
People talk about survival analysis all the time, but the G you mentioned other fields.

570
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:38,364
People also have a different name, you know, for survival analysis, for example, you know, people talk about lifetime data analysis, right?

571
01:07:38,574 --> 01:07:42,704
And then people talk about time to event analysis.

572
01:07:42,804 --> 01:07:46,733
Right. People talk about reliability analysis.

573
01:07:46,734 --> 01:07:52,254
You know, they are talking about the survival analysis and the.

574
01:07:54,294 --> 01:08:00,384
And also the techniques actually are almost the same across different disciplines,

575
01:08:00,384 --> 01:08:05,214
but actually the ability of most actually the people in engineering school do well.

576
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:09,624
They were able to just code out, get out. But survive are not seen this way.

577
01:08:11,304 --> 01:08:15,454
But in our setting, normally we just cause a survival analysis.

578
01:08:15,594 --> 01:08:22,823
Right? Okay. So, so survival setting, you know, so I will send you here mostly.

579
01:08:22,824 --> 01:08:29,574
Actually, we describe the probability of the event occurring by some particular time, right?

580
01:08:29,574 --> 01:08:35,483
So in this situation we talk about distribution and we talk about the survival function.

581
01:08:35,484 --> 01:08:41,354
So in that situation, we talk about the how to you know, how what is the probability is a patient of a survival pacified.

582
01:08:41,934 --> 01:08:47,093
So, for example are very important indicator of their importance.

583
01:08:47,094 --> 01:08:52,434
And the point in cancer research is what is a five year survival.

584
01:08:52,884 --> 01:09:05,904
So all because why five year survival is very important because physicians feel if a people can survive first of five years after cancer,

585
01:09:06,924 --> 01:09:10,374
it's likely the patients will be cured.

586
01:09:10,794 --> 01:09:15,384
So that's why five year is a very important indicator because in the field,

587
01:09:16,284 --> 01:09:21,944
because actually full from the physicians perspective they are thinking about.

588
01:09:35,874 --> 01:09:43,944
Now think about this stuff like this in five years. Because after five years, this survival curve will almost become like a flat.

589
01:09:44,384 --> 01:09:48,674
Okay, so think of this. So this way, this thing as a patient are cured from the cancer.

590
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:54,294
So this is some some concept and a survival analysis.

591
01:09:57,844 --> 01:10:08,704
Okay. And another thing here he is. Okay. And the ultimate particular point point for this for for for this field is the sensory ride.

592
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:12,954
Because if we do not observe the the events.

593
01:10:12,964 --> 01:10:17,314
So that's why we have to take care of the of the sensory.

594
01:10:20,934 --> 01:10:25,854
Okay. So, of course, I actually saw one of our labs is about to study it.

595
01:10:26,784 --> 01:10:31,314
How? How long people can survive, you know, always, you know.

596
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:39,354
And the point is all, I would think that perhaps 90% of time will be will be the death.

597
01:10:39,384 --> 01:10:43,144
Right. Survival rate means of death. Right. But it doesn't have to be that.

598
01:10:43,164 --> 01:10:47,424
So, for example, either can either, you know, cancer incidence, you know,

599
01:10:47,514 --> 01:10:59,124
whether or how soon people will develop cancer or cancer remission or, you know, the HIV HIV infection locally, the infection will sell out.

600
01:10:59,124 --> 01:11:10,914
Right. So as long as you can define the time zero and also you define your event, then the time lag is your survival time.

601
01:11:11,544 --> 01:11:21,174
Okay. So that's why you if you if you've you've an investigator wants you to work on something related to survival analysis,

602
01:11:21,804 --> 01:11:27,864
the first the first question you'll want to ask is always what is times zero?

603
01:11:28,524 --> 01:11:34,224
And also what is your your bent? Okay. Once you understand these two points,

604
01:11:34,674 --> 01:11:41,134
then you will be able to calculate as a survival time and you will be able to calculate as a survival distribution.

605
01:11:41,154 --> 01:11:51,744
Right. Okay. So these actually normally people will forget about asking the first which first question people will ask about is the body going event.

606
01:11:52,194 --> 01:11:55,823
But people will always forget about the first question What is your time?

607
01:11:55,824 --> 01:11:59,544
Zero. That turns out to be very important as well.

608
01:12:01,314 --> 01:12:06,054
Okay. So the event here can be just ten business days.

609
01:12:06,294 --> 01:12:09,923
Represent representing a quantitative change.

610
01:12:09,924 --> 01:12:12,924
Right. Going from alive to that.

611
01:12:12,984 --> 01:12:22,644
Right. Going from, you know, cooler to free to a COVID infection for you from, you know, same bill to marital marital divorce disease free of disease.

612
01:12:22,824 --> 01:12:30,954
So. Okay, so so this this just a little bit of motivation.

613
01:12:30,954 --> 01:12:38,603
So why we care about the why we need the, you know, survival are not, as it turns out, to be a very important branch of about that.

614
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:46,614
Right. Why we cannot just directly use our own the methodologies to deal with survival time.

615
01:12:47,344 --> 01:12:54,504
The the usual here is because of the sensory you'll have to handle sensory property.

616
01:12:55,404 --> 01:12:59,484
And the other masseuse, you know, cannot handle this well.

617
01:12:59,634 --> 01:13:06,394
So people say, okay, so why don't you just use the imputation?

618
01:13:06,684 --> 01:13:13,794
Why can't you just a treat as a sensory, as a missing and a you've used some recent data techniques to do that.

619
01:13:13,944 --> 01:13:16,554
Okay. People do. That's what people do.

620
01:13:16,554 --> 01:13:31,524
That also, for example, we will talk about when we deal with the NFT model, we actually we we shoot the sensor the time using the so-called education.

621
01:13:31,704 --> 01:13:36,204
Right. It turns out this actually is a way to to do imputation.

622
01:13:36,414 --> 01:13:43,733
But for some other models next, the Cox models, it turns out we don't have to use a imputed value.

623
01:13:43,734 --> 01:13:51,204
We can just directly introduce the so called higher likelihood and then we can establish very efficient estimate.

624
01:13:55,254 --> 01:14:03,144
Okay. So sometimes actually the of the sensor here can be very large and the UK has financial.

625
01:14:03,144 --> 01:14:06,324
90% of the people make a sensor. Okay.

626
01:14:06,804 --> 01:14:12,093
But you say, okay, what is the minimum threshold for conducting survival?

627
01:14:12,094 --> 01:14:15,654
Our analysis is 90% is too high.

628
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:25,554
I would say yes or no. So, for example, if you have a 100 kilo.

629
01:14:26,594 --> 01:14:37,484
99% of people were censored, which means only a 10% ten people had fully observer survivor types.

630
01:14:38,384 --> 01:14:43,244
In this situation, I would say no. The censor rate here is just too high.

631
01:14:43,904 --> 01:14:48,614
You cannot do anything with only. Maybe you can do something that it's only ten people.

632
01:14:48,614 --> 01:14:52,694
But I wouldn't trust your results too much. Okay.

633
01:14:52,964 --> 01:14:57,154
Still 19% since the race, right?

634
01:14:57,164 --> 01:15:13,314
But this time you have 100,000 and then you'll have 90% censoring and then all over the calculate 10% of the people that you can fully observe.

635
01:15:13,514 --> 01:15:17,234
I would have come out 100%. 100,000.

636
01:15:17,504 --> 01:15:24,554
100,000. Right. It's going to be 10,000 people had the failure times for the observer in this situation.

637
01:15:24,554 --> 01:15:32,674
I will say no, you are perfect. Fine. So you can see young us in survival analysis.

638
01:15:34,154 --> 01:15:38,234
What really matters here is the number of events.

639
01:15:39,224 --> 01:15:47,744
Okay. Yes. Another above how high you'll say are rate is is really about how many deaths, how many events you have observed.

640
01:15:48,164 --> 01:15:55,004
Okay. So you're in clinical trial, what you call the number of events as information.

641
01:15:56,234 --> 01:16:01,304
Okay. It's not the phase of reign or the order or the failure rate as the information.

642
01:16:01,554 --> 01:16:04,654
Actually, it is the number of events information.

643
01:16:05,034 --> 01:16:13,844
So it turns out this at you just tells you that what really matters here is just as a number of events.

644
01:16:16,234 --> 01:16:21,574
Okay. Just a little bit location here. As I said, we use AI in this course.

645
01:16:21,904 --> 01:16:33,184
We use I appear to indicate a subject we use here here to denote some fixed time points where we want to evaluate our survival function at some level.

646
01:16:33,184 --> 01:16:38,764
Keith are actually the first time point is at least it's not a nonrandom time point.

647
01:16:39,154 --> 01:16:43,444
And also now having a chip here is our number offer.

648
01:16:43,444 --> 01:16:45,454
You bet. I'm sorry. Time up.

649
01:16:45,464 --> 01:16:57,244
You back for a subject I shot at you to use something that's actually years of our major interest and a CIA concrete in all potential sensor in time.

650
01:16:57,844 --> 01:17:04,924
Okay, Kai. And the CIA is just completing each other, so we only observe the winner.

651
01:17:05,074 --> 01:17:08,224
The winner is whichever comes first. Right? Okay.

652
01:17:08,224 --> 01:17:14,254
So that's why our excited years is a minimum of the chi and a CIA.

653
01:17:14,944 --> 01:17:18,394
Okay, so whichever comes first is going to be something we all deserve.

654
01:17:18,694 --> 01:17:25,594
And as we also observe, there's still time. We know that whether the event happens or not.

655
01:17:25,744 --> 01:17:35,614
Right? So, for example, if if I have a if I have at this arrival data like one, two, three, four plus.

656
01:17:35,644 --> 01:17:41,944
Right. Okay. So for the people with long, we know that we fully observe this event,

657
01:17:41,974 --> 01:17:52,773
which happens at the one year right now before that a full plus people we know what the T is greater than four and as we know here in this situation,

658
01:17:52,774 --> 01:17:56,734
delta is equal to one. Not how they are, right?

659
01:17:57,004 --> 01:18:01,624
Because in this situation, he actually is greater than Seattle.

660
01:18:02,154 --> 01:18:05,384
Okay. So that's why in this situation, we have an indicator.

661
01:18:05,404 --> 01:18:11,224
So in other words, four plus can also be coded as black for zero.

662
01:18:11,254 --> 01:18:15,294
Right. And then for that, one is going to be one.

663
01:18:15,304 --> 01:18:18,543
And what? Right. The first one here is the observe.

664
01:18:18,544 --> 01:18:26,374
So by the time the second one indicates that this event is fully observer MLK, we're good.

665
01:18:28,054 --> 01:18:40,354
Okay, so that's why I, I just caution that you before your ordinary statistic, of course, we use x side to denote y covariance, right?

666
01:18:40,714 --> 01:18:44,914
But here we use Exciter to denote our observable survival time.

667
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:50,734
So that's why we have to use the AI here to denote our our covariance.

668
01:18:52,444 --> 01:18:56,524
So a fundamental assumption here, we have to assume here.

669
01:18:57,034 --> 01:19:01,054
Let me just finish this and then we conclude that it's been quite a week.

670
01:19:02,494 --> 01:19:06,664
The key subject here is key. And to see it here are independent.

671
01:19:07,264 --> 01:19:15,274
So basically, we assume the of the center of time and the survival time here are totally independent.

672
01:19:15,994 --> 01:19:22,804
Unfortunately, this is not something you can use a statistical methods to test this assumption.

673
01:19:24,294 --> 01:19:32,394
What you can do here is usually out of hate. You would always ask, what is the cost of loss to follow up?

674
01:19:33,364 --> 01:19:36,594
Not so. I give you two scenarios.

675
01:19:38,644 --> 01:19:48,694
A patient. Patient lost a follow up because the patient decided the true treatment.

676
01:19:48,994 --> 01:19:52,924
The treatment is just too much for this patient to bear with his body.

677
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:57,004
His health cannot sustain the treatment. Okay.

678
01:19:57,154 --> 01:20:08,544
So the in this situation the center in time may will be related to the truth survival bible because the censoring is related to two films.

679
01:20:08,584 --> 01:20:16,624
Right. Or the the the patient that moved from Michigan to Hawaii and we lost track of this patient.

680
01:20:17,284 --> 01:20:22,164
Okay. Maybe lost. You know, not to Hawaii. May not be so health dependent.

681
01:20:22,204 --> 01:20:29,974
So in this situation, we may think that the sense around here is dependent, is independent from the true survival type.

682
01:20:30,334 --> 01:20:40,254
Okay. So that's why the cause of the censoring may be the only justification for whether the censoring years you depend on or not.

683
01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:47,104
So that's why this really requires some subject matter expertise or knowledge.

684
01:20:47,314 --> 01:20:54,454
It's not as it isn't. This is not something we can test by using our statistical knowledge.

685
01:20:54,784 --> 01:21:00,423
Okay. Okay. So I think actually, I'm I'm so here.

686
01:21:00,424 --> 01:21:05,914
I'm saying I'm down for first class, but I really feel bad for you can get to learn.

687
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:14,374
Look at our films with a hammer this time and then just look at our first one and I'll see you on Thursday.

688
01:21:18,334 --> 01:21:18,714
Mr.
