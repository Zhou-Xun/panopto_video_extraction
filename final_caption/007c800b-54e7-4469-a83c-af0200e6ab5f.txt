1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:07,460
True. Yeah. I mean, I didn't like them.

2
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,750
Yeah. Okay.

3
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:41,950
I guess that's what I got to go. Yeah, I, I.

4
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:51,880
I don't know. I just. It's a one. I.

5
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,770
I think. The fundraiser.

6
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,080
Before we get started. Before we get started.

7
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,650
If there's anybody from group eight.

8
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,740
Oh, yeah. If there's anybody from Group eight, make sure you share it with me.

9
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:05,850
Or maybe have it loaded on to a jump drive. Anyone from Group eight?

10
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:24,140
Google wants to entice people. So if there's anybody from Group eight, either share it with me or watch email with someone that.

11
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,160
At that. Oh. That's my maiden name.

12
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,139
No, it is my original. You missed email when I came here in 1997.

13
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:42,070
So that's my perfect. Yes. You used my proper email, but I just have to log in, that's all.

14
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,940
Uh, better. Doo doo doo doo doo. Oh. I should be able to do that.

15
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,670
Oh. Here's.

16
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:17,250
Come on earlier. Okay.

17
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,490
Okay. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

18
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:35,090
I'm sure. My pleasure.

19
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:50,750
Well, I guess we can actually go ahead and get started. Yeah.

20
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,470
Yeah, but. But, you know, I first. Yeah.

21
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:02,890
So when when. After the second.

22
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:12,190
Yeah. I will bring all that back to you. 44 in a row.

23
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,230
Yeah. Yeah. All right.

24
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:24,920
Here we are. Second day of presentations. So today.

25
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:35,630
Today we have on the list group five, group four, and group eight.

26
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:45,550
Um, let's see. So for the groups, you'll find your presentation on one of these taps.

27
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,790
So. And let's see. Anything else?

28
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,290
Um. Yeah, that's about it.

29
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,860
When Group four presents their second, we're gonna give them our attention in the back.

30
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:05,730
But other than that, we will be doing things just as we did on Tuesday.

31
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:15,130
Yes. No.

32
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,030
No. I will put the grade on canvas. Now.

33
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:29,040
Any other questions? All right.

34
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,680
So I will get out the way for group five.

35
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:42,910
Yeah, that's about it. I'm like, What else do I need to do? Oh, yeah.

36
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,630
Just a reminder. I'll lift up the five minute and the one minute warning.

37
00:05:47,410 --> 00:06:08,720
Mm. She's like a double check.

38
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,180
Electric Blue Tigers are. I notice.

39
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:38,470
I just. Think we're past?

40
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:46,170
Probably. I'm not sure. I think just a lot like I.

41
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,700
One of everybody. Good to go. Just let me know when you work out.

42
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,870
Okay, cool. Ready to go? All right. Hi, everyone.

43
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:08,439
My name is Meredith, and I worked on this project with Cindy, Tabitha, Hadia and Sarah and ZoÃ©, and we just wanted to make a little PSA.

44
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,490
Today is World AIDS Day, and we're going to be talking about HIV today.

45
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:19,749
So here we go. We planned it. Yeah. So first we're going to run through the introduction and the evaluation design

46
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,140
data collection methods and then the data analysis and dissemination plan.

47
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:29,670
So first for the introduction. First and foremost, what is HIV?

48
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,909
It's human immunodeficiency virus.

49
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:37,910
And I want you all to know that it can be transmitted in multiple, multiple different ways through blood, vaginal fluids, breast milk.

50
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:48,100
Pre seminal fluid rectal fluids and semen. And I want to point out this graph here on the right, you can see that since the 1980s in Michigan,

51
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,010
HIV transmission rates and acquisition rates have gone down substantially.

52
00:07:52,390 --> 00:08:00,879
The lines almost at zero. But it's important to note that there are people living with HIV in Michigan, in Michigan, who have not yet been detected.

53
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,000
And that's why the You Can Write program exist, which I will explain in a moment.

54
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:15,500
So our problem statement is that in 2021, there were a reported 17,870 people living with HIV in Michigan.

55
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,370
And HIV testing needs to be increased in southeast Michigan.

56
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:25,760
The purpose statement is you can press the the purpose of the you can read program

57
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:31,250
is to increase access to HIV testing to finance people in southeast Michigan.

58
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:40,970
And our program description is that because MDH, the MDA, HHS you can write program is run throughout organizations across the state.

59
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,340
We are assessing that you can ride program through one of these community partner organizations,

60
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,090
Unified HIV Health and Beyond, which is based in Detroit and Ypsilanti.

61
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,879
Unified brings that you can write program to community events all across Southeast Michigan,

62
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,880
including Summer Pride events, HIV awareness walks back to school events, drag shows, conferences, and more.

63
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:13,470
Here's just a little snapshot of our logic model. To be clear, we just we this is an adaptation from Unified Logic model that they made for the MDH.

64
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:21,620
As a few key highlights, I wanted to point out we had multiple inputs and funders like the Ryan White Center, the CDC.

65
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,090
As far as participation goes, we're looking for around 500 participants.

66
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:34,430
And then the red boxes here highlight some of the evaluation questions that we will discuss next.

67
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:47,370
I'm going to come up here. I'm not going to find out everything. All right.

68
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:52,950
So we really wanted first we'll talk about our process evaluation questions and their corresponding indicators.

69
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,149
But before I get into that,

70
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:59,970
we just want to highlight that these process evaluation questions and indicators are really reach focused because as we know,

71
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:06,270
HIV disproportionately impacts folks of color and folks in marginalized groups that are hardly reached.

72
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:12,239
So with that in mind, we wanted to first assess what the social what are the social media and advertisement

73
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,980
strategies that have been utilized and how have these efforts increased our program's reach?

74
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,650
And so we'll be assessing that using assessment data.

75
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:28,140
So we'll be looking at the number of social media posts in 2022 compared to 2021 and our ad campaigns compared to those two years.

76
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,540
And then our second process evaluation question is where did our participants learn about the You Can Write program?

77
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:39,200
So our survey data, we will collect directly by asking, how did you learn about the program?

78
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:44,220
And we'll talk a little bit more a bit later about those success data for these evaluation questions.

79
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,070
All right. So we have some outcome evaluation questions.

80
00:10:51,460 --> 00:11:00,540
One was what percentage of people were tested who had been previously tested before, who had not been sorry for HIV?

81
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:05,320
And then the second one is what percentage of program participants were adherent?

82
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:15,280
We're sorry. Participants on Art and Prep were adherent to their medication during their follow up appointments after the bubble testing.

83
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:22,600
And the third is to what extent do the staff maintain knowledge of the You Can Ride program,

84
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:30,100
including HIV testing protocols at six months after the six month and after also 12 months to.

85
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,030
All right. And then we wanted to look at the indicators.

86
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:40,660
So first one would be, could we what we would want to count the individuals who had been previously tested.

87
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,610
And it's like it would be the rate of participants who were compliant.

88
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:52,329
And the third would be number of staff who during the protocol, the HIV protocol role play demonstration,

89
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:57,250
they would demonstrate less than two errors in the six months time frame.

90
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,360
And then at the 12 month time frame, it would only be one error.

91
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:14,770
Um, so the design we chose was the pre experimental, one group post-test and we had three observations post experiment.

92
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,550
And the reason we chose this was because we had a relatively relatively large sample size.

93
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:29,950
It was low cost and it was a short time frame. So we were doing time of intervention, six month and 12 month post.

94
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:37,270
And we also wanted to capture the prevalence rate so this would be an optimal design to use.

95
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:43,149
And the limitations with this is some threats to internal and external validity

96
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:48,610
and also because we're observing both outcome and exposure at the same time.

97
00:12:51,510 --> 00:13:02,459
So next, we'll discuss our data collection methods. So the inclusion criteria for evaluation is individuals over the age of 18 who are living in

98
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,230
southeast Michigan are unaware of the current HIV status and are at risk of contracting HIV.

99
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,210
We will use two methods to sample this population. The first is a non probability convenient sample.

100
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,349
Non probability sampling does not utilize random selection,

101
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:22,050
so each individual in a population of interest has an unknown probability of being chosen to participate in the evaluation.

102
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:28,650
Although this is a threat to our external validity, this approach is most appropriate for our design because it's efficient,

103
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:34,980
inexpensive, and with such a large population of interest, it will allow us to sample the greatest number of eligible individuals.

104
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,440
We will use this method to sample individuals who are at the program and are actively using the services.

105
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:47,160
Posters with a QR code will be distributed throughout the mobile unit, allowing individuals to learn more about the evaluation and participate.

106
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,740
HIV test counselors who are working in the mobile unit will also share with the participants

107
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,100
about our evaluation and share with them a flier if they would like to participate.

108
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,510
The other form of sampling will use this snowball sampling.

109
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:04,850
This form of non probability sampling is advantageous in sampling, hardly rich populations,

110
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,090
stigmatized populations, and those include people living with HIV.

111
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,069
We will use this sampling method by asking individuals in our convenient sample who fill out

112
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:17,450
the survey to share the QR code with individuals they know have used services in the past.

113
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,999
Our qualitative data collection will consist of two different data types assessment

114
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,750
data from the You Can program and survey data from the program participants.

115
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,530
The assessment data from the program will be gathered from the You can write

116
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:36,010
program records and documentation to obtain objective data about the program.

117
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:41,890
The data will be collected at the first observation timepoint and include questions about number of program attendees,

118
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:48,370
number of HIV tests administered, number of positive HIV tests, the number of social media post and advertisements.

119
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:53,499
Location of the services and communities reached the survey program participants will allow

120
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,880
us to assess the participants subjective experiences and satisfaction with the program.

121
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:05,320
This data will also be collected that at first post observation time point through a self-administered electronic survey and include questions

122
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:11,620
about overall satisfaction of the program report accessibility if and how many times they have been tested by HIV through the program.

123
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:17,919
If they had been tested for HIV outside the program, if they received HIV counseling, adherence to art and prep,

124
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,650
and where they learned about the program, individuals who complete the survey will be compensated with a $10 gift card.

125
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,000
For qualitative data.

126
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:36,489
We ended up deciding on focus groups, and this was for a couple of reasons because our participation population would be 500 people.

127
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:40,390
That's very large. Doing individual interviews for that would be difficult.

128
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:46,810
We're also hoping to use the focus groups to expand on our surveys that were administered before.

129
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:52,060
To incentivize participation, we'd be giving out $25 gift certificates.

130
00:15:52,630 --> 00:16:00,459
And we recognized that while those in the HIV community are rather open about talking about HIV, not everyone is.

131
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,290
So that is a slight limitation.

132
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:10,120
Having a focus group that not everyone would want to discuss, among others, just some basic breakdowns of our focus group.

133
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,839
It would be six months and 12 months post intervention and we would have separate groups for staff and participants.

134
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:23,140
So try to minimize any sort of power dynamics and then we can ask specifically tailored questions to each group.

135
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:30,760
We're hoping to gain insight on participation, participant experiences, concerns, expectations and areas for growth.

136
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:38,440
So next, we'll go over how to analyze the collected data and disseminate the finding to our invested parties.

137
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,989
For our data analysis, we will use them with in-group design by comparing the participant answers from the

138
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,830
baseline surveys to their answers and the focus groups at time points two and three.

139
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:52,360
Our quantitative data includes descriptive questions from the assessment data,

140
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,960
which will use frequency distributions and measures of dispersion to analyze.

141
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,559
And then there's inferential questions from the participant survey that will use

142
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,930
paired t test and mixed effects linear regression to analyze the qualitative data.

143
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:12,969
First and foremost, we want to transcribe the recordings into a written document so that they are able to search easier access for that.

144
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:24,220
And then we would go on to code body language responses into major themes and then go on to interpret those themes in context.

145
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,179
The standards that we'll use to compare the evaluation findings to determine

146
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,139
whether the intervention was successful is based on the organization's values,

147
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,620
expectations and norms that are indicated in the in the logic model.

148
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:41,140
And the next few slides will map our questions to the indicators and the success standards.

149
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,560
All right. So we've got these questions in these indicators, but how are we?

150
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:56,930
What's the standard that we're holding them to? So first, with social media comparing 2021 to 2022, that's pretty easy.

151
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:05,480
Well, look, we're looking for at least a 10% increase in the amount of social media posts and presence as well as ad campaigns.

152
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,790
So that will be a very simple calculation of how much compared 2021 to 2022.

153
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:17,570
Unfortunately, our second question is a little bit more complicated when thinking about the success standard.

154
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:23,600
As I said before, we really want these questions to be reach focused and reach centered.

155
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,190
So we decided that the standard for which we would look at this question was having

156
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:33,650
participants report a diverse area and avenues from which they're learning about the program.

157
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:40,160
We will also use this question to ascertain what groups are we not reaching and what avenues are not working.

158
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:49,360
So for our upcoming evaluation, we were looking at 3 to 3 questions.

159
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:55,570
The first, we were looking at the percentage of people who were being tested for HIV for the first time.

160
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:01,600
And our indicator was the count of people who had not been previously tested.

161
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,350
And our standard was to get about 40% of first timers.

162
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:15,940
Our second evaluation or outcome evaluation question looked at the percentage of individuals who were compliant with their either R prep therapies.

163
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:22,540
And so the indicator was the rate of participants. And we were looking about 30% of complaints from smokers.

164
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:28,720
Lastly, we wanted to look at the extent that staff retained their knowledge.

165
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:38,350
And so indicator, we said, was demonstrating less than two areas at six month or less than one area at 12 months.

166
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,940
And our standard was 90% of staff demonstrates those.

167
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:57,809
Okay. So, ah, so first and foremost, I want to say that there wasn't really room in this presentation to share this information,

168
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:01,950
but I wanted you to know that people living with HIV can live long,

169
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:09,930
beautiful, healthy, happy lives if they regularly take their antiretroviral therapy and regularly see their medical provider.

170
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,799
HIV is not a death sentence, and it doesn't have to be something that's scary.

171
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,820
But there's still so much stigma surrounding HIV and we need to change that.

172
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:23,700
So thank you for letting us have this conversation with you here today. So my ask for you is to get tested.

173
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:30,750
And the reason I say that is because 15 to 29 year olds are the highest risk age group for acquiring HIV.

174
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:41,159
And the American American Medical Association recommendation is that a person get tested once in their lifetime for HIV.

175
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,870
And I think that that's bogus. And I say that as an HIV test counselor,

176
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:53,730
I work in Wolverine Wellness on Mondays from 1 to 3 p.m. I do completely confidential testing and I encourage you all to sign up.

177
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:57,870
It's 100% free. We don't ask for insurance. It's super quick. It's just a finger prick.

178
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,010
And then you know your status and I encourage you to continue getting tested

179
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,700
regularly if you're a sexually active individual or you're an injection drug user.

180
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:15,930
So thank you for letting me do that. PSA Our dissemination plan is to share these results with unified HIV health and beyond.

181
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,770
MDA, HHS You Can Ride program the Ryan White Center, a key funder as well as the CDC, another key funder.

182
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:34,100
And that is our presentation. So.

183
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,440
Jackie. Okay.

184
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:45,740
A question regarding. On social media advertising since there are so many.

185
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:54,140
The thing that I was curious also have a great number of shares.

186
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:06,060
Yeah, absolutely. That's a great question. So we did talk about engagement.

187
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,690
We didn't talk about money spent. That's a great avenue that we could explore.

188
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,729
But in terms of engagement,

189
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:23,040
we ultimately decided to look at our what we were outputting into social media as a way to evaluate our efforts and see if that was working,

190
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:29,310
if that makes sense, to see how much we were posting, and then connecting that data to how folks learned about the program.

191
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,250
So it would be useful to know if people are interacting with our material,

192
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:39,810
but we're more so trying to look at how much are we posting and how many of our friends are learning about the program through social media,

193
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:44,370
which we felt looking at the posts and how folks learned about it was a more sustainable way to.

194
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,810
As I say, I will note in the logic model we did include that we were looking for a 10% increase in engagement.

195
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,229
However, just for this presentation and like the scope of the paper,

196
00:22:55,230 --> 00:23:05,490
we didn't discuss it back to us and say that would be a fantastic subsequent evaluation to be like this one to focus on increasing number.

197
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,850
Next evaluation is like increasing engagement with great focus.

198
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,220
Taking notes on what we're going to add to the list gives us.

199
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,810
So my question is actually a follow up. Can I get to it?

200
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:30,940
So I wonder if you could say more about how you are using social media as part of your.

201
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:42,100
Knowing the representation I reached, can you say more about how you what things you would consider to ensure that the reach.

202
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,530
To marginalize populations that begin.

203
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:55,320
Ultimately the. Yeah, absolutely.

204
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:01,840
So there are a lot of partnerships that and DHS as well as unified has.

205
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:10,110
So utilizing those in terms of not just sharing on our platform but partnering with other organizations to share on the social media.

206
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:16,470
So being very strategic in terms of where we're sharing it, around what events, around what time points and what pages.

207
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,760
And also, as Meredith said, the critical ages are the highest risk.

208
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:27,960
Ages is 15 to 29. And as we know, social media is a really big avenue for that age group.

209
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:37,590
So that's kind of what we were thinking on those two. And are there particular social media platforms that you would focus on versus others?

210
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,810
Yeah. So Facebook is kind of where, if I'm not mistaken,

211
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:51,409
the big page is how's how we do know that in that age group, Facebook is kind of the lesser social media.

212
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:57,170
So Twitter and Instagram are the big ones. We haven't talked about Tik Tok, but that's.

213
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,810
I don't know if we're going to do any TikTok dances about HIV testing.

214
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,380
So probably Twitter and Twitter and Instagram are our main ones based on what age groups are most likely to use them.

215
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:16,239
Yeah. And just go off of that unified HIV Help and Beyond is a great partner with LGBT Detroit and other great sister organizations,

216
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,480
so they always collaborate with their posts and share each other's stuff.

217
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:26,110
So we'll definitely like have them reach out to have partner organizations share the information as well.

218
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:32,050
And in the survey that people were going to take after they get tested, there'll be a question that says, how did you hear about this?

219
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,770
And that's another way to evaluate, like, oh, they heard about it on social media,

220
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:57,480
or they heard about it from a friend who told them to look at the post. I have one more.

221
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:04,390
So. You would do the survey with.

222
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:10,300
People who have used the program.

223
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:17,080
Right. So what are some. Considerations that you would take to.

224
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,000
Reassure people's concerns about confidentiality, respect, he said.

225
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:34,230
Regarding the focus groups and I think also with the survey that people would be concerned, especially since there might be perceptions that.

226
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:39,100
To me. The survey and the test results.

227
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:44,050
Yeah, you are you. So have you thought about how you would?

228
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,300
Alleviate some of. I can speak to that as a current HIV test counselor.

229
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:53,480
We actually have a survey that goes out our pharmacy.

230
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,860
Those at the end of each test, the participants take the survey.

231
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:03,770
It's like we acknowledged at the beginning of the test and say, Hey, at the end of your test, we're going to fill out this survey.

232
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:09,440
You can do it by yourself. I can assist you filling out the survey. If you need assistance, I can type in your answers for you.

233
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,290
I can read the survey to you just to help guide you through the survey.

234
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:20,720
It only takes a couple of minutes and then your answers are confidential and that is a guarantee.

235
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:27,170
The email is only collected in the survey response to make sure people aren't filling it out more than once.

236
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:33,470
But other than that, it's confidential. Your email won't be shared with anyone, and we'll use that same practice with this survey as well.

237
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:39,280
Yeah, I'll just add one other thing. The survey, the questions on there, we make it clear that it's like self-reported,

238
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,220
like we're not going to check their medical records or their test results to verify any of their answers.

239
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,930
Like it's all self-reported. We're not going to tie it back to the milk worker and not take them off the record at all.

240
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,220
So the survey. Thank you.

241
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:07,730
Darren, have a great up here. And a family member died of AIDS.

242
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,170
So it's a personal issue to me. So thank you.

243
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:23,480
Thank you for. I reinforce the PSA. So our next group is presenting from the back and I'm going to give you the clicker.

244
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:27,200
You want both my microphone? Oh, yeah, that'd be great.

245
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,440
Yeah. Um, so we're gonna give them a few minutes to get set up from the back.

246
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:38,210
This is for right? Yes. Okay. Oh, I have to download it.

247
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:51,810
I'm not you know, it does make a difference as I mean, because like I said, I mean.

248
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:59,060
Oh. Oh, yeah. So that was, he said.

249
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,280
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I advice?

250
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,960
Yes. Oh, it's working.

251
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,770
Okay. Okay. That's fine. Can't we all.

252
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:24,510
Tess. I think so.

253
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,860
Hey. Hi, everyone.

254
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:37,049
Oh, yeah, it's really long. So we did our evaluation plan regarding safe centers,

255
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:44,100
Teen Choice Program and Safe House Center is a domestic violence and family law center in Washington County.

256
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:49,780
MRSA. Oh, I'm Sarah. I'm Julia.

257
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,790
I'm Joe. I'm Tamara. And I'm Davina.

258
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:08,400
And we're sitting we're back here because I can't get down the ramp and my wheelchair and I don't want to be alone up here.

259
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,820
So they're here in solidarity with me.

260
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,200
That's what's going on.

261
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:24,660
So Teen Voice is a program that focuses on reducing and eliminating and hopefully eventually eliminating the issue of teen dating violence,

262
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:28,260
which is a really prevalent issue in current American culture.

263
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:41,130
You can see where these statistics that we've found, one in four teens in dating relationships have reported being harassed, put down or called names.

264
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:50,790
Things that we could consider emotional abuse. One in 12 have experienced physical violence and one in eight have experienced sexual violence.

265
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:56,150
Those numbers are pretty big. I'm.

266
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,140
And in addition, when we're thinking through the public health lens,

267
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:10,420
this is even more of an issue because teen dating violence disproportionately affects bipoc disabled and low income adolescents.

268
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:22,980
These folks are. I'm just generally more at risk for experiencing teen dating violence for for a variety of reasons, but all public health related.

269
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:32,220
Additionally, there's all this stigma around sexual violence, dating, violence, abuse, etc.,

270
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:42,990
and that real or perceived judgment definitely impacts the reporting that happens the reported incidents.

271
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:51,390
So the the statistics that we have that we're working with are probably significantly lower than the actual true incidence,

272
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,660
which no one can really estimate because people are keeping secrets, and rightfully so.

273
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:08,730
Survivors of teen dating violence are at a significantly increased risk for a variety of negative health outcomes which are listed here.

274
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,430
And this isn't just like over time.

275
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,360
It's also like within their relationship, within other relationships,

276
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:27,090
it's like a whole lifetime of negative health outcomes that can happen resulting from the experience of one.

277
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:44,020
Violent experience in a dating relationship. Even though it's so prevalent, public health has essentially ignored the issue for the majority of time.

278
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:58,150
It wasn't until 2013, so not even ten years ago that the National Youth Risk Behavior Survey, which is a CDC nationwide survey that goes out that.

279
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,670
Gets us all the statistics that we have to work with.

280
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:14,220
It wasn't until about ten years ago that there is even any sort of question about dating violence or non intercourse related sexual violence.

281
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:21,650
Michigan State that we're in the state that teen voice operates in, in addition to most states,

282
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:31,640
has no legislation regarding teen dating violence, which means that at least legally, a lot of survivors aren't getting the help they need.

283
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:38,770
Perpetrators aren't getting consequences. And this can be for a variety of reasons.

284
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:48,820
But one of the things that has been that data has been gathered about is that many adults just simply don't believe it's a very significant problem,

285
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:55,230
whether it's because they don't see it or they believe that it's happening out there,

286
00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:02,860
not to them and their kid, they just don't see it as something that we really need to do anything about,

287
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:10,220
which means that there aren't very many prevention interventions out there and what policies do exist.

288
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,520
We can think of things like Title nine and other policies within schools or other institutions.

289
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:20,110
They often make reporting more difficult or even dangerous.

290
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:30,350
So things really need to change. So as you rightly explained, so this is a rising public health concern.

291
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:35,839
So that is why we have the Safe Harbor Center coming up with a pilot education program which

292
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:40,490
basically aims to spread awareness about sexual assault and dating violence among teens.

293
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,240
So this peer education program called the Teen Wise Program,

294
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:50,779
is based off of a peer education model, which does not have any according to the literature.

295
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:53,420
There's not a theory from which it comes from.

296
00:34:53,780 --> 00:35:02,540
However, the definition and application of the peer education model is from preexisting frameworks that have been proven to be very effective.

297
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:08,569
Why so? It's mainly because adolescents are likely to change their behavior if they have

298
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:12,290
role models who are similar to them or faces the same concerns as they do.

299
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:21,920
And this sort of there's this shared affinity between the educator and the educated, which is not limited to age, gender or race.

300
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,270
So the peer education model is based off of four behavioral theories.

301
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:30,650
The first one is the theory of reasoned action, which suggests that peer education,

302
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:38,810
peer educators can affirm or remove or decipher how they oppose, might view a positive or negative result for a behavior.

303
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:45,920
And then we have the social inoculation theory, which suggests that some unhealthy behaviors are reinforced by social pressure.

304
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:52,580
And then we have the help believe model and trans theoretical model from which we take the principles of fear education,

305
00:35:52,760 --> 00:36:03,830
which involves reinforcement and empowerment. Some of the the previously tested education models are dating mothers, Dean Empower and Teen Pep.

306
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:09,470
So all of these point towards creating awareness about sexual health and youth violence.

307
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:16,080
Mental and physical violence. Then we have what is the purpose behind our evaluation?

308
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:22,139
So we want to give our stakeholders the information that that revolves around the planning,

309
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:28,620
cost effectiveness and delivery methods of this particular program in order to fund, promote and propagate the program.

310
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,149
So like I mentioned earlier,

311
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:39,780
the whole point is to increase the awareness of sexual assault and dating violence and also to do increase the comfort of discussing such issues.

312
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:48,630
And we want to give them a space where we provide them with resources pertaining to interpersonal violence and so on to our logic model.

313
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:55,379
The problem that the program seeks to address is that there is some percentage of youth in Washtenaw County who experience dating violence

314
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:04,170
before the age of 18 and who don't think that adults understand what it's like to date and as a young person in their generation,

315
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:10,530
the context of in which the program exists and in which our evaluation plan exists is

316
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:14,879
that Safe House has provided services and educational programing about dating violence,

317
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,790
as well as other forms of gender based violence in Washtenaw County.

318
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:22,650
For some number of years that we do not know and a percent of youth in Washtenaw County

319
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:26,670
either attend a public school or are involved in extracurricular youth programing,

320
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,300
which is where the teen voice program typically takes place.

321
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,850
And so here's our entire logic model, and I'll just highlight some of the outcomes that we're focused on.

322
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:40,200
And so there are kind of two big goals of our outcomes.

323
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:45,120
One is to increase involvement and engagement with the Teen Voice Program and Safe House.

324
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:52,710
And the other is long term or longer term outcomes associated with healthier engagement with dating.

325
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:57,420
So two two of our short term outcomes are a percentage of program participants.

326
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,660
Sign up to learn more about Safe House and volunteer opportunities,

327
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:08,010
as well as a percentage of program participants report that they learned new information about dating violence and where to seek help.

328
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:15,450
And then, as for long term, some percentage of program participants engage in dating, violence, education and volunteering.

329
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:19,500
And then some percentage of program participants self-report,

330
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,390
continued engagement and healthy communication with partners after receiving the program.

331
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:37,889
So on to our process evaluation questions. And for our process evaluation, we really wanted to help the host site safe center to understand,

332
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:41,820
you know, what are the current intervention delivery methods? How are they effective?

333
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:49,830
Are they effective in reaching the focal populations and how many participants express interest and becoming a peer educator?

334
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:54,510
We also wanted to stand more about TV staff, TV being Teen Voice.

335
00:38:55,140 --> 00:39:04,110
That's the abbreviation TV staff and the ways in which they communicate program goals and content during the peer educated,

336
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:12,929
the peer educator training. And this is completely super important because ultimately it will be teens again,

337
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:16,860
peers delivering this programing and this information to other peers.

338
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:23,910
And lastly, we wanted to understand a little bit more about what challenges exist in program delivery.

339
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:31,860
So is the program session similar or different depending on like the venue,

340
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:37,410
the school, the students that are in the audience and things of that nature?

341
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:46,340
So far, our process evaluation, we had a few objectives, as you can see on the screen.

342
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:50,570
We really wanted to identify the current participant facilitator demographics.

343
00:39:50,870 --> 00:40:01,520
Again, to get at who are participating in these programs, who is interested, and then ultimately who goes on to become a peer educator.

344
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:14,610
Again. We wanted to. Assess the current training strategies and communication methods to better understand what facilitation and

345
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:21,900
structuring methods were being used and ultimately get at the question of what makes a good peer educator.

346
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,249
Next, we wanted to assess and streamline programed fidelity measures.

347
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:35,830
So understanding what? Makes a good curriculum and understanding how it could be reckless or sorry,

348
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,470
how it can be duplicated for other communities and other schools and other counties,

349
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,950
because currently the same boys program only runs in Washtenaw County.

350
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:55,540
And lastly, we wanted to understand factors as participants satisfaction to the extent in which content is applicable to self in daily life,

351
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,690
the accessibility and the transparency of information,

352
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:08,050
trust between the participant and peer educator and interactivity all affect participation and satisfaction.

353
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:13,809
The last question and Sarah will go into this later about our data collection methods,

354
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:20,680
but the last question will ask after the intervention is Are you interested in becoming a peer educator?

355
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:32,250
So next are outcome evaluation questions, which are mostly targeting whether change is sustained over time,

356
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:37,770
either in sort of rates of teen dating violence and healthy relationships,

357
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:46,230
as well as sustaining the program or targeting sort of the number of teens that are interested in being peer educators for the program.

358
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:52,680
So did the youth who participated in Teen Voice report increased interest in participation in teen voice volunteer activities?

359
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:59,669
What aspects of the program were most effective to them? Did the participants of the Teen Voice program show an increase in knowledge and awareness

360
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:03,749
about sexual assault and dating violence as compared to non participants in Washtenaw County?

361
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,340
And was this sustained over time?

362
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:11,370
And then lastly, is there a decrease in reported teen dating violence in Michigan counties that participated in teen voice?

363
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:20,790
And so our outcome, evaluation, design and plan try to get at that long term outcome.

364
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,450
And so as shown on tomorrow's slide briefly,

365
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:34,500
we'll have a test or we'll have survey and conversations take place before engaging with the program and then at multiple points after,

366
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:38,490
we imagine it being about six months after. So that would go on for about a year and a half.

367
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:44,340
And then the objectives I won't repeat, but they each address the questions that Julia just mentioned.

368
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:55,100
For our evaluation, we're going to take a non probability approach to sampling using specifically the quota sampling method.

369
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:03,259
We're hoping that this is going to allow for long term greater opportunity is for

370
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:07,960
generalizability because it's going to allow for the greatest level of equity.

371
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:16,280
As we're gathering information, we're going to be gathering information equally across different ages,

372
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:22,150
genders, socio economic classes, etc. and therefore not be.

373
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:30,100
Not be seeing the the data skewed by any of those demographics.

374
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,910
We have a lot of data points we're trying to collect.

375
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:40,059
So for the process, evaluation will be primarily using survey data to collect, as was said before,

376
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:43,330
descriptive data concerning the participants themselves, but also attendance.

377
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:50,950
And then more categorical, Likert is continuous. If you want to argue that scales to collect data on assessment of the programing themselves,

378
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:56,229
the session debriefings will be specifically for the peer mentors and relevant facilitators

379
00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:01,059
and administrators of the Teen Voice Program to discuss questions around communication,

380
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:05,050
efficacy of the programing materials themselves and the administration of it at the event.

381
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:09,909
This will be primarily recorded through note taking for analysis later and then

382
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:13,719
secondary data concerning the school administrative records and preexisting

383
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:18,280
school partnerships that the program already has will be used to further support

384
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,490
the characteristics of the population participant population themselves.

385
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:28,870
For the outcome evaluation, we start to integrate more qualitative methodology to explore the broader themes around behavior change,

386
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:31,600
attitude change and knowledge change. Regarding teen dating violence,

387
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:41,020
we will still use survey data for comparison with the process of evaluation as well as to follow up on knowledge change and then secondary data as

388
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:48,220
well from the CDC Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System to look at teen dating violence changes at the county level within Washtenaw County.

389
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:56,070
For the analysis. This will be a within groups comparison with two primary populations to analyze

390
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:00,750
the participants themselves and the peer mentors for the quantitative data.

391
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,820
Once again, that's primarily survey data.

392
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:12,090
And because we're collecting both descriptive bivariate and continuous data, we have multiple analyzes we can conduct for the qualitative data.

393
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:18,059
The section debriefings from the process evaluations will primarily be looked at to identify broad themes,

394
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:25,410
and then the interviews and focus groups for the outcome evaluation will be transcribed and a deductive coding schema will be used

395
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:32,460
to create a codebook which is essentially using the themes identified from the indicators for the process and outcome evaluation.

396
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:41,479
And then for the validity and limitations, the majority of our validity issues come from our lack of a comparison group,

397
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:46,310
except for the threat to attrition and concerning limitations or weaknesses of our programing.

398
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:49,850
The generalizability of this at best is specific to Washtenaw County,

399
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:57,070
but more likely specific to the schools within which we conduct the evaluation and then the timing.

400
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,260
We acknowledge that we are trying to collect a lot of data and using a lot

401
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:03,740
of different methods that could create issues in the data analysis timeline.

402
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:15,020
So I'm thinking about dissemination, but also the program evaluation in general, who are invested parties and primary users of the evaluation.

403
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:19,579
So this includes Ann Arbor High School administrators, SafeHouse Center Board of Directors,

404
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:24,860
Safe House Donors and Funding Partners, program administrators for Teen Voice in Ann Arbor.

405
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:31,459
Adolescents and Parents. And then this is summarized here.

406
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:37,970
So we have different sort of methods of dissemination based on different goals for disseminating those findings.

407
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:45,350
So on the far left, you have all our invested parties and then moving from left to right, we have like detailed written reports,

408
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:51,709
summary reports of infographics, in-person presentations and social media posts not restricted just to Instagram.

409
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:55,280
But I was trying to come up with cute little icons, so I picked that one.

410
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:06,799
And yeah, so your educators would mainly be disseminated results in order to recruit new people to engage in the teen voice programs.

411
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,680
That would mainly be through social media posts.

412
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:20,210
Parents will only receive sort of summary reports or infographics and same thing with safehouse center donors and funding partners more detailed.

413
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:24,620
So the detailed report, summary reports and in-person presentations will be given to school administrators,

414
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:29,719
program administrators and the board of directors in order to sort of gain and maintain support.

415
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,500
And also specifically talk about the effectiveness and efficiency of the teen voice program.

416
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:40,910
And then current peer educators will kind of just receive summary reports and in-person presentations during training.

417
00:47:43,230 --> 00:48:02,110
And that's it. So I know that if you go back to the.

418
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:16,590
The flight. The flight that. So I know that you do want to measure the.

419
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:25,950
This audit came to my. That would be just.

420
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:33,799
Yes. So that would be the the National Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, which Joe mentioned.

421
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:39,110
So starting in 2013, they did include there's a few questions about just experiencing,

422
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:44,929
I think like emotional and physical violence and then specifically sexual violence in dating relationships.

423
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:48,080
And that's a survey that is regularly given to.

424
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:53,100
I think high schoolers in like nationally throughout the country.

425
00:48:53,910 --> 00:49:00,000
Did you all as a group discuss. All other options like.

426
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:14,580
Not because we were trying to focus as much as possible on.

427
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:25,090
From. And then it was kind of like we did in the grand scheme a lot.

428
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:40,120
Plus, when we acknowledge issues with reporting, the further we go down in like level or the I guess further,

429
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:45,460
I don't know what direction we're going, but as like consequences get bigger,

430
00:49:47,350 --> 00:50:03,250
the the numbers get less and less accurate and essentially like the number of people who actually like report experiencing teen dating violence

431
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:11,890
is going to be higher than the number of people who have experienced teen dating violence and then actually like press charges against anyone.

432
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:18,040
And that number is going to be much higher than the number of people who actually

433
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:25,209
have like charges like are actually like found guilty and receive consequences.

434
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:33,940
So really like the the biggest impact is going to be further upstream.

435
00:50:42,580 --> 00:51:04,720
But since they are. So like you, as you said, it's difficult to really control for that because we need their consent.

436
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:11,200
Hopefully we'll address it through the privacy of the that's why we have both focus groups and separate structured interviews.

437
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,589
So that way there is a space because, you know, you have to disclose to the parents, obviously,

438
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:17,980
that they're going to be participating in the study, but you don't necessarily have to disclose.

439
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:21,640
You know, we're going to ask your child specifically about this instance or.

440
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:29,290
So rather than trying to tackle again. How you control information provided to the parents.

441
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:39,190
We'd rather provide more options for how the youth can choose to tell us if they want about their specific experiences with teen dating violence.

442
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:45,160
It's also the program is really based on kind of our prevention model.

443
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:51,310
And so a lot of the curriculum in education is really around promoting healthy relationships, right?

444
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:58,350
Figuring out how to problem solve and figuring out conflict resolution within dynamics.

445
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:07,040
And so. We're not specifically asking you have you explore, you know, have you experienced sexual assault?

446
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:16,340
Have you been harassed? Anything like that? What we're looking at again with our partner team voice is who comes to the presentations,

447
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:21,379
who then feels empowered to also go and teach the information and the skills that they

448
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:29,260
gained during the workshop to other students and then moving forward in that way.

449
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:34,399
And so we're looking at we're really ultimately evaluating is this prevention because the program is

450
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:40,280
really based on prevention and also thinking about having conversations about the socio ecological,

451
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:49,220
environmental issues that impact students and why they may commit violence and assault.

452
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:58,670
Right. And so that can be, as Joe mentioned, income, race, ethnicity, you know, experiences of violence in their household.

453
00:52:58,910 --> 00:52:59,990
So many different things.

454
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:10,040
But yeah, we're not asking for individual stories, but definitely it was is more so trying to understand how students are being reached,

455
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:19,910
how this can become normalized to talk about because again, this is extremely taboo, which is why we have a lot of our surveys, you know, anonymous.

456
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:27,210
Yeah. Oh, go ahead.

457
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:42,320
Yeah, I just want to nominate. I was just kind of wondering.

458
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:52,310
Why? Your value to think about. Like Are they going to send?

459
00:53:55,050 --> 00:54:03,450
Yeah. Now, that's a great question. I think ultimately because again, for the teen voice program, the youth are the deliverers of the program.

460
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:08,220
And so during this evaluation process, they are our primary stakeholders.

461
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:15,180
And so we're going to be working with them throughout the evaluation process to better understand, again, what makes this program work.

462
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:22,230
What are some areas of improvement and how, you know, they can move forward?

463
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:29,010
Yeah, and it wouldn't be. I think when I was sort of thinking about this, it wouldn't be the the entire evaluation plan,

464
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:36,780
but it might be like some statistics around effectiveness and it would mostly just be targeted towards teens who had gone

465
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:43,740
through the program and were maybe interested in preventing teen dating violence or promoting healthy relationships.

466
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:49,260
So it wouldn't be like the complete report or anything like detailed around the evaluation findings.

467
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:56,729
Mostly just like this is what it is and these are some of the findings from it and why it's effective or how it's effective and the things that people

468
00:54:56,730 --> 00:55:01,110
identified through surveys as being beneficial to them in the hopes that that

469
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:04,800
would reach people that might be interested in participating and then signing up.

470
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,930
I also think to your point, and as you have in the dissemination plan,

471
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:15,150
the dissemination, we haven't broken up into different types of products because,

472
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:22,290
again, we want to make sure that the outcomes and the results of the evaluation are geared towards specific audiences.

473
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:29,730
So the results that we prepare for, you know, the parents or the and the funders might look completely different.

474
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:44,260
Now I'm working my way through.

475
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:49,280
Yes, it is. Yeah. Staples is typical family. Okay.

476
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:53,530
I just want to know why not. Oh, yeah, I haven't.

477
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,890
Yeah. Oh, yeah. He's going to quit.

478
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:30,890
Okay, so Justin looks like Jenny forgets on this, or it is my assistant here and here.

479
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:48,070
Okay. Yeah. So we're just here to say you have to laugh.

480
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:52,440
Was like a. This.

481
00:56:53,270 --> 00:57:01,479
I think you're good. I. Hey.

482
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:05,080
So we're ready. Good morning, everyone.

483
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:08,860
Today we're going to be discussing the Healthy Living Ambassador program evaluation.

484
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:12,150
My name is Mikayla Connor. I'm Jenny.

485
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:16,060
Kaia playing Cecily. Carolyn.

486
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:22,140
Okay. So here is an overview of what we're going to be talking about today.

487
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:27,000
We're going to start with a brief overview of the social problem, then move on to our logic model,

488
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:33,690
our evaluation design, data collection plan, data analysis, and data standards, and then our dissemination summary.

489
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,390
So beginning with the social problem,

490
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:45,490
rates of childhood obesity in the United States are exacerbated by disparities in healthy access to food and safe recreational spaces.

491
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,850
And childhood obesity in the United States is also on the rise.

492
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:55,000
Children from low income backgrounds are disproportionately impacted and experience higher rates of obesity.

493
00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:00,669
The Healthy Living Ambassador program plans to utilize high school students as

494
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:05,260
teen ambassadors to facilitate a garden based curriculum in San Mateo County,

495
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:12,309
California. This eight week program plans to increase elementary students ability to choose healthier foods by

496
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:18,640
using teen ambassadors as influencers and educators of healthy diet and nutritional practices.

497
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:28,180
So we'll dive a little bit into our logic model. So we have listed our inputs, activities and outputs and also our outcomes.

498
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:31,089
We as a group decided to focus on our short term outcomes,

499
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:37,540
which are listed as the percent of students will increase in knowledge among the target groups regarding nutritional variety and intake.

500
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:45,580
The percent of students will have an initial change of attitude, skills and aspirations concerning concerning gardening and healthy eating.

501
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:50,020
And the percent of students will have a developed relationship of trust with the target population.

502
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:58,050
Now I'll be discussing the process evaluation aspect of our evaluation design.

503
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:07,920
So for our first process evaluation question, we would like to understand the extent to mentors have adequate support to facilitate the curriculum.

504
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:12,480
One of the most useful process indicators to address this topic is to ask

505
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:17,220
mentors if the support they receive to carry out the curriculum was sufficient.

506
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:24,360
Another helpful process indicator is acquiring the number of teams that mentors report having access to as a

507
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:29,340
point person to whom they could ask questions or raise concerns regarding the facilitation of the curriculum.

508
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:39,240
Lastly, data surrounding the number of point persons available for team mentors to contact will be collected for a second process evaluation question.

509
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:44,010
We will investigate the teen mentors. We will investigate 15 mentors.

510
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:47,430
Maintain the eight week sequencing of curriculum activities.

511
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:52,320
First, we will obtain the number of teen mentors that adhere to the curriculum as intended.

512
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:59,670
Next, we will look at the proportion of teen mentors who report that the chronological order of the curriculum was appropriate for youth participants.

513
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:07,230
Finally, we will ask teen mentors if they feel the curriculum activities in overall program is a good fit for our targeted youth participants.

514
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:14,790
So in conjunction with the process evaluation, we'll also be conducting an outcome evaluation.

515
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:21,180
So these are some of our questions that will be kind of focusing on. So for this outcome evaluation,

516
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:27,270
we'll obviously be systematic collecting data to assess the impact of our program and whether our ultimate goals have been achieved.

517
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:35,940
So we're yeah, we're looking to the extent to which the programs, objectives of healthy eating habits and nutrition knowledge have been obtained.

518
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:42,120
So kind of the goal here is to assess causal inference or a developer counterfactual.

519
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:49,590
So we chose a single time series design which would allow for multiple observations before and after the intervention is implemented.

520
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:54,360
And so we'll be looking for for a successful program will have a significant

521
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:59,460
change in scores or observations that take place for the program in the program.

522
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:06,000
And then some of the outcome indicators that we'll be looking at in relation to these questions will be.

523
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:10,680
The number of students who have shown an increased knowledge about nutritional and gardening.

524
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:15,380
The number of students who have continued to participate in activities.

525
01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:22,950
And then finally, the number of students seeking out healthy and positive behaviors at their school as defined by the goals of the.

526
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:27,160
All right.

527
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:35,920
So the HLA program will use a few different methods of collecting quantitative data, both prior to the program's implementation and at its completion.

528
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:41,860
Surveys and assessments will be conducted through a combination of interviewer and self-administered techniques.

529
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:46,060
Interview rate administered surveys will be completed in a group format,

530
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:50,740
both pre and post intervention to encourage the students to collectively share their ideas,

531
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:55,390
to reduce survey fatigue for both parties and to receive a sufficient response rate.

532
01:01:56,110 --> 01:02:03,339
The HLA team teen ambassadors will be trained to facilitate the interviewer administered surveys to the participants to keep those

533
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:09,730
involved in the delivery of the program consistent and to foster a sense of community between the participants and the ambassadors.

534
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:15,959
For the Teen Ambassadors. Surveys and assessments will be provided via Qualtrics for easy for ease of use

535
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:20,010
and to allow flexibility for the survey is completed in the required time frame.

536
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:27,900
All survey and assessment items will be created through a participatory process involving the teen ambassadors prior to the beginning of the program.

537
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:36,900
So in addition to our quantitative, we'll also be collecting our qualitative, the data we collect through semi-structured interviews.

538
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:41,640
These interviews will be conducted one on one recorded and in the programing space.

539
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:48,990
They will consist of direct probe and structure questions to develop an interview space that's based on the specific needs of the participants.

540
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:56,099
This method is intended to create a conversation between the interviewee and the participant, which will make them comfortable,

541
01:02:56,100 --> 01:03:05,010
but also encourage them to voice opinions without concern of a right or wrong answer or any backlash for voicing positive or negative experiences.

542
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:13,590
So it's very imperative that they have this space to be reflective and in depth with their answers so that we can properly document the experience,

543
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:19,890
but also thoroughly evaluate the program to take the myth. So as mentioned, it will be recorded and conducted in the programing space.

544
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:24,360
These recordings will allow for students to have the undivided attention of the interviewee,

545
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:30,300
but also allow them to be safe in a familiar and accessible place, because that's where the program was conducted.

546
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:37,219
So now I'm going to talk a little bit about our data analysis, which is really important,

547
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:42,710
to make sure that our data is transformed into meaningful information that we can then present.

548
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:48,710
As I mentioned, the qualitative data we collect will be obtained through recorded semi-structured interviews.

549
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:52,760
And while interviewers will write down a few notes right after they conduct the interviews,

550
01:03:52,760 --> 01:04:00,320
we will also have members of our evaluation team listen to each interview again and write up notes and identify major themes as they go.

551
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:04,970
The interviewers may miss a few nuances in the data during this method,

552
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:09,380
but our hope is that the quantitative data we collect in conjunction with this will fill the gaps.

553
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:15,730
After we review the interviews and have substantial notes for each of them, we will code the data to pick out key themes.

554
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:19,180
This will help us determine what general themes our interview discussed.

555
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:24,580
We will use an inductive approach to coding, so our themes will be created based on what the interviewees mentioned,

556
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:26,980
not based on our overarching research questions.

557
01:04:27,370 --> 01:04:33,310
This will ensure our results are reflective of what the teens and students experience and not our team's idea of what might have happened.

558
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:40,990
We will present our major themes as well as the associated, major and minor categories to illustrate a full picture of our interviews experience.

559
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:45,670
We will also use quotes from the interviews in our presentations to highlight the students voices.

560
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:53,450
For the quantitative portion of our analysis, we will first into categories or questions into descriptive and inferential questions,

561
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:56,360
and this will guide which type of analysis that we conduct.

562
01:04:57,450 --> 01:05:03,120
Many of the quantitative indicators we are looking for in the process of valuation would fall under our descriptive questions.

563
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:08,190
These include finding the number of teen mentors that report having access to a point person

564
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:12,630
to whom they could ask questions to regarding the field facilitation of the curriculum.

565
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:18,780
The number of teen countries that adhere to the HLA curriculum and the proportion of team members who reported

566
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:24,570
that the chronological order of the curriculum was appropriate and made sense for the youth participants.

567
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:30,750
For these measures, we will use a frequency distribution to find accounts or proportions or percentages.

568
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:32,060
Well,

569
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:39,020
we will focus on the interview analysis to answer most of the questions in our outcome evaluation that could be categorized as inferential questions.

570
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:45,110
We can also include questions that relate to how students nutritional knowledge and behaviors change in our quantitative analysis.

571
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:51,650
So for this, we'd use a scale question or something like that to kind of quantify how their behaviors changed over time.

572
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:58,430
This question will be considered inferential because it looks at how the variable in this case behavior changes over time.

573
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:04,760
We'll use it within group design to compare participant scores from pretest to future post-test.

574
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:09,909
Since health behavior is a continuous outcome, a mixed effects linear regression,

575
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:13,660
we're required to look at the associations between attending the HLA program and the

576
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:17,230
health behaviors of the student participants after the completion of the program.

577
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:33,380
So our standards surrounding ah that analysis to ensure that the program is efficient and increasing our students knowledge and nutritional value.

578
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:40,249
In 2010, President Barack Obama had enacted the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act,

579
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:51,020
which was a federal statute that required the USDA to update their national school lunch program guidelines and spreading these updated policies.

580
01:06:51,020 --> 01:07:00,980
Research was conducted from the 2012 2013 school year to compare pre and post results to food waste and of food waste.

581
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:06,080
Or there was increase or decrease and also the increase or decrease of students

582
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:10,430
knowledge of the nutritional plate when picking items were during lunch trades.

583
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:17,770
So based on the results from this study, we wanted to align our, you know,

584
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:23,179
our results to what amongst know our teenagers who were evaluating and teaching our

585
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:29,000
kids nutritional value and going up to pre and post examinations of those records.

586
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:35,490
So one of the values standards that we wanted to include incorporate was like

587
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:41,780
students will also include fruit in their trays by an increase in the number of

588
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:47,269
students who have vegetables on their plates were increased by 20% and the consumption

589
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:53,180
of school meals with a variety of healthy ingredients will increase by 13%.

590
01:07:54,270 --> 01:08:02,520
Okay. And then I'm going further from that to, you know, disseminate the knowledge of our findings throughout the duration of our program.

591
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:06,720
We wanted to break it down into three groups of stakeholders.

592
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:16,050
So one of our stakeholders will be our program coordinators and our staff in charge of implementing that program.

593
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:23,130
And, you know, parents who may be involved in the program who are thinking about enrolling their children in the future.

594
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:30,510
And then our last group, Inc., with that are our teachers who are who will help implement and assess the program's effectiveness.

595
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:35,430
So the way we will disseminate knowledge amongst our teach excuse me,

596
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:45,840
our program coordinator is in amongst our staff is to have a written pamphlet in telling our information from the intervention

597
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:55,770
strategy and it's process evaluation highlighting what change behaviors have occurred amongst our students at attitudes and knowledge.

598
01:08:56,790 --> 01:09:06,209
In addition to that, you know, gaining by gaining the perspective of our teenagers, you know, what, you know, do they see it as valuable?

599
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:12,060
What's missing, what could be, you know, what can we enhance?

600
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:18,720
And then also, we want to address our parents and our youth within our second stakeholder group.

601
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:24,810
So the way we disseminate knowledge through that is hosting a town hall meeting with our panels consisting of

602
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:31,530
two program coordinators in our evaluation team who will lead the team hall meeting to answer any questions,

603
01:09:31,530 --> 01:09:35,370
comments or concerns throughout presenting our findings.

604
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:42,660
And in addition to that, we want to have written information that will be transferred digitally.

605
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:47,070
So we use social media and physically those attend in person.

606
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:53,010
And then last but not least, we will have some similar terminology disseminated to our teachers,

607
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:59,669
who was our last stakeholder group we want to engage with. And through that they will also receive in reports,

608
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:08,340
but that the verbiage within the information will be disseminated a bit differently in comparison to the staff and coordinators,

609
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:11,340
so it could be more digestible and understanding.

610
01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:19,560
And then these reports will be adapted and words tailored specifically amongst the teachers and across the board.

611
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:25,260
So. Those are our references and thank you for your time.

612
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:35,639
Yeah, I think that's a great question. I'll take that. So that's a great point that you brought up as far as maybe the cafeteria folks

613
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,670
or people who are actually providing or preparing the meals at the schools.

614
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:43,170
That's definitely something we can incorporate as it pertains to the curriculum.

615
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:51,300
And like what students actually have access to. Our garden based curriculum is basically a learning tool for students to have exposure.

616
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:57,659
So really, we do understand that there are some constraints, especially when you're dealing with students from a low income background.

617
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:02,580
We have these different societal factors going into play here, so everything is not within our control,

618
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:07,500
but our goal here is to get them that exposure so that down the line they can carry those tools with them

619
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:12,420
throughout their life and hopefully build upon these habits as they move along through the life journey.

620
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:18,980
Yeah. Oh, I was going to say I think that's something that to keep in mind for post survey too

621
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:24,880
and just like make the questions clear that like even if you don't have access to it,

622
01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:27,500
like how would your behavior change if you did have access to it?

623
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:32,500
So it might not be exactly what they are actually doing, but more like what they have learned from the program, like you said.

624
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:36,860
Yeah. And I would also add, like, I think this could be a useful policy tool.

625
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:41,810
To advocate for more funding for schools like school lunches, healthy options.

626
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:49,130
This specific program is more focused on the youth and their experience, but I agree that it should be like a broader system.

627
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:40,290
Thank you. Definitely something to consider. Thank you.

628
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:53,200
So maybe tomorrow. So I thought was interesting.

629
01:13:53,530 --> 01:14:02,470
The choice to use you two are the two ambassadors to do the interviewing of the elementary school student.

630
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:06,940
What are some considerations that you had in terms of.

631
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:11,520
How that might affect their quality or what they would.

632
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:19,230
I can take that. I think it's definitely something to consider, especially when we have like elementary students.

633
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:26,530
And so I think the thought was to have many data collection points so we can try and see like over time, is there gaps in what's going on,

634
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:29,320
especially with the process questions to see like, okay,

635
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:33,940
is there something we can like help supplement and when they're asking these questions to the students?

636
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:37,550
So I think that was where we were going with that. Yeah.

637
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:43,879
Oh, sorry. I was also going to say, because of the close proximity and age, we thought that was like a bonus,

638
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:48,140
that students may feel more comfortable with people that are closer in age instead

639
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:52,280
of talking to like adults who there is kind of an authoritarian figure over them.

640
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:56,900
So yeah, the comfort, the comfortability factor there was our consideration.

641
01:14:57,230 --> 01:15:01,629
Yeah, absolutely. And also just because they were their peer educators, there's a rapport that's been built.

642
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:04,750
So we thought that might. Allow for a more honest response.

643
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:07,899
And in addition,

644
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:14,510
the reason for recording is so that we can go back and kind of like listen to it and fill in any blanks or gaps or just like understand,

645
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:20,920
try to understand or make a better understanding of some things that might just be like an elementary school kind of conversation.

646
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:25,840
So making sure that they get the opportunity to just voice their opinions freely.

647
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:29,980
And then when we're able to go back and record and kind of take pieces from.

648
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:40,040
We're. Okay. Right.

649
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:50,950
Um, thank you. Well.

650
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:54,249
Thank you, everybody. I don't know about you. It warms my heart.

651
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:59,110
To see prisons do presentations is my favorite part of the semester.

652
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:05,590
So just a reminder that we've got two more days of presentations.

653
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:09,790
We got five more groups. So Thursday will be a short day.

654
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:16,659
And let's see. Other than that, I don't have anything else for you.

655
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:19,780
So we'll just, you know, continue moving along.

656
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:30,220
If you have any questions about your papers, please feel free to reach out to me and I'll see you all next Tuesday.

657
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:47,760
You. My answer to your.

658
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:53,550
Yes. So for the paper on canvas, you had this really nice template.

659
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:59,350
All right, so it's not like we need to do this. You don't have to do it.

660
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:04,199
Now you can choose to use. I mean, if you want to lay it on a different way, that's more useful.

661
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:10,390
But it matches more with the description of the assignment.

662
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:14,280
This. Okay. That helps because I quite like what it doesn't. That's perfectly up to the assignment.

663
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:17,790
So yeah, this is more like a good question to think about reference.

664
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:31,980
Okay. And then with the first assignment that the logic model and the literal delivery here were, as you said, to include the first we have.

665
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:39,270
Oh yeah. It's I'm like with like what we are clocking all in basically just been building the whole thing along.

666
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:44,730
Take those two together and fill in the last thing like you're walking.

667
01:17:46,430 --> 01:18:01,510
She studied design and has gone with multiple concepts because the Time series has

668
01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:06,650
multiple tests beginning at the O before the intervention and after the end of it.

669
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:14,310
I also think about I think it's cool, but you intentionally don't do that.

670
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:18,520
It's not just like reduce burn out ahead of time.

671
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:32,780
We're going to be like, are you saying where you stagger the record notwithstanding that maybe that's good to talk about?

672
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:39,380
Are you happy about this? Okay, so there I have started. Yeah, there's never been science design.

673
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:44,090
Is that like. Does that make sense? You're talking.

674
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:55,800
So whether you be five. So let me make sure I understand the way that you are here.

675
01:18:56,120 --> 01:19:06,140
It's all right. It's fine. So would you say this circle is all the people that you are working with?

676
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:10,850
Are you collecting within this sample or random?

677
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:20,050
You at random? Maybe be some at one time point randomly from at another time or whatever time we have.

678
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:25,610
I think what's important to me as.

679
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:38,730
Yeah. That's going to be it's definitely going to kick in intentionally ahead of time reading stuff out.

680
01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:48,620
I know you like it. Yeah, that would definitely.

681
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:52,630
I honestly have never. I don't know. I never seen that.

682
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:58,110
So there's definitely going to be this temporary attrition issue because it.
