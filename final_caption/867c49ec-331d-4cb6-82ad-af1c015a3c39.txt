1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,890
So I. Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:16,650
Hello. So today we're going to cover this second set of slides for basic on homework.

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,880
Remember that the homework is due on October 2nd.

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,770
There are three questions.

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:32,280
Question one and two can be completely solved with whatever we did last class, plus the IOC card code that we have from lap one.

6
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,000
And then the third question we are going to try to solve today.

7
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:42,000
We're going to go through all the code that you need to solve that question before we start, any questions?

8
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,340
Okay. Remember that everything is already uploaded into Encompass.

9
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:55,740
Okay. So this is our one for today. What I'm going to start with are logistic regression with one binary predictor.

10
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:05,250
Then we're going to go for how to make how to do logistic regression analysis and then logistic regression waiting for actions.

11
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:11,400
Okay. So we are going to work with basic sample for.

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:24,740
Distracting them. Okay. So this is a couple women I worked with, let's say.

13
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:32,000
181 boys were asked about duration of sleep in the previous 24 hours before the injury.

14
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:39,020
So they are all injured. That's not the question. They're under 24 hours before that control week.

15
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:49,010
Okay. So we will define exposed as getting less than 10 hours of sleep and unexposed as getting 10 hours or more of a sleep.

16
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:57,350
So that's a binary category. Seek binary viable two over one and we want to explore is the number of hours of sleep

17
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,640
on the first night can involve the number of hours of sleep on the second night.

18
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:09,439
So we have 2181 people who got injured and we just asked them about like how many hours

19
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,440
do they did they sleep the night before danger and the night before midnight high band,

20
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,840
you know, like two nights before. And this is the two by two table that we have here.

21
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,020
We have the control of mind, which is their right before danger.

22
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,579
And then the case night. Wait, I'm sorry. Haze night is before danger control night.

23
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,630
It's like two nights before. And this is our two way to table.

24
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:41,059
Okay. Given that we can construct the following model, so we're going to do a logistic regression.

25
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,600
So that's why here we have love of B over one minus.

26
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:52,340
B, where P for me it's going to be getting 10 hours or more of a sleep.

27
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:58,250
So that's my outcome. Getting 10 hours of of more of a sleep.

28
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:10,670
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's less 10 hours of less than 10 hours of sleep.

29
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:17,570
So here I have my love of B over one minus C, I have the Intersect, and I have only one covariate.

30
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,050
And that corporate covariate exam, all of us they have the night before.

31
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:30,020
Does that make sense? Okay, so this is just night before the injury and then this is two nights before they did, and I'm using that as a predictor.

32
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:39,950
So basically my model wants to predict the following. I want to predict whether they sleep more or less than 10 hours per day.

33
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:49,160
And my companion is whether they use it more or less often or in less than 10 hours of sleep the night before.

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,370
And that's it. So as you can see, this is a logistic regression and we are a categorical predictor.

35
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,610
So only one predictor and that predictor is categorical.

36
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,320
And the question is, how can we code that into our onset?

37
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,800
So we're going to start with Sports Insights.

38
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,630
I'm creating the data set. This is the two waiting tables that we had at the beginning.

39
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,280
So I have some control on the number of people in each of the cells.

40
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,060
And then I'm just going to use up from logistic.

41
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,960
So I have from logistic. TR Data is the data set that I have here.

42
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:33,590
I'm waiting my data set by the variable count here.

43
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,530
And then my model is case basis controls, pages versus functions.

44
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,350
And remember that here in SAS, I have to specify what is the case for me.

45
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:52,850
So in this case, a case is coded as one. So these sort of cases for me, like these of the cases.

46
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,780
So that's what I'm specifying here. That's for me the outcome.

47
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,070
But I'm interested in its event equal one.

48
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,210
That's what I'm that's why I'm coding it in R anxiety.

49
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,380
Okay. And then if you run this are two lines.

50
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,700
You get the you get the estimate.

51
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:23,060
So these two. So just be very careful about how those either SAS or R gives you the output.

52
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:33,890
So, for example, in the table analysis of maximum likelihood, the estimates are these are the estimates of this table but zero unbeaten one.

53
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,870
However, in the question, odds for the odds ask for the odds ratio.

54
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,410
These is not the odds ratio because these are the estimates.

55
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,220
So remember that if you want the odds ratio, you have 2x1 and see it.

56
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:55,280
Okay. So just be very careful about this. The source, the analysis on maximum legal table is giving you the estimate, the row estimates.

57
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:59,540
If you want the odds ratio, you would have to exponents the same.

58
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,960
Does that make sense? Just be careful with those things.

59
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,910
Okay. And then how do we do it in our. Okay.

60
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:13,250
So our first create the same job I can table that I have here.

61
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:26,550
This is my two way you panel designed to form lines in back table and pulling back table is V and then this is slightly unnecessary.

62
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:34,700
This five you can just always up names to the table. So case control and count, which are names that I assign.

63
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:43,340
And then the really important bias how to run the logistic regression uses GLM function as the function to run logistic regression.

64
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:52,310
It will ask you for the form you want the formula how to here is case that we are simple that I don't know how it's called.

65
00:06:53,390 --> 00:07:01,120
I think it's the little stuff I want to say. So variable my outcome fuel the height of predictor.

66
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:12,620
So this is the formula. You can either plug in this formula without the quotations here or just do us formula with conclusions and then form.

67
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:21,499
The case goes here. You can do like whatever you want if you just tried to remember what we're reading five,

68
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,970
20, 25, 20, anything, we directly specify the formula here, which is that's also.

69
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,990
This is just another way to do it. And then very important.

70
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,070
So I specified that we are running a logistic regression.

71
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:40,100
Finally equal binomial and in parentheses we are using a logic function.

72
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,020
Okay, so this is important.

73
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:52,430
5 to 55 logistic regression and then weights equal count because our table has you know, instead of like one observation for each operator,

74
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:58,430
I just aggregated all the data so I have to wait for the number of people that use in each cell.

75
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,800
So that's what I'm doing here. Weights equal count. And then you have some.

76
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:08,080
Right off the name of your function here. And so now you have your function.

77
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:15,220
And then here I'm using E to the power of whatever I have here to exponents here to get the observation.

78
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:25,330
So in our. These will be the output if you're the summary of your GLM function.

79
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:32,320
This would be the output again in case the output give you beta one beta zero hot.

80
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:36,030
But if you need the odds ratio, you need to experience it.

81
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:41,500
So that's what I'm doing here. This is easy to follow because you don't lose it to the final beta one.

82
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:48,280
So in this function it's going to give you beta one and betas euro hot.

83
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,440
And then here in this light, I'm using the exponent function to get the odds ratio.

84
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:58,360
Okay. Does that make sense? Any questions so far?

85
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:06,340
Okay. So there is.

86
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,670
There's another way to do the same thing in our business life.

87
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,059
So to just answer the question,

88
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:25,040
are logistic regression against one predictor that is a categorical variable in aren't really the only thing that you need is this.

89
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:30,830
However, there's another way to do it if you want to try it because is like another way to code it.

90
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,420
It's very similar. Whoops. It's very similar.

91
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,960
We also we are also using the goal and function and everything is the same basically.

92
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:51,770
Except that here I'm instead of using data equal to sleep, I'm using a different type of data, which is right now I have a two way table.

93
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,060
What if I expand that table into instead of having just four rows?

94
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,080
I have 181 rows, one for each subject.

95
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,069
This is this table. And then I do data about these.

96
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:11,420
And then he had notice that I don't have to use weight equals count because I already have the long format of that table.

97
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,060
Does that make sense? So does the same thing do it in two different ways.

98
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,060
So the first way is just have a two way to table.

99
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:29,680
And then in that case I need to like wait equal count or the second wife is transform that two by two table into a long format,

100
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:40,849
but each row has one subject. So that row that I would have 181 subjects and then use the same code except on here you

101
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,720
don't have to wait for anything because you already have the long format of your data.

102
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:50,630
Does that make sense? Okay. Okay.

103
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:58,440
And then very important, how do we how do we interpret these parameters?

104
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:12,120
So remember that the logistic regression in something like log of B over one minus B, it's equal to oops, how do I erase?

105
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,430
It's equal to.

106
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:37,230
Beta zero hard loss beta one hot over IXI and then here IXI, it's either one or zero because in this example we are using a categorical variable.

107
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:44,670
So if you are ask about the interpretation of data zero.

108
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:51,480
In fact, I don't know if, but I do know the interpretation of E to the power of beta zero.

109
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:55,220
So the problem is that means I have embarrassed beta zero with me,

110
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:01,160
which would mean interpreting the look of the observation, which is normally not something that we do.

111
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,170
We interpret the operation of the log of the observation.

112
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,400
That's why here I can explain and see the whole thing.

113
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:15,630
So if I exponential the left hand side, I would get B over one minus B.

114
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:31,540
And then on the right hand side, I would get e to the power of betas, you know, hot plus E to the power type plus beta one hard times.

115
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:40,780
Okay. And then so that would be saying just play with the variables and said variables to see them.

116
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,100
So for example. So only thing there for each of the power betas you.

117
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,670
I need to make these disappear with my equation.

118
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,320
How do I make these these up? You just set x equal to zero.

119
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,200
So if I said x I equal to zero.

120
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:06,130
If I said x I equal to zero, I would get that my equation would look something like B over one minus B, which is the odds ratio.

121
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:11,800
Remember that gave me these means odds ratio would be able to e to the power of beta zero.

122
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,520
And then if I said x I equal to one,

123
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:26,830
I would get exactly the same equation that we have Y minus B and C want to eat the power of beta pseudo hot plus beta one.

124
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,480
Okay. And that's the interpretation.

125
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:41,799
So we the power of beta zero would be the odds ratio of what offsetting x equal to zero for me.

126
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:50,910
Excited for the zero. I think it meant. It means asleep more than 10 hours because that's how I coded it.

127
00:13:50,940 --> 00:14:01,510
So just a reminder. X is equal to zero, which means less, not more than 10 hours for sleep.

128
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:09,930
And these will be less than 10 hours of sleep. So given that each the forward betas,

129
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:21,190
you would mean it's the odds ratio of the people who sleeps more than 10 hours in the in the night before the injury.

130
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:30,879
Does that make sense? And then do the powers Michael then to the power of beta what if the additional because notice how this looks this is exactly

131
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,520
the same as does that the second thing the second third the second equation contains a new term which is veto on pot.

132
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:48,100
So what I want to do in this case would be the additional observation I have when I sleep less than 10 hours.

133
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,870
You know, that's the rationale for it. Why is it additional?

134
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,980
Why is it additive? Just because I have a beta so hot that I cannot just like get free.

135
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,229
So that would be the interpretation of betas you had in our example would mean that the estimated odds ratio

136
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:11,350
of a sleeping less than 10 hours on the second night when you sleep more than 10 hours on the first night.

137
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:18,550
So this when you asleep more than 10 hours would mean that x i it's equal to zero.

138
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,590
And then this is just the odds ratio.

139
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:32,650
And then if we go now to the interpretation of E to the beta one, it would be the odds ratio associated with one unit increase in x one.

140
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:41,620
If I do a one unit increase in x, one would mean is the difference between sleeping 10 hours lives in 10 hours

141
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:46,480
and more an hours because is the additional part of doing that and that's it.

142
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:54,010
Does that make sense? Does the interpretation make sense? Yes, a little bit.

143
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,760
Okay. Good. Okay. So that was the first part.

144
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:05,850
Second part of today, it's talking about how come we perform logistic regression analysis.

145
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,520
So remember the same meta analysis example that we were working a couple of weeks ago.

146
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:16,740
Here we have we are interested in the odds ratio of mortality.

147
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,280
My exposure variable,

148
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:31,350
it's magnesium and then I have a control group and then this is our mortality for acute myocardial infarction and I have different studies.

149
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,940
Okay. So given this, we have two problems.

150
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:40,799
The first one is we want to write out a logistic regression model that can be used to

151
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:48,840
estimate the overall odds ratio of magnesium versus magnesium all control e suspected.

152
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,610
This is my myocardial infarction adjusted for a study.

153
00:16:53,860 --> 00:17:02,670
Okay. So the first question is just I want to write out a logistic model that is able to estimate the overall odds ratio adjusting for a study.

154
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:13,100
And the second problem would be write out logistic models that can be used to test for almost generating a full of risk of of all odds ratio.

155
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:20,610
So in the second logistic model, I want to be able to test whether the study of the seven studies that I have there,

156
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,260
they have the same odds ratio or not. Okay. Does that make sense?

157
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:35,380
Okay. Let's just go for the first problem first. So the following model will let you test for the overall odds ratio.

158
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:42,000
So here, how do the odds ratios these are? In this case, I'm interested in odds of mortality.

159
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,730
So this is the odds of the longer the model logarithm of the odds of mortality.

160
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:53,450
And then he I have an intercept and indicator variable for treatment or group.

161
00:17:53,460 --> 00:18:01,980
So in this case these is going to take the value of one if this object it's in the treatment group or zero if it is in the control group.

162
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,450
And then I have indicator volume variables for each of the studies.

163
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,460
Does that make sense? Okay. Please notice the following.

164
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:18,420
We have seven studies in total, but we are only adding six indicator functions for a study.

165
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,470
So I have a study two. A study three. A study four, five, six and seven.

166
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,120
What happened to the first one? Why don't I have an indicator variable for.

167
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:34,080
I don't know. Why don't I have here beta eight times indicator variables for the study number eight.

168
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,140
Did I just forget about the. Should I write this down in my equation?

169
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:51,010
Should I? Should I have something like this?

170
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,010
Oops. Study one. I'm sorry. Should I have something by this?

171
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:17,130
Why? Because whenever you are working with categorical variables remember that the number or.

172
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:23,999
So if I have the categorical variable in this case my copy of my Bible is a study and it's 1 to 7.

173
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,050
That's categories.

174
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:34,880
Whenever I'm working with categorical variables, the number of variables that are in to the model, it's always one minus the totality of that I have.

175
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,770
So in this case, I have seven studies, which means I only need six files.

176
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,650
I notice that's also the case for the variable of light control treatment.

177
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:53,760
I can couple of variables that is namely group. And for each person who's going to tell me whether they belong to the treatment or the control group.

178
00:19:54,180 --> 00:20:00,360
That's how I do with two levels, which means I only need one variable into the model for that group.

179
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,950
That always applies. Okay. Just remember that always apply.

180
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:12,540
You need to like. You need to always hide one of the levels.

181
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:22,820
Okay. Why didn't you debate anyone in this case?

182
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:28,880
Well, give me the overall ratio of mortality for humanism versus control.

183
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:36,830
In my suspected meal, come down in some things I don't remember.

184
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:46,280
Adjusted for study. Why? Because I want the overall odds ratio, which means I want the overall odds ratio for all of these studies.

185
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:52,160
It doesn't matter if it belongs to the first one or the second one of the third one or the for one or the first one, it doesn't matter.

186
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,130
Which means that if we know the technique that we did before.

187
00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:00,450
I'm just going to say, all of these are certifiable to zero because I don't need it in anywhere.

188
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:13,360
And if I. If I said this to zero on this to zero on this to zero on this to zero on this to zero and this to zero.

189
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:18,190
Then I'm only left with beta zero plus beta one.

190
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:24,570
Correct? Oops.

191
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:41,980
So I I'm only left with this if I save all of my variables of a study equal to zero because I won't be full of outrage.

192
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,090
Arms. You're going to see it. I know, but I have to debate you, okay?

193
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:54,690
Yes. Because if I do the same thing, but for the control group, then I said all of my variables.

194
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,240
I started to see look. But then additionally these will be zero.

195
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:04,210
So for the control group, it will be it will look something like this.

196
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,650
So this is for the treatment group and this is for the control group.

197
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,950
And then I want the overall odds ratio with me,

198
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:23,260
which means odds ratio would be divide one over the other e to the power of beta zero plus beta one divided over E to the power of beat us.

199
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,469
You know, this is equal to E to the power of beta.

200
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:31,560
What does that make sense? It's a crisis.

201
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:42,330
It is a part of our own. Okay.

202
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:46,980
And then the question is, yes, how do we create this?

203
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,920
How do we create these? Yeah.

204
00:22:53,930 --> 00:23:00,080
How we doing? How do we go sing songs for us? So the first thing is we need to create our own dataset.

205
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:04,580
So for our dataset, we're going to do something very similar to what each has done.

206
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:09,500
Let's just take the first one. So for the first one, I can construct a two by two table.

207
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,040
Right. We already left this for you halfway.

208
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:21,680
So I can go on top to table for each side. So this is the that I work for the first one and then for each the little table.

209
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,340
I'm just going to create input data lines as I did before.

210
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:39,080
So for example, here I'm going to say one one and then one one, zero, very nice people, 012 people and then 0034 people and so on and so forth.

211
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:49,400
Those that make sense. So what I'm doing is just creating a two by two table for each study and then just setting those two tables as we did before.

212
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,660
And then just adding one variable for where do they belong.

213
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,550
So for example, here in.

214
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:34,290
Who's. Fox.

215
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,860
Yes. So, for example, here I have.

216
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:54,099
So that's how you would do it. I phrase couple variables for each of study notice and here I have 1 to 7 and then I

217
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,930
have a variable for whether they are in the control group or in the treatment group.

218
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,680
So one would mean that they are in the control in the treatment group.

219
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:08,260
I have a lot of variables for my outcome. One means they are that otherwise.

220
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,430
And then I have the amount of people. I will explain these later.

221
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:17,500
So for example, here you have one, one, one. What this one is, is the first study.

222
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:26,920
They are they belong to the treatment group. They are that how many people are in that in that same.

223
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:33,970
So first three they belong to the treatment group and how many people died was on the cards.

224
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,620
And then this the other four lines are the same first.

225
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,580
These is the first study. It means that they are in the treatment group.

226
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,630
They are alive on how many people do I have?

227
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,830
39 and so on and so forth. Does that make sense?

228
00:25:54,010 --> 00:26:02,650
Clear on how to like input the data into source. So these line the first line here inputs all of the data for the first study,

229
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:07,330
the second line inputs, all of the data for the second study and so on and so forth.

230
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:11,760
Does that make sense? Questions.

231
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:19,730
Here. I have the other cell, and here I have the other cell.

232
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:34,489
All right. Once I'm done, once I have, like, updated that data, then I just do what I think I submitted before.

233
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:41,120
So probably just because I have my off and yet I remember to wait by your account variable.

234
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:51,740
And then here I have my model, my outcome, which is then I use that I need to specify which one is the outcome I guess yo or one in this case is one.

235
00:26:52,160 --> 00:27:01,190
And then my covariates are magnesium, which is like the treatment group I'm a study which is like, you know, to which study belongs.

236
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:08,270
And then I'm going to ask for dual estimates, for dual test for the estimates, and that's it.

237
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:20,629
So here we have the results. In this case, we have the Wald test for magnesium,

238
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:29,480
which means whether it belongs to the treatment or the control group, we have this estimate and we have the p value.

239
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:35,870
Given what we see value is close to zero and in particular is based on 5%.

240
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:41,870
These variable is significant, which means that the overall odds ratio is significant.

241
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,670
Why the overall odds ratio?

242
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:54,800
Because remember that we already are we already establish that e to the power of beta one will give you the overall odds ratio.

243
00:27:55,010 --> 00:28:03,020
Correct. So here's what we are testing for, not like for the significance of that overall odds ratio.

244
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:08,510
So here I am testing whether that overall odds ratio is equal to one or different than one.

245
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:12,580
In this case, it's different than one evaluated based on type.

246
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:23,240
And then here in the other variable odds ratio estimates on well, confidence interval, we have the different confidence,

247
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,700
the different estimate very important that here in source this is always going to

248
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:35,359
be greater e to the Aveda is not beta one better to wait of three in this case.

249
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,500
In this case it's a rate each area. So that's very important in this table.

250
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,680
You don't need to explain to somebody explain it for you.

251
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,460
Seeing this is easily made online and this is the estimate,

252
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:54,049
these is the value over of the overall odds ratio of the overall all odds ratio of that

253
00:28:54,050 --> 00:29:02,810
for myocardial infarction in fraction of condition on all of their studies is 0.43.

254
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,830
And we found out that that's a significant value that is different than one.

255
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:13,100
Okay. And the significance is between all these is one and this is the Chi Square.

256
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,950
Thanks for that overall observation.

257
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:24,710
I mean, here I have the comparison on all of all of this studies versus this study that we hide, which is the first one.

258
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:29,810
So this is easy for me to do, each of the five obligatory and so on and so forth.

259
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,510
Does that make sense? Any questions so far?

260
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:46,110
Yes. So we do have the story that has zero in themselves showing as we're going to study for this whole question.

261
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:51,460
No gift to zero. Yeah. You don't need. Oh, I.

262
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:06,690
Okay. Then if we do this formulation, we'll be able to answer that question.

263
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,510
What's the overall overall observation?

264
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:20,579
However, we also have another question Can we create or formulate a model that let us answer the test for homogeneity,

265
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:25,950
which means now I want to test whether the odds ratio of all of their studies is the same.

266
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,260
This is my question. I want to test whether the odds ratio of all of this is the same.

267
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,250
So in that case, we can formulate a different model.

268
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:43,290
Romano looks very similar to the previous one. In fact, on the on here it's exactly the same.

269
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:48,960
So I have an intercept. I have a variable for the group, either prevent or control.

270
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,580
And then I have this secret Bible for each of their studies.

271
00:30:52,590 --> 00:31:02,520
Remember that I have to hide one. And then after that, I'm just adding interaction zones between this study and the treatment group.

272
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,740
So yeah, under treatment.

273
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:13,560
So for example, here I have beta eight and this is an indicator function, whether it's study tool for a study number two and magnesium.

274
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:19,860
And then I have beta three with my base and then I have beta four, I'm sorry, and study four with magnesium.

275
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,630
I'm going to have a study five with my Nike associates, with my organizing, my study seven with validation.

276
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:28,800
I'm just adding interactions and. Okay.

277
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:39,760
And then if I want to test with this model, the weather, the odds ratio of all of the studies is the same of no is the same or not.

278
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,719
But we mean that in this equation, all of the new terms that I just ordered, which are beta eight,

279
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,050
beta nine rate of ten until later 13 are zero because they would disappear,

280
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:56,950
which means that there are no incremental effect of my one study over the other.

281
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:04,870
They all have the same ratio. Does that make sense?

282
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:37,720
Okay. Any questions so far? Any questions?

283
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:45,220
Oh, good. So now this is called a model with interaction terms.

284
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:52,240
So now we are going to add some interaction terms into the F into the equation.

285
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:56,380
So the dataset is the same. We don't need to change anything in the dataset.

286
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,470
The only thing we need to do is reformulate our model.

287
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:05,200
So when I'm writing my model, I have them as my outcome.

288
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:14,739
And then I have my two variables the group, the group either treatment or control and the study I know to add the interaction,

289
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,370
I'm just going to multiply those things and that would add the interaction.

290
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:26,980
Okay. That's the only difference between the model, like coding difference between the model winning directions and the model without these actions.

291
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:31,600
So without interactions would be only these flawed with interactions.

292
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:38,800
These are what I remember about the interactions. Allow us to test whether all of the odds ratio are the same or not.

293
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:47,860
Okay. So that's the only difference. And then we will have two variables.

294
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,860
So our two tables,

295
00:33:49,990 --> 00:34:01,290
one with the while Chi Square has been another one with the absence in the variable with the in the table with the wildcard score test.

296
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,160
And we already know that we can test for overall odds ratio.

297
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:12,940
However, in this table we are interested in tested whether the interaction is significant or not.

298
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:16,720
That would be this term. So here I have the odds ratio.

299
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,190
I'm sorry. Here we have the test. If what we see here, I have the p value.

300
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:32,380
So for these. So for these hypotheses, they are based on the 13 equal to zero.

301
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:46,600
The squares that we see would be 747 and 600 p value associated with would be 0.25 seems 0.25 is greater than my significance level,

302
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:53,590
which in this case I'm setting to five for st. I fails to reject the null hypothesis, which means.

303
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:01,729
I have no evidence that the tests are different because I failed to reject the hypothesis.

304
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:08,510
Right. So if I fail to reject, I still believe that the null hypothesis is stolen.

305
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:16,639
The null hypothesis is that they all the null hypothesis is that the null

306
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,830
hypothesis is that they all have the same observation and I fail to reject that.

307
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,960
Does that make sense? Okay.

308
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:36,430
And then if you run this model, you will also have one of these huge stable we all of the estimates.

309
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:42,160
Right. Finally, we also want to.

310
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:53,130
Yeah. There's another way to test for the homogeneity test.

311
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:59,640
There's another way to do it. The way to do it will be using a likelihood ratio at best.

312
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:13,880
So the first way. If you notice in the code using source here, I added these part which will give you the wild chi square quickest.

313
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:22,690
This would be. The answer to that question, to that hypothesis of homogeneity.

314
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:29,440
But using the Wild Chi Square test. Wild Ho Chi Square test.

315
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:35,710
However, there's another way to do it and it's using the likelihood ratio at best.

316
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:41,079
Okay, it's a different test. So it's likely, very,

317
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:47,960
very likely it's going to give you a different value and a different p value is going to be is

318
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,550
going to require different test and a defensive value because they are just different test.

319
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:58,830
However they can be, you know, I can use one or the other to test for the same hotspots.

320
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:08,470
So for the likelihood ratio test, what I would do is whenever you fit the model in SAS here, I only show you like part of the output,

321
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:14,710
but if you like are doing it with me, you can see that there is more output, that whatever I'd like show you.

322
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,700
For example, if you run a spread, if you run the prop logistic,

323
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:29,860
you will have at least at least three tables, one table with the wild chi squared test.

324
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,090
You will have another table with the estimates and the confidence intervals.

325
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:40,480
Correct. So you will have one table, four beta long hard beta, two hardware, three hard to win and so forth.

326
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:45,910
And then you also have another table, but it's called model feed statistics.

327
00:37:46,660 --> 00:38:01,120
So here I have the table, this table to the left, it's the is the output for the model virus one.

328
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:20,260
I study two plus beta three. They don't want it.

329
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,170
I think it's been a seven. I think a eight.

330
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:35,510
So we have two models, one with all of these betas, and then one, we'd all of those betas which have the same flaws, the interaction terms.

331
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,860
So here I have the two tables of the comparison here.

332
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:45,200
This is a one only for the main effects, which means no interaction.

333
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,590
I'm here in the right. I have the same table, but we don't model.

334
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:54,800
But we are waiting for actions. So you have those two tables here.

335
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,580
You must perform something that is called the likelihood rate of this.

336
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,630
It's very simple. Like mathematically simple. You only have to.

337
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:14,270
Subtract two values. In this case, I would so abstract 546 -538.

338
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:25,070
These minus four log m l here which means likelihood racial that's the f and then above the test.

339
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:30,290
So just to stress these value with these value, which is what I'm doing here,

340
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:37,400
and then you will give you 8.80 to the likelihood ratio best it's a chi square on the variable.

341
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:46,130
So then with that chi square on the Bible, you come up manually these would you have to do it manually?

342
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:52,250
You can just like figure out what the p value is.

343
00:39:52,370 --> 00:40:00,590
Okay. So again, there are two ways for test for the homogeneity test.

344
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:06,379
One way is to do the world test and the other way is to do the likelihood ratio.

345
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,780
This with the one test, the answer, it's already there.

346
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,200
It's one of the outputs of SAS. With the likelihood ratio test, you need to compare two models.

347
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:23,840
The first model includes bolus zero plus beta, one times all of the group plus a study,

348
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,989
and then the other model is the same ones as is the same one as before, but includes the interaction.

349
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:31,310
So those are the two models.

350
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:39,110
If I compare those two models in the model of the 76, you will find in the last row something that is called minus the log of M.

351
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:45,230
The way I remember it is remember it is because it is because l it's likelihood.

352
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:50,569
So this is a little best and the test itself, it's not given.

353
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:59,720
So you have to calculate it by hand on how do I calculated 546 minus one 538.

354
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:06,110
Okay. Just to keep likelihood ratio these always positive.

355
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:12,469
So just say the bigger one minus the smaller one doesn't matter because then just take the bigger one minus the

356
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:19,550
smaller one because it's always a positive number and it's like Chi Square on the mobile with six degrees of freedom.

357
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:27,020
Why? Six Degrees of freedom? Because there are six other parents.

358
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:34,080
So six is the difference between the number of parameters that I have in this modern model compared to the beaver model.

359
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:41,340
So that's the number of degrees of freedom is the difference in parameters between this model model and the beta model.

360
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:46,140
Does that make sense? And that's it again here.

361
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:56,820
With this information, you can either do it by hand as like you did in 521 to calculate the value or use this code to calculate the P value in SAS.

362
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,460
But you have to do it by hand. The bottom line is.

363
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:08,280
The bottom line is that while Chi Square, it's already given the likelihood ratio test, you kind of have to do it by hand.

364
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,180
Does that make sense? Any questions so far?

365
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:18,300
Notice that the food tests are giving me exactly the same conclusion.

366
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:24,630
These three value is greater than 5%, so I would fails to reject the null hypothesis.

367
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:30,470
They are giving me the same conclusion. However, they have different values of course, because they are different.

368
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:37,340
But the conclusion with both of them is the same. Okay.

369
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:42,850
And then a summary sentence of what have we been doing so far?

370
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:54,370
So that's a lot of homogeneity suggests that the odds ratio of mortality for magnesium versus control in suspected mitochondria in France in.

371
00:42:55,690 --> 00:43:04,180
I don't I homogeneous for all of the studies because we fail to reject so I is the notion but they all have the same odds verified.

372
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:08,560
So it's reasonable to combine the odds ratio across all of the studies.

373
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:16,059
And if I do, then the answer will be e to the power of beta one hoc where these features are part of data.

374
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:25,870
One part is from the first model, the small one, without losing their actions and overall the odds ratio of mortality for magnesium versus control.

375
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:29,080
In this respect that is 0.433.

376
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:39,790
This is adjusting for a study, of course, this adjusting for a study because I did this study into the equation.

377
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:49,250
Does that make sense? Any questions so far? Okay.

378
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:59,950
Then how do we do this in art? Okay, so this is my a small model item holding fractions here.

379
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:04,930
I create the two by two tables as I do the same thing.

380
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,620
So here is this a little table for the first study and this is what you table 47 is study.

381
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:16,600
Okay. So I just create right away two tables and then I run a geochem.

382
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,350
With my outcome. And then my variables are the treatment group.

383
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,410
I'm a study and that's it.

384
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:35,100
That's the model with those interactions I remember that being are the outcome is beta one has beta to hot it's not the odds ratio.

385
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:42,870
So if you have if so if you want the odds ratio especially especially if you want the overall odds ratio, you have the exponents.

386
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:50,970
So that's what I'm doing here in the last line exponents and then these would be the outcome.

387
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:58,559
So these are all of my estimates and this is they don't want, however, I want the overall operation.

388
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,660
So it will be e to the power of veto one which is this table that I have here.

389
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:23,610
Okay. And then how do we model the interactions on screen?

390
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:28,410
All right. The same thing. Use the gene function.

391
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:36,329
The only difference is that instead of doing magnesium, magnifying this study, I'm going to do my measure like a star,

392
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:43,740
which means like multiplication in our study, and that we are all of the items that you need, including the interaction there.

393
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,060
So notice that for the model without interaction.

394
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:59,150
I'm using up. Last sign here. However, for the model raising bear auction, I'm using a multiplication sign here.

395
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,960
That's the coding difference in art. So does that make sense?

396
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:14,270
The notification sign would be would be for the interaction terms and then to test for homogeneity using the word test.

397
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:24,980
So first of all, we need a library. So library c r c, f r, make sure you spell the package first if you have it.

398
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:31,100
And then we are going to use this function linear hypothesis in linear hypotheses.

399
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:35,180
We are going to literally express what is our hypotheses.

400
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:43,640
So remember that for homogeneity we are looking that the null hypothesis is that all of the interaction terms are zero,

401
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:56,990
so beta eight until Vader 13, they are all equal to zero, which are the interaction terms here Veda eight until weighed up 13.

402
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:58,850
They are they are all zero.

403
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:12,860
So what I'm doing is I use thing and hypothesis function and then I'm specifying like literally kind of one those parameters 6 to 0.

404
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:20,900
So my mission times I study do a study SEQ two will be zero magnitude time is 33 will be zero.

405
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:26,210
My major finds and study four will be zero. So I'm just specifying literally.

406
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:32,180
But beta series equal to zero and I use equal to zero beta that is equal to zero, so on and so forth.

407
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:41,660
Those that make sense. Okay, beyond anything that I would recommend if you are using R is to make sure that the names are line.

408
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:50,630
Okay? So notice that the way I coded that treatment by all these and a g and x.

409
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:57,850
So whenever I'm using the linear hypothesis here, I have to use exactly that same.

410
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:02,890
Okay. Exactly. Exactly as I do. So just make sure that the names align.

411
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:11,520
Okay. And then that said, if you're wrong, these line of code are the output would be something like this.

412
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:21,170
And then here in the second line, you would have the chi square variable, the code square test and the p value.

413
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:31,000
Good. Now also notice that another difference between sass on heart is that, ah, you know,

414
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:36,249
they say that degrees of freedom so there is more freedom here will be if you take

415
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:42,280
this like if you take the difference between 20 and 14 here that would be six.

416
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:45,880
Okay, so just some differences.

417
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:50,920
However, the confusion is the same on the values the same. I fail to reject the new hypothesis.

418
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,800
So this is the world test while test in ah again using linear hypothesis function.

419
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:00,910
Um for the likelihood ratio pass.

420
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:06,070
This is very short U.S.A. a function on feedback to models.

421
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:17,830
But first we see the make up, which is the outcome of the small model and this is the outcome of the big model.

422
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:23,590
So if I go back a little bit, for example, feed that matter for me,

423
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:33,460
if I go back a little bit notice of because feedback my thumb is the glimpse of the is small model and then.

424
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:39,870
She brought me back down home. It's the GLM, including interaction.

425
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:47,520
So those are the two things that I have here. And then I specify in test l IQ, which is my legal racial pass.

426
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:54,660
And then here you have the likelihood ratio, which is again notice is that you take the difference between these two.

427
00:49:54,660 --> 00:50:02,760
It will give you the value that you need, which is also here and then the p value of that hypothesis.

428
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,209
We either get while passed or the likelihood rate depressed.

429
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:11,460
I fail to reject the null hypothesis. Any questions so far?

430
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:23,250
That's great because it's already time to go. So, yes, there's a little bit more.

431
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:29,400
Not much, actually. But however, we don't have time to cover it today.

432
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:33,030
I will try to be much faster for Wednesday.

433
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:39,460
If I can finish, I would like I always upload Wednesdays, lobby to Panopto.

434
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:44,730
So I live, you know like I can cover this section on maybe you can watch do a cardiac.
