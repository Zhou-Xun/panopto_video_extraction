2
00:00:06,101 --> 00:00:07,208
As we talked about,

3
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:11,850
public health is not necessarily
focused around governmental agencies.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,070
But there are a wide range of
entities outside of the government

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,220
that impact public health.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,819
Take a look at this network and
you'll see the various

7
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:23,595
organizations that contribute to the web
of a working public health system.

8
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:27,865
These include mental health organizations,
nursing homes,

9
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:31,830
civic groups, schools and employers.

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,270
Each of these entities alone,
lack the power of a combined voice,

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,680
which gives rise to coalitions.

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,130
A coalition is an organization of diverse
interest groups that join their human and

13
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,860
material resources to
produce a specific change.

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,642
This change comes about by including
major voluntaries, other NGOs or

15
00:00:51,642 --> 00:00:54,430
non governmental organizations,
hospitals and

16
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:59,710
health care systems, insurers,
academics and leaders in the community.

17
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,870
Despite the importance of the role
of government in health care,

18
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,160
it is not without it's challenges.

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,990
I'll discuss three here.

20
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,042
The first, is around coordination and
communication.

21
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:14,998
Communication among federal, state, and
local health officials, and with political

22
00:01:14,998 --> 00:01:19,030
leaders, public safety personnel and
the public is often cumbersome,

23
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,390
uncoordinated, incomplete,
and sometimes inaccurate.

24
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,290
Interagency collaboration at the federal
level can be difficult because of

25
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:32,120
the specialized nature of agency
structures from agency to agency.

26
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,490
The second, is around the integration
of federal standards.

27
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,320
The standards set on the federal level,
are difficult to integrate with state and

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,020
local systems.

29
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,640
As a result, information may be collected
in disjointed ways, across the very

30
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:52,250
jurisdictions and evaluation of programs
and services is often cumbersome.

31
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,390
Last, is around the limited role
of state and local governments.

32
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,840
State and local governments are often
seen as just another interest group, and

33
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,190
not a formalized entity of the government,
when it comes to health.

34
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:09,250
This is due, in part, by inadequate
budgets, inadequate personnel and

35
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,470
an enormous burden on
medical care clinical needs.

36
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,430
To ensure the health of our nation,

37
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,850
government's role in healthcare
is necessary, but it is just

38
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:23,350
one part of a complex network that must
involve all sectors of the community.

39
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,770
Despite the lack of
constitutional authority,

40
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,510
the federal government has
established a significant presence.

41
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,340
Federal agencies establish
research agendas,

42
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,540
inform public health practice,
and guide clinical care.

43
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,100
So, what I hope you can
see from our discussion,

44
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,200
is that the government has
an important role to play.

45
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,930
And understanding the dynamics and

46
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,789
relationships is key to understanding
how public health works.
