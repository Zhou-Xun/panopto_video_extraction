1
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:21,329
So we will. So we will start from where we left off.

2
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:31,970
You talk about the metrics of some things across products and the end there.

3
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:41,600
And basically, you know, we argued that, you know, it's very tedious to sort of write these in the summation of.

4
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:56,310
But when there are more than one predictor in the model, then there are like five predictors or B-minus, one predictors in the model.

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,959
Then it's difficult to, but it's, I think, significant.

6
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:10,410
It's just tedious to write the normal equations in the summation notation, but it's really sustained using matrix notation.

7
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:16,229
So that's where we live. So now I want to remind you about so let's,

8
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:32,820
let's talk about what we were doing in dance off from the design matrix X for though at least first or the normal equations to have a unique solution.

9
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,350
So at this point I would like to remind you about that.

10
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,600
We reviewed this module today, linear algebra.

11
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,140
So linear independence length and matrix inverse.

12
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:55,349
Suppose we have vector six one x2 to XP SPV we saw a C that these are linearly independent.

13
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:04,139
If summation C.K. X squared is not equal to zero on Louis C.K. zero four.

14
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:17,040
Okay. So essentially another way of saying is that you cannot express I mean,

15
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:24,930
you cannot express one vector, the linear combination of the other vectors for a matrix.

16
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:41,250
And Cosby then goes X is less than equal to the minimum of An and B, and it's the number of linearly independent columns or rows of X.

17
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:49,440
So this is basically when I'm pulling this from module D review of matrix algebra,

18
00:02:49,980 --> 00:03:00,900
we say X is full rank if the rank of X is minimum of and then B otherwise X is singular or rank deficient.

19
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:08,640
So here are two examples of matrix x.

20
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:16,859
So the first matrix is as normal is a two by two matrix and the first really one one and the second row is one two.

21
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,580
So my question to you is, what is the rank of this matrix?

22
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,350
You do. Great. Now let's take the matrix.

23
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:44,140
The second matrix here. And it's four by three matrix.

24
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:52,520
The first column is 1111. The second column is zero zero 1010, and the third column is ten, ten, zero zero.

25
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:59,060
What's the rank of this matrix to do again?

26
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:11,480
Why? Because as you can see, like if you add this column to this column and divide by ten, you get the first column.

27
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:21,439
So there are only two linearly independent columns of X, although there are three column.

28
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,920
So the first column is.

29
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,410
One over 10/2 column.

30
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:49,460
The third column. So the aim is to lock in a linear independence rank and matrix inverse rank of x.

31
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:56,690
Again, we view from majority rank of x is equal to rank of x,

32
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:11,730
transpose equal to rank of x x transpose equal to rank of external force x and a b by b matrix is inevitable if and only if that exists.

33
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:19,840
The matrix e inverse denoted as e superscript negative one such that.

34
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,360
So this is a scalar analog of the reciprocal of of a of a quantity.

35
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:40,180
So inverse plots that if you pre multiply or multiply by inverse, then you get the identity matrix of diamond shouldn't be crossed.

36
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:55,600
B. And this is possible if and only if the rank of E is B.

37
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:03,730
So in other words, E is a square matrix of 40 grand.

38
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:10,900
So A's inverted. But we can only if it is non singular.

39
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:21,790
Okay, fine. Now I'm going through the normal equations.

40
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,380
So we will have unique solution to the normal equations.

41
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:35,770
Remember, our normal equations are we rotate using matrix algebra as x transpose x.

42
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:45,830
Peter had equal x, transpose y and we obtain the least squares equation least squares estimate there.

43
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:59,170
The problem is normally creation, but the requirement was that x transpose x is in vertical.

44
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:10,270
But in other words, you get right, it's transport x, inverse x transpose y as the experts estimate, therefore be the head.

45
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:16,780
So this requires that x transpose x has a unique inverse.

46
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,400
Then because it's conflict, some has to be involved to win.

47
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:30,030
So in other words, to have it transpose X have a unique inverse.

48
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:46,080
This requires that the rank of x transpose x is equal to p because what is x transpose x x is interest p and so x transpose is b, cross n.

49
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:56,280
So x transpose x is because p and for that matrix to have a unique inverse what be query is

50
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:05,370
using you know this this result here that extract codex has to have brand B or in other words,

51
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:18,150
it should be full. Right now using this first result here, the rank of x is equal to rank of x transpose x.

52
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:34,650
Then what we require is that the desired matrix x has a rank equal to the number of violence which is equal to p.

53
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,790
In other words, the design matrix X has to be fully run.

54
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:56,760
Said in another way, there is no column of fakes that can be expressed as a linear combination of the other columns.

55
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,750
I want to make sure that everybody is sort of with me on this page.

56
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,490
So what is the take home message from this site? What is the bottom line?

57
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:27,960
The bottom line is that in order to have uniquely square meters, we have to have the design matrix X to be off full volume real.

58
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:43,840
Okay. And in other words, there are no violence of X, and that can be linearly expressed as a combination of the other columns.

59
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:51,930
Now note that on the slide I, I put sort of within parentheses, recall my decoding everything.

60
00:09:52,030 --> 00:10:00,700
I want to make sure that you all appreciate that there's no conflict between this

61
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:11,560
condition and multiplying in my type or linearly being sort of in a theoretical sense.

62
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:21,220
But as a practical note, what can happen?

63
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:30,060
And we will go more into the technical details of this when we talk about multiple unity.

64
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:42,550
But let's say that your design matrix is such x matrix is such that C, let's take the example of income and education.

65
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,170
Typically, income and application are highly correlated.

66
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:55,960
Suppose in the design matrix you have two columns like that that are highly correlated.

67
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,570
So it's not it's it's not that. Exactly.

68
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:13,180
You can write the the income as, you know, kind of a linear combination of education and something else like algebraically.

69
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:24,609
It doesn't hold strictly, but the correlation between income and indication is so high that the matrix x,

70
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:30,040
the designed matrix x is almost almost less than full.

71
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:40,270
Right? Or in other words, that ex-prime x x transport x matrix is almost singular.

72
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,250
Yeah. Let me finish this and I'll come to your question. So.

73
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:54,010
So that can happen. That's more of a practical sort of situation.

74
00:11:54,010 --> 00:12:04,330
And what happens then is that the expression makes matrix like the inverse of the inverse of that matrix,

75
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:11,710
because you are taking like matrix inverses, that becomes kind of unstable.

76
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,890
And that's what gets reflected in the in the mild type of linearity diagnostic.

77
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,610
So we will we will talk about this more in detail,

78
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:34,370
but I want to make sure that that you appreciate that there's a sort of a there's a distinction between these two things.

79
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:44,660
And when we're talking about it's matrix to be a full length, basically we are declaring that the inverse like it's possible to get an inverse,

80
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:53,090
but there may be data situations where that inverse might be kind of unstable.

81
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:00,590
There are ways and I have that as a footnote, and this is what I started seeing one day.

82
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:07,580
Like, you know, there's another kind of inverse the chart exactly like, you know,

83
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:18,740
inverse, but and, and it's not unique, but it can hold for like a list.

84
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:30,920
And Food and matrix is what is called a generalized or a G and without begin going into too much technical details about that.

85
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:47,390
So the so the D words is like is it is a matrix adding matrix e is a thing by you know, if e g is equal to E,

86
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:55,250
then we can write g as the generalized inverse and divided as E superscript like a minus sign.

87
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:07,040
If is a square in vertical matrix, then it turns out that in the derivative equal to the regular inverse and is unique.

88
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,610
But in other words, the generalized inverse is not unique.

89
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:19,550
So the so in the situation of less than full rank matrix, you can get a g inverse.

90
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:24,900
But we're not getting the most difficult because here we may be multiplying anything.

91
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,809
I just wanted to make sure that you all appreciate that at this point.

92
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:35,870
What we are declaring is that that x matrix, the design has to be pulled back.

93
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:43,880
So in other words, none of the plans can be expressed as a vignette on the mission of the other caller

94
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:53,640
written down by me that x transpose x is equal to one and have that uniqueness.

95
00:14:54,050 --> 00:15:00,629
Okay. Question is what is? The idea is to do that.

96
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,100
And I think that's what that's what I see.

97
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:12,929
The cure typically, you know, it almost doesn't mean anything because every thing it's black and white either for that food.

98
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:19,800
And basically it's like, you know, in a really good situation when I see it almost,

99
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:32,190
almost seems like what we happen is when you trying to compute the eating path basically you will get it something

100
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:40,860
like like we are doing scalar to be the chef if you have in the denominator a number that is being really,

101
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:45,240
really small, almost zero, it becomes unstable.

102
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:52,490
Right. So that's what I'm talking about. And I see all this because borderline like being.

103
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:00,969
Okay. Any other questions? Okay.

104
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:06,250
So no. So I know I need X to be a full column.

105
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:11,980
Right. So now let's talk about the properties of this first estimate.

106
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:19,360
So we will derive the mean and the variance of bit that.

107
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,560
So here is to remember, what is it that I'm going to first right here?

108
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:39,370
What is better had better had using the normal equations we derived X transpose and I'm going to write it's transport as ex-prime x in birth.

109
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,720
I think I'm in. Okay.

110
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,310
So France sports.

111
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:04,420
Right to play this for. There's some good.

112
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,280
So the easier notation. So that's my beta hat.

113
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:17,190
So now let's get calculate the mean and variance of the first estimate.

114
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,340
So first the mean mean of beta hat.

115
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:34,530
So I think the expectation of beta. And I know that beta hat is x transpose vaccine vertex transpose by based on the normal equations.

116
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,540
And what is the random quantity in this expression?

117
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:53,240
X is fixed. So this part here, it's transpose, it's invert, inverse x transpose.

118
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:59,360
This plot is like a constant. So I have expected value of a constant time.

119
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:05,480
So random variable y. Then I can basically take the constant outside of the expectation.

120
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:15,680
So I do x transport the inverse x transpose outside the expectation and then I'm left with the expected value of y because y is the only that number.

121
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:33,070
It is fixed so I could take the expectation out or I could pick x drive for the x inverse x transpose outside the expectation.

122
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:44,250
Now what do I do. I bloody expected value of y because remember our model is y equal.

123
00:18:44,260 --> 00:19:00,490
We expect a plus epsilon where the mean of epsilon is zero and the variance for reduced matrix of epsilon is sigma squared times the identity matrix.

124
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,500
So that was the assumption we started with. And these are all vectors.

125
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:10,270
Y is a vector B data vector x is a matrix, epsilon is a vector.

126
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:20,050
Okay. So I can write the expected value of y using this assumption I can write the expected value of y is equal to x beta.

127
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:34,280
So plug that in. And now what happens it stands for vaccine worth, cancels out with x, transpose x, and I'm left with only data.

128
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:42,090
Yes. Okay, everybody.

129
00:19:50,810 --> 00:20:00,140
So no. So that's the mean. So I have I have proved that the expected value of Bakelite is equal to better.

130
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:06,560
Or in other words, the least worse estimated to be to have is an unbiased estimate there of beta.

131
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:12,500
What about the variance? What is the variance of beta?

132
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,740
So once again, beta had this x transpose xin worth x transpose y.

133
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,460
So I just want to, you know,

134
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:36,919
have you recall this result from again modeled for random vector y in a matrix of constants in expected

135
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:45,350
value of e by is eight times expected value apply and variance of evi can be written as e times gradients,

136
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:49,880
applied time c transpose. So we are going to use this result now.

137
00:20:51,710 --> 00:21:03,350
So now what is variance of beta had once again iodide beta had as its transport vaccine worth its transpose Y from the.

138
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,100
So this is the least courtesy member of beta high of beta.

139
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:17,120
So now consider consider this as my e matrix.

140
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,270
So X transpose it's inverse expands.

141
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:26,899
So I have an expression like variance of e, but it is a matrix.

142
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,950
And why is a vector? Suppose this might e.

143
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,980
Okay. So then what do I have?

144
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:49,540
I use this result at the bottom so I can write the variance as e, which is its transpose 16 versus transpose times variance of y.

145
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,780
And then it transports.

146
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:02,780
So I have x transpose x inverse the x transpose transpose of the whole thing.

147
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:11,220
I'm just applying this result at the bottom, you know. Okay.

148
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,870
So now plug in. So I have extra because I've seen vertex transpose.

149
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,310
What is variance apply?

150
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:30,299
Just in the previous slide I wrote what the assumptions we started with Y Expedia Plus Epsilon and we had assumed that expected value of Epsilon

151
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:43,080
is zero and variance of axillary sigma squared times I the identity matrix so expected value of y is expected and what is variance of y?

152
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:51,660
Variance of y is equal to the variance of epsilon because you know, adding a constant to a random variable doesn't change that big enough.

153
00:22:52,830 --> 00:23:03,300
So variance of why is we must wait times the identity matrix of dimension and plus n so I lagging so

154
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:12,810
variance of y I know from my model is sigma squared times the identity matrix of dimension m crossing.

155
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:22,440
So I plug that in and what is the transpose of this amy prefix?

156
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:32,250
So e b so I know or I like a c d transpose is equal to be transpose c transpose.

157
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,390
I apply this line. So what do I get?

158
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:45,179
I get this part actually I can write as its transpose transpose.

159
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:50,100
So this is x and then x transpose x inverse.

160
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:59,520
Yes. So now what do I have?

161
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:03,459
The Sigma Square dance identity matrix basically C must become.

162
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:11,950
So multiply an identity matrix by matrix you get a.

163
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:19,780
So I have x transpose x inverse x transpose and then I have x x transpose inverse.

164
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:32,710
So one of the examples x inverse cancels out with the x transpose x and I'm left with sigma squared times x transpose x inverse.

165
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:43,440
So everybody clear. I hope I didn't go fast.

166
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:56,250
Okay. So that's the variance, the knowledge of the mean and the variance of the least squares estimates.

167
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:05,170
So here's a question for you. Now, last year, the variance expression.

168
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:18,940
So this expression we have now using matrix algebra, we have established this.

169
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:29,020
Does this ring a bell like you could think about when we derive the variance of the least squares?

170
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:33,280
Estimate the slope in simple linear regression.

171
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,740
Does this look somewhat like, Oh, I think I know this guy.

172
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,760
I know this one. He doesn't reflect that. Yes.

173
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:49,200
Why? And next.

174
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,810
It's a six. So remember, he doesn't really have a different model.

175
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:04,600
The variance of the slope estimate there was six Mossberg divided by a6x.

176
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:08,379
So the x stands for vaccine dose is like one.

177
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:12,670
What is this? Okay.

178
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:20,740
Oh, another question. So that's that goes with simple regression here.

179
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:26,380
The variance of beta hair. It's a matrix.

180
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:50,620
What's the dimension of this matrix? What are the diagonal elements of triplets?

181
00:26:53,280 --> 00:27:01,380
Variances of like with a lot had bigger one had we definitely had what are the abdominal movements.

182
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:09,280
The full radiance of Peter. I have been waiting to.

183
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:14,210
Okay, great. Now.

184
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:39,040
I'm going to mention two very important results that basically kind of concisely or summarize the mean and variance of the least word estimate.

185
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,300
So the first one is Golf Markov Theorem.

186
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:50,020
And what the Golf Markov to Death says is that if Y is XP beta plus accident,

187
00:27:50,770 --> 00:28:00,190
where I have made the assumption that expected value of epsilon is zero and variance of accidental sigma squared times the identity matrix.

188
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:12,190
Now I'm not here. I'm not making any normality assumption or any sort of independence assumption.

189
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,020
The assumption that I have made are that the errors are uncorrelated.

190
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:22,690
So the only assumption that I have made is with regards to the mean and the variance.

191
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:34,540
So what the glasswork of clearance says is that if X has this model with the underlying assumptions on the mean and variance of epsilon,

192
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:46,950
then beta hat, but beta hat is the least squares estimate to achieve minimum variance among linear, unbiased estimated curves.

193
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:59,740
So let's I'm not going to prove this theorem, but let's ponder over what what this theorem actually means for us.

194
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:15,430
So Beta had the least squares estimate that is referred to as the blue and blue stands for best linear, unbiased estimate for beta.

195
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:22,360
Best in what sense? Based in the sense that it has minimum variance or small step.

196
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:32,319
We should take any other linear estimate there of beta and let's call it beta.

197
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:47,290
Had the prime or beta had the one something then the least squares estimated our beta had.

198
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:57,610
We have a smaller variance than any other unbiased, linear, unbiased estimate for beta and it is best among both.

199
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:06,520
It is best among all linear, unbiased estimated dose of beta linear estimate.

200
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:17,679
There are essentially estimated words that are linear functions of the response, y and unbiased estimate.

201
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:25,120
This means that beta had satisfied this condition.

202
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,500
That expected value of beta had is equal to beta.

203
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,440
So that's the definition of unbiased this.

204
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,790
Okay? Yes. How do you get out?

205
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:07,250
All of the other things. I mean, the the what two or three of these things I can get at the these best we can

206
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:13,130
estimate those are the biggest hypotheses going to get a linear combination of one.

207
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:23,850
Something upon me, if not quite. So even lower latency for limited edition we we kind of geometrically when

208
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:28,410
before that how do you get the best line fit they go through the scatterplot.

209
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:32,180
And I said you could do many different flights, so let's get to it.

210
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:37,650
But what is the best line? The best line is dummy body awareness.

211
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:44,379
Similarly, think about to that age, like you get 1263 straight lines to that step.

212
00:31:44,380 --> 00:32:00,110
But nursing 30 here also. When I look at things that are, you know, unbiased, I mean, you know, nor do I have to look like you don't basically know,

213
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:06,659
like whether it's I'm biased or not but you get wanna stop you know,

214
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:13,360
be a linear combination of the wife that gives you that and does this what this is still this result.

215
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:20,299
The news that the these were estimated the wave of these the mysterious stranger and the

216
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:25,870
mysterious community get he's going to be the best in terms of the multimedia time all he.

217
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,910
So weekends, people you can construct.

218
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:41,990
I mean, you're not supposed to make her off of paper, but I think hypothetically different base, many different.

219
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:52,400
But the one that would give you the least Lewis Arabians is the dispossessed.

220
00:32:52,400 --> 00:33:03,660
And I did put in somebody or a seed in another way among all possible linear combinations of y you can use to get a better her.

221
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:12,650
This is the one. The LLC, or the least worse estimated is the one with the lowest obedience.

222
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:19,310
So not again among all possible linear combinations of y that you can use to the

223
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:24,470
other way to have the least worse estimated is the one with the minimum variance.

224
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,460
So it has minimum variance among all linear, unbiased estimate.

225
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:35,600
Now there is a bias variance tradeoff among unbiased estimators.

226
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:42,800
This is the best you can do. In terms of having the smallest problems.

227
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:47,450
If, on the other hand, you feel like maybe this is the question you were asking.

228
00:33:48,980 --> 00:34:02,300
If you if I am willing to allow some buyers, if I'm willing to kind of compromise on the unbiased test, then I can achieve even smaller variance.

229
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,450
So there's a five speed in straddle.

230
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:16,219
So if I'm willing to give up the business and allow some buyers, then I can get an estimate with the smaller billion volumes.

231
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:32,810
But the but what this difference is, is that like among all linear estimates that are unbiased, the least fair estimate has the minimum variance.

232
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:45,110
Okay. One thing that I want to point out is that note I am not using or the normality or the independence assumptions here.

233
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:53,830
I don't need those assumptions. Now what happens if I aired the normality assumption?

234
00:34:53,840 --> 00:35:00,440
I get something even more powerful. So you play at the normality assumption.

235
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:10,670
Then in other words, I'm saying like now I will add that Epsilon has a normal distribution with mean

236
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:15,710
zero and variance for within me fixed in my spare times the identity matrix.

237
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:23,170
So I'm adding the normality down and then I get even stronger result.

238
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:37,820
And that is basically done so that the least square estimate there is also the maximum likelihood estimate of.

239
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:53,700
Okay. How many of you have heard about the maximum likelihood estimate that.

240
00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:01,620
Okay. So the maximum likelihood estimate there.

241
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:20,730
You will formally learn in three to do, but it's a different kind of estimation method and it relies on that a human distribution.

242
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:30,240
So here the food distribution is normal and the idea is this that given the beta,

243
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:41,280
the method of maximum likelihood signs the barometer values that maximize the likelihood

244
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:49,650
or the probability of getting the observed data under the assumed distribution.

245
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:57,140
So under the assumed normal distribution of the ED.

246
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,730
I will do given and will do given the data at hand.

247
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:24,210
I'm going to find barometer values that maximize the likelihood of getting the data at hand under these ocean distribution.

248
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,610
So those are all maximum likelihood estimates.

249
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:35,700
And again, as I said, you will learn this formally in 62, but that it's a different kind of estimation method.

250
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:42,000
But conceptually, that's what's going on and it requires a distribution.

251
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:50,309
So here that for me that distribution is the normal distribution on the as the I'd like

252
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:54,880
the additional property additional assumption of a normal distribution number errors.

253
00:37:56,490 --> 00:38:09,720
So with that extra assumption of the distribution of the errors, the normality assumption, I actually get even more.

254
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:15,330
So why is x beta? This is theorem to you to reveal.

255
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,500
And what this theorem says is that if Y is equal to a plus epsilon.

256
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:30,420
And now I'm assuming that epsilon has come from a normal distribution with mean zero and variance covariance

257
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:42,130
matrix sigma squared times the identity matrix then beta that is the uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimate.

258
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:51,570
Do you know it's acronym does? I'm feeling you and the U.S. beta hat is the um view of beta.

259
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:56,010
What does this uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimate and means?

260
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:04,169
So what that means is among all estimated earth linear or not, beta hat is the best.

261
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:13,620
And if so, that's more that uniform uniformly minimum variance mean.

262
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:17,180
So among all estimate there's.

263
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:31,270
Linear or not. Baker head is the best.

264
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:40,600
Anyway. Yes.

265
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:51,180
So is it all all unbiased among all unbiased estimates?

266
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,959
The unbiased is already here. That's why I did not write it.

267
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:05,890
But you, right? Among all unbiased estimates, media or not, the name has unbiased in inside it.

268
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:14,229
It's uniformly minimum variance at best estimate, which among all unbiased estimate are linear or not beta.

269
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:24,500
That is the best. So the normality assumption buys me that extra.

270
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:31,740
Property. Questions.

271
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:55,429
Okay. So now. And actually, you know what?

272
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:58,940
Let's let's take a break here and Don.

273
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,650
Okay. Let's take a break. It's 852. Let's come back at 9:00 to.

274
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:17,588
So everybody back. So let's now.

275
00:41:18,938 --> 00:41:24,038
Oh, I think we should talk about the exam.

276
00:41:26,978 --> 00:41:35,518
So let's let me just briefly make some announcements about bass and then we carry on.

277
00:41:49,708 --> 00:42:02,998
Okay. So I wanted to say a few things about the midterm and.

278
00:42:05,138 --> 00:42:08,888
And then get it on the door. What you need.

279
00:42:11,588 --> 00:42:22,358
So how. Basically all the materials that we were doing this a total of 70.

280
00:42:22,908 --> 00:42:29,848
In the end, unfortunately, you'll be tested on all of that.

281
00:42:29,868 --> 00:42:32,118
Some modules if you need.

282
00:42:34,248 --> 00:42:45,558
I would encourage you to study the slides, go back and review the homework questions and backstage sense we will make available for you.

283
00:42:46,488 --> 00:42:51,648
Last three years of exams four 650 with the key.

284
00:42:53,238 --> 00:43:01,378
And I would very, very much recommend that you go over the fasting sense.

285
00:43:01,428 --> 00:43:07,738
I believe that. When many were studying for the exam.

286
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:19,528
So homework to you are submitting today and there will be a whole lot three that's assigned today that will be due next Tuesday.

287
00:43:20,368 --> 00:43:28,798
So what we will do is we will pause the homework, three solutions right after the deadline on October 4th.

288
00:43:30,148 --> 00:43:38,818
So please remember that no late submissions will be graded and we have already sort

289
00:43:38,818 --> 00:43:45,388
of advised the decides that they should pause the homework will solutions right.

290
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:56,758
You know kind of at midnight on on next Tuesday we won't have a question that

291
00:43:56,758 --> 00:44:03,808
asks you to write to our board to analyze data or SAS or to analyze data.

292
00:44:04,438 --> 00:44:11,438
But you may be asked to interpret some output a bit.

293
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:18,838
Now, in terms of the.

294
00:44:22,218 --> 00:44:37,968
Review session and the exam. We have checked with both Nepal and Mendi and we heard back from them yesterday so far.

295
00:44:38,628 --> 00:44:42,708
A speech for wind regulations.

296
00:44:44,568 --> 00:44:58,877
We are okay to hold the exam for both sections and the review for both sections jointly in this room said this in their speech to auditorium.

297
00:44:58,878 --> 00:45:07,068
So for people in this section, nothing changes for the review as well as the exam.

298
00:45:07,088 --> 00:45:21,018
You come here. But for folks in section one for the review and exam, they will come and kind of do both of those in the auditorium.

299
00:45:21,738 --> 00:45:30,018
And the reason why we wanted to do the review jointly is because then you see both like myself and the song,

300
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:35,558
we will kind of big dance, answering questions and doing some review problems.

301
00:45:35,568 --> 00:45:45,848
We did bit like this on so fast. You are so basically, you know and then you know,

302
00:45:45,858 --> 00:45:59,718
the the students across both sections sort of get to experience the review session together simultaneously because we are trying,

303
00:46:00,138 --> 00:46:13,458
trying our very, very best to coordinate the two sections, almost like one as a as a sort of duplicate of the other.

304
00:46:14,028 --> 00:46:20,808
So this is another effort to kind of synchronize things very closely.

305
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:27,468
The exam also, you will think here this room and it will be held jointly.

306
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:33,378
This will be the in-person close notes, close book exam.

307
00:46:34,068 --> 00:46:40,668
But you are allowed to bring one standard sheet of paper with handwritten formulae.

308
00:46:41,448 --> 00:46:53,687
You can use both sides of the paper and please, please bring a basic calculator with only a basic calculator and you will use a calculator.

309
00:46:53,688 --> 00:46:58,157
However, you must show steps prior to using the calculator.

310
00:46:58,158 --> 00:47:05,538
For example, if you are evaluating a test statistic there, it is formed as a ratio of quantities.

311
00:47:06,018 --> 00:47:13,337
Then please sure both the numbers as a B fuel and then compute the value using your calculator.

312
00:47:13,338 --> 00:47:21,047
And then the reason we are asking you to do that is because sometimes, you know, you end up making a mistake in the calculation.

313
00:47:21,048 --> 00:47:26,117
We can still give you partial credit for kind of doing it the right way.

314
00:47:26,118 --> 00:47:32,448
And generally, I, you know, I don't like to take off points for like, you know,

315
00:47:32,538 --> 00:47:38,208
miscalculating something if I see that you have sort of approached it the right way.

316
00:47:38,598 --> 00:47:49,428
So we give more credit to getting the right answer in the right manner and we give more credit,

317
00:47:50,238 --> 00:47:55,877
even if you got a wrong answer, but you get the right track.

318
00:47:55,878 --> 00:48:03,228
So we try to do that before that. So please join your do not collaborate with others during the exam.

319
00:48:03,678 --> 00:48:06,907
Any perception of collaboration with other students.

320
00:48:06,908 --> 00:48:15,858
The exam would be considered a misconduct and and you will be expected to turn off all cell phones and remove all headphones.

321
00:48:20,158 --> 00:48:27,058
During the exam. As I said, to get full credit, you must show all work unless something has been proved in class.

322
00:48:28,228 --> 00:48:39,808
If there's a result that we blew up in class, you can sort of mention that and you can say building class and using that result.

323
00:48:41,278 --> 00:48:48,117
But otherwise you must show all your work and unsupported answers, maybe even no credit if you simply, you know,

324
00:48:48,118 --> 00:48:59,638
sort of write down a number and you actually don't show your work and don't support your logic steps, then you may not receive any credit.

325
00:49:00,928 --> 00:49:03,958
There will be 4 to 5 questions on the exam.

326
00:49:03,968 --> 00:49:10,078
So I said about four at this point. But when we do the review next year,

327
00:49:10,108 --> 00:49:18,268
then we we can tell you exactly how many questions are there on the exam and each question will have multiple parts.

328
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:24,058
Typically there's a question that's like a two false statements.

329
00:49:25,408 --> 00:49:31,828
Then there's a there is typically a question where, as I said, that you won't be expected to write false.

330
00:49:32,338 --> 00:49:43,348
But we can you do talk about that to ask you to interpret the results and of of a detailed analysis and comment.

331
00:49:44,428 --> 00:49:50,358
So there could be a question like that and there could also be a question on here.

332
00:49:50,668 --> 00:49:51,358
Methods.

333
00:49:52,708 --> 00:50:02,308
Questions will be very similar to materials covered in lectures, slides, homework passed exams, but not exactly the same during the review session.

334
00:50:02,308 --> 00:50:12,418
Next week, Tuesday, we will do some fast exam problems and we share the exam with you.

335
00:50:14,998 --> 00:50:32,727
And often the key would be we will work out some exam problems and typically what are you requested by Saturday of this week if you do have,

336
00:50:32,728 --> 00:50:45,778
let's say, for the review, if you want us to kind of talk about a third topic that seems like you need a bit more clarification.

337
00:50:45,778 --> 00:50:58,498
Some participants using you want us to kind of forward it one more time or do you have questions then please send that to me by Saturday.

338
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:08,808
And what we do is we kind of pulling down questions that cross the sections and we would talk about this.

339
00:51:09,568 --> 00:51:15,148
If I do not get any questions from, from the class,

340
00:51:15,958 --> 00:51:24,448
then we are going to sort of structure the review our own way and we are going to solve mostly problems from fast exams.

341
00:51:25,078 --> 00:51:30,477
But usually overview is done best if it's a combination of both.

342
00:51:30,478 --> 00:51:36,717
So in the past what has happened is students have sent me questions like, you know, this part wasn't very clear.

343
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:44,338
Can you describe such and such and such and such, and can you please explain this part one more time?

344
00:51:44,488 --> 00:51:48,117
And so a few like that.

345
00:51:48,118 --> 00:51:58,348
And then we solve some problems to class the exam usually like a review and the that structure format works best for everyone.

346
00:51:58,708 --> 00:52:02,428
So please, please send me questions.

347
00:52:04,628 --> 00:52:20,878
And if you want me to discuss certain aspects of certain parts, certain topics, note that the problems are not going to be of equal difficulty.

348
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:34,988
So why during the exam if if you kind of little problem do you clean that you know you are not getting them so immediately

349
00:52:34,988 --> 00:52:46,218
and it seems that stuff then skip and and you know sort of finish other problems and then come back to the problem too.

350
00:52:46,228 --> 00:52:52,918
So it doesn't mean that all problems are just a standalone problem.

351
00:52:52,918 --> 00:52:56,157
You don't just overspent on one problem.

352
00:52:56,158 --> 00:53:01,138
People with other problems finish them and then come back. So that's kind of a general advice.

353
00:53:04,618 --> 00:53:08,008
So that's all I wanted to say today.

354
00:53:10,648 --> 00:53:17,398
So between now and you said your job would be to.

355
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:27,068
While you were reviewing. Then, you know, send me questions.

356
00:53:29,618 --> 00:53:42,688
And the government works. And do you recall what declined to do session next Tuesday?

357
00:53:44,338 --> 00:53:48,808
In this room and I'm about to go spastic san.

358
00:53:52,148 --> 00:53:57,658
Any questions? Yes.

359
00:53:58,408 --> 00:54:05,778
All right. Or he looks like he can't make.

360
00:54:08,568 --> 00:54:12,408
It's. It's totally up to you how you want me to set space.

361
00:54:12,498 --> 00:54:16,428
You are only allowed to be one internal conflict within.

362
00:54:18,568 --> 00:54:23,878
Piece of paper, and you were right on both sides. But how you want to use that piece.

363
00:54:31,088 --> 00:54:36,508
Any other questions? Okay.

364
00:54:37,918 --> 00:54:41,308
So I have uploaded this on canvas, but.

365
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:54,267
We will, you know, on the day of the review, we will kind of talk more about the specifics of the exam.

366
00:54:54,268 --> 00:55:01,908
So let me be able to tell you that exactly four questions out of the five questions and things like that.

367
00:55:01,918 --> 00:55:09,988
But but mostly we will do a review full length of the funding for the exam.

368
00:55:10,948 --> 00:55:19,378
So to use this class, remember, will not be regular lecture, it will be entirely free.

369
00:55:20,788 --> 00:55:24,898
When I say you will not be reading a lecture, I mean likely not covered in any new materials.

370
00:55:26,218 --> 00:55:32,798
Okay. Yes. Mistakes and especially.

371
00:55:34,818 --> 00:55:40,458
I was thinking it's the first. And who speaks.

372
00:55:40,858 --> 00:55:45,377
And especially you. Can you it?

373
00:55:45,378 --> 00:55:49,228
And it's an expression that you formally won't be Leavenworth.

374
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:54,738
He is thinking of moving in the whole world. Yes, you can.

375
00:55:55,278 --> 00:56:00,348
You can say in order to improve this, you could stop.

376
00:56:08,108 --> 00:56:19,358
So for example, I mean, you know, I'm just going to use one example of that just in this next slide that we're going to talk about.

377
00:56:21,948 --> 00:56:26,948
So if if there's a result like that, yes, you can see, you know.

378
00:56:27,878 --> 00:56:34,338
Okay, any other questions? Okay.

379
00:56:34,338 --> 00:56:54,138
So if not, let's go to now let's talk about the seated values, the means and the variances of why you have to fast.

380
00:56:54,888 --> 00:57:01,338
Let's talk about the pleated mean. So the better of fitted means is why you have.

381
00:57:01,878 --> 00:57:05,358
Right. And why that is so?

382
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:20,448
Why is it speed up? Plus it's. And I have better hat is that, let's see, the least good system there.

383
00:57:21,748 --> 00:57:27,208
So what is why have why had? Is it better had?

384
00:57:31,158 --> 00:57:39,078
So ex beat the heck. And then I mean, the expression for data had the least squares estimate there.

385
00:57:39,768 --> 00:57:55,408
So we had this example that's in verse X, transpose Y and this matrix it's, it's transpose it see number six transpose I denote by E.

386
00:57:58,788 --> 00:58:11,838
So I I can write y hat is equal to eight times y where each is the matrix x x transpose x inverse its transpose.

387
00:58:13,428 --> 00:58:23,448
This is called the hat matrix. This is a very, very important matrix in linear regression.

388
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:30,938
It's called the hat matrix y because it puts a hat on y.

389
00:58:33,828 --> 00:58:48,977
The matrix h is crossing because X is in graph B, so an expression makes this b cross B, its frame is b cross n.

390
00:58:48,978 --> 00:59:04,878
So x it's time for the x inverse x transpose is in cross n and note that the hot matrix h only involves x the covariance.

391
00:59:05,178 --> 00:59:15,258
So there's nothing vendome about the matrix because it only involves the full radius and what happens.

392
00:59:16,248 --> 00:59:19,428
So some what are some properties of the hat matrix.

393
00:59:20,778 --> 00:59:26,507
So this is where I said that we're in the next slide I'm going to use exactly like,

394
00:59:26,508 --> 00:59:33,617
you know, the question you ask you forward in homework to that the height matrix.

395
00:59:33,618 --> 00:59:37,788
It is symmetric and it's important. Yes.

396
00:59:38,118 --> 00:59:41,808
Problem, do you call it like B?

397
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:54,498
So you thought that this is symmetric and it's important and it's very easy to show that because what is it is it's x transposed inverse,

398
00:59:55,008 --> 01:00:08,988
it's transpose. So transpose of e to is, you know, a, b, c transposes C transpose B transpose a transpose.

399
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:20,498
So X transpose transposes x. It's transposed, it's inverse inverse transpose.

400
01:00:20,498 --> 01:00:29,468
You can interchange its transport and what is eight square eight times eight.

401
01:00:33,488 --> 01:00:47,978
Is x. X transpose x inverse x transport and then you write h one more time x x transpose that inverse x transpose.

402
01:00:50,468 --> 01:00:54,877
So this gets canceled with this and you are left with H.

403
01:00:54,878 --> 01:01:00,008
So H squared is equal to H, so you should eight is symmetric.

404
01:01:00,008 --> 01:01:03,848
And I'd important in other words, it's a prediction matrix.

405
01:01:04,358 --> 01:01:13,207
And in in in this module, Bibi said that if it is a prediction matrix,

406
01:01:13,208 --> 01:01:21,488
then I minus H identity minus eight is also symmetric and I am open to that because it's a prediction matrix.

407
01:01:22,018 --> 01:01:27,458
But what about h times x h ten sixes.

408
01:01:28,448 --> 01:01:34,628
You can write it as I identity matrix minus three times x.

409
01:01:38,758 --> 01:01:42,928
He's equal to zero. So X minus each X is equal to zero.

410
01:01:43,618 --> 01:01:53,038
You can write it like this. Take the transport on both sides.

411
01:01:53,048 --> 01:02:02,078
You have external force times. I think the minus eight is zero transport of the zero vector is zero.

412
01:02:05,858 --> 01:02:13,327
It's now all better. Sorry.

413
01:02:13,328 --> 01:02:17,317
It's not a rule vector, but the dimensions in the expert column vector.

414
01:02:17,318 --> 01:02:22,238
Then it's transposed. Would freedom so correct.

415
01:02:23,828 --> 01:02:42,188
So hence I can write x transpose times identity minus c multiplied by y adds that is equal to zero.

416
01:02:42,788 --> 01:02:48,668
But I can write this says x transpose y minus eight y.

417
01:02:51,598 --> 01:02:55,528
Right. This part is Y minus H1 one.

418
01:02:59,268 --> 01:03:03,408
Yes. Okay.

419
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:16,068
And what did they try? It was why he had so s force y minus y you had.

420
01:03:24,758 --> 01:03:31,748
What is y minus y you had, by definition, the residuals epsilon had.

421
01:03:32,648 --> 01:03:36,938
So what do what have I got? X strong spores.

422
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:44,948
Epsilon hap is equal to zero, meaning the under saved.

423
01:03:44,948 --> 01:03:50,438
In plain English residuals are well known to the.

424
01:03:54,168 --> 01:04:05,038
Design matrix. Okay.

425
01:04:06,928 --> 01:04:10,138
Is everybody with me on this or have I lost you?

426
01:04:16,428 --> 01:04:29,438
Any steps. Not clear here. Okay.

427
01:04:30,278 --> 01:04:34,867
So that's the vector of the treated means.

428
01:04:34,868 --> 01:04:40,898
So basically what he had is again always like this each time fly.

429
01:04:45,608 --> 01:04:58,448
Okay. So a little bit more on the projection for Booth six and why the projection why he had to fly on do X is given by this Y had these

430
01:04:58,988 --> 01:05:10,328
extra schools Y divided by example this time set so it's here I have a on the left hand side I have a pictorial depiction of this.

431
01:05:10,328 --> 01:05:17,528
So I have I have y here.

432
01:05:18,968 --> 01:05:26,428
This is my x. And this vivid section here.

433
01:05:29,628 --> 01:05:36,498
This red line here. Who's the projection of Y?

434
01:05:39,078 --> 01:05:51,388
On to X? So the aim is to minimize the norm of epsilon.

435
01:05:51,908 --> 01:06:02,728
So the double line by a vector double bar to double barred by the vector is basically the norm.

436
01:06:08,788 --> 01:06:12,598
Of the vector. So the aim is to minimize that.

437
01:06:13,588 --> 01:06:19,048
And what is epsilon? Truly sorry if its epsilon had.

438
01:06:23,428 --> 01:06:27,237
The dual metric equivalent of what we did in simple linear regression.

439
01:06:27,238 --> 01:06:42,468
So the aim is to minimize the sum of squares of the epsilon hearts and the vector notation, and I can write it as normal if epsilon had.

440
01:06:42,478 --> 01:06:46,438
But this is really like this plot of the sum of the squares of.

441
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:59,287
My definition. This is why minus y had epsilon headed by minus y head.

442
01:06:59,288 --> 01:07:17,498
So the aim is to minimize the normal phi minus y hat and or in other words, we have to find it sidestep the normal y minus e hat x is minimized.

443
01:07:18,218 --> 01:07:22,178
So. So the idea this is kind of geometrically what is happening.

444
01:07:22,178 --> 01:07:26,797
So parallel drawing, the parallel between what we did in in simple linear regression,

445
01:07:26,798 --> 01:07:33,098
how we saw geometrically what's going on the production line that lies on the X space.

446
01:07:33,968 --> 01:07:48,338
And we need to determine the length of this a hat so geometrically e hat should be selected so that Epsilon had the residuals when we started this,

447
01:07:48,878 --> 01:07:54,008
we think the hat so that the residuals are to one or two x.

448
01:07:54,098 --> 01:08:06,748
What we proved before in this slide, the residuals are orthogonal to the space and generated by the design matrix.

449
01:08:06,788 --> 01:08:10,538
Basically we are saying we are seeing this geometrically.

450
01:08:12,128 --> 01:08:18,248
So if X is an interesting matrix of rank P and is greater than equal to P,

451
01:08:18,608 --> 01:08:27,457
then the projection of the vector Y on to the column space of x is given by y.

452
01:08:27,458 --> 01:08:34,688
You had equal to x x times for vaccines versus transpose y, which is each of y.

453
01:08:34,688 --> 01:08:44,858
So you know what we kind of showed algebraically in this slide geometrically.

454
01:08:47,898 --> 01:08:50,988
This slide shows what's what's happening, what's going on.

455
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:58,937
So what what's really the opportunity means in either geometric perspective

456
01:08:58,938 --> 01:09:04,938
leg of the wreckage will be not to do on the orbit it's a geometrically one.

457
01:09:05,148 --> 01:09:15,198
And so on the ground we have the X space and we have the vector y here.

458
01:09:15,498 --> 01:09:23,178
And Y you had also is the projection of Y on to the x space.

459
01:09:23,628 --> 01:09:32,088
And the idea is geometrically we aim to find data have such that the distance between y in y effect is minimized.

460
01:09:32,088 --> 01:09:44,148
So once again, if you recall a salad how we did I do omit or how we sort of saw geometrically what does it mean to talk about you know the oil is how

461
01:09:44,168 --> 01:09:55,938
we obtained our this estimate that was were dropping from each Y to like you know the the sort of the best line and the projection.

462
01:09:56,358 --> 01:10:02,898
And we were saying that, you know, you you minimize the sum of squared distances of the epsilon impacts.

463
01:10:03,498 --> 01:10:08,928
So the idea is you would minimize epsilon sum of squares of the epsilon effect.

464
01:10:08,928 --> 01:10:21,737
So in other words, minimize the norm of the residual select b hat in such a way so that the residual and covariates are orthogonal,

465
01:10:21,738 --> 01:10:26,328
which is basically what we sort of proved algebraically.

466
01:10:26,718 --> 01:10:39,858
So in other words, it's transpose epsilon had strong of y minus y hat and white hat I know is basically x minus beta had.

467
01:10:40,338 --> 01:10:50,418
So you get extra unschooled y minus x transpose x peter hat and I know better hat is example that in vertex transpose y so it's basically zero.

468
01:10:51,228 --> 01:10:56,898
So in other words, what we are saying that this also should be Epsilon hat.

469
01:11:04,708 --> 01:11:10,638
That the the residuals are parallel to the full period.

470
01:11:10,648 --> 01:11:28,068
So if you take the final product off, it's okay, any column of the designed matrix with Epsilon hacked, then that's enough for all key.

471
01:11:30,298 --> 01:11:42,728
So once again, h y gives a prediction of y on the column space of x and that's what is going on here.

472
01:11:42,748 --> 01:11:51,567
So that's kind of the geometric perspective of what is going on on the ground.

473
01:11:51,568 --> 01:11:55,168
We have the design matrix, X, the entropy.

474
01:11:55,168 --> 01:11:59,398
It's easier to see this in two dimensions than as we saw in the slides.

475
01:11:59,938 --> 01:12:04,798
It becomes more and more complicated to conceptualize it in higher dimension.

476
01:12:05,728 --> 01:12:08,758
Or in other words, when P increases some.

477
01:12:09,238 --> 01:12:18,207
But that's what is going on. So you have on the ground X the design matrix and cross P and Y,

478
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:28,738
you had the H time slide on the pole, you had the Epsilon hat, which is basically y minus y you had.

479
01:12:31,298 --> 01:12:42,498
And. Therefore, Absalom had, in order to win over both X and Y, had this,

480
01:12:42,498 --> 01:12:56,478
we proved algebraically also and geometrically we see that the residuals also have to be orthogonal to y hat.

481
01:12:56,838 --> 01:13:01,998
But you can also prove this algebraically and it's based, you know,

482
01:13:02,718 --> 01:13:08,748
sort of the easiest way to prove this algebraically is what is y had remember y you

483
01:13:08,748 --> 01:13:21,648
had is h times y so you can write this expression as h y transpose epsilon hat,

484
01:13:22,968 --> 01:13:31,338
correct? So you can write it as y prime h prime Epsilon hat?

485
01:13:32,838 --> 01:13:37,308
Yes. And what is Epsilon hat.

486
01:13:39,408 --> 01:13:48,688
I can write Epsilon hat as y minus. Y minus y hat.

487
01:13:49,768 --> 01:13:55,008
By definition. Correct.

488
01:13:56,748 --> 01:14:00,588
So I can write this? Yes. Why prime?

489
01:14:02,208 --> 01:14:06,588
Each prime rate is symmetric and it's important so I can write.

490
01:14:06,588 --> 01:14:15,738
This is y prime h y minus what is y had y had is eight times y.

491
01:14:22,998 --> 01:14:29,268
So this is equal to white prime h y minus y.

492
01:14:29,268 --> 01:14:33,258
Prime eight squared y.

493
01:14:40,378 --> 01:14:43,998
Okay. It.

494
01:14:43,998 --> 01:14:47,988
Is it important? Means a square.

495
01:14:48,438 --> 01:14:52,308
It is symmetry. And each squared is equal to each.

496
01:14:54,498 --> 01:14:59,238
So I can write this as.

497
01:15:03,088 --> 01:15:12,478
White brown AQI minus because it is an important white place, eight square mile each.

498
01:15:18,438 --> 01:15:29,788
Which is equal to zero. Yeah.

499
01:15:39,578 --> 01:15:49,668
Clear. So it's easier to see this geometrically in in two dimensions.

500
01:15:50,868 --> 01:15:57,918
But these hold even in higher dimensions.

501
01:16:00,338 --> 01:16:10,678
And. You can begin some of these results algebraically.

502
01:16:14,218 --> 01:16:24,118
Recognizing that each of the happening pieces of collection make except the X, Y, or Z in the space of x.

503
01:16:26,338 --> 01:16:42,258
And. It does so then that the residuals are optimal to hold the design space as well as the white hat.

504
01:16:45,278 --> 01:16:48,728
Okay. Any questions?

505
01:16:54,748 --> 01:17:01,588
So let's talk about the properties of the fitted means. Why that is we call each one.

506
01:17:01,858 --> 01:17:03,958
So I need to take the expedition of this.

507
01:17:06,928 --> 01:17:22,678
So what do I get me out of while I have, you know, the expected value of defeated means is I can write at the expected value of each way.

508
01:17:23,518 --> 01:17:29,808
Each remember is clearly a matrix of x.

509
01:17:35,468 --> 01:17:38,438
There's nothing random about it. It's. It's like a constant.

510
01:17:38,438 --> 01:17:44,648
So I can take it outside the expectation sign and I get each day an expected value of quite.

511
01:17:49,278 --> 01:17:53,268
What is the expected value of y under the model is x mater.

512
01:17:53,388 --> 01:17:56,538
So you can write it as eight times Epstein's paper.

513
01:18:01,908 --> 01:18:11,048
Yes. And what did they look?

514
01:18:13,668 --> 01:18:18,138
Two earlier that each same sex is equal to x.

515
01:18:26,928 --> 01:18:30,378
So I replaced my ex. I get a better.

516
01:18:34,408 --> 01:18:39,898
So why have these unbiased for expected value of why?

517
01:18:52,158 --> 01:19:05,888
Everybody okay with this? When I see why work is done by spirit, but the value of flight expected value of fly has x, b, tiny, right?

518
01:19:05,898 --> 01:19:10,367
So and beta is unknown. So it's a it's a it's an unknown quantity.

519
01:19:10,368 --> 01:19:26,008
It involves a barometer. So what I'm saying is that we have defeated that we can be using.

520
01:19:26,008 --> 01:19:35,458
The embassy gives me an unbiased estimate for expected life.

521
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:52,698
I mean, if they wanted to say it in plain English, what I'm saying is the predictive values the predicted means are unbiased.

522
01:19:52,708 --> 01:19:59,298
All the. Okay.

523
01:19:59,548 --> 01:20:07,428
What about the variance? What about the variance of why you have?

524
01:20:10,738 --> 01:20:14,698
So once again I'm going to use by hand equal to eight times y.

525
01:20:15,328 --> 01:20:30,658
So variance of y had this variance of h times y eight is like my matrix e in the resolved in the not because the only random part is coming from y.

526
01:20:30,748 --> 01:20:39,028
So I can write it as eight times variance, five times each transpose applying this result in the footnote.

527
01:20:42,978 --> 01:20:49,128
And what is billions of why? Because remember, we have this model X better plus epsilon.

528
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:57,068
Well, once again, we had assumed this.

529
01:21:04,048 --> 01:21:13,438
So the variance of why is again sigma spread times the identity matrix of dimension and cross n so from 13 so eight

530
01:21:13,438 --> 01:21:25,738
sigma spread identity matrix times h transports and age and each transport are the same because H is symmetric.

531
01:21:25,768 --> 01:21:34,708
So I can write this as H. So I get sigma squared times h, times h.

532
01:21:35,218 --> 01:21:41,218
H, times identity matrix time C. So I get sigma squared, eight squared.

533
01:21:43,318 --> 01:21:48,028
But it is important to the squared of the matrix as it is itself.

534
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:58,488
So I get sigma squared primacy. So the variance of why that is the most work by A.H.

535
01:22:02,228 --> 01:22:08,058
Okay. All good.

536
01:22:08,268 --> 01:22:14,458
But now, when I fought the regime normality, what do I get?

537
01:22:14,478 --> 01:22:19,248
So now I'm assuming that the Syrians are coming from a normal distribution.

538
01:22:21,518 --> 01:22:27,948
Then I have already established the mean y hat and the reunion.

539
01:22:27,948 --> 01:22:33,498
So fly back. I've already established this group.

540
01:22:35,538 --> 01:22:41,088
Now I have that if still has a normal distribution.

541
01:22:42,108 --> 01:22:50,118
So if Epsilon has a normal distribution and why is it de plus epsilon?

542
01:22:54,678 --> 01:23:06,587
Then why also has the normal distribution with meaning speed and variance will be reinstated sequel to six months time.

543
01:23:06,588 --> 01:23:14,307
So identity matrix. And what about why, PRATT Why you had these eight times?

544
01:23:14,308 --> 01:23:22,048
Why? So it's a linear combination of why a linear combination of normals is also normal.

545
01:23:26,368 --> 01:23:32,068
Yes. So what? What about the distribution of why that why you have these also normal.

546
01:23:34,928 --> 01:23:50,048
Because linear combination of normals. Abnormals also known not.

547
01:23:54,648 --> 01:24:00,887
And I have already derived the this the mean and the variance of why that so why you have it the normal

548
01:24:00,888 --> 01:24:07,998
distribution the mean equal breaks greater and variance convenience matrix in my spare time stage.

549
01:24:13,728 --> 01:24:23,528
Okay. I have already derived this in the previous two slides.

550
01:24:24,158 --> 01:24:35,778
Finally, I want to of fame derive the properties of the residual back to the excellent hat.

551
01:24:35,798 --> 01:24:40,718
So let's let's talk about Epsilon hat. Let's talk about the residuals for now.

552
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:45,488
So first, we in the mean of Epsilon Hat.

553
01:24:45,488 --> 01:24:59,648
So let's what is the mean of Epsilon hat? So Epsilon had is y minus y you had or in another words, it's y minus eight times y.

554
01:25:00,548 --> 01:25:04,448
So I can write it as I. Minus eight times y.

555
01:25:08,748 --> 01:25:19,728
So I did as acquitted value of the identity matrix minus the hat matrix, the whole thing multiplied by one once again,

556
01:25:20,088 --> 01:25:25,188
because the I minus the matrix is like a constant because there's nothing then the.

557
01:25:25,608 --> 01:25:29,688
It's all made up of the columns of the designed matrix.

558
01:25:29,748 --> 01:25:37,518
So I get outside the expectation sign I minus eight and then I find the expected value of Y.

559
01:25:40,588 --> 01:25:50,908
Under the model. I know expected value of y is basically a beta, so I have II minus the time fixed beta.

560
01:25:52,198 --> 01:25:59,808
So in other words, this whole thing becomes, I don't think speed down, which is eight speed down, minus eight, it's beta.

561
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:07,828
I've already shown that eight x is equal to x because eight is a prediction matrix.

562
01:26:10,488 --> 01:26:15,368
So I have expected minus eight speed equals.

563
01:26:17,608 --> 01:26:24,448
So the medium the residual to zero so that's what the is does the mean of residual.

564
01:26:28,248 --> 01:26:34,028
Is. What are the variants?

565
01:26:36,378 --> 01:26:43,238
So now let's up in the variants of Obsidian had. So what is variants of epsilon?

566
01:26:43,538 --> 01:26:52,388
Again, I'm going to write Epsilon happens y minus my hat or in other words, variance of I minus eight times y.

567
01:26:53,108 --> 01:27:02,047
So treat this as like the matrix in in the in the result in the food.

568
01:27:02,048 --> 01:27:06,368
No. And I'm going to use this, apply this result.

569
01:27:06,998 --> 01:27:17,258
So I have variance of y minus each times y is equal to I minus C variants of y times I minus h transpose.

570
01:27:22,458 --> 01:27:27,078
Okay. What is variance of y one seeking from the linear model?

571
01:27:27,078 --> 01:27:40,338
We have written it many times. Variance of y is equal to variance of epsilon equal to sigma squared times the identity matrix.

572
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:51,828
So I plug that in. So Sigma squared identity matrix is sandwiched between two matrices, I minus eight and I minus each transpose.

573
01:27:53,058 --> 01:28:00,048
We have shown B before a few slides back that each is a projection matrix.

574
01:28:01,848 --> 01:28:07,698
It's symmetric and it's important and so I might need eight is also symmetric four and so

575
01:28:07,698 --> 01:28:17,418
what do I have sigma square times I minus two times I minus each which is equal to by,

576
01:28:17,448 --> 01:28:22,157
I think potency of I minus de gypsy moth squared times by minus eight.

577
01:28:22,158 --> 01:28:27,618
So that's the variance of the residuals.

578
01:28:28,548 --> 01:28:35,298
So I am going to end with one.

579
01:28:38,568 --> 01:28:42,468
So so I'm going to end with this slide.

580
01:28:42,488 --> 01:28:52,208
So we have already proved or established the mean and the variance of the Epsilon hats now only so far to take to normality.

581
01:28:53,228 --> 01:28:59,108
Meaning I'm assuming that Epsilon has normal distribution, which means it obediently must.

582
01:28:59,108 --> 01:29:01,148
But I mean, once again,

583
01:29:01,658 --> 01:29:12,518
since Epsilon I had is and we didn't as I minus each times y so it's a linear combination of normal that once again I get a normal.

584
01:29:14,018 --> 01:29:19,688
So the receipt words are also normally distributed with mean equal to zero.

585
01:29:20,258 --> 01:29:32,828
Which are your pain from two slides back and variance equal to sigma squared times the identity minus h mean.

586
01:29:33,248 --> 01:29:37,508
So that's the result. So I'm going to end here.

587
01:29:37,508 --> 01:29:41,228
But before I leave, I have a quick question for you.

588
01:29:41,708 --> 01:29:54,068
So I want so in the model I assume that the errors are independent epsilon the true errors are independent.

589
01:29:56,088 --> 01:30:06,388
Are the residuals independent? The Crusaders are independent.

590
01:30:06,848 --> 01:30:15,718
That's my assumption, correct? Other recipients in the back.

591
01:30:22,588 --> 01:30:25,938
Hmm. If girls independent.

592
01:30:26,058 --> 01:30:29,448
Okay. Any other. Huh? I'm guessing.

593
01:30:30,198 --> 01:30:33,498
You're guessing? No. You want to guess?

594
01:30:33,508 --> 01:30:41,308
You know, y y you do get to see what is this resulting in New Zealand have hasn't.

595
01:30:41,718 --> 01:30:46,877
I mean, even forget about this result. What is this result?

596
01:30:46,878 --> 01:30:54,858
Telling the variance covariance matrix of epsilon is sigma squared times I minus h.

597
01:30:56,748 --> 01:31:00,348
So the pool for radians between epsilon.

598
01:31:00,348 --> 01:31:05,567
Ah, you have an excellent G hat will be a term like what.

599
01:31:05,568 --> 01:31:09,398
C plus Fairmont. My Sigma Square each.

600
01:31:09,408 --> 01:31:17,328
I dare you cancel that it is because there's no like doesn't necessarily.

601
01:31:18,348 --> 01:31:21,368
So the visitors are very much for kids.

602
01:31:27,458 --> 01:31:32,638
The Druids are independent. I'm 42, but I received little long, you know.

603
01:31:32,768 --> 01:31:39,428
But it's, you know, it's a very good story. Once, actually, you're encouraging people to make a whole lot of sense.

604
01:31:39,998 --> 01:31:44,028
What are the residuals? Y minus y? How are you getting the Y hits?

605
01:31:44,858 --> 01:31:54,888
You are one of the issues. Yeah.

606
01:32:01,298 --> 01:32:02,468
For the median zero.

607
01:32:02,478 --> 01:32:14,258
But the bottom line of this is that that is the doing of studying, depending on what the recipients and what the residuals are very much correlated.

608
01:32:14,798 --> 01:32:17,888
I often like to give this question in the exam.

609
01:32:22,768 --> 01:32:30,248
Like not not like this, but some kind of weird death.

610
01:32:31,658 --> 01:32:34,828
So it was a really nice coincidence.

611
01:32:35,458 --> 01:32:45,538
Okay, I'm going to stop here and we will come back.

612
01:33:00,928 --> 01:33:01,868
If I do.
