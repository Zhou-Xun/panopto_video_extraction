00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:25,760
Hello and welcome. I'm Ken Warner, and I'm here today with a panel of experts to discuss some important issues facing the future of public health.

2
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:32,450
They're going to share with us their ideas and insights about seemingly disparate issues such as climate change,

3
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:39,320
precision medicine and the management of our health care system, and how these will influence public health in the future.

4
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,740
Before we get started, let me introduce our panel.

5
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:51,980
Marianne Phillips is the executive director of the Center for Health Care Research and Transformation or CHART at the University of Michigan.

6
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,720
Chart is an independent 501c3 impact organization with a mission to advance evidence based care delivery,

7
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:06,500
improve population health, and expand access to care from 24 through 27.

8
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,550
Marianne was director of the Michigan Department of Human Services, appointed by Governor Jennifer Granholm.

9
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:21,530
Marianne came to State Service from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, where she served in leadership roles for over 20 years,

10
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,810
most recently as senior vice president of health care products and Provider Services.

11
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:32,870
She holds a master's degree in Health Services Administration from the University of Michigan School of Public Health.

12
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:42,050
Welcome, Marianne. Great to be here, Ken. Thank you. Dr. Scott Tomlins obtained his M.D., Ph.D. at the University of Michigan Medical School.

13
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:51,950
He completed residency in Anatomic Pathology at Michigan Medicine in June 2012 and is currently an Associate Professor of Pathology and Urology.

14
00:01:52,550 --> 00:02:02,240
His coauthored over 170 manuscripts, focusing on the integrative analysis, functional characterization and clinical translation of cancer genomics.

15
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:10,850
Most recently, he's focused on the development, validation and application of broadly applicable precision oncology approaches.

16
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:19,430
Welcome, Scott. Thanks, Ken. Eric Black is a faculty member in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Michigan.

17
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:25,040
He has a bachelor's degree in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from MIT and

18
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,049
Masters and Ph.D. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California,

19
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:36,140
Berkeley. His research encompasses principles of air quality engineering to reduce the emissions of

20
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:42,560
chemical air contaminants and reduce disease transmission via airborne viruses and bacteria.

21
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,580
Welcome, Eric. Pleasure to be here. So thank you all for joining us.

22
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:52,700
I do want to emphasize, as may be obvious to anybody watching, that we have three very different issues here,

23
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:59,390
but they're all germane to what we're going to be looking at in the future. And there may be some intersections we hope to explore some of that.

24
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,460
So here I would like to start with you.

25
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,510
We're all familiar with the issue of climate change, but I'm not sure everybody understands the public health implications of it.

26
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:14,720
Could you just give us a little background on that, what you anticipate seeing in the future as a result of climate change?

27
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:21,320
So I think the public in a way, the public face of climate change would be rising sea level.

28
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:27,140
And so you'd imagine a greater inundation of coastal areas by sea water,

29
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:35,630
perhaps an increase in diseases that have that are transmitted by vectors that are associated with marshy areas.

30
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,829
But there are more, as you might expect, for something as complex as climate change.

31
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:44,060
There are certain, certainly more subtle and less expected impacts.

32
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:51,170
So, for example, in my area of research, the transmission of diseases via the airborne route,

33
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:58,700
if for those pathogens, viruses and bacteria that are susceptible to UV radiation.

34
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:08,150
So sunlight areas that get a greater amount of sunlight might experience decreased transmission of those pathogens that are inactivated by sunlight.

35
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:17,420
And, you know, the distribution of increased sunlight, decreased sunlight, increased rainfall, decreased rainfall, that'll vary.

36
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:25,639
Right. So it's not a uniform. It's not as uniform, perhaps, as the public might think about increasing sea levels.

37
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,799
You know, some places will get more rain, less sunshine, less rain, more sunshine.

38
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,610
And so it'll vary. And so the challenge challenge will be responding to these changes in disease outbreaks.

39
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,090
If we're talking about infectious diseases responding to these changes as they arise.

40
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:50,569
Another thing that you might consider would be the melting of permafrost, right?

41
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:55,850
So where there have been pathogens buried in the soil.

42
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:06,739
Then as there's warming, you run the risk of releasing these, you know, centuries old pathogens back into the environment,

43
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,879
whereas before, you know, they were frozen and we were sheltered from them.

44
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,220
So they're you know, they're as you might expect. As I said, there are there are subtleties and there's a complex.

45
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:22,830
City, I think, to the health impacts of climate change that are just now beginning to be explored.

46
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:31,710
So as part of that complexity, are there going to be some winners in terms of health coming out of climate change?

47
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:37,079
I mean, we know we talk about the fact they're going to be areas of the world where the geography is

48
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,330
going to change in a way that will be suitable for more agriculture than it was previously.

49
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:46,500
Are we going to see areas that are going to benefit in any sense, any health sense?

50
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:56,430
I would be reluctant to suggest a winner or loser given that health is a you know, is impacted by so many different things.

51
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:08,190
So those regions. Again, going back to the the example of greater sunlight leading to reduce transmission of certain viruses,

52
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,059
greater sunlight would also might also lead to drought. Right.

53
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:19,830
So your your health will be compromised if you don't have access or you don't have as much access to clean water.

54
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,680
So I think I think it's just really complex. Right.

55
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:37,620
So I think kind of the buzzword really has to be impacts of climate change will be uncertain, will be multifaceted, and will be unprecedented.

56
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,840
Unprecedented. Well, thank you.

57
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:47,760
I'm actually I'm going to go to each of you individually just to kind of get an introductory comment, as Eric just gave us on your area of expertise,

58
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:54,570
but be thinking about how these different issues interact between or among the three subjects that we're looking at here.

59
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,320
So, Scott, I want to ask you something about personalized medicine.

60
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,979
We've all heard a little bit about it. I don't think many of us know a lot about it.

61
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,280
Could you just tell us what it is and specifically what you see?

62
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,760
It's implications for health and health care in the coming years.

63
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:16,709
So broadly speaking, personalized medicine is a concept for patients with a disease that we're going to identify the

64
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:23,010
specific treatment for their disease at the right time based on what's causing their disease.

65
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,580
So for an example, instead of talking about all breast cancer,

66
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:33,810
we're going to talk about what should be the treatment options for an individual patient who has breast cancer based on what are the changes

67
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:42,240
either they inherited from their parents or that they were exposed to or that developed in their tumor that would allow us to best treat them.

68
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,360
And so importantly, we do that every day.

69
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:53,459
Oncologists do that every day in the clinic right now, so they treat patients differently with breast cancer based on age,

70
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:59,790
family history of breast cancer, etc. They also treat them differently based on the characteristics of the tumor under the microscope.

71
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:07,570
And then they also do some standard molecular testing looking at changes in the tumor, and that guides our therapy.

72
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:14,910
So you could say right now, most women and almost every woman certainly seen at the University of Michigan is getting personalized medicine.

73
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:20,190
So where I really think this is when we talk about personalized medicine and precision medicine,

74
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,030
we're talking about applying some of the cutting edge technology that we now have

75
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,890
available that lets us look at the molecular changes and really unprecedented detail.

76
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,000
It's using that to guide how we treat patients.

77
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:39,600
And so that brings up some, some both the sort of the the awesome power and the potential of that technology.

78
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:47,549
But it also causes a whole bunch of challenges both to a practicing doctor.

79
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,050
So, for example, which of the thousands of tests should we order? How do we interpret that?

80
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,780
And then it also brings up challenges to the health care system.

81
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,720
How do we pay that pay for that, both for an individual patient as well as for society.

82
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:07,230
Right. Thank you. That's we will come back to that because I think that's a really interesting set of issues.

83
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:15,180
Marianne, I hear a lot about population health and the health care system.

84
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,400
And I have to tell you, as an economist and someone who knows a little bit about it,

85
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:27,300
I've always been a little skeptical that our health care system was structured to foster an interest in population health.

86
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:35,250
First of all, would you define population health for folks here and then tell us how the health care system might indeed become interested?

87
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:40,530
Yeah, so it's a really great question. Can including the question about how do you define population health?

88
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,950
I think that most health providers,

89
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:51,179
hospitals and physicians define it as looking at the patient population that they're serving and thinking about

90
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:57,210
them a little bit more broadly than just the individual clinical presenting commission condition that they have.

91
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,010
So thinking about the environment that that population lives and that individual lives,

92
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,520
and it becomes part of the responsibility for that health system.

93
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,459
So it's a little bit different from public health.

94
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:15,180
And I think that's something people get a little confused because we think of public health as being related to the community, to the.

95
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:23,180
Broader issues like climate change and, you know, all of these bigger things that affect the entire community around us.

96
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:32,150
Whereas population health tends to be focused more specifically on the the group of patients that an individual provider is taking care of,

97
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:37,550
but looking at them more broadly as a whole person, not just their clinical issue that's being presented.

98
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:44,870
And I think your core question about are providers incentivized to treat people as is in that?

99
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:52,309
Broadway is a really excellent question. We have some things that have been embedded in our financing system that do encourage health

100
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:57,320
systems to look at a person beyond that clinical issue that keeps them in a hospital bed,

101
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,970
for example. But we have many other incentives in the system that really kind of go in the other direction.

102
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:09,830
And so I think it's a little bit of a question right now if we can really move our current financing system to focus on population health.

103
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,980
Kind of like the rhetoric is trying to encourage us to do it. So how would we go about actually moving it there?

104
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:21,560
So you really have to look at the incentives and who holds the risk in the system.

105
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,269
If we look, for example,

106
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:32,090
at most European systems and you and you go in I've been in meetings where you ask people who's responsible for the health of the population.

107
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,330
It's very clear. Right? There's usually a government agency at either the federal level, the national level,

108
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,340
or at a community level that's responsible in our system in America.

109
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,930
It's very fragmented. We have a public health department that's responsible for some things.

110
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:53,360
We have some health systems, providers responsible for some people.

111
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:59,410
And we have health plans, you know, Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurers that all have a different piece of the picture.

112
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:04,819
Right. You really have to align in our very fragmented and complicated system.

113
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:11,300
We have to align all of these parties to get to that idea of real population, real public health.

114
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:20,330
That's really challenging to do. I think we see the beginnings of it as we see more providers being paid on a capitated basis.

115
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:25,190
And capitation just means you're paid per person, you're not paid per procedure that you do.

116
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:36,950
Our historic system of paying for every service a physician does is enormously fragmenting and focusing people on just that individual moment,

117
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,750
not in the tire patient.

118
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:48,440
But if you start paying on a broader basis and capitated, then you might be incentivized to look at what's happened upstream with that family,

119
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,840
what's happened upstream with that individual, and really start to focus on health beyond medical care.

120
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,700
So we do have some systems that seem to do do that better than others.

121
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,950
Kaiser Permanente is an obvious example.

122
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:08,720
Can you give some examples how with their incentives and their capitation and so on, that they are more interested in population health?

123
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:15,380
Yes, it's a it's a great example to look at some place like Kaiser or other health plans that assume that total risk for that patient.

124
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:20,780
And they do things like they may send a patient home with a scale,

125
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:28,580
somebody who has congestive heart failure so that that patient can weigh themselves and they talk to them about nutrition.

126
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:36,410
They may deal with transportation issues or other barriers that patients have to getting their medical care.

127
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:42,140
Our hope is that they deal with multiple issues that that people have.

128
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:47,030
You know, many people who are who have serious disease come in with mental health issues.

129
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:56,000
And they they often are dealing with multiple systems of treatment for mental health care and then, let's say, a heart condition.

130
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,580
Right. And so in places like Kaiser, they try to integrate that care.

131
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,640
They focus more on teams of practitioners and not just practitioners.

132
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:11,960
One of the exciting developments I think that we're seeing today in health systems is they're using what are known as community health workers.

133
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:18,260
These are individuals who don't have medical training, but they live in the community.

134
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,140
They can do better actually communicating with patients,

135
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:29,330
helping them stay on their medication to prevent an eruption of disease who might help take them to their appointments,

136
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:36,140
who might help them coordinate their care, might help them get food if they are food insecure.

137
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,490
Those are the kinds of people that we're beginning to see health systems like Kaiser

138
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:45,610
and some others employ to really try to help integrate the care for those patients.

139
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,970
It's a very exciting development. Sounds like the barefoot doctor in China in the early seventies.

140
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,190
Well, you know, there are many things we've done through history that we could learn from.

141
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:54,490
Right.
