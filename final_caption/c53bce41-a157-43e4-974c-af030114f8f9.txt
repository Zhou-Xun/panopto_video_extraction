1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,040
As for and that's what I'll try to do now for moving forward,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,469
is on recording these classes for the Panopto so that folks can access them if for whatever reason,

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,940
you're unable to make it for the next maybe half an hour until Pat shows up.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,979
I just want to go through the syllabus. You can access the syllabus on canvas.

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,520
It's right, right, right.

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:34,210
It says blocked earlier. Yeah. No, it's not work. So this is there flat over here.

7
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,710
I think it's fine. No. Right, it'll be there. Okay.

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,190
So wait. But do we do or not have access system? Is this big deal now?

9
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,370
I think of the night I stayed, the night I belong. All right.

10
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,000
Let me let me just post it as an analysis. You look at this. Good morning.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,190
Hi. Nothing. Right. Uh, okay.

12
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,940
Do you have access to this announcement? I can, yeah.

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,249
Oh, okay. So, yes, when you click on syllabus on the home page, that part is tonight.

14
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,420
But this I can access. Okay. All right. And I'm assuming folks can access it.

15
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,670
I will figure out what the denied part is, but here it is and all score.

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,410
So give me just a little bit of license with the syllabus and particularly the schedule.

17
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,040
So trying to get a lot of folks in here again to give you different perspectives and different research that's happening in injury prevention,

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,010
trying to coordinate all those schedules. Invariably they're there, they're going to be some conflicts and some rearranging.

19
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:41,280
The vicissitudes of scheduling this many people is also the reason why I didn't put the syllabus until yesterday,

20
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:47,010
but I think it made for a more enjoyable course for everybody.

21
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:54,210
So the the structure, though, with the way I kind of think about the course is each week you're going to have some readings and some meeting to do.

22
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,150
If you are one of those assiduous students that looks at the reading list is like, I'm gonna knock all this out in September.

23
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:07,409
Great. Except for please know that when I have speakers come, I ask them, Is there anything that you'd like them to read?

24
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:12,420
Because oftentimes they're preventing or occurring, presenting an intervention that they're working on or something.

25
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,220
So I will probably be adding readings like the week or week before they come to speak.

26
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,690
So just knowing that caveat, the things that I have up on the syllabus, I'd love it if you read it all.

27
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,990
It'd be great. I think you learn a lot, but it doesn't necessarily mean that there won't be some things that we add over the course of the semester.

28
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,410
Same thing with media. I might have both watch videos as they start to come out.

29
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:38,970
The injury center speaker actually has a fantastic course on child and adolescent injury,

30
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,650
so it's a kind of do it yourself course that you can take and you can go to some of the different modules.

31
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,740
They're all developed by experts here at U of M, so I might recommend that you take a look at some of those videos.

32
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:55,800
You don't have to, but it's just going to give you even more information about different areas and help you get a little bit more depth.

33
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,020
My goal is to give you overviews of the topic areas myself.

34
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:09,030
I want to just kind of help make the connections between the different areas so we can kind of get a theme moving throughout the semester.

35
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,370
But then I'm supplementing that with experts who know a lot more about their individual areas,

36
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,940
and in particular who are doing some of this work in the field.

37
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,280
So hopefully we're going to be seeing a lot of different sorts of interventions that are happening now or had to happen recently.

38
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,950
And then we're going to talk about them kind of reflecting back on what we've learned in other weeks, what we learn about injury science.

39
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,690
I'm hoping that we can push folks a little bit. So why did you decide to work in this in this area?

40
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,530
Why why this population? What happens when we consider an X, Y or Z?

41
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,219
And we'll hear from the experts and then afterwards we can also discuss.

42
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,780
So it doesn't have to be, you know, feel like a rapid fire. We don't like your intervention, but, you know, that type of thing.

43
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:52,260
So we can have some space for both. And then with the assignment piece, this is again kind of broad overview.

44
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,820
A couple of times just during the semester, I want to hear more than what I might hear from class.

45
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:04,170
So the assignments I don't think are super burdensome. I'm very happy to talk to people about what your workload looks like and whether or

46
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,850
not I can facilitate moving through the course requirements if you're struggling.

47
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,150
But they are asking you a couple of times to just reflect.

48
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,790
Give me some of your own thoughts on how the what the what you're thinking about the readings,

49
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,540
what you thought about a presentation where we are kind of in the course.

50
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:29,340
Some of those different challenge areas that you thought about there really is your space too, to think critically about some of the material.

51
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:37,139
We do have a more standardized assignment in a and the form of a a critique is an injury article critique.

52
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,250
So you have a couple options to choose from and I just want you to provide that academic lens.

53
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:48,660
And then finally, we're going to end with a group project that allows you to go into a lot of depth in a particular injury topic area,

54
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,730
and that'll be a combination of a report like you've all done a million times, as well as a policy brief.

55
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:59,040
How can we just do a whole bunch of information into a very accessible piece of.

56
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,030
Either literature or visualization that if you're walking and you bump into Gretchen Whitmer,

57
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,160
a senator, and you say, hey, I really need you to know about this and what we can do about it.

58
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,550
So that's kind of to go from a broad, broad structure.

59
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,330
I'm just going to pause here and again say that I think this is an interesting way to go about the course.

60
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,310
It doesn't have to be set in stone. So if we're starting to feel that for whatever reason there are,

61
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,959
there are more things that we want to discuss or if there are different ways that we can utilize the assignments.

62
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,190
I'm very open to hearing that we can kind of co construct our learning environment.

63
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,850
That's the educational psychologist. All right.

64
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:50,710
So the syllabus itself is the easiest way to go about this and to let folks read the course objectives on your own time.

65
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,900
And but essentially, in a nutshell, it's this is a survey course based on injury science.

66
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,309
So I want you to have some theory. I want you to add some substance. I want you to have an opportunity to apply that.

67
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:07,600
That's my objectives when you leave, if I've done my job well, you know, I actually think injury science is really interesting.

68
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,399
I could see myself working in here,

69
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,660
or at least I'm not going to forget about it when I'm doing a good public health work I'm going to do in the future.

70
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,730
The assignments, the reading assignments. Just please do them in advance within reason.

71
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,770
Right? So I will try each week to give you a pretty frank.

72
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:32,050
Hey, it's week four. These are the reading assignments. This is kind of what I want you to focus on.

73
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:38,620
I'm going to cover this one a lot. And class, these other two, maybe not so much, so maybe spend a little bit more time on the other two.

74
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,960
And on the one we do in class, you're going to get to I mean, you can infer, right?

75
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,540
If you're going to do all the readings, that's fabulous. But who are we kidding?

76
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:49,720
You're not going to have time probably to do all the readings for all your classes, you know, before the classes start.

77
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,650
And that's okay.

78
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:58,959
Trying to get just kind of the gist of an article, trying to understand now here's the difference, some of the methodology behind the articles, right?

79
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,240
So looking into how people are thinking about testing and assessing injury.

80
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,440
Those are some of the questions that I want to see brought into the the assignments,

81
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,580
like the reflection assignments or certainly the critique as well as the final project.

82
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,390
I mean, anybody can say, oh, yeah, I'm just going to go run our city and see what happens.

83
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,590
But generally speaking, we're not going to see tons and tons of RC teams and injury space.

84
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:25,180
There's ethical issues. There's finance issues. We're looking at quasi experimental data.

85
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:31,180
What are the strengths and weaknesses there? What are the authors say was why we this was the best decision to move forward?

86
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:35,940
And what do you really think about that? Tell me what the authors think and tell me what you think about the idea of

87
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,130
thinking and how would this actually apply to your world once you're out of here?

88
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,860
And those are the kind of questions that I'd like folks to just step outside the book report ish,

89
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,760
like, this is what they are and this is what the articles about Jonathan participation.

90
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,260
Please come to class. If you're not feeling well. Absolutely.

91
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,650
Feel free not to be in class. I do want folks to be safe.

92
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:03,760
I will make sure that these lectures are recorded moving forward, if any of the probably off chance that a speaker asked not to be recorded.

93
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,150
There might be a little bit of a gap there, but I have not had that happen.

94
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:12,700
But I will try to have the lectures recorded. But if you're going to be here, please talk.

95
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:20,080
Talk to your neighbors. Talk to me. I love hearing from folks and I will do my best as the names start to come to call in.

96
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,850
Folks, if I haven't heard from you in a while, please take a shot. If I call your name, just give it a try.

97
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,960
You might say something that you wish you hadn't said earlier, but that's okay.

98
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,240
I do it all the time and no one's going to hold you accountable for it.

99
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:36,990
So but we do want this discussion to tend to flow, to hear from people's different perspectives.

100
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,850
We want to be respectful and all that kind of good stuff, and I think it's all on the syllabus.

101
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:48,009
So thinking through some of that, but really this is more of a discussion based course versus like section 22, which is a very one sided didactic.

102
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:53,079
I don't want that to be discourse, although it feels like right now assignments I've already went through.

103
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:59,229
In a quick nutshell, I want if I have pages for you to do that, the assignments are the ones I'm most excited about it.

104
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,969
A reflection of saying as honestly, those are just little short things that you're going to do and it can be about anything.

105
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,270
That was the day of or even honestly, in the past couple of weeks.

106
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:12,670
It's, you know, I ask you to do three of them in the course of the semester and just free form is fine.

107
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,510
There's no real like structure in terms that I want to see this that the other.

108
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,920
Just tell me what you think about the articles. Tell me about a connection that you made.

109
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,660
Tell me about your own personal experience and how, when you read this article, you thought, Geez,

110
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:31,360
if I had only known this when I was working here or when this is one of them or something that like this happened to my family member,

111
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:38,500
it made me think I could, you know, those are the type of things that I'll never get to know through, you know, an article critique.

112
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,590
And that's what I'm I'm really excited about the article critique.

113
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,480
You've done a lot of this before.

114
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,730
This is trying to apply some of that science and rigor that we're trying to do with at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.

115
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:56,470
Right. Think critically about somebody else's work and pull out the things that we think are strengths for the things that are that are weaknesses.

116
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,880
And then the final assignment, again, is just that real? In-Depth focus.

117
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:06,970
So I want to give you lots of spaces these first few weeks to hear from each other about the kind of stuff you're interested in.

118
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:12,009
Doesn't mean if you have different interests, you can't be in a group together. But if you have similar interests,

119
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:20,890
I think it's just gonna make it that much easier to find a common topic that you want to examine and start to streamline the workload.

120
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,690
Challenge yourself if you're sitting next to your best buddy that you've been in the program for two years,

121
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,660
maybe think about something across the room that you never talked to before.

122
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,680
Might have some ideas and and develop a nice working relationship or something.

123
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:43,000
Conduct, I forget. So it's the conduct piece because we are talking about at times very sensitive subjects.

124
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,470
I do want to try I want to be respectful and I want folks to be respectful of one another, recognizing that people have different experiences.

125
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,820
Recognizing that we're talking about vulnerable populations. Trying to use inclusive language.

126
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,960
Trying to be, again, respectful of people's different opinions.

127
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,620
I will do my best to facilitate those conversations and allow people to feel like they can have those conversations and discussions.

128
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,919
It's okay if we disagree. It's not okay if we're not respecting one another.

129
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,290
So those are that's what I'm going to try to do within the class,

130
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:19,479
try to create a learning environment or co construct a learning environment where we feel comfortable doing that and folks aren't feeling ostracized,

131
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,780
excluded or in any way offended from the conversations that we have.

132
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:28,890
But we are going to be touching on some sensitive topics mental health, suicide, gender based violence.

133
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:35,320
I mean, all these injury topics can be at hand and have different folks have different experiences and different perceptions.

134
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,900
Schedule. Pretty straightforward. You come here on Thursdays and then the rest of the week you guys are free.

135
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:47,380
I mean, the speaker schedule will vary a little bit throughout the day.

136
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:52,630
In my ideal world, it's, you know, Justin, for the first, you know, 45 minutes to an hour talking with you about some of the overview.

137
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:58,030
And then the speaker comes in, does their thing, and then after that speaker leaves, we get to talk about that speaker.

138
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,950
If it's not always going to work out that way, we're going to have at least one person is going to zoom in,

139
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,229
another person's coming at the kind of tail end. So we might adjust here and there, but, you know, just roll with it.

140
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:13,450
I think it'll be good, but that's pretty much the schedule we think.

141
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:20,530
Any questions about this syllabus here? Course objectives, learning objectives, reading assignments.

142
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,430
So the degree breakdown, you know, class participation, 20%, 20%.

143
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,820
Everything on canvas conduct.

144
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:46,590
And of course it resources some things where I might be posting information that's already coming from canvas.

145
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,770
These presenters, they wouldn't be here if they weren't interested in talking to you.

146
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:56,670
I promise you, I'm not twisting anybody's arm to come here. And it's amazing how many people say, yes, I'd like to talk to this class, which is great.

147
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,090
And they're all and actually, by and large, almost all of them are going to be on campus.

148
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,540
So if you still got some time left in your program, reach out to them.

149
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,640
That's how you can get involved so you can start doing some of their research.

150
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:12,570
That may be an opportunity to talk about a professional opportunity once things are all done.

151
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,200
The injury prevention center we're going to hear about in just a second. Related is the muck.

152
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:25,410
It is an injury. It's a I think it's a settlement, a listen injury muck that has a lot of these topics covered for younger population.

153
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:31,770
So we're going to miss some of the older and the middle and older adult kind of developmental injuries that might be happening.

154
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:40,799
But then within the IPC, there's a lot of people doing some of that work to the Youth Fires Prevention Center, near and dear to my heart.

155
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,640
It's help on the third floor and each one is led by Mark Zimmerman.

156
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,600
And it's been around for, I guess, different iterations for about 20 years.

157
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,400
In this case, we're working with a group in Washington, DC called the Trigger Project.

158
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,830
It's a youth led kind of an empowerment of program to to prevent gun violence.

159
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,819
But there also are a lot of different projects kind of within the Youth Violence

160
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:08,400
Prevention Center umbrella that are related to violence prevention form of prevention,

161
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:14,160
the Center for Disease Control. A lot of the data that I'm going to pull for this class comes from the CDC.

162
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:19,080
They are kind of the nation's leading experts on injury and both intentional and unintentional.

163
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:26,010
And we're going to have a speaker from the CDC there, specifically the injury center at the CDC,

164
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:33,239
hopefully zoom in, add in at the end of November to talk a little bit about policy advocacy.

165
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,380
To the extent the CDC likes to talk about advocacy and evaluation and within

166
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:43,830
injury and how the CDC thinks about injury prevention and then in the HHS.

167
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:52,440
So if you're if you're not aware, the state actually has a pretty big paw injury project that they are working in different areas.

168
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,780
So it has TBI.

169
00:14:54,780 --> 00:15:02,880
So traumatic brain injury, it's motor vehicle crashes, alert, you are working in car seat spaces, it's educating about intimate partner violence.

170
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:11,249
There are a couple of there's a period of purple crying. So it's a an intervention working with young parents to make sure that their and caring

171
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,960
for their baby and that and monitoring kind of aggressive behavior when that happens.

172
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,320
So lots of different resources at the state. You saw some Michigan vital statistics that they monitored consistently.

173
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,170
So you can start to understand because again, data are powerful.

174
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:32,730
If you can put numbers into a meaningful package of communications, you might start to influence action.

175
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:37,590
And how can we do that? Finding those numbers can be the biggest part of it, and so we'll do that at the state level.

176
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,179
We'll also show you if you haven't seen it before, of the CDC's WHISKERS database.

177
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,890
So if you want to look at national statistics,

178
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:51,120
if you want to break them down by subpopulations to understand different injury burdens for Asian Americans, I heard was one.

179
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:56,910
There might be other groups that folks are really interested in to the extent that we can use that administrative data to say, hey,

180
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:02,010
this is an injury burden that hasn't that isn't getting enough attention, and this is why we want to move forward with our intervention.

181
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:08,520
What better explanation for why we're going to propose, what we're going to propose or give us the funding to do some of this activity?

182
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:15,300
Questions about the syllabus. Sorry.

183
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:25,460
Okay, okay. Okay. And final exam, a final paper and the presentation of just the paper.

184
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:32,440
It is a paper and a one page policy brief or some sort of visualization and presentation about it.

185
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:41,850
And. Well, I mean, I think the way we I mean, last last the last night, again, this is almost like time.

186
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:48,510
The last time I did have folks just talking about their most most of the people wanted to talk about their policy brief, which was great.

187
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:53,790
We don't have to do that formally, though. It wasn't graded or anything. But and there are two different dates for those.

188
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,770
So the policy brief is due the last day of class and then the assignment is due a week later.

189
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,030
Don't let that fool you. It's going to be hard to write the policy brief if you don't have the whole assignment done.

190
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,080
You could still do a big chunk of it. I mean, it's you don't have to involve the same time,

191
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:14,890
but there are a lot of work for the policy brief is going to be is going to will be done with the final project.

192
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,940
Good question. Other questions.

193
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,080
Alexa? Yes. No names. No exams.

194
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:36,710
Angry? Yeah. And in response to what we just heard, anyway, that we want to talk to three of them anyway.

195
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:43,990
Yeah. And I'm not going to be super outraged about this. Ideally, it's about the topic of the week or connecting to the topic of the week.

196
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:48,739
So I don't get like a bunch of them in December. That's that's kind of the purpose.

197
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,649
But yeah. Yeah. And it doesn't have to be the readings.

198
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:57,200
It can be the speaker, it can be the it can be something that you read in the news on that kind of stuff.

199
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,590
Seriously, you see you read an article in the New York Times or somewhere else and you say,

200
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,860
Oh, this is really interesting, is relevant for the question. I'll throw it up our campus.

201
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:07,430
We can all talk about it. That's way better than, you know, something prepackaged that I come up with.

202
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:14,090
So let's try to be responsive to recent events. Let's think about ways that we can maybe we can have some of those discussions as well.

203
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:28,780
Others. Got that right.

204
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:37,390
So we go on. It's kind of an overview we to try to get you some exposure to a theory that's related to injury.

205
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,799
So there's not you know, it's not as well developed as, you know, health behavior theory,

206
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,780
for example, or, you know, some of your psychological or sociological or political science theory.

207
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,230
But there still is some out there, some of which I think will look familiar.

208
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:57,550
So you are so so social ecological theory, for example, finds its way into a lot of injury conversations.

209
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:04,770
But how can we use theory to guide those interventions? I bet you thought that the whole big theory thing was just kind of an academic exercise.

210
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:12,670
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. When you can't when you can't tell me the mechanisms for which your intervention is going to prevent injury,

211
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,940
there's no way I'm going to give you $3.75 million.

212
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:21,280
There should be a theory to predict what would happen if you implement your your intervention as designed.

213
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:29,230
Right. So trying to think through about how we can support something because oftentimes, especially in a new space like injury prevention,

214
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:36,459
you're not going to have umpteen million studies to fall back on and say, look, when we do this, it works out just fine.

215
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,270
And now we're just going to translate some of that information. Oftentimes, we're breaking new ground.

216
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:46,420
We're looking at new populations. We're thinking about take away or hybrid studies where it's both like an effectiveness implementation trial.

217
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:53,410
We want to have the right kind of language to say this is why we're pretty confident that our hypothesis will be supported.

218
00:19:53,710 --> 00:20:02,050
Now, give us the monkeys. Right. That's that's the goal. Week three Early Childhood Injury Re Snodgrass is coming out of the medical

219
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:06,010
school to talk a little bit about is the interventions that they're working on,

220
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,940
you know, and this is where sometimes these topics get short shrift.

221
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,229
I mean, early childhood injury can be burns, it can be drownings, it can be falls in themselves.

222
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:18,940
It could be a peer to peer violence. So we're going to try to capture some of those things.

223
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,060
One, especially in the overview, I'll kind of get to those topics out there.

224
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,560
But there are or other ways if you're like, well, wait a minute, I really want to think about this.

225
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:32,800
Let's try to figure out if we can either work those into your assignments or some way touch on those spaces.

226
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:40,780
We're also that week I think we're having Aaron's going to zoom in from a short shot.

227
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:49,240
It's kind of Sean is going to talk to us from Asian people because they're generally somewhat gone when there somebody from Asian think there was.

228
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:55,690
Yeah. Well Sean Smith from AT&T is going to kind of she's an implementation science expert.

229
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,940
Implementation science is a very exciting and emerging topic right now.

230
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:06,400
It's trying to think through we have all these kind of interventions that we say are effective, but let's talk about scaling.

231
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,540
Let's talk about different populations. And so she's going to talk to us a little bit.

232
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:17,650
She was able to make it next week, but she's going to come in and talk a little bit about kind of a seminal implementation science article.

233
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,360
Then in week four, we're going to move into substance use an injury.

234
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:28,569
Erin, Boehner is a it's kind of incredible in the amount of work that she's able to do,

235
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:35,950
but she's focused a lot on cannabis and driving behaviors, focusing a lot on opioids.

236
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:39,130
So she's going to talk a little bit about some of the interventions she has in those spaces.

237
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:42,580
Substance use and injury, as you can imagine, is a huge topic as well.

238
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,950
If we're not capturing something that you're interested in, let me know whether it's a reading or whether it's a reflection.

239
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,870
Bet you we can touch on those spaces. Gender based dating violence and we have five circuits.

240
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:57,290
Maya from nursing is going to come in also as an appointment ADHD.

241
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,160
So I'm excited that she might have an opportunity to meet some of the students. If you haven't met, Sarah talked about her intervention.

242
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,810
Week six is open because we might try to do a little bit of shifting around.

243
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:15,730
I'm hoping that we can pull in some speakers that are coming to Ann Arbor for a panel, so I'll just leave that with a kind of open spot right there.

244
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,959
But we will do something and it will be injury related, motor vehicle crashes,

245
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:26,910
Lisa owners coming out of the Transportation Institute to talk about the work that they're doing there.

246
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:32,800
That's also when our first assignments do so. Week seven, just to flag that on your calendars.

247
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:39,159
Concussion and traumatic brain injury. I'm hoping that we can have Doug Willoughby join it.

248
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,460
Does some of this work I was at Penn had just come to the University of Michigan.

249
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:46,060
And so we're trying to figure out if we can make that work with his schedule.

250
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:50,020
But then so the concussion, TBI, it's also a very big space.

251
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:55,359
We actually have an entire concussion center over housing, the school physiology.

252
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,400
I believe Steve Royo is associate dean or something there now, but also runs the Concussion Center.

253
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:06,340
Very exciting in terms of the work they do because they're a mix of physiological as well as social science.

254
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:14,320
It's kind of coming together to prevent. And what happens in response to traumatic brain injuries here at community violence, firearm safety?

255
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:21,220
There are lots of folks on campus that are doing this work. So I'm trying to find somebody that's coming outside of public health.

256
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,120
So I've thrown a couple of feelers out there now. Otherwise, I'm also.

257
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:29,950
Ahead. You talk about pure violence in violence, firearm violence, as well as this gentleman here.

258
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:35,170
Dr. Carter, thank you so much for joining us. I can pause because we're just going through our syllabus.

259
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:42,880
Would you like to come on? Sure. Hi, this is Dr. Pat Carter.

260
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,950
Emergency medicine physician also has a IS and serves as the director for the

261
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,120
Injury Prevention Center and the Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention.

262
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,259
Do not prepare your bio, but I figured you and parents are willing to talk to us a little bit about what the IPC does.

263
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:06,670
What I think does is open to asking some questions about some of the resources on campus related to injury prevention.

264
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:14,349
Been doing this work for at least 20 1515 years and will come out of a different perspective, right?

265
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:18,610
So coming from a medical school, coming from the perspective of a physician,

266
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:22,690
but then also working closely with social scientists, with other physicians.

267
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:27,159
So I will turn it over to you. I need this. Great. Yeah, we are recording that.

268
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,520
Okay, that's fine. Yeah. And I didn't I didn't do any slides.

269
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:37,570
I thought I would just keep this kind of open and loose. So as Justin said, I'm Carter and Dr. Carter.

270
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:45,129
So I'll tell you maybe a little bit about how I got into injury prevention and then kind of my research.

271
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,510
And then I'll talk about the Injury Prevention Center and the Institute for

272
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:52,329
Fire Image and Prevention and some of the other injury resources on campus.

273
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:59,620
So as Justin said, I come at this from a sort of clinical perspective and during my training in emergency medicine,

274
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:07,270
you know, became very apparent very quickly that by the time patients ended up in the emergency department with an injury,

275
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:15,160
most notably things like firearm injuries, we sort of had missed the boat on what we could do for them because at that point,

276
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,100
all you can do is provide the clinical care to try and get them better.

277
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:24,880
But that clinical care is one very expensive, very involved, often involves a lot of ICU time.

278
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:31,180
And there were these huge high rates of seeing people come back again and again and again for violent injuries.

279
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:37,120
And so I began to think about like, what could we do to sort of prevent that from happening up front?

280
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:43,930
Because by the time they land in the trauma bay and the emergency department, sort of, we've we've missed the boat on trying to change things.

281
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,780
So that's kind of how I got interested in this.

282
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:57,190
So my research really focuses on that question what can we do in health care settings to, um, to prevent folks from violence outcomes broadly,

283
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:02,590
but also specifically firearm violence outcomes into the most severe type of violence injury that we see.

284
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,500
So I have a couple of projects that are, you know,

285
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:12,190
that are sort of federally funded research projects that look at how do we how do

286
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:17,110
we focus on different parts of the injury spectrum to prevent these outcomes?

287
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:22,540
And I think about it as kind of like any other disease. And we think about things like strokes or heart attacks.

288
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:29,680
People often have some sort of introductory symptoms or lower level things like chest pain, right?

289
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:34,660
And then they end up having a heart attack. And and there are risk factors for that heart attack.

290
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:40,209
There are things that we can do to them to prevent them from having that that initial heart attack.

291
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:43,210
And then we do a whole bunch of things, turn them having a second heart attack.

292
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:51,010
But we think about violence in the same way we think about lower level fighting, complex conflict resolution.

293
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:55,450
How do we address some of those factors upfront and prevent those violence outcomes?

294
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,329
And then once somebody ends up in the emergency department with a violent injury,

295
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,690
how do we prevent them having that second potentially more severe, violent injury?

296
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,830
So I have some projects that are focused at different aspects of that spectrum.

297
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:14,349
So we we have an intervention that we're looking at and testing with kids who carry firearms and how do we prevent

298
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:20,979
them from engaging in higher risk behaviors with firearms that would increase the potential for firearm injuries.

299
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:25,809
So things like, you know, carrying a firearm, whether using alcohol or drugs or, you know,

300
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:30,010
how do they address conflict to other people when they have a firearm available?

301
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:37,180
Because we know that these lower level conflicts can escalate into these violence outcomes pretty severely when a firearms devolved.

302
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:42,100
And then I have a project that's looking at, okay, well, when somebody does end up in the emergency department with a violent injury,

303
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:49,500
how do we how do we provide them the services that they need to try and prevent them from having that second violent injury, that second outcome?

304
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,049
So I'm happy to talk more about that. We can get into all the specifics of that.

305
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:57,820
But but that's kind of broadly the type of research and work that I do and how I got into that.

306
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,959
As Justin also said, I wear a couple of administrative hats,

307
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:08,650
so I co-direct our injury prevention center and I co-direct our Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention.

308
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,200
And what I'll say about injury in Michigan is, if you're interested in injury and injury prevention,

309
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:20,589
there's there's virtually no better place in the country now to understand and learn.

310
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:24,280
And and you're you get to learn from experts like.

311
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,220
And and his colleagues that he's going to have to talk to you throughout this course.

312
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:36,419
But we have here the Injury Prevention Center is one of the nine CDC funded injury centers around the country.

313
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:41,250
And so these centers focus broadly on injury prevention, everything from violence,

314
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,350
as I just kind of talked about, to opioid overdose, which is considered an injury to poisoning,

315
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:52,560
to concussion, to motor vehicle crash injury prevention,

316
00:28:52,980 --> 00:29:01,320
to sexual assault on campus and to older adult falls are just becoming a very common type of injury that we're seeing.

317
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,080
And so we focus broadly across all those areas.

318
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:11,639
And the Injury Prevention Center does everything from, you know, research and research projects to how do we educate you guys,

319
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,860
the next generation of injury prevention researchers,

320
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:21,920
to how do we how do we take the results that we get from the research that we do and move it out into practice?

321
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:25,890
And that actually helps people broadly across the work across the country.

322
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,600
And so that's one sort of facet of injury prevention here.

323
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:36,660
But we've been so successful with that that we have all these sort of offshoots here on campus.

324
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:43,740
And that's partly why I think makes Michigan so special. So we have an institute for Motor Vehicle Crash Prevention called I'm sorry,

325
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,890
UVM Transportation Research Institute that does all but the whole building that just focuses on how do you prevent car crashes,

326
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,769
how do you prevent things like distracted driving with cell phones,

327
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:57,390
and how do you develop the next generation of vehicles that are going to be autonomous and drive on their own?

328
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:03,120
And how do you get people to put the right car seat into the car when they have a newborn?

329
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:08,730
Has that newborn grows? How do you change those car seats so that they're adequately providing prevention,

330
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,940
everything across the spectrum of motor vehicle crash, injury prevention.

331
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:21,090
We also have a concussion center that is focused largely on sports related concussions and the prevention of concussion injury.

332
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:25,180
That's led by Steve Braulio here on campus. Know if he's coming to talk to your classroom.

333
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:36,240
Okay. All right. To a youth violence prevention center, which Justin is very much involved in, that focuses on preventing youth violence.

334
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,840
And then we have an opioid initiative that just started.

335
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:46,230
And then we have the Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention, which is the other administrative hat eyewear,

336
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:51,710
which is an entire institute focused on how do we prevent firearm injuries across the board.

337
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,790
And so, you know, I talked about give me 1/2 of all, just a question.

338
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:05,010
I talked about sort of my work is primarily around youth violence and to some extent intimate partner violence that we see in emergency departments.

339
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:13,440
But there's a whole range of firearm injuries. This firearm suicide, which is a large component of both firearm injury, police violence,

340
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,440
unintentional injury among kids who find unsecured firearms, as I said, intimate partner violence.

341
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:28,260
So we focus kind of broadly across all those things have a similar sort of setup to the injury center where we focus on research,

342
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:32,160
we focus on training of the next generation of folks who want to focus on this.

343
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:38,160
And then we focus on dissemination of results to communities that are impacted or have interest in solving this problem.

344
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,709
So I'll pause there and then I'll let you ask your question and open any other questions.

345
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:50,050
And I have a couple of things I wanted to just highlight that are coming up in the future for you guys potentially, right?

346
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:50,820
Yeah.

347
00:31:50,820 --> 00:32:00,209
I wanted to ask if you're finding that a lot of these centers have overlap based on like populations there, not just the topics that are covered.

348
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:06,150
It seems like there might be like a lot of communication between the centers based on what you've said.

349
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,330
Is that that's true? Yes. So there is a lot of overlap.

350
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:15,780
And, you know, largely the folks who work in these different areas are enmeshed, you know, working with each other.

351
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,079
So, you know, Justin and one of his colleagues, Marc Zimmerman,

352
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:26,940
who I don't think has come together and work very heavily in the School of Public Health here and with the Youth Violence Prevention Center.

353
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,170
But I'm involved in that, too.

354
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:37,140
And similarly, Justin runs a school safety center, and we do a lot of stuff around school violence prevention with firearms.

355
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:43,200
And so all those things do tend to overlap. And we try and use these different centers to help, you know,

356
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:49,110
build the field and move everybody forward in terms of figuring out what works to prevent injury and save lives.

357
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:53,470
Well. Other questions come.

358
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,600
Want to know how you can get it. How are you are.

359
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:03,660
I'm not sure if you do, but in these purposes you're involved and you are working on.

360
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:12,600
Are you calling on and trying to reach out to maybe with the political side of things as well for support to change things or I guess.

361
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:21,360
Yeah. So that's a great question. So, you know, my own personal research is very much focused in health care settings,

362
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:29,370
but we have researchers who are focused on questions around policy, questions around communities and what we can do in schools, for example.

363
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:35,219
And so the nice thing is we have this breadth of expertize across all of these different sectors, right?

364
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:43,560
So and my work will hopefully have some policy implications if we find, let's say, one of these interventions that we're looking at works, right?

365
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:48,480
How do we now take that and we scale it up and we implement it in emergency departments across the country?

366
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,440
You know, similarly, Justin's work with school violence prevention, you know,

367
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:59,459
as they're doing work in schools around Michigan and around the country, you know what works and how can we disseminate thought to policymakers?

368
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:04,140
But then also how do we evaluate policies that are put in place and whether they work or not?

369
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,740
Right. Because we don't want to put policies in place that don't necessarily work.

370
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,810
We just want things that are effective. Right.

371
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:19,020
I should clarify, I just we I think about that as policy evaluation and then translating research into policy,

372
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:24,030
which I think is very different from advocacy advocates have a specific role.

373
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:29,070
We're sort of researchers, an injury prevention specialist.

374
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:33,570
Right. And so our role is to try and, you know, educate policymakers about what works.

375
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,840
But I don't necessarily advocate for certain things. Right. Except that I'm advocating by educating.

376
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,470
Other questions? That's a good question.

377
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:53,130
You know, you find like people working within all this after like now old school in the right now they been go to the White House.

378
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:58,780
Like, hey, like, you know, or like I think it's going to be like kind of like.

379
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:03,770
One said it goes up like down domino it.

380
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:14,060
Yeah. I mean, I think I think you naturally sort of cross some of those sectors and things that work in one environment might work in another.

381
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:21,230
And and so we talk about how do we translate something that we find is effective in one setting into another one?

382
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:29,059
And there's a whole field of sort of implementation science that's focused around taking something that works here and moving it over here and

383
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:37,370
figuring out how to get community input and feedback on that to make sure it's tailored to the community that's most effective in that setting.

384
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:49,690
Great question. Other question you mentioned earlier, the concussion center and focusing on sports related injuries.

385
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:55,560
I want to know a little bit more on like kind of the interventional work that they're doing and what are the outcomes of that interventional work?

386
00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:02,879
Yeah, and I'm not the best person to ask about that, but I'm sure if Steve comes to your class, [INAUDIBLE] talk more about that.

387
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,020
But I know they're working on things like how you design a better football helmet, you know,

388
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,490
so there's less concussion injury, you know, how do you put sensors in the monitor?

389
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:16,470
There's a lot and a lot of work around that sort of technology and technology based.

390
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:24,590
There's also a lot of work around, you know, when's the right time to return somebody to a field or to play after they've had interaction.

391
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:30,600
So that's sort of return to play guidelines. And the reason for that is there's something called second impact syndrome.

392
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,249
So if you have one concussion and you get a second one with a dedicated period of time,

393
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:40,230
it can lead to this cascade of effects in terms of brain injury.

394
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:48,450
So there's been a lot of work done over the years on sort of what's the stepwise way to assess whether somebody can return back to the field of play.

395
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:52,350
And so that's a lot of the work I know they focused on over the years, I think.

396
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:05,100
My share of special interests is the homeless population, and I know that significant amounts of them account for injuries.

397
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:09,750
And I heard what I found is anybody who is involved in that work at all.

398
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:19,950
So we're involved in it to the extent that, you know, a lot of our interventions intersect with populations that may or may be homeless.

399
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:24,479
Right. So so, you know, we have some folks who are focused,

400
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,850
especially on opiate and substance use prevention and have worked a lot with homeless populations.

401
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:36,659
And that's certainly with some of our violence work. We don't have somebody who's dedicated, focused just on homeless populations,

402
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:41,340
but generally they're focused on a content area that includes because of the population that's most affected,

403
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:47,729
you know, some degree of homelessness and a lot of our interventions trying to address some of those components.

404
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:54,600
Right. So they provide not just behavioral interventions or behavioral therapy, but also sort of care management and linkage to resources.

405
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,700
More of the resources being how do we get somebody who is homeless into a situation where they're safe?

406
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:08,800
Yeah. So for the age of 84, we have on a cruise ship.

407
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:14,780
Mm hmm. We have students come through the injury prevention, uh, to do that great segway.

408
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,720
Yeah. So we have. We have two internship programs that I want to highlight.

409
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:27,670
So one is there's there's one through the Injury Prevention Center, and that's every every year during the summer, we do an internship.

410
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:35,590
And one of those spots is dedicated to somebody who goes to the CDC to do work with the folks at the CDC.

411
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:40,630
Now, the past couple of years, because of COVID, that's been virtual, but we still been able to pull it off.

412
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:47,830
And then we have a handful of other internship opportunities through that, through the Injury Prevention Center.

413
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:52,120
If you're interested, particularly in firearm injuries and firearm injury prevention,

414
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,800
the Institute for Fire Imagery Project also has an internship program.

415
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:03,010
And we had, I think, four or five interns last year. And then I think Youth Violence Prevention Center also has internship opportunities.

416
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,520
And so because we talked about overlap among all these centers,

417
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,360
one of the things we do is an educational seminar series during the summer with the interns,

418
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,990
and we pool the interns from the Youth Violence Prevention Center, Injury Prevention Center, the Institute for Fire Image and Prevention.

419
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:20,930
And they all get exposure to educational topics on injury prevention.

420
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,140
I just got to lay it out. I said, no place better to do injury prevention.

421
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:38,440
Other questions. So I'm wondering, are these centers only within an amateur or are these centers available throughout the state of Michigan?

422
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,340
So so they're located here at the university.

423
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:48,440
But most of them I mean, the injury prevention center really is in some ways really focused.

424
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:51,820
There's a Great Lakes center because there are nine centers around the country.

425
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:56,979
So our focus area tends to be the Great Lakes region, but our work is going on throughout that region.

426
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:04,750
So we have projects going on with National Guard and suicide prevention and multiple National Guard places, sites around the state.

427
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:10,230
We, the School Safety Center, is nationally focused, so it does a lot of work across the country.

428
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,340
I know Justin had a project in Miami and some other places, so that's pretty broadly focused.

429
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,370
The Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention is also nationally focused,

430
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:25,840
so a lot of our work involves populations and questions that touch on populations across the country.

431
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:34,510
The couple of projects I talked about that we're doing through emergency departments, we're primarily working in Flint, Detroit and Philadelphia.

432
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:40,240
So not focused just in Michigan. That's like, Oh, it's I got to do this right.

433
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:48,490
How are you guys going? Like because you touched on the process of going from the EDI to like an institution, right?

434
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:49,840
Well, I mean,

435
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:59,530
so you think about it as like we have these projects that are really focused on a population and doing work and then there's sort of this larger

436
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:09,280
way of bringing faculty and students and other people together at this institution and that that's what like an institute does or a center does.

437
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,700
But then within that, there are dedicated projects focused on doing. But the question.

438
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:23,830
So a couple of things I wanted to highlight for you guys. I was told to have an actual debate.

439
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:32,200
So September 22nd at the Foreign Policy School.

440
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:39,550
At 430, we're going to have a policy panel on firearm injury prevention.

441
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:44,470
And we're going to have on that panel Daniel Webster, who is from Johns Hopkins.

442
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:49,120
Rod Brunson, who is from the University of Maryland, Somalia.

443
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:53,320
Rajan, who is from Columbia. And April Viola, who's here at the University of Michigan.

444
00:41:53,860 --> 00:42:01,270
And we're going to talk about policy based solutions to firearm injury prevention and talk about it from a bunch of different perspectives,

445
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:09,010
you know, intimate partner violence, school violence, community violence, policy writ large.

446
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:16,000
So I think that's going to be a really cool, interesting panel. So I encourage all of you who are interested in that to come to us.

447
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:28,870
This is open. It's open. I think I can actually ask somebody right now and I will get you an answer probably before we leave.

448
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:40,550
But when you started doing this last week, that was one thing.

449
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:52,850
And then the second thing is Daniel Webster is coming for that policy challenge is also going to do a distinguished faculty seminar in the next day,

450
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:57,110
says 923 at 1 p.m. here at the School of Public Health.

451
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:02,390
But [INAUDIBLE] talk kind of broadly on his work and policy of prevention around firearm injuries.

452
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:11,840
And then on October 3rd at 4 p.m. here in school public health,

453
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:19,069
we're going to have Lois Lee and Eric Pfleger, who are pediatric physicians, come talk.

454
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:22,340
They were just recently wrote a book on pediatric firearm injury prevention

455
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:27,319
with a number of authors from Michigan who are who wrote chapters in the book.

456
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,830
And they're going to talk about their work environment prevention.

457
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,849
And then last but not least, October 25th, actually, two more things.

458
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:43,729
So October 25th at Palmer Commons, at 4 p.m., we're going to have a distinguished faculty seminar.

459
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:46,760
This is being hosted by the Injury Prevention Center.

460
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:54,440
It's going to feature Liz Damico, who is a researcher who does work on opioid misuse and opioid overdose prevention.

461
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,919
And a lot of her work has been through working with tribal populations.

462
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:06,889
And so she's going to talk specifically about her work there. And then last but not least, the School Safety Center,

463
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:13,070
the Injury Prevention Center and the Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention are putting on a conference in February.

464
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:19,700
I don't remember the day to day after about ten days after Valentine's Day on school violence prevention.

465
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,410
So and it's being led by our very young Justin.

466
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,410
So lots of opportunity and I think I just got a text sent her.

467
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:34,040
Thank you. Register for everything so we can plan space.

468
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:38,690
We have up to 200 spaces, so there's plenty of room.

469
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,770
I just register and I will make sure Jessica sends you.

470
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:46,440
Yes, she's. Other questions.

471
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,940
Lots of opportunity to learn. Internships over the summers.

472
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:55,230
So please, if you're interested in the stuff, reach out to us. My door is always open.

473
00:44:55,230 --> 00:45:00,240
I'm happy to talk to people. If this is something you get really interested in throughout your course here,

474
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:07,589
you guys have a great teacher and I think it's it's a great opportunity to learn about the

475
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:11,639
breadth of work that's going on here in Michigan and the ways that you can get involved.

476
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:16,380
And, you know, there's lots of ways that people can focus their careers.

477
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:24,959
I think injury prevention is fascinating because there's all kinds of things we can do from engineering solutions, building safer cars, you know,

478
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,930
developing urban planning interventions that build better roads to driver behavior and how

479
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:35,940
we change driver behavior to driver training and how we train drivers to drive better.

480
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,750
And when we say all drivers can't work anymore, can't drive anymore.

481
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,279
So there's just this like immense opportunity to make changes.

482
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:54,450
And, you know, that's maybe the untold story of the past 50 years is that car crashes has declined by 70 odd percent,

483
00:45:54,450 --> 00:46:01,110
76% in this country from the 1950s to now with more people driving on the road every day.

484
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:07,169
And that's really a success story of the approach and work that you will learn about it, I'm sure,

485
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:12,360
in this course or on how people thought about motor vehicle crash injury and that is now being applied to this

486
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:20,730
breadth of injuries that we have and it really has potential to move to the next step in all those areas.

487
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:28,170
So I think it's fascinating. I think you guys are going to enjoy this class and and I hope you get involved.

488
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:38,700
And yeah, it was great, you know, lots of days for you know, I did not write them down, but I know I will.

489
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:42,360
Yeah, I will make sure that you guys get that information. Okay. Yeah.

490
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:52,019
So I guess I just would note some folks in the in the program, this class, it really doesn't touch as much on global injury prevention.

491
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:56,530
Do is there anything around the university and or anyone around the university that talks about attendance?

492
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,629
Yeah. So let's see.

493
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:05,490
There's a number of folks focused on work outside the U.S. and you're you're going to tax my memory here.

494
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:12,510
So when I started as faculty, I actually started in global health by building an emergency medicine residency in sub-Saharan Africa.

495
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:18,840
But there are a lot of people focused on sort of injury in the international

496
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:24,030
context because it's really it's more prevalent than than almost anything else.

497
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:33,719
So I'm trying to think who in emergency medicine, Rocky Oteng this is who works up at Hurley Medical Center,

498
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:43,860
but as a U of M faculty member does a lot of work in Ghana, there's some folks in a big way and focused on maternal fetal mortality there.

499
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:49,049
The U.S. Department for Global Health at the medical school, they focus on stuff.

500
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:53,160
I'm not sure what the status is about. I'm sorry. A ton more on that.

501
00:47:53,220 --> 00:48:00,060
Oh, Ron Mayo to run Mayo in the injury center who used to be the head of the injury center many years ago.

502
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:05,130
And it's really semi-retirement. It's done a lot of work on injury prevention in their action context.

503
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:11,170
Sorry. Okay. Yeah. A project on sexual violence in sub-Saharan.

504
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:18,520
Yeah, I think in West Africa, maybe in Ghana, but it might also be in Senegal, I'm sure.

505
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:23,490
Yeah. Yeah, she's in nursing. Yeah, that's another question.

506
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:35,089
All right. All right. Well, thank you so much, Perry. I heard the offer.

507
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:39,440
He said Door's open, remains open. I will share his contact information.

508
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:43,340
Again, there's there's so much going on both at the institute and the injury center.

509
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:48,670
It is shame for you to do not know when things are happening and if it's of interest, need to be on the lookout.

510
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:53,840
We have times of these kind of faculty seminars and conferences and things that we're doing and so,

511
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:57,200
you know, they're great opportunities to meet and network with folks.

512
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:00,200
Usually there's food and refreshments and other stuff,

513
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:05,479
so so opportunities to sort of get to know people around campus who are doing this kind of work.

514
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:09,860
And I tell you, you know, there's lots of labs and lots of people looking for help.

515
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,850
And so if this is something you're interested in, you know, don't be shy.

516
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:20,330
Check out some of their one pagers. Just like the injury center. They have all these ways of getting dissemination like this research out there.

517
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:27,400
Yeah. Again, my experience is most injury faculty are willing to talk to students and they can find something.

518
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:30,980
So. All right. All right. Well, enjoy the course. Thanks so much.

519
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:37,640
We appreciate your time. All right.

520
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:54,130
Let's see, here's 140 ish when we usually end to end 230, 233 because my five are you want to go with 5 minutes?

521
00:49:54,150 --> 00:50:04,850
Let me take 5 minutes. We'll come back. I'm still not able to access the syllabus.

522
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:13,399
SS Access denied. Right.

523
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:24,630
Here is where you're okay. I can see that, of course.

524
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,730
Oh, she. I have to go back. All.

525
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:39,910
I don't think you can say they'll decide whether it's the right thing to do.

526
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:45,850
Yeah. If you want to pursue this. Yeah. Yeah.

527
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:56,110
And then he has the canister against me, so I guess I'm only able to access the other side.

528
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,670
Can you try it again? Just click on the silver page. And it was a not published works.

529
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:05,140
Yeah. Sorry. For whatever reason that page was not published.

530
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:13,460
Usually all the pages within are published. But. Yeah.

531
00:51:14,060 --> 00:52:22,710
We're gonna have to. Can I put codes on speaker?

532
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:27,900
Sure. I reached out to say capital. No, because that's in my name.

533
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:31,920
So. Okay. So promotion and something?

534
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,540
Sure. Is it.

535
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:39,480
Is it same hacker sexual assault prevention. Okay.

536
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:45,000
Okay. So if we get somebody, I work for them.

537
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:50,820
Okay. If you could send me a name of somebody you think would be great to come in and speak to us, that'd be great.

538
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:55,389
Yeah, I think they're currently hiring a lot of people.

539
00:52:55,390 --> 00:53:06,990
A pair of faculty and staff is a big one, and so they like to send people over there and I get sort of the name transition.

540
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:20,330
But I'll be. It means lots of transition periods last year and that reshuffling and restructuring resignations.

541
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:25,040
Right? Right. Yeah.

542
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:33,110
That was not a new. 40,009.

543
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,490
But you said mouse liberation. And I was like, Oh, that's a hard topic.

544
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,930
Everyone's very casual about those topics.

545
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:57,310
So very serious. No idea. I'm sure she was.

546
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:04,070
I think was. Yeah. No public bathrooms.

547
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:09,840
You know, construction is.

548
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:16,740
I like dreaming about the. Oh, what?

549
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:26,560
I'm not proposing to do this. I'm here in Jerusalem.

550
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:32,700
I will start lost as good as it gets in the ear.

551
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:36,020
Infection. Very specific infection.

552
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:44,000
And eventually, like America in good times.

553
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:48,200
It was very disconcerting for a good cause for a man's life story.

554
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:54,320
Oh, you're pretty confident that you did that? I don't like certain crime.

555
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:02,300
And there was. I remember.

556
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:07,260
I remember after security.

557
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,680
I think I would.

558
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:18,930
I don't know. That sounds so scary down there over all the testing afterwards.

559
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:25,730
I don't. Very.

560
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:41,080
There is a color, red color. And I remember that it was pretty color.

561
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:45,010
That's interesting. And being told to personalize it was like, okay,

562
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:54,160
so this is your first time because it doesn't work for the first because they didn't about and then I think the hearing.

563
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:04,900
Yeah, I did the same thing.

564
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:15,579
And then, you know, I'm like, okay, I get something like this, but it's got this really sheer fire,

565
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:21,940
like because I was very opposed to this, which is at a recent election.

566
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:29,020
Somewhere. We need to come away with your vitamins, and we do that for you.

567
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:34,730
He didn't. I never even knew what to do.

568
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:38,930
I still have them. All right, folks. Let's go.

569
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,380
I'll be back here. This last section for today.

570
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:46,250
It's a data dump. I'm just going to send a lot of information your way.

571
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:49,610
Feel free to ask questions. But again, this is just more of.

572
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:51,680
This is the field that we're gonna be talking about.

573
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:58,640
It's absolutely not comprehensive, but at least we'll give you an idea and we'll try to wrap up meeting a little bit early.

574
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,880
When I get my time check, I'm back here. So.

575
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:09,140
So these are things that I want folks to know about to make sure that we're understanding, moving away from.

576
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:15,500
You know, there's just nothing we could have ever done about this, right? We're going to change our mindset that this is unavoidable.

577
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:21,709
But in fact, it's predictable. If it's predictable and we can anticipate, then we can probably prevent it.

578
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:28,100
So we're gonna move away from some of this language that's more fatalist injury just

579
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:31,969
broadly from the CDC doesn't mean the CDC is the end all be all around injury,

580
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:39,020
but they're the ones that I know of that are thinking the most about it bodily harm resulting from severe exposure to an external force or substance.

581
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:42,860
So Pat mentioned, for example or example, that substance use and poisoning,

582
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:48,410
including intentional or unintentional overdose, is considered within the injury field.

583
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:53,000
So works which are we're being expansive about what constitutes an injury versus

584
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,309
not and how to adjust the mechanism as well as the intentionality behind it.

585
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:02,420
To the extent that we can, we can think through it intent,

586
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:09,469
whether an injury was caused by an act or are on purpose by oneself or another person with a goal of injuring or killing.

587
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:16,760
So when we think about intentional injury relative to unintentional injury, the burden shifts a little bit each year.

588
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:24,410
But generally speaking, unintentional injuries and intentional injuries are kind of part of her reversal rate.

589
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:29,930
This I think this was from 20 or 20 to about 56% would have been unintentional injuries.

590
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:35,900
This could be suffocation. Drowning, overdose or poisonings typically are considered unintentional injury.

591
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:46,400
Intentional injury, by contrast, would be things like violence, IPV, suicide, those type of things that would be would fall into that category.

592
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:50,479
And then there is still often a lot of things that we just don't know.

593
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:56,660
There are fatalities, there are injuries that are happening, but we don't know the cause. And the best we can or the best of the data is available.

594
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:03,420
We're trying to document it, but more often not incomplete. Data means that there is this gap and sometimes it's really significant.

595
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:07,190
I'm sorry. I forgot your name. We. We, we, we.

596
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:14,720
Yes. So the categorization of all these injuries, is it determined by how is also reported?

597
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:18,709
It kind of looks at all things, but I can see. Yeah.

598
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:23,210
So all this is based off of CDC data and there are kind of whisker systems.

599
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:30,770
So they have a whole bunch of codes and this is how people assign to codes and whether that's the admitting meeting physician or if it's a coroner,

600
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:36,920
those are the ones who are ultimately categorized or monitor these these data.

601
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,899
And that's going to be what's uploaded into the system. So this is not always been in place.

602
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:46,340
So there's a violent death reporting system that's been around for about ten, 15 years, wasn't always in place.

603
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:51,890
The data monitoring is getting better. But then also not to be. Forget that there is a lot of injury that goes unreported.

604
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:59,030
Even some fatalities that get mischaracterized are diagnosed. And so although the data is really, really helpful,

605
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:02,239
we have to think about it is incomplete and thinking about ways that we can do

606
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:08,630
a better job of making sure we're representing it and keep early questions,

607
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:16,700
happy to to interrupt it or to help folks at any point if we were going to say intentional injuries or assaults,

608
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:20,960
definition here, self harm definition here, I won't read them to you.

609
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:26,150
But again, the the idea is that there is a purposeful intent behind some of that injury.

610
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:29,629
Right. This was an important distinction.

611
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:39,530
Yes. There are new research looking at the models for like not disclosing an injury and then or like corrupt filing if it's like,

612
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:44,200
oh, I found know my buddy did something I'm not going to say like this and look at the motives behind that at all.

613
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,389
Yeah. And it's also especially an intentional injury.

614
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:51,050
So the places where I tend to think through there is underreporting.

615
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:53,450
So violence is one of it.

616
01:00:54,080 --> 01:01:00,170
So people don't want to report that they've been injured because they could get in trouble if they were if they were involved in an altercation.

617
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:04,760
Sometimes treatment is not sort of an emergency room, so that could go unreported.

618
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:08,899
We have people in particular in intimate partner relationships.

619
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:12,500
They don't want to get their significant other spouse or whatever in trouble.

620
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:22,330
So they might not report something. So the the research that I can think of, there are some from criminology that's focused a lot of on the like.

621
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:30,660
Code of the streets is one of the ones that's been re operationalized in different settings like schools and in community settings and whatever,

622
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:38,370
where people just are reluctant to tell who did what for whatever reason, whether it's not trusting law enforcement, whether it's fear of retaliation.

623
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,130
So there is some of that work from that field.

624
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:46,470
I think, again, intimate partner violence is another space where people recognize that underreporting occurs,

625
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:50,640
but then trying to quantify or categorize that becomes very, very difficult.

626
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:57,470
And they've talked to survivors about why they're reluctant to share.

627
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:02,850
Oftentimes, it's financial pressure. It's concerns about custody.

628
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:06,120
It's concerns about retaliation.

629
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:12,660
So those are all reasons that people from the kind of qualitative interviews of survivors that have come over as to why they would not stay or leave,

630
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:20,880
perhaps their abuser. A follow up question, would that would most of those reasons fall under structural or individual?

631
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,260
That's a great question. And I would say it's probably a combination.

632
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:25,530
Right.

633
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:32,160
But I would think you can have structural features that impact an individual situation that could then influence the way that they're responding.

634
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:42,700
That's part of it. And that this stigmatization about this is your fault or this is someone's fault for being injured.

635
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:48,940
Right. And if you're not the perpetrator moving away from that kind of language,

636
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:53,979
this is this is something about you that you're suffering from depression or anxiety.

637
01:02:53,980 --> 01:03:01,360
Right. So we're trying to to move away from sort of that plain language, like victim blaming or wherever else it might be,

638
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:05,410
so that we can still talk about this and understand how to support folks,

639
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:09,490
how to address those who are perpetrators, but also understanding, for example, in bullying.

640
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:14,950
You know, I have a lot of bully victims, right? Intimate partner violence. You have a lot of reciprocal violence between partners.

641
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:21,430
So it's not just necessarily always one way. So is there any sort of way to or is there something.

642
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:32,290
Are in place for helping to protect people, to report any sort of like that from any negative repercussions.

643
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:37,299
Yeah, and there's some and I'm trying to think of specific examples.

644
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:44,050
Certainly we have sort of the equivalent of whistleblower rules, something in some of the school contexts that I work in.

645
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:47,980
But it can be very, very difficult and there are is absolutely reprisal that can happen.

646
01:03:48,670 --> 01:03:53,590
And that's one of the reasons why you, for example, do not want to report when something could be happening.

647
01:03:53,590 --> 01:04:00,969
So thinking through those kinds of interventions, understanding the reasons why people do and the do not report again in my space,

648
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:04,270
anonymous versus confidential reporting systems, they're used differently.

649
01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:10,540
If I know that I'm going to have to share my information and share information about the altercation or my concern,

650
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,680
whether it's somebody who might be bringing a weapon to school or whether somebody who might have said,

651
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:19,350
I'm going to kill myself, does that change the behavior?

652
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:26,290
So thinking about our health, behavior, ideas, your self-efficacy to report or to act,

653
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:33,250
your willingness to act your your self, I mean, you're aware of some of those other steps for getting them up.

654
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:37,570
So that advocacy and folks in here should know this.

655
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:42,420
You took 600. Yeah. And they don't come to me.

656
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:46,840
But anyways, so trying to address some of those upstream features that might be preventing reporting,

657
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:53,980
but these are great questions and there's not a whole ton that I know of research that's out there specifically on the reporting aspect of it,

658
01:04:55,240 --> 01:05:02,060
certainly from the anonymous reporting side, there's zero. And yet they're in 90% of school districts.

659
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:12,540
Questions. Again thinking self harm as an intention, not as as an unintentional trigger.

660
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:19,590
So how we might approach that differently than if assuming it's an intentional so transportation related poisoning.

661
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:23,700
So that would be most of your substance use and related overdoses drowning.

662
01:05:23,730 --> 01:05:25,020
So different though, however,

663
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:30,720
if you are intentionally taking enough opioid to kill yourself that there's intent there were making a distinguish a distinction.

664
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:39,090
Again that's only important to the extent that it could change how we would intervene or how we want to to design our support services.

665
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:45,060
Drownings, sports related fire. All of these can kind of fall within the unintentional injury space.

666
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:46,010
Right.

667
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:51,570
And if you look at the CDC codes and we will do this later on this semester, you would not believe the different categorizations that are out there,

668
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:57,900
all sorts of different ways that people, unfortunately, can hurt themselves. And then here you are, a policymaker in the state of Michigan.

669
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:12,830
Where are you going to direct those resources? Drowning incidence is higher than fire, if I'm remembering correctly.

670
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:17,660
Certainly higher than getting struck by an object that was not by another person.

671
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:21,560
Like a tree farm. All terrible things.

672
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:26,600
Finite number of resources. Where are we going to put our efforts? How do we make those decisions?

673
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:31,729
Maybe fire is more preventable because there is more information about fire detectors.

674
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:39,890
The technology is better than drowning, for example. We know how to secure a home better than we do a pool or the docks out on Lake Michigan.

675
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:44,900
Unfortunately, drowning seven every every year, it's becoming a bigger issue rather than a smaller one.

676
01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:52,470
Where do you direct again the efforts? How do we think about designing interventions that could be different here?

677
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:56,660
If you haven't seen it before and I'm sorry, it's a little small to see.

678
01:06:57,410 --> 01:07:01,400
Remember that second category, that second challenge, developmental?

679
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:05,060
Look at the injury burden across the lifespan.

680
01:07:05,870 --> 01:07:14,510
When do injuries happen? What form of injuries have unintentional versus intentional injury are the ones that are in these different colors?

681
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:18,020
I am colorblind. I think this looks blue.

682
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:22,040
It could be a different color to you. I couldn't tell you what color this is.

683
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:25,310
I must say it's brown. If it's something else, it has to correct me.

684
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:30,560
Like I said, brown or orange?

685
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:35,030
The green. Yeah, green. But yeah.

686
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:41,750
So blue boxes are all an intentional injury. Homicide is orange and then green.

687
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:53,510
Green is is suicide in this case. And you can see how the burden starts to shift as we get older and older throughout the developmental span.

688
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:58,010
So again, what this tells us, what this data allows us to do is to think,

689
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:03,569
do we want to be looking at suicide prevention programs for those 65 years and older?

690
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:07,160
It doesn't mean it doesn't happen here, but where is the biggest injury burn,

691
01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:11,600
unintentional injury we're going to see in the next slide how we can break that down.

692
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:15,470
Where should we be focusing our efforts? How should we be thinking about interventions?

693
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:16,580
What, at worst,

694
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:26,510
for a suicide intervention or education program for a ten year old to 14 year old could look very different for a 25 year old or 34 year old, right.

695
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:30,000
For somebody my age. Here.

696
01:08:30,570 --> 01:08:39,990
It's. Okay. So in wrote ten columns 5 to 9 suicide but it says 20 and then some Asterix it's

697
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:45,600
some there could be because there is not enough numbers in the cell to be reliable.

698
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:56,620
Okay. That is such a young age. Sorry, I was right there. So the lesser the ages are taught in the woods on that.

699
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:59,850
The members want to rank the most.

700
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:04,660
Most of these are the top ten reasons that people die in the United States.

701
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:12,250
You can start to see as we get older. Unfortunately, things like heart attacks and cancer begin to overtake or you're going to be the most prominent.

702
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:18,940
But then again, if we think if we're again operating on that premise, that those injuries are preventable.

703
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:25,000
Really look at how much opportunity there is for us. Look at how many lives we can make a difference in.

704
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,630
If we can do our science well and we can get this information out there.

705
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:33,820
That's the promise of this field. Like Patterson was one crunch pal said.

706
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:40,920
Other people say the same thing. There's a lot of opportunity here. But these big old boxes are at the top, are really unattached.

707
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,520
And that could be any number of things. And here's those things.

708
01:09:44,530 --> 01:09:48,850
But first, what's your question? Just a little weird question, but I was thinking about missing people.

709
01:09:49,450 --> 01:10:00,350
Yeah. Where do they follow in those books? Like, I think that would either be undetermined or unless they are in my list, it's pretty clear,

710
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:06,790
unless it's confirmed at some point that it was an attack and not someone like actively missing.

711
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:12,970
All right. Well, is it clear or do you think they're going to need a cause of death from a coroner,

712
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:19,780
whether it's somebody that's fallen into a lake or a hunting accident or something like that?

713
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:23,450
One thing I like tribal communities, something like people. Right.

714
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:30,550
So going can be totally skewed. Right. So there could very easily and again, this this data is great to have.

715
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:35,770
The likelihood of underreporting is happening very high. The likelihood of mis categorization is happening very high.

716
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:45,070
Where we can potentially do is try our best to to actually model the error and understand what the limits are,

717
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:50,470
the kind of confidence intervals of our estimates here. So that's easy to like.

718
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:58,389
Seen a trend. But in seeing a trend, how do we go to looking at the disparities and then looking at the disparities,

719
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:01,870
determining the direct action plans if it's going to look different for each group?

720
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:07,390
Well, the question so let's start by what we're going to do is peel away layers of the onion here.

721
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,959
So let's start to look now. All right. I mean, here we have we started.

722
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:17,200
We just kind of want to touch on a big, old, broad category. We can start to break down when we talk about one area of injury.

723
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:23,260
What do we mean when we talk about even suicide? We can break down the means and methods that attempts there might have been happen.

724
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:27,459
Right? Or was it a firearm? Was it an overdose? Was it a strangulation?

725
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:32,560
Suffocation hanging? Based on the method, maybe we can make the different sort of decisions.

726
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:40,510
I'm sorry. This is so small and really hard to read. Top is total motor vehicle.

727
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:46,510
Motor vehicle and traffic poisoning, which would include overdoses drowning.

728
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:56,560
Is there is this one transport, other land transport transports that might be like like a four wheeler or something like that.

729
01:11:57,050 --> 01:12:04,900
False fire, fire, burn, suffocation, pedestrian natural environment kind of on down the road.

730
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:11,770
Right. So we can start thinking about within just one category of unintentional injury, the different ways that we can break this down.

731
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:18,070
Half of these are from overdose opioids, alcohol.

732
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:21,840
Right. And we can break it down even further and figure out a bunch of questions here.

733
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:27,130
So just breaking down poisonings. That's our overdose.

734
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:31,510
Half of those are narcotics, psychedelics,

735
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:40,970
hallucinogens that are have other kinds of poisoning or unspecified drugs or medical medicines that can be different.

736
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:50,530
So this one's alcohol. Gases and vapors.

737
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:56,920
So there are some things that we're going to be told that we can kind of break down to, again, understand where do we need to focus our effort.

738
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:03,340
This is, again, just start with 2017. This is our 15 to 24 points.

739
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:07,090
And that could look very different from the 35 to 44.

740
01:13:08,290 --> 01:13:11,320
I think you're going to see that opioids are going to be a consistent one across all of this.

741
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:15,580
But this is also still with a young people.

742
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:20,430
They're less confident behind the wheel. They have fewer hours. This is just an experienced thing.

743
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:23,709
It's not that young people don't know how to drive. It's just they need more experience.

744
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:26,830
The better it they're the longer you do something, the better you tend to be it. Right.

745
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:31,000
So thinking, moving away, blame language. Adolescents can't drive their crazy.

746
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:33,970
You're driving 100 miles an hour. That's not necessarily what's happening here.

747
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:43,180
So understanding these data can help us to make more of a refine, estimate and a more targeted approach to how we're going to do this.

748
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:48,070
Five Leading Causes of Death by Age Group.

749
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:57,190
I just like this data is a little bit older, but you can start to see how the burden changes over over the course of the life span.

750
01:13:57,730 --> 01:14:05,440
Right. So again, starting to see some more some injury things starting to represent more often as we get to the older end of the spectrum.

751
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:11,110
And that to me suggests that if we are thinking about planning interventions, if we are thinking about community communications,

752
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:15,670
what do I want to be talking about to parents of young children versus parents

753
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:20,290
of adolescents versus new parents versus older parents and grandparents?

754
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:23,740
Right. All that kind of communication and messaging could start to change.

755
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:29,020
And I know this is a data dump, but the whole purpose is to know that it's out here and that we can we now going

756
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:34,140
to review it over the course of the semester and this is all in the slide. I still have not forgotten your question here.

757
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:39,790
Here's the success story that I was mentioning, unintentional injuries over the last,

758
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:43,840
I think, what, 20 years or something like that, actually, since 1985.

759
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:49,390
You can see how the motor vehicle crashes.

760
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:53,110
They're getting better, folks. This is the success story.

761
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:57,729
This is quite the success story juxtaposed, unfortunately,

762
01:14:57,730 --> 01:15:07,810
with what's clearly a country that's still suffering from structural influences, private influences, whatever it's going to be.

763
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:12,040
And it's still manifesting itself in a greater and greater burden for our populations.

764
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:17,290
And so then where are we thinking about again one more time, something like a broken record,

765
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:21,759
but directing resources or thinking through where do we see trends and is this

766
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:26,830
helping us trying to figure out how we can either readjust resources or efforts?

767
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:31,960
Where do those funding ideas need to go? So a lot of this is directed by the NIH, directed by the CDC.

768
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:35,770
Where should those new RFP, who are we trying to call to action?

769
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:43,630
Who are we trying to get out there? What areas have successful interventions that we can replicate or extend to different to different fields?

770
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:49,600
Right. So we were able to get people to wear seat belts, both through a combination of messaging, but also loss.

771
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:55,540
Does that mean we use a combination of messaging or laws, or is this a whole different animal and why?

772
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:58,659
So who knows about this space? Who knows what the bird looks like?

773
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:06,670
Who's been talking to folks who are suffering from addiction or not, getting access to the treatments that they need?

774
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:10,330
What are the wraparound services look like? Are those equitably distributed?

775
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:17,920
All sorts of questions that you're right, all sorts of things that we can be different on a day to day continues nonfatal injury here.

776
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:25,360
It's not all about the fatalities. 23 million folks, 23 million every year.

777
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,469
Nonfatal injuries. This is basically requiring either a hospital visit.

778
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:37,360
You need a hospitalization, right? To a certain extent, you do think about fights and more minor injuries, but those typically don't get recorded.

779
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:43,930
Right. So of the ones that are recorded on average, they cost folks about $3,000.

780
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:51,030
I talked about the opportunity cost for having so much money devoted towards it.

781
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:59,680
So things that are very preventable. Most of the nonfatal injury is unintentional and that's because the means for firearms, etc.,

782
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:07,300
are just more likely to lead to a fatality suicide more likely to lead to a fatality going to fall, for example.

783
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:17,290
So broadly speaking, the unintentional injury or the non fatal injuries tend to be unintentional types of injury.

784
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:31,370
I still I'm going to get there. There are slides there from the basic premier.

785
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:35,330
So injuries are not an accident. We talked about this. They're predictable and preventable.

786
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,219
This feels a little redundant from early sigh.

787
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:43,010
Apologize for that but can share characteristics of time, place and person's dog if we can get him in here.

788
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:49,370
I think he does some really interesting work about the temporality of injury, like what's happening at the time,

789
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:55,820
what's going on with people when an injury right before an injury occurs at the time, and then following injury.

790
01:17:56,150 --> 01:18:00,200
And if you think about all the different forms of injury that we might talk about, that's going to shift for.

791
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:03,469
There are some interesting questions there, depending on the context,

792
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:06,920
depending on the individual, depending on the type of injury that we're studying.

793
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:16,430
But we believe that we can develop interventions to limit or prevent to prevent or limit the extent of injury, burden of injury.

794
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:19,580
I'm going to talk a lot about this because it's inevitably born.

795
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:28,580
Let's see your ten leading causes of death for folks in the US 2018 noticing that we see changes developmentally.

796
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:40,280
So as you might expect, there are lower rates of some some just kind of physiological things, higher rates of unintentional injuries.

797
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:48,290
So you think about young kids, we're likely to have an accident from drowning, from fire, from self suffocation.

798
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:53,569
Excuse me. We do start to see as we get into the second stage of life, things like suicide,

799
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:58,550
homicide are beginning to represent themselves much, much higher rates than we did at younger ages.

800
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:06,319
And we could do this throughout the year, throughout the spectrum. But I think this is just an interesting juxtaposition of how these things start to

801
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:13,129
change as we move forward in the life course fatalities forces that are place,

802
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:16,820
too, but they are the tip of the iceberg. We can't just stop here.

803
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:27,500
Okay. I think about those that are hospitalized at great expense and great pain and suffering for the individuals as well as recovery.

804
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:32,480
But then we can think about people who go to a hospital but are ultimately not admitted.

805
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:37,610
We can think about people who are just going to the family doctor. Do they have a broken arm or because they were in a severe enough fight?

806
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:38,750
And then this is the big one.

807
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:49,309
Unfortunately, it is the largest chunk of the pyramid, those who we just don't know and is probably not going to get reported represented here.

808
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:53,630
We got some injury veterans being very by many factors, including sex, age and race.

809
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:57,770
You're going to start to see your first, in my opinion, a weakness or or one or a few.

810
01:19:57,770 --> 01:19:59,930
But the weakness in the CDC data,

811
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:07,580
the decision makers who decide to pull these things together and what level of discrimination or detail are they going to be collecting information.

812
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:15,530
So, for example, sex differences, this is the best I could find for I cannot find any sort of information from the CDC,

813
01:20:15,890 --> 01:20:18,440
people who do not identify as either male or female.

814
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:23,239
We know there are individuals who do not identify as male or female, and they are missing from this data.

815
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:26,360
We happen to know that they also suffer different disproportionate rates of bullying.

816
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:30,920
There are certain intimate partner statistics that look different.

817
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:38,630
And when that starts to I guess when it's not represented, then these are less fair, fewer people thinking about or we could be missing.

818
01:20:38,990 --> 01:20:41,720
For example, people are suffering at a disproportionate rate.

819
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:50,809
But for males and females that are getting categorized within the data, the types of injuries look a little bit different, right?

820
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:55,010
So in terms of accidents, intentional self harm, assault,

821
01:20:55,310 --> 01:21:04,550
you can see the rates here look a little bit different whether we're talking about in this case at the end of adolescence, males versus females.

822
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:13,160
So thinking about the the populations that you're most interested in working with, think about the area of of injury that you may be working with.

823
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:18,860
Could be could could change depending on the sex of the participants.

824
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:24,379
Race differences mortality rates again children just might this where it's been most of my

825
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:33,380
time working noticing the different burden based on their their race idea or think identity.

826
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:44,389
I agree with the blue is a purple type.

827
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:48,500
Purple and. Well, come on, that's blue and. All right.

828
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:56,570
Well, then white purple I think might be males and females are number one, I'm sorry, 1 to 4 years and 5 to 14 years.

829
01:21:57,050 --> 01:22:04,170
So looking at why just kind of a disparities across race, but then also the differences in age.

830
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:07,310
So 1 to 4 versus five, 14 years.

831
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:18,640
Thinking about intersections between the two, you might find that there are broad differences bi racial category.

832
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:22,630
You might find that they're exacerbated no matter where most. I don't know.

833
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:26,260
They are exacerbated when I further break this down by sex.

834
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:30,639
And we can see, I think both for for black males,

835
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:36,549
for American Indian males tend to be even higher so that the disproportionate burden is even

836
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:41,540
more stark when we break it down by when we break it further into multiple categories,

837
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:48,630
you're thinking about that intersection. So all of these different facets of our identities probably play into once to

838
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:52,780
an extent or another to some of the injuries topics that we're going to stay.

839
01:22:53,290 --> 01:22:58,030
And so thinking through those and whether or not that would change the way that you're approaching an intervention.

840
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:02,800
Thing. No. I'll pull off.

841
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:05,290
I'll see if I can find. I made a slight pause.

842
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:13,160
Okay, so for next week, we're going to be we're going to take a little bit more and a little more depth about this.

843
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:16,150
So what are some of those factors? We've already touched on a few.

844
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:23,260
There are certainly some in some individual factors that might make someone at a lower or a relative risk versus others.

845
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:26,710
There are absolutely some social factors, societal factors.

846
01:23:27,190 --> 01:23:29,710
Where are they playing in and are they the same for everybody?

847
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:36,520
Do we see the different influences that are kind of consistent across versus those that are maybe more isolated?

848
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:41,020
And if we know that, where again would we focus to really focus on those isolated things?

849
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:50,590
Or could we potentially influence multiple areas if we, for example, look at systemic factors or if we look at structural features or influences?

850
01:23:56,190 --> 01:23:59,280
The measurement, high level of measurement.

851
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:05,790
This is good stuff. And one spent tons and tons of time here, but it's now thinking or if we see that there are some differences.

852
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:11,820
If we see that there might be opportunities based on the data, how can we kind of ensure that anything that we're doing is data driven?

853
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:23,430
How can we ensure that we maintain good data, good collection, so that we're not making decisions based on faulty information surveillance?

854
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:27,840
I'll let folks read this definition. But basically, we think that this is very important.

855
01:24:28,290 --> 01:24:31,470
Otherwise, it's very easy to not see injury.

856
01:24:32,010 --> 01:24:38,370
It's a very overt thing, but certainly not it's not it's not borne by everyone.

857
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:41,840
And it's not something that folks think about all the time.

858
01:24:41,850 --> 01:24:48,060
And if so, if we're not collecting this information, it's easy to get lost or it's easy to move away from really data driven decision.

859
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:57,150
Just so folks know or use incidents and prevalence, they're not interchangeable once talking about the frequency in a given time period.

860
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:02,910
Once targeted by the proportion of a population in a given time period or a specific time bird point.

861
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:11,370
So things to think about when we are collecting some of this data, where are we setting our priorities?

862
01:25:11,910 --> 01:25:13,830
When are we going to be collecting some of this data?

863
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:19,259
Oftentimes when we're talking about imagery, we have to think about sensitive time periods for the individuals.

864
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:24,450
If we're going to understand what happened, are we talking to people in the head? Are we talking to people doing where their care providers are?

865
01:25:24,450 --> 01:25:29,940
We're trying to follow up and asking retrospectively what happened? All of these things bring in issues of privacy.

866
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:33,180
All of these things that you can imagine, bringing issues of resources,

867
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:36,780
whether or not we have the means and the the ability to collect those information.

868
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:45,970
When you read in the data, obviously it's easy to see the trends like a bespoke linear digression, but there's like a gap and we're to an age period.

869
01:25:45,990 --> 01:25:52,190
How do you interpret that? Or how would you go about like thinking of the information?

870
01:25:52,200 --> 01:26:01,559
Because like I'm looking back at the five leading causes of death, the color code there, and between one and four homicide is fairly high.

871
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:06,030
But then between ages like five and 14, it's low and then it just jumps back up.

872
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:12,540
It's like, am my head of asking what is going on between five and nine and 14?

873
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:18,209
And then it just goes like back up like as a Yeah, no.

874
01:26:18,210 --> 01:26:20,550
And I like that you're thinking critically about the data.

875
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:25,800
So 1.1 thought could be if you have a longer age span, something could be getting averaged out, right?

876
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:29,640
So there could still be a high rate of homicides for, for example, 10 to 14 year olds.

877
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:34,770
But if it's lower rates for 5 to 9 year olds, maybe that isn't represented as well.

878
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:38,760
Not sure, but that could be one reason why you see a spike.

879
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:45,810
A drop, a spike. So it's if it's binary or whatever. I think for the question, like gaps.

880
01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:53,170
I see it and it's maybe a little cliche, but this is kind of where your theory should step in.

881
01:26:53,560 --> 01:27:02,080
Right. You should have at least something I would suggest. What is it about earlier age ranges that might then make them more susceptible to homicide,

882
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:04,090
if that's like shaken baby syndrome or something like that,

883
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:15,070
or just neglect that could increase that rate versus those younger, I guess, slightly older ages to try to fill in some of those bases.

884
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:21,600
But there's not necessarily always going to be data for all of our populations, all our age ranges.

885
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:29,950
And so we're using a game theory to say, well, if we're reasonably confident that this is working for a similar population,

886
01:27:29,950 --> 01:27:35,080
can we extrapolate and try to do something with with this unknown space?

887
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:40,540
But that's probably best, I guess, for the.

888
01:27:46,030 --> 01:27:53,829
How you emphasize the differences in we're trying to figure out the differences in what causes a different interest for different communities,

889
01:27:53,830 --> 01:27:57,460
because every community has their own cultures and their own.

890
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:04,250
Unique circumstances that me let's just say, for example,

891
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:11,690
some of the injuries going about how do you then prevent those injuries and how do you then navigate around that?

892
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:19,400
I think that's a great question. It feels very public health to me, and I think that's a great thing.

893
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:23,120
And I will tell you why. So the state of Michigan rolled out a few years ago.

894
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:27,020
I was actually at the injury center S.O.S. It's an opioid surveillance system.

895
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:31,940
And the idea is to get real time data about when someone dies from an overdose

896
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:37,340
or even now expanded to when someone when a EMT has respond to an overdose,

897
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:42,710
that means they're collecting EMT data, hospital data and coroner data.

898
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:49,940
That's all the data that they're collecting to try to guide police officers, first responders, family members,

899
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:56,569
community residents who have been trained in naloxone distribution to a spot where there

900
01:28:56,570 --> 01:29:01,130
could be a a sudden surge in opioid related overdose or wherever else it's going to be.

901
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:04,730
But that's the extent of the data. It's numbers.

902
01:29:05,330 --> 01:29:10,879
It does not get into the why or the house. It does not get into those people.

903
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:16,730
Were those those situations where an overdose was averted because someone did have no access to access to provide that treatment?

904
01:29:17,150 --> 01:29:22,100
Right. How then do you supplement that information?

905
01:29:22,550 --> 01:29:26,430
It's getting in to talk to the community members. It's getting into talking to first responders.

906
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:30,320
I tried to do this was a partnership that we have with the Detroit Health Department.

907
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:36,950
That's hard to do. It's hard to find the people who are willing to talk to us about, yes, we did have a successful reversal.

908
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:41,269
And this these are the circumstances. It's expensive to do so.

909
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:44,660
That piece is often missing from what I keep calling administrative data.

910
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:47,810
And but it's there's nothing to say that S.O.S. is an important.

911
01:29:48,290 --> 01:29:53,869
It can tell us if there's all of a sudden a sudden spike in fentanyl related overdoses.

912
01:29:53,870 --> 01:29:56,360
That probably means that there are some dangerous drugs out on the street,

913
01:29:57,020 --> 01:30:01,219
and you're trying to get information out to a community they're trying to expand the system

914
01:30:01,220 --> 01:30:06,290
to now also include firearm injury so people can know when there's been an incident.

915
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:09,560
But that's not going to get at some of the different individual communities.

916
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:15,500
It's not going to help us understand what could work for those communities if we're going to try to do prevention related behaviors.

917
01:30:15,890 --> 01:30:23,330
All of those things tend to just be open questions. And so that's where I'm hoping folks like you and others in this room might

918
01:30:23,330 --> 01:30:28,700
be interested in trying to figure out what could we do that's standardized,

919
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:37,969
replicable, cost effective scale so that we can start to have some of those conversations and understand more about just the endpoint?

920
01:30:37,970 --> 01:30:45,140
Because I kind of alluded to by the time you show up in a in a hospital data or unfortunately like a corner office,

921
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:50,389
the opioid overdose prevention opportunity has gone right.

922
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:56,600
Or we're talking about a different form of treatment than if you talk to somebody in a community prior to or something.

923
01:30:57,050 --> 01:31:01,370
So those are those are good challenges, but there are challenges.

924
01:31:01,370 --> 01:31:06,050
And, you know, answer your question now.

925
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:16,579
Address the question that addressed the question then. Yeah, I don't have an answer for you other than I think there are a lot of grassroot community

926
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:21,680
efforts where people are working with their neighbors when I would love to see it.

927
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:28,129
I mean, I'm a researcher. I come from this perspective. We love to see communities that want to work with academics.

928
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:31,730
For example, these research to practice partnerships are going to be, in my opinion,

929
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:35,060
a lot more effective than when a researcher comes in and says, Hey, I got a great intervention for you.

930
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:42,050
So that's I mean, that's another way that we can use CPR. I know it's a big area in our our our field,

931
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:47,240
thinking through how we can leverage some of those success stories in a just a new space and do different kind of help.

932
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:58,830
Yeah, but I think like this before me, I think that's where it will go wrong, where they're going to be like, Here's what you need to do.

933
01:31:58,830 --> 01:32:08,670
And it's a young family. And so I think we need to change about that to make the committee work with us as partners and in telling them.

934
01:32:08,970 --> 01:32:14,940
Right. Yeah. And to a certain extent, there is there are there are influences outside of our control.

935
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:20,340
There are some priority settings. So when I get funded to do a big project like this, I'm asked to tell you what's the outcome going to be?

936
01:32:20,610 --> 01:32:27,510
How effective is my intervention? Rarely are they saying we're actually really closely monitoring the implementation, the acceptability,

937
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:34,259
the fidelity with which you're aggravating or intervention is getting from the the recruitment and reach of your intervention.

938
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:38,790
Are you actually getting to the community members that are most affected by this, whatever the injury might be?

939
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:39,389
Right.

940
01:32:39,390 --> 01:32:47,700
So trying to reprioritize some of those pieces that could inform how well the intervention is working when it's not working, for whom it's working.

941
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:51,180
Those are all great questions. And they're kind of related to implementation science, which we're talking about next week.

942
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:56,480
How are you feeling, folks? Are we getting. It's about 220.

943
01:32:57,650 --> 01:33:06,680
I am going to probably leave you with just a small assignment to just scan the remaining slides.

944
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:10,250
There's not too many of them. And I don't think it's going to be anything you haven't seen before.

945
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:14,260
Different types of data sources I think you're going to use.

946
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:16,490
We can use different sort of different data sources.

947
01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:21,740
There's a little bit of an intersection in terms of how we can use the appropriate methods and sources, etc.

948
01:33:22,070 --> 01:33:24,710
And I'd say for the remaining maybe five or six slides that I have,

949
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:29,660
you can probably infer one is talking about, but if you have any questions about, bring them next Tuesday.

950
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,960
Next Thursday. Thank you so much for joining us today.

951
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:38,440
I hope you're excited about the class. I'm excited to hear what you have to bring to the table and I will see you.

952
01:33:38,450 --> 01:33:41,480
Have a great Labor Day weekend. Be safe. All right.

953
01:33:41,510 --> 01:33:44,830
We'll see you next week, Peter.

954
01:33:45,770 --> 01:33:54,200
Thank you. Yeah, you know, I think your heart.
