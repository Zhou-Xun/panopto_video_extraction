00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Population health. Part three, life expectancy.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In the first segment of this lecture, we defined and illustrated the concepts of health, public health and population health.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In the second segment, we illustrated these concepts by focusing on infant mortality.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In this segment, we will focus on another important measure of population health, life expectancy.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
As before, we need to define a few concepts, life expectancy or more specifically,

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
life expectancy at birth is the expected or average number of years that a newborn infant is expected to live.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If current mortality rates remain constant in the future.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Since in reality, mortality rates are constantly changing.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The concept of life expectancy is a bit artificial, but nevertheless,

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
it is one of the most useful measures for assessing the overall health status of a population.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:21,000
In addition to life expectancy at birth, one may also consider life expectancy after having attained any given age.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For example, life expectancy at age 65 is the average number of years that a 65 year old is expected to live.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
If current mortality rates remain constant in the future here, the key difference is that it is assumed that want to survive to age 65.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So the mortality rates prior to age 65 are not relevant.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Only mortality rates for those 65 and older are considered less.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Life expectancy at age 65 provides a measure of risk factors that pertain to older people.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
From nineteen hundred to 2015, the life expectancy at birth in the United States went up by more than 30 years,

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
an increase of nearly two thirds, as with the reduction in infant mortality.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The improvement in life expectancy is a remarkable success.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Notably, the reduction in infant mortality was the major contributing factor to the great increase in life expectancy during this period.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And many of the same underlying factors contributed to the success, such as better sanitation,

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:45,000
better food, better housing and better and more access to medical care.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
However, if we look more closely, in particular at the life expectancies for males and females,

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
separately, we see some interesting and divergent patterns in nineteen hundred.

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The life expectancy at birth for females was only two years greater than for males.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But over the next 70 years, the life expectancy gap increased to seven point six years, which is a huge difference.

27
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Since 1970, the difference has shrunk to four point nine years.

28
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Why are there these differences by sex? And why have they changed over time?

29
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Well, there are many contributing factors.

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But two of the most important factors involve changes in maternal mortality and mortality related to cigaret smoking.

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
At the beginning of the 20th century, pregnancy was a very risky life event.

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The maternal mortality rate or the number of mothers who died of pregnancy related problems during pregnancy or

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:01,000
soon after giving birth was almost was over eight hundred per 100000 live births or just under one percent.

34
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
However, as shown in this graph, the maternal mortality rate began to decline significantly in the 1920s,

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and by 1950 the rate was less than one hundred per hundred thousand.

36
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And in 2013, the number was less than 20 per hundred thousand, representing an overall decline of more than 98 percent.

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
There are a number of factors that contributed to this public health success,

38
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
many of which have already been mentioned, including better sanitation, clean water, better nutrition,

39
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
improved and more widely available medical practice, and in more recent decades,

40
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
legalization of abortion, which vastly reduced maternal deaths from septic illegal abortions.

41
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Obviously, none of these changes had any impact on life expectancy for males.

42
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But all of these changes contributed to the improved life expectancy for females,

43
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:10,000
thereby contributing to the increase in the life expectancy gap between females and males during the early and middle decades of the 20th century.

44
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
A second factor that helps to explain the increase in the life expectancy gap between males

45
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and females during the middle decades of the 20th century is the increase in cigaret smoking,

46
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:33,000
particularly among men. The graph displays the trend in per capita cigaret consumption for men and women combined in the United States.

47
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Notably, cigaret consumption among men in the United States began to increase during and after World War One.

48
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But it really exploded during World War Two. Women did not begin to smoke in large numbers until later in the 1950s, the 60s and the 70s,

49
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
after which smoking rates had been declining among both men and women.

50
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Though at present, more men still smoke and they tend to smoke more cigarets per day.

51
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Compared to women, smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease.

52
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
A variety of cancers, including lung cancer as shown here, and chronic lung disease, which,

53
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
as we will see soon have been among the leading causes of death since the middle of the 20th century.

54
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
As a consequence of greater smoking among men than women,

55
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
the overall increase in life expectancy from public health and medical advances

56
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
during the 20th century was much more pronounced among women than among men.

57
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The difference in patterns of smoking has been a key factor in the difference in male and female life expectancies over time.

58
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
As previously noted for infant mortality, the US experienced enormous gains in life expectancy during the 20th century.

59
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:03,000
However, let's compare life expectancy among the OED member countries among OAC these countries.

60
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We see a consistent pattern of life expectancy at birth being greater among females than among males.

61
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Similar to what we have describe for the United States.

62
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
More distressing, however, is the fact that the US currently ranks near the bottom in terms of life expectancy at birth.

63
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
For both males and females compared to other ECD countries,

64
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:35,000
it is important to emphasize that the U.S. spends far more money per capita on health care than any other country in the world.

65
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So why does the United States look so bad?

66
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This is a major problem with our health system and this will be examined more closely in later sections of the course.

67
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Life expectancy at age 65 is a useful measure of the impact of factors that influence health later in life.

68
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So differences in childhood mortality, maternal mortality and occupational mortality, which was a particularly big factor in nineteen hundred.

69
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Especially for men, are for the most part not relevant.

70
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Once someone has managed to survive to age 65, we can see that nineteen hundred the life expectancy at age 65 was identical for men and women.

71
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But then something changed. And over the next 70 years, female life expectancy at age 65 grew by five years.

72
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But for men, it only grew by just over one year.

73
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Why? Again, in one word, tobacco. The vast increase in smoking, particularly among men in the early and middle years of the 20th century,

74
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
was the single biggest contributor to this gap in life expectancy at age 65.

75
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Between the sexes and since, smoking rates have declined, though, men still smoke more than women.

76
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We can see that the difference in life expectancy at age 65 has shrunk from three point nine years in 1970 to 2.5 years.

77
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:24,000
In 2015. When we examine how the United States compares with other OPEC countries in terms of life expectancy at age 65,

78
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
we see the same pattern we have seen before. The United States ranks in the lower half.

79
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Again, this is disturbing for a number of reasons,

80
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:42,000
particularly when we remember that the United States spent so much more on health care than any other country.

81
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
To recap, population health is more than just numbers.

82
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It can reveal trends. It allows for comparisons and for assessment of patterns in the data.

83
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The data can provide for identification of underlying causes or explanations of trends.

84
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And importantly, the data can provide a basis for public health interventions.

85
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:16,481
Next up, we will examine death rates in the United States.
