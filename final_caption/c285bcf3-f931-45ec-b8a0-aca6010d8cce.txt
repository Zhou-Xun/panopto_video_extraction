1
00:00:10,966 --> 00:00:15,440
After watching this video, you will be
able to describe the general template of

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,000
SAS procedures and
some of the most commonly used procedures.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,985
We will use PROC CONTENTS to check
the information of a dataset.

4
00:00:22,985 --> 00:00:25,915
We will learn how to create
labels in a data step.

5
00:00:25,915 --> 00:00:30,190
And we will use PROC SORT
to sort the assets.

6
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:35,082
The procedure steps generate results
from data, that can be printing,

7
00:00:35,082 --> 00:00:38,781
tabulating, summarizing and
performing analysis.

8
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:42,722
Any type of analysis from
simple descriptive statistics,

9
00:00:42,722 --> 00:00:48,140
the means and standard deviations,
to complex regression models.

10
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,845
The output of this procedure is either
results that will show up in your

11
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,009
result output tab, or report.

12
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:59,847
For the purposes of this class we will
not be generating any reports, but

13
00:00:59,847 --> 00:01:02,980
focus on results from analysis.

14
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,613
In a very general way,
the template of any procedure,

15
00:01:07,613 --> 00:01:10,445
it starts with the keyword PROC.

16
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:15,290
Then it has their own keyword,
by means or reg, etc.

17
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,545
Then you have to specify the data you
want to use to perform the analysis.

18
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:25,080
And remember you will have to specify the
library too if it's a permanent dataset.

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,034
And finally,

20
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:31,048
every PROC would have its specific
syntax that we will learn in this class.

21
00:01:31,048 --> 00:01:35,797
Initially, it's good to just learn
the most basic syntax possible, and

22
00:01:35,797 --> 00:01:43,030
as you feel more comfortable with SAS,
you can add more options in the statement.

23
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:48,045
Some of the most common used PROCs and for
sure the ones you will be using in this

24
00:01:48,045 --> 00:01:53,510
course are PROC CONTENTS, that will
check the contents of the dataset.

25
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:58,090
PROC FREQ will tabulate
categorical variables.

26
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:03,200
PROC MEANS will give you the script
statistics for continuous variables.

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,709
PROC UNIVARIATE is a more comprehensive
descriptive statistics analysis for

28
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:09,960
continuous variables.

29
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,190
PROC CORR will give you correlation
coefficients among continuous variables.

30
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,145
PROC SGPLOT will make various plots.

31
00:02:18,145 --> 00:02:23,353
PROC SORT will sort a database
based on a specified variables.

32
00:02:23,353 --> 00:02:28,375
And PROC REG, PROC GLM, PROC LOGISTIC,
PROC GENMOD, PROC PHREG, will

33
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:35,830
do different regression analysis that we
will cover in this course in more detail.

34
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,318
The PROC CONTENTS is very useful to check
important information in your dataset,

35
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,280
like the number of observations and
the list of variables.

36
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,236
The basic syntax for PROC CONTENTS
is PROC CONTENTS, your dataset and

37
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,310
run, so that's it.

38
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,029
In this example, we have not added any
option, so you can see the really,

39
00:02:56,029 --> 00:02:58,220
really basic syntax.

40
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:03,070
We will see in other videos of this model,
one important option for PROC CONTENTS.

41
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:08,200
If you run this call, SAS is going to
give you a few pieces of information.

42
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,857
Note, and this is something
I will emphasize throughout

43
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:17,140
the whole course that SAS give you
sometimes too much information.

44
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,516
I'm not saying that this is not
necessarily important information, but for

45
00:03:21,516 --> 00:03:24,240
now you will probably not need it.

46
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,580
In this situation, let's ignore most
of it and focus on three things.

47
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,828
First, check that the dataset you're
getting information on is the one

48
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:34,460
you want.

49
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,130
In this case br.variation.

50
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,953
Second, check the number of
observations in your data set.

51
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:45,230
This is very useful information
as we will see later on.

52
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,580
And finally, check the list of variables
that you have in your data set.

53
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,065
SAS will list in alphabetical
order all the variables.

54
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:56,040
It will tell you what type
of variables they are.

55
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,340
In this case, all of them are numerical
and it will list the labels either labels.

56
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,414
Note that in this particular example
we did not create labels, so

57
00:04:05,414 --> 00:04:08,090
SAS only repeat the name of the variables.

58
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:12,830
So let's see in the next
slide how to create labels.

59
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,356
If you want to create labels for
your variables,

60
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:17,770
you have to do that in a data step.

61
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:22,312
We can use the keyword label to create
labels the way that it's shown in this

62
00:04:22,312 --> 00:04:23,720
example.

63
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,726
Note that you have to put your labels in
quotes, and you can write whatever you

64
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:34,560
want in your labels as long as you
keep them shorter than 256 characters.

65
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,122
When you run this code, you will not see
any results because there is nothing to

66
00:04:39,122 --> 00:04:43,147
show, but your data set will now
contain labels for your variables.

67
00:04:43,147 --> 00:04:47,920
So let's see in the next
slide with PROC CONTENTS.

68
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,233
Running the same PROC CONTENT syntax as
before will give you the same output.

69
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:56,364
But note that now you can see the labels
that you just created in the list of

70
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:58,440
variables in the right.

71
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,529
Creating labels is definitely very
useful to identify what your variables.

72
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:08,414
Some variable names may be very
descriptive, such as they for example,

73
00:05:08,414 --> 00:05:10,269
but others are not so much.

74
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:14,750
So keep it in mind for
your future analysis.

75
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,970
Finally, we are going to learn another
useful procedure to manipulate your data.

76
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:25,052
PROC SORT helps you to sort the data
set based on a specified variables.

77
00:05:25,052 --> 00:05:28,263
It will rearrange the order
of the observations.

78
00:05:28,263 --> 00:05:32,863
And note that is the one of the few
SAS procedures that will actually

79
00:05:32,863 --> 00:05:35,150
change the data set.

80
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,171
The basic syntax is
PROC SORT on your data, and

81
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:43,128
remember always you have to specify
your library for permanent database and

82
00:05:43,128 --> 00:05:48,670
then with the biased a menu tells us
which variable to use to sort the data.

83
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,037
By default,
SAS will certain in ascending order.

84
00:05:52,037 --> 00:05:52,999
In this case,

85
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:58,220
the will be sorted in ascending
order based on the vitamin A values.

86
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,767
If you want to sort them
in descending order,

87
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:05,720
you can add the descending option to
the first statement as written here.

88
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,487
Also note that missing numeric data
are indicated as a period or dot,

89
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:15,105
and are considered by SAS as a smaller
than any real numeric value.

90
00:06:15,105 --> 00:06:18,017
So whenever sorting in ascending order,

91
00:06:18,017 --> 00:06:21,920
you will see all the missing
values at the top.

92
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,611
Note that this is a procedure that you
will have to do always before doing

93
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:30,599
anything else that will be done
using a bivar statement, but

94
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:34,480
we will go back to that one needed.

95
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,698
So in summary, we learn the general
template of such procedures and

96
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,439
some of the most commonly used procedures.

97
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,121
We learn how to use PROC CONTENTS to
check the information of datasets.

98
00:06:46,121 --> 00:06:49,147
We learn how to create
labels in a data step, and

99
00:06:49,147 --> 00:06:51,579
how to use PROC SORT to sort datasets.

100
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:52,655
In the next video,

101
00:06:52,655 --> 00:06:57,365
we will continue learning about
some other basic procedures.
