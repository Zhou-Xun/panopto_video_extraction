1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:23,000
This guy used to win. And then he said something about like, okay, my girlfriend does like side like it was not true like the other day as.

2
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,020
Yeah. Yeah.

3
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:46,820
You haven't done this in a while.

4
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,820
And he's like, Yes, I'll see you later.

5
00:00:53,870 --> 00:01:02,000
You know, really, to be honest, I was like, Oh, that's what I started.

6
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:19,060
I don't want to go with that extremist example as it tries to come by.

7
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,270
Okay. I'm looking. All right. Welcome, everybody.

8
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:33,020
So we have a guest today. Away some time as they haven't.

9
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,750
He's an M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

10
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,169
Minnesota, Wolf, is going to spend some time.

11
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:55,330
It can see Texas. Texas School of Public Health in Houston and next door to some statistical genomics work.

12
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:06,210
Tell us about some mediation analysis today. And, you know, do feel free to ask questions of Austin to prompt you for questions.

13
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:14,070
I mean, we'll have an office hours for anyone who wants to just meet, hang or ask questions afterwards in my office right afterwards.

14
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,540
All right. Thank you, Bob. Professor Taylor's imitation and nice introductions.

15
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,860
So today I'm going to talk about something on the mediation that I can mention, not only mediators,

16
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:38,280
the mediation analysis has been there for many years, but until recently, genomic data, highly emotional genomic data had become available.

17
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:50,849
And I became interested in this field and we would kind of discover some unique challenges facing mediation that high dimensional genomic mediators.

18
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:59,910
And hopefully we can close to something like my recent work today and this is outlined for my talk.

19
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,650
First, I will introduce some background about mediation, analysis and omics studies.

20
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:15,960
Second, I will introduce a new matter of mediation effect size of five mediation effect size, which is based on Oscar.

21
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,230
Oscar is great for us. Quickly be about determination in being a regression.

22
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:35,160
Essentially it's a virus explained based on second moment, and I will contrast with the classic mediation if exercise merit based on me fact.

23
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:43,230
And I would argue that the second moment based Oscar based mediation marriage has some

24
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:53,010
advantage in this said and I will introduce some recent extensions of the first work.

25
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,819
And in terms of the additional spit up of a comment as interval estimation as

26
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:05,190
well as extension to a time to evolve outcomes in survival analysis for any.

27
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:16,730
So this figure illustrates the complex difference between the management intermedia and macro phenotypes and disease outcomes.

28
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:28,190
So conceptually, environmental exposure, for example, air pollution, cigaret smoking or secondhand smoking can affect the disease outcome.

29
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:34,220
In this case, it's a lung cancer, so some intermediate molecular phenotypes.

30
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,930
So the molecular phenotypes I refer to all sorts of omega three matrix.

31
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:50,860
For example, the DNA level, we have single nucleotide polymorphisms, the number of variations and I,

32
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,970
I, you know, not all we have to say, but methylation histone modification.

33
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:07,760
And as a trans transcriptome now over half of the messenger RNA gene expression and the gene expression is actually regulated,

34
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:16,640
can be regulated by DNA mutation, can also be regulated by DNA methylation as well as my car.

35
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:24,800
And then the messenger. Messenger is translated into amino acid and form of the proteins.

36
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:34,790
So the protein protein all mixed here and then metabolize, which is closer to the disease outcome and the phenotype.

37
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,329
So mediation, as I say,

38
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:45,139
is a useful tool to kind of quantify how much of the effect of environmental

39
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:51,290
exposure on the disease outcome through the intermediate molecular phenotypes,

40
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,810
for example, saw gene expression, data authority expression as well as the methylation.

41
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:08,140
So here I did some ongoing and some completed as well as I'm going multi-omics projects.

42
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:16,840
And on the left hand side is the Cancer Genome Atlas Project, funded by the National Cancer Institute.

43
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,300
So it's already completed.

44
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:33,490
It profiled over 11,000 patients in over 23 different cancer types across different omics data domain, including the DNA level.

45
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:38,410
So making mutation and copy number of variation also has a DNA level.

46
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:44,530
Gene expression adds transcriptome DNA isolation, genome microarray.

47
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:54,459
Our VPA is a protein expression as well as clinical data such as baseline clinical variables as well as overall overall survival.

48
00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:06,730
Time to event. On the right hand side is the top macro program, funded by a national Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

49
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:14,470
And it aims to put data to characterize various types of hard line and block diseases.

50
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:23,590
And the top man is well on his way to collecting whole genome sequencing of almost 200,000 wild phenotype individuals,

51
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:31,630
and also is currently generating multi-omics data in terms of RNA sequencing, DNA methylation and the metabolomics.

52
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:40,150
And I believe the Boston Department here at Michigan actually play a very important role in helping to top back up initiative.

53
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,910
So now we have this a large amount of data.

54
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:54,140
So how to analyze them remains a daunting task, and there are many challenges.

55
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,880
So here I'm trying to address some of the challenges.

56
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,260
So here let's look at a motivating example.

57
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:12,229
So how you quantify the following relationship, where the the environmental exposure here is from a Framingham Heart study.

58
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,550
I use that aging at Exam eight in the Offspring cohort,

59
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:24,980
which is a large longitudinal cohort recorded since recruiting in the 1970s and has been a follow up.

60
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:38,309
I train up to date and every six years the participants are asked to come to the clinical clinics to get physical exams,

61
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:49,250
the vital signs as well as draw blood. And so the data I'm going to use as an age are the exam at Exam eight.

62
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,350
So aging is can be considered as a proxy of quality because you are meant to explore.

63
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:04,550
And the way we know that age is a main risk factor for many complex diseases like heart disease, cancer over time or disease, etc.

64
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:10,250
And the outcome here I'm interesting is systolic blood pressure.

65
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:17,120
So we know that the systolic blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

66
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:26,920
And also it's cognitive is continuous. So it's easier to approach in a linear model framework with a continual outcome.

67
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:36,920
Later on, I'm going to talk about the extended to time to it, like overall survival of progression free survival in the cancer.

68
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,860
Me and the fear the mediators.

69
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:50,060
I will star with gene expression data where in the Framingham Heart Study we have about 2000 individuals in the offspring cohort.

70
00:09:51,080 --> 00:10:05,450
So while they had a gene expression profile from blood drawn age and so so here I'm interesting how my job my relationship

71
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:16,470
to it of the fact of aging on systolic blood pressure can be explained by that 20,000 genes expression and expression.

72
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:28,280
So first, I will briefly introduce a simple mutation model, which is a single year after.

73
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:38,960
And so your ex is the exponent of interest and the arm is a is a univariate example of one TS expression.

74
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:47,510
And later I will go to plenty of audiences, but we start out with what and why is all the common interest,

75
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,860
which is based on blood pressure in our motivating example.

76
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:06,170
So the classic media analysis dated back to the 19 1980s or was formulated this this three linear models this century,

77
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:19,800
first we realize why all X and the R and then the coefficient C is the totally so the totally back of the development is over alcohol.

78
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:31,730
And the second equation, our DNA model is realizing y both acts as mediator and here the R coefficient which

79
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:37,640
is our coefficient of of environmental exposure adjusted adjusting for the mediator.

80
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:47,480
R is called the direct effect. And then the third equation we reverse all acts the progressive mediator over of interest,

81
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:56,450
and then we have the coefficient eight and the common measure of mediation in fact is so called product metric.

82
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:04,430
It's a high speed and the in the causal mediation analysis framework, this is also natural, indirect.

83
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:13,190
So it was based on quite some strong assumptions.

84
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:27,260
This eight times B can be either pretty has a causal effect and such assumptions say you could for example no, I'm married marriage mediator.

85
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:40,130
The mediator are all combining among these factors and no matter these motor and mediator confounding factors and those are.

86
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:47,930
I have strong assumptions. And, you know, some of them cannot be verified single handedly.

87
00:12:48,680 --> 00:13:00,500
And in all holding files and in high dimensional data analysis, I guess it is hopeless to be verified off those assumptions.

88
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:07,819
So here I am. So today I'm not going to pursue a causal interpretation, but rather from our events.

89
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:18,280
Explain. On the social association, a related matter of mediation, in fact, is the racial matter we say,

90
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:32,239
which is an indirect effect over directly and similarly for how to mediate, which is indirectly fact over totally fact, which is equal to eight times.

91
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,570
B indirect effect plus are direct effect.

92
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:43,600
So this is essentially a percentage. And now we go to multi mediator small.

93
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:51,280
So now we have key mediators which can be moderately emotional, like five or six all tied in,

94
00:13:51,300 --> 00:14:00,300
in the expression application without 20,000 gene expression and the idiom association almost 1 million civic size.

95
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:07,320
But the model is still formulated by the three equations.

96
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,540
The first equation of state to state, which is the total effect of X and Y.

97
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:23,400
So the C is a total. The second equation is regress y, x, and all the immediate mediators.

98
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:34,290
And again, are the Court of Acts addressing for all mediators for us it directly by natural fact in a causal mediation framework.

99
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:46,970
And then we have a set of equations, key equations regarding each of the mediator X and we have a one to a p and then similar.

100
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:52,100
It is the classic mediation you fact matter todo mediate.

101
00:14:52,180 --> 00:15:02,910
The matter is it's a product measure which is a summation of component y's mediation factor 18 times.

102
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:10,560
Similarly, we can define a racial manner and in the proportion mediated matter in terms of percentage.

103
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:17,580
However, there are some caveats with this equation for that matter multiple multi,

104
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:25,650
multi modulating, all so or the component like mediation fire and the positive or negative.

105
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:35,610
And this is actually very common in genomic in genomic applications where a scientist may increase risk, some genes may decrease the risk,

106
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:49,770
and we hardly know a positive and this positive and active with some of that it leading to a cancelation estimation of dove for that matter.

107
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:58,530
And similarly if other racial and proportion mediated so intuitively there could be none of the component applies.

108
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:04,650
Mediation factor is zero, but one way some about if you are close to do it.

109
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:17,430
So it's kind of a paradox. And then the high dimensional mediation model as a measure of each of the coefficients can be unreliable.

110
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,150
P is large, for example, P is close to a sample size and a lot of events.

111
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:29,610
And now we know that this is a high dimensional regression model, allows way for some regularity, for example.

112
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:35,280
So we kind of hit the B.J.

113
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,860
We cannot really estimate reliably.

114
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:47,760
If we cannot estimate BJ reliably, then we cannot estimate the product error and also high dimensional applications,

115
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,690
the identity of a true mediators, and that the biological mechanisms are rarely doing a pilot so essential.

116
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,330
It is unlikely that all the 20 solid genes will mediate.

117
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:09,250
Will mediate the fact of, say, smoking, systolic blood pressure only as some of the genes some over the pathways.

118
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:17,100
Well well we've got involved. So so in that sense, we'll have to do some sort of variable selection.

119
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,510
Any questions so far?

120
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:35,480
So here we are before the apparent humiliation of the fact merit based on Oscar, which is a familiar matter in in Indian Indian models.

121
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:44,180
And this matter was first proposed by some psychologist in 2009 in a single mediator model.

122
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:52,250
And we kind of rediscover this matter and extend it to multiple and high dimensional mediator models.

123
00:17:52,610 --> 00:18:03,889
So here I'm going to go into some details. So so Oscar based immediate mediated matter is device variance in Y explained

124
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:13,040
by by X by the is polar and plus the virus in Y explained by the mediator.

125
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:20,870
So here there's a single mediator. Subtract the virus in Y, explained by both mediator and explorer.

126
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:26,990
So here we can represent this formula by this series of brain diagrams.

127
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:31,850
So here, this this circle represents the variance in y in outcome.

128
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:37,970
So first term is a virus in Y that can be explained by this by the mediator.

129
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:43,550
The second term is a virus you y that can be explained by the explorer.

130
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:50,570
And the third term is of everything y that can be expected by either ab or x.

131
00:18:50,960 --> 00:19:00,540
And then as a result, plus and minus the Oscar mediated virus wide, that can be explained by X throughout.

132
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,250
So this is a kind of intuitive interpretation of the Oscar.

133
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:13,190
And here the Oscar because I'm both I'm an ice skaters so this is this is the century

134
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:20,000
squared Pearson correlation between all time and I'm the explorer or the mediator.

135
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:28,210
But in height in multiple mediator model, we just need to replace the lower.

136
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,940
Oscar y am we stuck capital.

137
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:38,090
Oscar y by the coefficient of multiple, multiple determinations.

138
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,959
So I ask so you. Yes, you can diagram.

139
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,650
It's just not really real things in my diagram.

140
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:52,050
Right. Let's just sort of a concept. It's not this concept that the virus, they are not necessarily the same, of course.

141
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:56,390
So the pie here, they are the same. But it's just a illustration.

142
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:02,680
Okay. But once a mediation analysis, we we actually standardize both acts.

143
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,960
So the coefficient of comparison, especially in multiple mediation,

144
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:19,250
this is guaranteed to be positive squared meaning classic theoretical it no is not bounded is actually the rate is from 9191 to 2.

145
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:33,200
You mean single medium commodity can range theoretically on that you want to to buy in kind of multiple mediator model a highly mediator model.

146
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:37,300
We actually derive that and they're reasonable.

147
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:43,700
Assumptions. It's guaranteed to be in zero at one.

148
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:50,780
So it is really having multiple media. Any other questions?

149
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:59,630
Okay. So here this is a exchange you have with us for a matter of our multiple mediator model.

150
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:09,410
So the only difference is the first time here. And then it boils down to estimated variances planned by a set of mediated set of variables.

151
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,120
And back to the multiple mediator model, recall that you can be high dimensional.

152
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:23,480
So even this simple task of estimating variances penned by a set of variables can be tricky, high dimensional case.

153
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:31,250
Right. Because if there are too many noisy variables, then our very Oscar estimate may not be reliable.

154
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:36,770
And what's more complicated is every three Oscar involved,

155
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:46,670
the target in the middle is very easy to assign is just a square correlation squared appears in correlation between outcome and and the scatter x.

156
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:51,350
But the first and the third time can be actually tricky to estimate.

157
00:21:51,860 --> 00:22:05,390
So to that end, we instead of estimate B.J as a piece individually here, we actually model E.J. as a random fact.

158
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:11,300
And so instead of estimate each BJ Pixie five, we estimate the various parameter.

159
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:21,590
So now we only need to estimate the virus of the BJs and the variance and the variance of the residual similarity.

160
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:27,230
So this is for the, the, the model. This is for the, for the third term.

161
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:38,630
This is a linear mix model. So R is the fact and the b.J are p random effect which follow a normal distribution.

162
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,440
And if you are familiar with the mixed model, this is kind of a standard formulation.

163
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:57,230
And oftentimes say, we say in spatial applications where regions or counties are next, not next to each other,

164
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:05,450
we cannot go that model that are not free to call these specific diagnostic random facts.

165
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:10,430
And then we try to estimate how much better is in the spatial randomly fact

166
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:16,370
and then how much of their spatial random effect times play in the outcome.

167
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,760
There is a similar this is a similar idea.

168
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,490
So instead of estimate each, B.J. kind of bottom up and then estimate summation some either b.j.

169
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:38,330
So here we is, a top down approach. We only need to estimate the tool is actually the tool virus parameter using our restricted maximum estimate,

170
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,820
which is a standard technique of mixed model.

171
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:49,700
And then similarly, for the first term, we we have another linear mixed model and we only need to ask mated to various parameters.

172
00:23:50,150 --> 00:24:00,980
And we actually demonstrate that this is more efficient than basic fact, let's say ordinary square when the dimensions is high.

173
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:06,760
In particular, the sample size is moderate. Any question.

174
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:20,340
So here I discussed some relationship, the relationship between the Oscar mediated and the classic for that matter, in multiple mediator model.

175
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:26,190
So we actually we can derive the close relationship between these two matters.

176
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:31,860
So recall that. So is the principal a principal be.

177
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:38,850
This is a product matter. R is a direct effect. So to sum up, this is essentially the total effect.

178
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,000
Square and then there's a virus Y.

179
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:50,090
So we have this this form of relationship in general when all ages are based on zero.

180
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:59,150
Oscar mediated easily. So based on this figure, are AJ A's and B's at zero C's.

181
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:08,990
So exactly. There's no connection. X and Y and this is a nobody, no mediator at all.

182
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:13,370
Then both the product matter and the Oscar mediated A0.

183
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:29,100
However, in general summation of Agent J equals zero does not imply that Oscar is zero particular at the know when A.J. and B.J. they cut,

184
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:32,420
they can be positive and negative. And we sum up together.

185
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,380
They can be exactly zero or close to zero.

186
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:46,460
But in that case, typical Oscar is not zero. So this is actually something we want to capture, and I think we should do that.

187
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:56,450
So we actually found that in the original way that we have this Oscar matter,

188
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:03,520
we extend it to multiple mediators that in the we have that the tool makes model and then we are done.

189
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:09,920
We just plug in and just repeat the data and plugging into this formula.

190
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:16,430
We got Oscar mediated. However, we find that there are some new nuances.

191
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:26,610
So essentially three types of mediators we call here I'm one which I'll call socio is outcome

192
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:33,560
a not waste to X and I'm not a Tavis I'm two which is associated with an always white.

193
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,540
So here I is a true mediator. We walk we want to estimate this mediation fact.

194
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:46,400
And of course, there is a for the noise variables which is not associate with either X or Y.

195
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:56,320
And we actually found that in the Oscar mediated model, a framework and one actually does not really bias our estimate.

196
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:02,420
So we, we kind of leave out one in the model we don't need to a few while to variable selection.

197
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:11,660
However, I'm two is actually a troublemaker in a sense that if we include, I'm sure it will price away from zero.

198
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:19,420
So away from this and we have to do some selection to get rid of, you know, what's good.

199
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,450
So it was for null and he said bias away from and no I mean there is a mediation

200
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:31,790
effect in that second picture I him correct but say we don't have the track.

201
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,920
We only have two and there no mediation in fact.

202
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:39,470
Okay. Yeah, that's not no means Oscar is zero.

203
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:49,190
So we proposed this barbell selection and as measured as measured procedure.

204
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,079
So essentially we simply data you do have one out, we use it as a verbal selection.

205
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:05,340
I'll mediate her selection. The other half more is is intact in the verbal selection procedure, only reserved for estimation.

206
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,270
So I'm the fault for the verbal selection.

207
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:16,380
And we actually studied all kinds of verbal selection procedures, including the lasso elastic, not FDR Control,

208
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:23,700
but finally open that is worth assuring the best screening cowboys Minimax Kong penalty,

209
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,410
which has Oracle property know high dimensional virus detection performed the best.

210
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:40,260
So that's our final choice. So we use up the authority as a US couple was accepted to select mediators in in the first half of the data and

211
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:47,850
the ones we have the selecting mediators we estimate the mediator in fact in the second half of data by feeding

212
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:54,989
the two linear female based models and beside the phone has made with a reasonable way to propose now parametric

213
00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:04,780
bootstrap to come up to a to a calculate 95% confidence interval for Oscar mediated and which can be American.

214
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:12,659
The additional intensive especially the the short iterative training test screening is an iterative process based on

215
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:19,440
marginal in fact screening and and then is conditional on the variables that I selected to select the remaining ones.

216
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:32,879
So it is very committee intensive. And if we do is a 500 bootstrap, it's it takes hundreds of hours which motivates our our further extension.

217
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:40,890
I will discuss later and we will perform extended simulation to evaluate the properties of the proposed Oscar mediation

218
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:47,730
in mirror and also as measured procedure regarding the Bise virus and bootstrap confidence in our coverage probability.

219
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,850
So this is our conclusion by both simulation and an identical derivation.

220
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:58,740
We demonstrate that I'm to type a nominate or will increase the buys of mediation.

221
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:08,459
In fact, my error I'll square well I'm one will not and a noise variable we're not either and I've already showing you my screening of our Streisand

222
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:17,910
could mitigate the potential caused by I'm to a type of non mediators and the way pilot published this concert last year and I share

223
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:28,410
with professor Taylor you can read some details if you want and in the supplemental we actually nicely derive that those those properties

224
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:41,880
like the the role of I'm an and so yes no question so what do you do at the end so you get Ms. R-squared mediated sequel 2.17 Yeah.

225
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:47,520
I mean, what does that what do you know? I mean, what does that tell you? Yeah, that's a very good question.

226
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,830
That's about the interpretation. So this is a application to the Framingham Heart Study.

227
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:06,210
So we look we use our age and exam AIDS ad is polar and the expression exam eight as a mediator and systolic blood pressure at exam nine as all time.

228
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:15,120
So we have this kind of control order. So here, by applying the the measure we propose, first of all,

229
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:29,220
they either destroy independent screening and I'm he selected almost 200 CS out of 17 18,000 genes and then the Oscar mediated was 1034.

230
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:35,760
But we have to interpret it in the context of total effect, which is 7.8.

231
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:48,810
So in other words, age at the exam age explain 7.8% of the variation in systolic blood pressure six years, eight later at the exam is not.

232
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:57,930
And among this 7.8% are viruses and gene expression can explain 3.4%.

233
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:05,700
And then we have this so-called as so as a matter of wishes it's actually kind of a normalized percentage.

234
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:12,450
So divide divide Oscar mediated by the total effect here.

235
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:16,110
This is a 44%. So this is a kind of percentage.

236
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:24,900
I expect that's because five. So we have to interpret Oscar in the context of the toilet fight.

237
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,990
So with this here,

238
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:41,470
I present some simulation results where we simulate I'm two type of navigators and then we compare it to Obama's selection procedures.

239
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:45,700
Why is it radio for investigating the abuses of the Air Force?

240
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:53,250
These are in control. And here in a cases and I imagine all of these are the same 1500s.

241
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,990
And so here X-axis is a percentage of true mediators.

242
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:10,380
For example, one word that means there are 15 true mediator out of 1500 punitive mediator, alternate mediators.

243
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:14,370
And then we range from one to 1% to 5%.

244
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:21,390
So the signal become less and less sparse, a more strong I mean, stronger and stronger.

245
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:33,990
And then the Y axis is Oscar mediated, assimilated from each simulation ramification, subtract the actual Oscar.

246
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:40,590
And so if you look at the mean and you subtract the US, the Oscar, true Oscar.

247
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,910
That's a box, essentially.

248
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:54,560
But here we we realize the 200 simulation ramifications by a box plot to see that both the bias and and an end of the favorites.

249
00:33:54,930 --> 00:34:04,469
So the the green figure I mean the green box correspond to a where we we assume we know that any of the

250
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:11,820
15 true mediators and then we just use a 15 to mediator in the linear mix model to estimate Oscar.

251
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:21,180
That's essentially the ground truth, but there's still variation because there's a certainty in the assumption itself makes model itself.

252
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:34,920
And the purplish box correspond to your we don't do anything like flag which does include all 1500 candidate mediators in the model.

253
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:46,350
And we can see that the Q with obvious bias and then the the bluish box correspond to a we we use a short impedance

254
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:56,190
screening to a filter out to essentially test the association between an Y and A to without those not associated with Y.

255
00:34:56,370 --> 00:35:04,200
So that way we aim to get a read of, to and we can see that in general that by doing verbal selection,

256
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:10,200
the performance improved, especially when the signal was not so sparse.

257
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,300
It's actually closer to the to the to the true true the case.

258
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:22,020
And also the Army need or the performance improved are not as much as the ballot selection.

259
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:28,830
On the other hand, if the use of force is how to read together, guy read, I'm to decipher to conservatives.

260
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:35,850
So the idea is you do that, maintain a false positive, you know, keep a low false positive rate.

261
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,100
But on the other hand, is to consult with you has too high false negative rate.

262
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,940
I mean the signs that the true mediator didn't got selected.

263
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:50,010
So as a result, we we largely underestimate the mediation factors.

264
00:35:51,180 --> 00:36:02,159
Any questions we have is a guess to make choices about sort of what level set the FDR rate to have presumably.

265
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,580
And yes, I guess you got to make some choice about some threshold.

266
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,660
And so is that easy to change ratio?

267
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:13,940
Yeah. Criterion done better does to shorten the my screening is quite robust.

268
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:21,179
You need to set up a kind of a ribbon of the initial screening like of 15,000,

269
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:30,830
maybe 10% of percent or even or actually it can be depending on the default in the in the getting class

270
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:40,319
package is going to depend on some of those P and I imagine P and the sample size and it's a log.

271
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,700
N and the ratio of. Q Who is 100?

272
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:51,840
So once we reduce the dimension to 100, then I'm is kind of comparable to to LA Soul.

273
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:59,700
So it does kind of moderate dimension, verbal selection and it does a very good job.

274
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:06,210
The IVR. Yes, you will have to specify 5% to 25%.

275
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:16,370
So we also study when when I'm too I'm one of the nominees or is for president.

276
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,960
What's a fact of doing Barbra selection on not doing Barbra selection?

277
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:30,110
And again, so if we use assuring about screening doing Obama's election, I actually do more harm than good.

278
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:40,699
So it record that the green box as advanced shows where we know the identity of the true mediators and the purple are not doing any of our selection,

279
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:49,770
including all 15,000, 1500 mediators and that the blue boxes correspond to do have a selection with or with

280
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:55,470
respect to association between acts and I'm using it already shorten my screening.

281
00:37:55,730 --> 00:38:00,620
I actually tend to underestimate and the FDR again is too conservative.

282
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:07,430
So in this case, as we can see, the the green and the purple boxes got them all at the same,

283
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:13,190
which means we actually don't need to do a virus action regarding one type of nominee.

284
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:19,969
And we actually show this not ethically that I'm one is not a troublemaker.

285
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:30,050
It's okay to include and so so this is the application to find me how our study day and how we look at suppression,

286
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,620
metabolomics, microarray and gamma isolation.

287
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:41,690
Second column is sample size, possibly mix data, sometimes a smaller and then the third column is a dementia added here.

288
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,280
And we see that the domestication dementia is almost half meeting.

289
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:53,720
And the fourth column is the number of mediators selected by the short screening procedure.

290
00:38:54,530 --> 00:39:00,770
And Oscar Mediate is upon estimate and the 95% confidence interval by a non parametric bootstrap

291
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:09,710
and as well as this Oscar media is divided by total total effect and this is the total fact.

292
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:20,480
So depending on the several size age you had that you can explain from 6% to 10% of variances in systolic blood pressure at night.

293
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,450
And also, as we can see, that in general,

294
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:31,400
gene expression might have metabolome and the demonstration is playing a higher percentage of the total effect.

295
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:41,270
But actually McQuarrie explained nothing. And we we actually replicated this in women's housing initiative, which has similar omics.

296
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:50,299
MERRYMAN It does not have gene expression data, but if you look at the microarray, it is almost it is not it's my car.

297
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:55,070
It does not read any of the effect of aging at baseline.

298
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:01,249
So systolic blood pressure three years after baseline in the Women's House initiative

299
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:06,770
study and the the omics measure was based on was based on the baseline blood.

300
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:16,390
Any question on this. This comes with a list as well of which one's which media it is?

301
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,990
Yes, exactly. Yes, I know we did.

302
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:27,549
We can do some say policy analysis to look at those genes, whether they they make biological science, both of comedy.

303
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:34,690
They did so in this replicated studies at the same two of the 73 genes as in the other one.

304
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:42,670
That's a good question. Of. He even played the verbose, high dimensional verbal selection.

305
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,889
Even the same status at you may not end up with the same selective variables,

306
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:56,770
but the two selected says if you look at, say, the canonical correlation, they actually capture similar information.

307
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:05,250
It's like they are correlated with actual true variables, but you don't really know whether to select the true.

308
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:14,770
So. So here we are. We send the comments viewable estimation.

309
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:22,300
So original use and now parametric bootstrap which is ridiculously low.

310
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:27,940
So it takes hundreds of hours of multiple paths in parallel computing.

311
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:37,300
So then we thought whether we can derive the asymptotic distribution of Oscar mediated as maybe Oscar media mediated.

312
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:41,440
So we can construct one type of objects.

313
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:50,020
So essentially, if we have a standard error, then on estimate -1.6 times that error, then we can get a confidence interval.

314
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:57,420
So to add the University of Minnesota State Department, I actually spearheaded this, this, this,

315
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:03,399
this work in collaboration with my current student Church Hall and Jensen and my

316
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:09,550
collaborator at the general at the University of Minnesota Plastics Department.

317
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,090
So this is a design of the may result.

318
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:23,950
And the way we show that the the three turns here they actually have more asymptotic multivariate normal distribution.

319
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:27,970
And with derived there is some Hollywood coherence matrix.

320
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:31,900
So by delta method we can measure it. God is emphatic.

321
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:41,260
It's an error for the Oscar mediated. And in this work, we also do some modification of the assumption procedure.

322
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,590
So originally we kind of split the data up.

323
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:51,280
You do have one half virus, that action second half as measured based on the slightly variable in the first half.

324
00:42:51,760 --> 00:43:00,400
But here we utilize a so-called CrossFit CrossFit model based on Jensen Files working in 2012.

325
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:09,850
So essentially we again with somebody the data you do have, but we use a first hop to to do virus that action and then use a second half to estimate.

326
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:14,380
And then we switch the role. So we do a virus that actually did the second half.

327
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:18,250
And then as made Oscar immediately in the first half.

328
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:23,860
And then you set up the the final estimate is an average of this, too.

329
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:28,480
So actually, intuitively, it utilized all the data.

330
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:36,340
It's actually not just half of the data. And by taking average as to actually is more robust than just based on one half.

331
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:40,989
And we can show that we did tons of simulations,

332
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:49,170
many to look at a coverage probability of this close asymptotic standard, error based world combat, as you know.

333
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:56,080
So this is a CrossFit idea, really square. And this is bootstrap plus a linear mixed model.

334
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:09,370
So we look at different scenarios where we have the true Oscar mediated in the practice, some small, some moderate, and then we vary the similar size.

335
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:16,270
And from 750 to 3000 and P is a empirical coverage probability.

336
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:20,350
We want it to be as close as to the nominal 95%.

337
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:24,190
And we can see it pretty well.

338
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:30,190
And the amount e is incumbent upon estimate.

339
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:36,970
So this MSE has nothing to do with either. It is a communist interval as many of the point estimate.

340
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:43,580
And as we can see, the the new procedure based on the CrossFit use both data.

341
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:48,340
I mean use all the data. The original procedure, you only use half of the data.

342
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:50,679
If we compare the PON estimates,

343
00:44:50,680 --> 00:45:03,480
I'm as e is actually the cross beating improvement has smaller MSE mainly the standard error becomes smaller that the virus becomes smaller.

344
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:12,550
So we use the data more efficiently. And then in terms of true positive rate, false positive rate, variable selection and the and the time.

345
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:20,590
So here the time of the number in the front is a minute is a minute for simulation.

346
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,680
Average time across over 200 simulation applications.

347
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:37,660
So in this case, the time is almost 6 seconds and then the numbering, the parameters is a stunt error of four.

348
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:51,370
It's time. And this is a bootstrap. Bootstrap, we can see this is 44, 45 minutes on I believe it's 20 class and the CrossFit here is just 6 seconds.

349
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:58,540
One. So the, the, the competition we implement is just tremendous with similar accuracy.

350
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:02,440
So both coverage albeit unsatisfactory.

351
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:11,830
2 minutes. Yeah. So this is the model based on arrow versus the some error,

352
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:20,049
our standard deviation from the 2 to 100 simulations and they actually follow match pretty well.

353
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:26,260
So this means that this entire scenario is really satisfactory.

354
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:37,149
And also we applied it to some new data and with a lot resembles eyes and our original application almost more than doubled and

355
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:50,830
we look at the we found that sucks actually is significant a mediated by gene expression is in fact our HDR and then we know

356
00:46:50,830 --> 00:47:02,950
that women actually have tend to have higher HDL the good cholesterol than the met and the we look at the the pathways that that

357
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:17,320
you reach in the selected genes and it's it's it's is very relevant to so hormone metabolism mediated cholesterol cholesterol.

358
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:24,300
But without it. So the. And so I'm going to skip.

359
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:33,750
So just briefly, we later on, we sent you to find an event outcome for this Oscar based, IT based mediation model.

360
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:40,889
But it's actually not a trivial extension because Oscar is not unique defined in.

361
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:48,450
So I will use the model Hungary that many because of the sensory and like linear model.

362
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:54,540
Oscar is uniquely defined in logistic regression and causal regression.

363
00:47:54,750 --> 00:48:00,840
Oscar is not unique actually more than plenty of word Oscar in proposed in syllable

364
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:08,960
analysis and in the first work we compare five Oscar that I recommended in the literature,

365
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:14,550
not in the context of mediation analysis, but we study and comparing the mediation analysis.

366
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:22,680
And then we would come out with the the one recommended, the one proposed by Canon or Quigley in 1998.

367
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:32,460
And it's a very simple form where the time speed high is a linear predictor in the course of regression and is very robust to a sensor rate.

368
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:42,900
The traditional product that is very sensitive to the sensor rate and actually required variables that are higher than 90% second rate.

369
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:51,960
And then we extend it to a high dimensional case based on the the the new Oscar the plus survival analysis.

370
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:57,690
And this was done by so in each shirt. So she was a master's student here.

371
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:02,790
And now she's working with me and my colleague, colleague, Dr. shooting along.

372
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:10,010
We'll actually graduate from Michigan diploma, I think, in early 2000.

373
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:21,840
So both of those are Michigan alumni. And this work actually got so many that in our student paper award and essay biometrics student payroll.

374
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:30,739
And so just briefly we found that it for survival analysis we actually neutral futile both I'm one and I'm

375
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:37,340
two a type of mediators because essentially it's not either model and it is nonlinear so you on one type of

376
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:47,360
mediator or ten and five estimation and then we compare it to some standard uses a method and we'll be applying

377
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:57,110
it to metabolomics in the Framingham Heart Study its time to accommodate heart disease and the new method by.
