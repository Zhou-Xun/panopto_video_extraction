1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,300
Thing. I had to get a juicy Lucy.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,400
Well, I was not as impressed with you, and I think it was overhyped for sure.

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,920
But also I watched like 15 minutes with it and it was kind of cold.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,450
So by the time I got that, she solidified any who.

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,990
Good morning, everybody. Hello.

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:35,190
Hello. Hello. Whoever uses this classroom has taken all the way of the whiteboard pens with them.

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,649
So just an announcement that your quiz was moved.

8
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:48,240
So it's due tomorrow by 11:59 p.m. and it will cover week seven through ten.

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,900
Open note, open book per usual.

10
00:00:53,580 --> 00:01:02,909
Okay. All right. So just to recap where we left off last week, we had a very detailed and I thought very lively discussion,

11
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:11,790
which I really enjoyed about, you know, vaccine hesitancy and like different reasons why folks might not get vaccines.

12
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:18,840
And then we started on this Great Lakes case study talking about the Hmong population.

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,710
So now we're going to pick up from there.

14
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:33,690
So with infectious diseases in the elderly population in particular, especially during COVID, they are an overlooked population for sure.

15
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:43,679
And because they are they have weakened immune systems, they're more susceptible to infectious diseases, but as well as chronic diseases.

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:51,450
So infectious diseases account for about a third of deaths in all folks age 65 and older.

17
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,400
And then 90% of deaths from pneumonia come from the elderly.

18
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:03,270
So they're particularly susceptible to bacterial pneumonia, influenza, urinary tract infections in particular,

19
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,040
especially if they are using a catheter and then various skin infections.

20
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:14,850
And that might be due to, like the health care setting or prolonged sitting or lying down in one spot.

21
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:22,260
But it's also important to consider, you know, again, the intersectionality of people's identities.

22
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,240
Where specifically with the Hmong population, we're going to be looking at, you know,

23
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:35,580
things of tribute to race and ethnicity, English proficiency, their age, educational attainment, and then also income level.

24
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:50,550
So this elderly outreach program was funded by Healthy People 2020, and it was led by the Eau Claire Area Hmong Assistance Association in Wisconsin.

25
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:57,660
Compared, as we showed last week in the data, a lot of the Hmong population are there,

26
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:06,390
less assimilated than maybe some other Asian American ethnicities, and they felt isolated because many did not have that English proficiency.

27
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:12,270
So this program in particular included transportation and translators for all

28
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:18,690
participants and enhanced access to services and comfortability getting care.

29
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:25,889
So what they did was they got student volunteers, they built partnerships with community based organizations and then developed

30
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,870
culturally appropriate workshops on health topics in particular like diabetes,

31
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,879
foot care, for example. And she was, who's a community liaison.

32
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:42,510
She said from the start, we wanted them to know that this was a project for them and not us.

33
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,219
So there were some positive outcomes with this intervention.

34
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:55,049
In particular, they got more folks out to primary care visits, enhanced vaccination of influenza and things like shingles,

35
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:03,120
which can affect folks over the age of 50 pneumonia vaccine and then very basic health care.

36
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:13,860
So they specifically went to some in Wisconsin because they have some like Hmong focused senior living assisted facilities,

37
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:25,379
but they also went to community centers. So now moving on to the role of DHS and OSH professionals in infectious disease response.

38
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,560
So how do we fit into this whole picture? Right.

39
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:36,600
So in the DHS, you know, this broadly defines the relationships and risks of the physical environment and health.

40
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:43,290
And so within this, you know, this isn't all encompassing, but you have people who do environmental epi toxicology,

41
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:49,980
which is a big part of our department, in particular exposure science, engineering, law and policy.

42
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:59,820
And in terms of infectious disease response, they work to understand, mitigate and manage some of the complex processes affected by the.

43
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,220
And so this might be something like looking at toxicant exposures. Pathogen susceptibility.

44
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,059
Source identification. Conduct research. Develop standards.

45
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,120
Guidelines recommendations. Implement interventions.

46
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:22,920
And then lend expertise to an environmental who's at okay on environmental to human transition.

47
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,910
Now how does that differ from the Osh professional?

48
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:32,370
They are only concerned what is going on in the workplace in particular.

49
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,129
But a key factor that they play in terms of the infectious disease response is actually

50
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:43,560
training the workers in order how to like mitigate and manage some of these hazards.

51
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:51,240
Now, this also you can see a lot of overlap here in terms of identifying toxic and exposures,

52
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,530
pathogens, source identification, implementing interventions.

53
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:02,580
But we're lending our expertise here on occupational hazards that create or worsen infectious disease outcomes.

54
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:15,660
I knew that was going to be Burnley. So here we are working at all levels where if you kind of think about the downstream midstream

55
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:21,060
and then upstream downstream is really considered clinical care or that physician care.

56
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:29,190
And then midstream we kind of think about individual social needs and then upstream we think about community conditions and community impact.

57
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:38,640
So where the DHS professional sits is kind of in between these two things, but mostly focused on the upstream.

58
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,820
So one thing I do want to mention is one health, which I don't think I talked about in this class.

59
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:53,069
Yes, kind of in your notes, it's said that they work at all levels,

60
00:06:53,070 --> 00:07:00,990
but you're saying that typically tends to have the community with upstream, midstream and upstream, yet midstream and upstream.

61
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:11,400
But definitely like you have Osh practitioners like Osh nurses or occupational health physicians who focus on like the clinical care aspect.

62
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,580
But I mean, you can find them at all levels basically, but mostly you'll find IHS in Asia midstream, in upstream.

63
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:23,090
But ideally for us, like in public health, we always want to try to get to the upstream level.

64
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:32,999
Right. Thank you. So one health here is a concept where we're looking at the interrelationship between people,

65
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:43,950
animals and the environment in the attempt mostly to protect each other from zoonoses and achieve the best health outcomes for people,

66
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:50,640
animals and plants in our environment. So how does that all fit together?

67
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:59,640
Well, one thing in particular, if we look at IHS, an OSH impact or Ohc impact now,

68
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:06,809
especially in this area like poop is the thing, like the sentinel thing.

69
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:13,709
So here in our school, Dr. Shi, Dr. Neitzel, Dr. DeBarge and Dr. Franz Blough,

70
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:21,750
they've been working over the last two years with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services monitoring the wastewater on campus.

71
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:31,110
And from there they can see when outbreaks are going to occur, usually at dormitories or things like that related to COVID,

72
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:40,530
just because pathogens are still present in your fecal matter and it's not been processed yet by the wastewater treatment facility.

73
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,050
So they're able to track diseases that way.

74
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:50,580
And now that COVID, I mean, they're still tracking COVID, but now they're also added other infectious diseases to the list as well.

75
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:58,470
So Dr. she is also tracking polio now on campus and RSV and a couple.

76
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:08,340
The CDC does have a map of localities and municipal municipalities that are tracking local wastewater,

77
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,850
but not all of them report their data to the CDC, obviously.

78
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:17,610
But this is a really clever way, I think in particular,

79
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:25,049
that as folks in this particular field have thought of a way to track and surveil for potential outbreaks,

80
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,230
because it's really hard to get everyone to come in and test. Right.

81
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:33,719
But if people are hooked up to like the main sewer lines and they're not on like, well,

82
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:42,000
water or like a septic tank system, this is a great way to be able to track what's coming up next.

83
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,830
And then from the Ohc side in particular, you know,

84
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:55,800
a lot has come out where they're now more so like delving into the world of policy, trying to advocate for workers rights.

85
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,910
So if you remember, early in the pandemic, they had what they.

86
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:09,370
Call it. It's our emergency temporary standard put out by OSHA regarding health care workers and COVID.

87
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,149
You know, that obviously did not become more than temporary.

88
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:21,020
And in fact, like it went up to different federal courts and they tried to like slam it down to keep the economy open.

89
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:29,479
But, you know, the ETFs in particular tried to put in like robust measures for health care monitoring,

90
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:36,080
contact tracing and providing hazard pay to workers as well for working in these environments.

91
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:46,580
So for us in the field in particular, I know a lot of well, for me, I at least feel like some days it's like, what difference am I really making?

92
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:52,760
I'm just like sitting around in my little, little office doing my little silly little research that no one reads.

93
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:58,280
But, you know, we can also advocate in this sense in terms of, you know,

94
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:05,180
pushing forward for labor issues, but again, very apt for today, Election Day.

95
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,290
So much of our policies in particular,

96
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:16,490
how efficacious they are fully depends on whether or not the elected officials we have are willing to implement them.

97
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:24,620
So now how do we in continuing in the vein this week of like and last week of preparedness,

98
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:32,929
how do we try to prepare underserved communities for the next outbreak so that the Office of

99
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:38,150
Minority Health and Health Disparities has a couple of key questions they want us to consider.

100
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,610
One is, why is this population considered vulnerable?

101
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:52,160
Some some people? There isn't consensus around the language where people are trying to shift away from the terms like

102
00:11:52,160 --> 00:12:01,580
vulnerable or like underserved or like marginalized to like maybe things like historically excluded.

103
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:07,100
But it's still very much up for debate because it's like, you know,

104
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:15,079
people are susceptible to vulnerabilities because of the way that things are structured.

105
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:22,100
So they're trying to get I've seen some some folks now trying to get away from calling them vulnerable populations,

106
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,240
but they're right now is no consensus on what the replacement is.

107
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,090
And then what are the issues, concerns or needs of each population?

108
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,729
What strategies can we use to protect them?

109
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:43,730
And then what are approaches needed for getting these populations, their families, health care and service providers to ensure their protection?

110
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,900
Another, you know, thing to consider is populations with special needs.

111
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:56,300
So according to the National Response Framework, which is part of that ESF number eight,

112
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,250
populations defined as needing special needs may have additional needs before,

113
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:09,170
during and after an incident due to one or more functional areas, whether that be independence and mobility,

114
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:15,740
communication, transportation, needing supervision or also needing medical care.

115
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:21,020
And if you think about how inclusive we want to be with these terms.

116
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:27,290
Obviously a lot of that like inherently this already includes minors into the population.

117
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:36,850
But then persons needing additional assistance and thinking about transportation in this country in particular is not not public transit is nothing.

118
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:46,220
Not that great. Great. So if we're thinking about primary prevention and preparedness, you know, we want to first, you know,

119
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,290
think about the provision of routine care that might mitigate adverse health effects over time,

120
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:57,230
getting very basic things addressed, like, you know, preventative vaccines, for example, primary health care checkups.

121
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:03,110
What about social supports and social safety nets? Are they even present effective communication,

122
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:11,390
education and outreach that is not only culturally and linguistically appropriate, but at the appropriate literacy level.

123
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:17,840
Most people say you try to communicate two things at a eighth grade level,

124
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:24,440
but really most public health communications should be at a fifth or a sixth grade level to try

125
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,919
to get most of the population and then bolstering in place systems building on the new normal,

126
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,150
which I think we kind of have done to a certain extent now post COVID.

127
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:42,320
So like for example, now I know so many if we think about like a noninfectious disease response, like a new normal,

128
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,879
so many restaurants during COVID shifted to like, you know,

129
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:53,300
using the QR codes to like pull up the menu or like ordering online, curbside pick up, stuff like that.

130
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:59,870
I think all of those things are definitely here to stay in a new normal kind of.

131
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:08,180
And I'm grateful for that because I don't like going into stores in particular or like Co-mingling.

132
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,830
Yes. And we just went back to the present effective communication.

133
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:18,790
And if there like some Web sites that what you wrote in the like, if it's like a joke.

134
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:27,840
Yeah. Are there things that like. I don't trust that I would be able to write something at an eighth grade level because I'm like so nine.

135
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:32,250
Yeah. So how do you actually check it to make sure that it's eighth grader?

136
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:46,190
Yeah. So actually on Microsoft Word, they have a function that you can use that will scan like about what what grade level your materials are.

137
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:53,549
And so that's one that I use sometimes to check on because even in my other class right now where I

138
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:59,190
have my students developing a survey instrument geared towards like the average worker population,

139
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:06,959
like I gave them a lot of feedback on a lot of their purpose where they were like using words like exacerbated and like these grad school words.

140
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,020
I was like, No, no, no, we cannot we can't use this words.

141
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,670
So that's, I think, a good check.

142
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:21,540
It's also important to like, recognize, depending on like language literacy, cultural literacy, like what language are translating it into.

143
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,809
So if you are not like a native speaker, okay,

144
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:30,630
Google Translate is probably fine for like English to Spanish because they've crowdsourced enough of that.

145
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,870
But if you do something like English to Vietnamese,

146
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:41,910
it does not make any sense because it is too formal and some of the words don't match up correctly.

147
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,139
So for example, like for Michigan, how they nail salon cooperative.

148
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:54,360
Right now we're translating our chemical safety module from English to Vietnamese and we had an AI translate it just to see how it did bad.

149
00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:00,059
Then we had one of my research assistants who worked at a nail salon translate it,

150
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,230
and then we had a third person track check her translation to make sure that

151
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:08,520
it's saying what she thinks it's saying and it's like comprehensible enough.

152
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,069
But it's funny because the AI is essentially functioning like Google Translate.

153
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:21,540
And for one of the question, like the knowledge checks we have, we talk about hypochondria, you all know what hypochondria is, right?

154
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:27,300
Google Translate translated hypochondria into Vietnamese as erectile dysfunction.

155
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So these kinds of things happen.

156
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,740
And then another one, as an aside, I'll say to you, hurrah and the rest of you,

157
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:46,620
in case there is also I forget the name of the tool, but you know, generally some people have implicit biases,

158
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:54,209
like when they're writing like recommendations for students where they might use like certain terms to describe female students versus male students.

159
00:17:54,210 --> 00:18:01,050
So there is like a generator where you can paste in like your letter or like who you're writing about.

160
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:06,750
And it will check about how like gendered your language is, which is very nice.

161
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,300
But there's, there's a couple that, there's a couple of ways to check,

162
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,680
but it's also good to just have a second pair of eyes on it like a lay person as well.

163
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:22,169
So that's why in my other class we talk about things like doing cognitive testing, which is you can do this not just for a survey,

164
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:26,729
but it's kind of like a think aloud where you maybe you have a flier or a survey

165
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:32,910
instrument and then you have somebody who's like outside of your area of expertise,

166
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:41,130
kind of talk through their mental processes of what they think about the question, but how they would answer it.

167
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:50,460
So an example that I use is a question that says how many ounces of chop or how many ounces of candy do you eat in a day?

168
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,680
0 to 1 ounces, 2 to 3 ounces, or like more than four ounces.

169
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,629
So if I were like an average person, like I would say I would read the question.

170
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,600
You would ask them to read the question and kind of do like a mental think aloud.

171
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,040
So I would say something like, okay, how many ounces of candy white in a day?

172
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:12,870
Hmm. Well, what's considered candy is that also chocolate?

173
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:16,260
Because I don't eat candy, but I like a lot of chocolate.

174
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:23,370
And then, you know, maybe like after dinner, I might pop like one to 2 to 4.

175
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:29,700
Ferrero Rocher in my mouth, I have a Costco membership. And then and then like how much do like each of those?

176
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,340
I think they weigh an ounce. So I'm going to say more that four or more ounces in a day.

177
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:43,620
So there's like checks you can do like that too that are more informal if you don't want to use Microsoft or like a computer thing.

178
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:50,250
Yeah. And then partnerships and collaboration obviously is the tippy top,

179
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:56,370
but all of these things take time to build and require maintenance to be successful.

180
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:03,450
It takes time. It takes time. So like King and I were talking about, for example, Michigan helping the US cooperate cooperative.

181
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:11,219
Yesterday I was chatting with an individual who works for Rising Voices, which I just heard about for the first time,

182
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:22,110
and they are an advocacy organization based in Southeast Michigan, targeted at Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders to empower them to like.

183
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:26,170
Learn more about their voting rights and their freedoms and stuff like that.

184
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,700
But they were chatting with me about how do you get in with the community?

185
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,170
And I was like, This is this is going to take a couple years, right?

186
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:46,120
So these things do take time. And I feel that because it it is essentially a very slow burn and it requires a lot of persistence.

187
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:53,410
And some days you feel like you took three steps forward, but you took five steps back and you kind of have to go back and forth and rebuild.

188
00:20:53,770 --> 00:21:00,370
That's why our country, a lot of times are focused so much on tertiary care because that feels like

189
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:05,259
really a media and like you're getting like the bang for your buck that way.

190
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:11,020
But we know from evaluation data the return on investment in terms of primary prevention is significant.

191
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:20,380
Just have to have patience for it. One thing I would like to highlight that I love these are federally qualified health centers.

192
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,209
So we talked about this a little bit before where they're community based health care providers

193
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:31,210
that receive funds from versa to provide primary care in underserved areas or populations.

194
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:42,220
So they are like a comprehensive in onsite in the house where they do preventative health services, dental, mental substance abuse.

195
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,850
They can provide transportation for unnecessary patient care.

196
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,270
Oftentimes, they have case managers assigned to folks as well,

197
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:56,230
with chronic health conditions like type two diabetes, and then they provide hospital and specialty care.

198
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:02,500
And they are a critical part of our health care safety net and especially an infectious disease response.

199
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:09,400
And with earthquakes in particular, they have to meet a stringent set of requirements to be an agency,

200
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:14,260
and they have to provide sliding fee scales based on people's income.

201
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:22,270
And they also the nice part for this is they have a governing board of directors that are generally folks from that community.

202
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:25,960
So when I lived in Omaha, for example, highly segregated,

203
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:34,600
there were two CS one world in South Omaha that focused on treating the Latino Hispanic population.

204
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:41,200
And then Charles Drew Center in North Omaha that focused on providing services to the black African-American

205
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:48,880
community and their governing board of directors was like people who were racially or ethnically concordant,

206
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:54,190
that were researchers, other physicians in the community, people who worked at CBOs.

207
00:22:55,030 --> 00:23:04,450
And because they qualify for enhanced reimbursement, more reimbursement than a normal clinic would get from Medicare and Medicaid and other benefits.

208
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:10,420
They're trying to maximize the ability for people to obtain low care health services.

209
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:21,340
But so as of 2016, nationwide, there's nearly 1400 CS, but it totally depends on the population needs and area.

210
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:27,190
So if you think about a state like Wyoming, for example, where I don't think I know anybody who lives in Wyoming,

211
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:36,520
but a.k.a. the capital I passed through Wyoming right before Wyoming only has nine affixes,

212
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:45,730
where a place like Michigan, for example, with a population of nearly 10 million, has 39 and California has well over 100.

213
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,670
So it's distributed based on need. Another thing that I love is community health workers are C.H. WS and these

214
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:58,690
are lay members of the community who have worked in the health care system,

215
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,860
whether that be in like rural or urban environments, sometimes they're paid.

216
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:10,420
A lot of times they are volunteers, though, and they usually share some common thread with the population that they're trying to target,

217
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:15,580
whether that's ethnically language, socioeconomic status, life experiences.

218
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:21,370
So these are other terms for WS that you've probably seen before,

219
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:29,740
and this concept or model has been used for decades and decades, specifically in the health promotion round.

220
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:41,440
This photo in particular is trying to get folks in Pakistan to get the polio vaccine through nasal administration.

221
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:49,300
And they were going door to door during that time. But also they also did COVID testing and COVID vaccine distribution.

222
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:58,750
So according to the C h w health Disparities Initiative, evidence has shown that these do improve access to health care.

223
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:01,840
Now, they don't necessarily provide the health care they can,

224
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,270
like come to people's houses to give them educational sessions or link them up with certain physicians.

225
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:13,710
They can also like give people rides to places as well, but they have encourage greater health screening,

226
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:20,889
understanding of what social services are in the community, and also greater adherence to health recommendations.

227
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:25,270
So like checking up on people. Or to be like, you know, like, how's your diet going?

228
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:33,430
Like, how are your grocery shopping habits change. And they also reduce the need for emergency and specialty services.

229
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:39,720
So as Q Foods and WS were what I wanted to highlight there, hoda.

230
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:43,690
Yes. A question about reimbursement. Yes. To comment on that photo.

231
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,400
Which one? The one we used to see. H.W. Records in Pakistan.

232
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,700
Yes. That's like a big controversy. Yeah.

233
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,360
They're getting attacked. Foreign policy. Oh, okay. Yeah.

234
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,250
Yeah. That was news to. I don't know it. Like specific. Sure. Sure.

235
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:08,319
Worth reading more about, but like US foreign policy intervention and the ways that they used polio to do that and then that created,

236
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,000
like a lot of distrust of the polio vaccine.

237
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:18,610
So I would be curious to know more about like the stories in Pakistan that really matter because that reads like a lot of vaccine hesitancy.

238
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,870
Yeah. Yeah. That particular. Yeah.

239
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,240
Do you mind sharing with the class a little bit about. I don't like. Okay.

240
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,070
Okay. If we're. Yeah. Pointing out or noting.

241
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,070
Yeah, yeah, there was there. I mean they're doing a great job on what they can.

242
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:39,020
But and also I am not a super duper expert on this.

243
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,720
So and if you feel free to correct me.

244
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:49,690
The W's in particular, because they are associated sometimes with the World Health Organization or like Red Crescent,

245
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:57,910
which is what they call the Red Cross abroad. There is a general distrust of like westernized public health and medical institutions.

246
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:05,049
So there was most of the people who are c h W's in Pakistan were women, in particular in health care workers.

247
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:11,860
So they were getting like attacked in some areas and killed in particular when

248
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:16,480
trying to distribute the polio vaccine and mostly like trying to reach kids.

249
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:21,520
And I know that again, correct me if I'm wrong,

250
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:33,910
but that some there has been some some rhetoric there as well from like extreme religious groups about anti-vaccination sentiments,

251
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:39,430
which also maybe COVID vaccine administration during that time.

252
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:49,030
Very, very difficult. Yeah. Yeah. Well, what I'm referring to, I think, is more like the use of fake vaccine campaign to find Osama bin Laden.

253
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:52,150
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Yeah.

254
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,240
Also that. Yes.

255
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:02,290
But my question is going to be about like Medicaid reimbursement.

256
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:06,460
You're saying that it's higher for and I can never remember that I've covered it.

257
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:18,430
Yeah. Is how how common is it for like a clinic or a hospital to say we don't accept Medicaid because the reimbursement is there?

258
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:23,830
Well, it depends if they're like an independent clinic or if they're part of a health system.

259
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,810
So like if you're part of Trinity Health. Right.

260
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:33,890
Like if you're the clinic and like here in township or like the one over here, they don't really have a choice if it's Trinity have managed to do it.

261
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:41,590
Right. But for example, I have an uncle in California and he's an entered endocarditis,

262
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:45,490
which is basically someone who just does root canals and stuff like that.

263
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:56,260
And his office does not accept medical, which is their version or Medicare, because they don't want to deal with the complexity of the billing.

264
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:08,140
So they'll just straight up tell people like no, and they have turned very anti-vax and MAGA, which is a whole other other thing.

265
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,870
But if they're a private clinic, they have full autonomy. If their health care system, they they may or may not.

266
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:24,010
Yeah, Michigan medicine definitely does take it. And it behooves you it's more common to find like larger health care systems that accept it.

267
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:34,330
And then smaller clinics, if you notice, in particular, may decline it and even don't even accept like all types of pretty common insurance.

268
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,350
Has very complicated infrastructure, especially. Yes, yes.

269
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:42,670
Yes, yes. Thank you. Yes.

270
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:51,980
Yes. The Osama thing. Any any questions or comments on that deck before I move on to the next.

271
00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:00,370
Okay. So I'm going to start talking about interprofessional teams.

272
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:07,900
But just as a reminder. Thursday is a fully on Zoom lecture with Dr. Herr Stein joining us from Switzerland.

273
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:12,280
So you can stay at home in your jammies if you want.

274
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:16,930
Don't come here because I'll be at my house, but it will start at 830.

275
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,310
Per usual. And the zoom link is in in campus.

276
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:30,760
So I'll be talking to you about things that she won't necessarily cover casually talking to you about me tab the show and her own experiences,

277
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,350
but I'll talk to you about certs and things like that.

278
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,250
So it takes a village.

279
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,510
They usually say this about raising a child, right?

280
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:49,600
But there is a African proverb that says, If you want to go fast, go alone.

281
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:57,400
If you want to go far, go together. And inherently, we know collaborative teams are the most successful.

282
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:06,220
And when I was a student in undergrad, but also grad school group projects galore.

283
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:10,510
Right. Everybody loves them sometimes.

284
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,690
And I will say, you know,

285
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:20,140
we've all experienced or had our share of like group projects that have been wonderful and then some that have been challenging.

286
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:28,479
But we are really are trying to teach you what it's like in the real world because we're projects at work are

287
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:35,890
like exponentially more difficult because at that point there's nothing keeping people accountable really.

288
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,059
There's no more grades.

289
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:46,480
There's no professors lowering over you to be like, you know, you know, do a team t grade your team member on whether or not they contribute or not?

290
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,800
No. And like in government, it's very hard to fire people.

291
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:56,140
People don't get fired there. They just you have people who do all the work and the people who just like chill.

292
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:06,730
Same thing with academia. So wherever you go, collaborative teams are the most successful, but only if they get along and work synergistically.

293
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:13,059
So ideally, as we talked about before in previous weeks, infectious disease response.

294
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:22,540
You want to have an incident command system or a leadership structure where there is a clear person that everybody reports to you,

295
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:26,290
but more or less hierarchical relationships are minimized.

296
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:34,060
So like I talked about before at the biocontainment unit, we had the physicians and nurses, the industrial hygienist, doing the cleaning.

297
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:41,649
We have grad students on the same level, like able to talk to like lead infectious disease physicians, just like colleagues.

298
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:49,330
But we all still know who was the incident commander and accept that no person or profession is

299
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:56,319
the expert in every facet of infectious disease care training and regular exercises are key.

300
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:04,900
We talked about that before, ideally quarterly and then evidence shows better success with staffing when people opt in rather than opt out.

301
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:13,600
So what does that mean? It's again, that volunteer basis where it's like, okay, who wants to be part of the Nebraska biocontainment unit team?

302
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:22,419
And then those folks opt in to be in it. And then when they are deployed, their cardio cardiology, pediatrics, whatever knows,

303
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:29,020
they'll be gonna backfill it rather than saying like, Lexie, you have to be part of this, right?

304
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:39,190
Like if you don't want to, because there is a lot of physical and mental fortitude that is required to do these kinds of things now.

305
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:44,890
Jonas Salk in particular. Jonas Salk from going back to the polio vaccine,

306
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:51,100
that's him looking very excited at the University of Pittsburgh, was an infectious disease specialist.

307
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,400
And I know some of you are interested in going into medicine,

308
00:33:56,550 --> 00:34:03,220
so it's I'll think about it because there are not that many infectious disease specialist anymore where

309
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:09,610
you do get you have to do internal medicine residency of three years and then a fellowship of two years.

310
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,440
But unfortunately they are among the ten lowest paid specialties out of all physicians.

311
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,110
So with how expensive medical school is nowadays, you're probably going to be leaving with a quarter million dollars in debt.

312
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:27,489
Nobody wants to really do a low paying specialty.

313
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:33,460
So they'll go into radiology, for example, dermatology, whatever.

314
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,360
Some people do get into primary care because her said,

315
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:43,629
does provide loan forgiveness specifically to folks who will work in like rural or underserved regions.

316
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:47,740
But infectious disease specialist really don't get any kickback.

317
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:53,050
And it's a unique area of medicine because unlike cardiologists that focus on the heart.

318
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,580
Or like gastroenterology that will focus on like your stomach.

319
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,980
This is a specialty that doesn't focus on performing procedures,

320
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:12,070
and they don't concentrate on one area of the body because potentially every organ of your body can get infected with an infectious disease.

321
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:17,440
And it's a common misconception that IT specialists only focus on HIV.

322
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:26,380
But really, to a certain extent, they are more or less researchers slash investigators that are trained on identification and treatment.

323
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:33,670
But they also play a critical role in vaccine development and novel disease treatment.

324
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:42,430
So based on like who I follow on Twitter, they always have the means of like the guy from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

325
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:50,350
And he has this like little like web of like, you know, his bulletin board where he's trying to explain to someone something.

326
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:55,810
And that's essentially what infectious disease specialists have to do, where they have to, like,

327
00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:02,800
piece together not only occupational and environmental exposures, do a certain level of contact tracing.

328
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:08,230
And some of them are also laboratorio ins, like Dr. Salk, for example.

329
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:14,560
Here. Here. In this photo, I have had the privilege of working with all these people.

330
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,800
Alex Parker is was one of the head nurses at the unit at that time.

331
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:27,940
Dr. Phil Smith very cool, very chill. I also clean his office out when I was a grad student and he was retired.

332
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:34,390
And then now Dr. Hewlett is the director of medicine at the Nebraska biocontainment unit.

333
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:44,860
And they were heavily involved in like the Ebola response did a lot of public press and still continue to be part of like monkeypox responses,

334
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:51,800
COVID and all of that. Dr. Monto, who just retired here.

335
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:57,580
Dr. Arnold Monto, you know, epidemiologist, but also infectious disease physician as well.

336
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:02,380
Now, one are thinking about infectious disease treatment in particular.

337
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:06,400
Some specialties that will particularly need are pulmonology,

338
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:15,580
because usually there are some kind of respiratory issues emergency med cardiology, pediatrics, surgery and then ob gyn.

339
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:21,729
Children generally cannot be treated in the same facilities as adults and will

340
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:26,740
need different sized beds and sometimes different size equipment as well,

341
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:33,580
just because they are not fully developed yet. Now registered nurses hold nurses.

342
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:37,600
Nurses provide the bulk of hands on patient care.

343
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:44,050
So like I said, like during Ebola, we had Dr. Phil it and Dr. Smith there providing care.

344
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:52,300
Frequently they would look at like the patient notes a couple of times a day and they would talk to the patient through webcam at the station.

345
00:37:52,570 --> 00:38:00,220
But it was the nurses who were suiting up and then suiting out and then doing the direct hands on patient care.

346
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:10,240
They can come from all specialties. They do beyond administrative things, handle disinfection and decon, and then handling of remains if necessary.

347
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:17,980
So in Nebraska, we had one wet patient who was evacuated pretty late and he passed away.

348
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:26,620
And at that time there were no protocols on how to deal with a highly infectious decedent.

349
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:32,230
And so when we talked to the CDC, they were like, I don't know, you decide.

350
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,230
Which is it?

351
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:42,670
So so when Dr. Gibbs, who gives his guest lecturer like the the the class before Thanksgiving, he has some photos and you guys can ask him about that.

352
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:49,780
But the nurses in particular came up with a process to, like shroud the body, perform last rites of package,

353
00:38:50,080 --> 00:39:01,570
and then do a couple of layers of thermal sealing body bags and then, you know, quietly transferring it to a crematorium and all that.

354
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:08,920
And then from there, if you look at like Ebola deceit and handling on the CDC website,

355
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:13,990
their their steps were adapted from from us from the biocontainment unit.

356
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:20,590
Yes. Berman, I was just curious on the nurses is like Nurse Maria Murrieta.

357
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,800
So a big issue that they had.

358
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:31,480
And they do this at a lot of places now where they'll either write it on the hood of your face shield or on your apron as when everybody suited up,

359
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:37,450
you know, who is who. So it's just a very common way of like identifying someone.

360
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:43,719
And it also adds that personal touch where I know during COVID they would write like the name and

361
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:50,530
then maybe like drawn a smiley face in particular just so that the patients felt more personal.

362
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:55,200
And it wasn't just like some random person. Like treating them, you know?

363
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:01,980
Yeah. Yeah. Respiratory therapists are also very cool and necessary.

364
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:10,250
I have had the chance to work with a few and they specialize in particular with breathing and cardiopulmonary disorders.

365
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:20,280
So whether that's intubation, managing ventilators, drugs with lung function, so people who have things like infectious disease cases,

366
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:25,230
multiple organ failure, like I mentioned, like some people with COVID would get sepsis.

367
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:32,309
So that can result in things like collapsed lung, bronchitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome.

368
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:35,370
And then they also provide outpatient therapy as well.

369
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:39,930
So if you think about like physical therapy, but just for your breathing functions.

370
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:47,590
Then you have various health care technicians and experts.

371
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:52,870
So here in this picture is a schematic of the special isolation unit.

372
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,740
This is at Emory University, and we'll go through it in a little bit.

373
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:02,710
But you also have X-ray technicians, sonogram technicians and laboratory specialists.

374
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:06,129
So at the biocontainment unit, like we had to,

375
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:13,300
they had to the x ray technicians had to wheel in the giant x ray machines from other floors in order to,

376
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,510
like, die, you know, give diagnostics of patients.

377
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:19,270
They had to be decontaminated in particular.

378
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:30,600
And then we set up our own biosafety level three cabinet within the facility to do blood testing onsite for people's antibodies,

379
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:34,059
because for a while people were getting freaked out that, you know,

380
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:42,459
Dr. Gibbs and Dr. Lowe were running around campus with coolers with essentially Ebola blood in them.

381
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:46,690
And like people were like just like cross the street, like get out of the way.

382
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:59,120
So when they installed the safety cabinet into the unit, we had like maybe an inch of clearance before it hit the hit the hit the wall.

383
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,490
Thankfully, it made it in there.

384
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:10,000
But if you see in particular, generally like the NBCU is a ten patient wing that hypothetically can hold ten patients.

385
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:15,910
But never has that happened yet. Generally, some of the rooms are used for something else.

386
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:23,080
So at Emory, you can see, yes, number one, they have patient, private rooms that look just like any other hospital room.

387
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:27,400
And then, you know, you might have a restroom facility.

388
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:35,290
Number four, they have a dedicated lab on site that's used to perform like blood counts, blood gas measurements, urinalysis.

389
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:42,430
And then a lot of times they might use a separate patient room to hold all the waste,

390
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,590
both solid and liquid that either needs to be autoclave or incinerated.

391
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,090
And then they might hold another room. Just stopped full of PPE as well.

392
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,170
So kind of thinking about creatively, about how to use it.

393
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:07,250
But if you see in particular here like this one where the patient is, this is considered a hot zone or a red zone and as well as the bathroom.

394
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:15,580
And then this area here would be considered like a warm zone where there may be some potential contamination.

395
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,080
And then back here,

396
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:25,660
where there are lockers and showers and where everybody's like cleaning out and hopefully there's some method of egress out this way.

397
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:32,560
Or if they're coming back through this way, this would be considered a cold zone where there's like the least amount of contamination.

398
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:41,110
But you see here at the peak of Ebola patients, illnesses, up to 40 bags a day of medical waste were produced.

399
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:47,110
I do think I talk about this later on, so I'll get to the waste stuff.

400
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:54,070
Now, industrial hygienists, I didn't know what industrial hygiene as was until my master's degree.

401
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:59,649
So a lot of times people confuse what industrial hygiene is.

402
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:02,710
Do I like to think of ourselves as occupational health scientists?

403
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,870
Because people are like, What do you do? Do you clean teeth or something like that because of the name?

404
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:13,149
But they are, I would say, at a higher level than a safety professional,

405
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:19,629
because they're looking in particular about implementing controls and what controls to actually

406
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:24,580
recommend for people to use rather than just making sure that people are actually using them.

407
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:32,320
So this in particular looks like h-back systems, negative pressure rooms, personal protective equipment, selection.

408
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:36,280
These are all things that industrial hygienist would recommend on appropriate

409
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:41,200
methods of decontamination and disposal of waste and then conducting research.

410
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:48,070
Then environmental services, sometimes called custodial services or janitorial services.

411
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:53,110
As I mentioned, we do not recommend them for high level isolation care or infectious,

412
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:57,999
highly infectious disease care just because of these justice issues about training,

413
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,570
compensation, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, gender, level of risk in particular,

414
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:12,340
and then performing should being cleaned by trained staff who are able to do so.

415
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:20,170
Even here, I would say there is like issues of justice related to our environmental services and custodial staff.

416
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:26,259
So on this tower two in particular, we have a couple of custodial staff that you might see.

417
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:32,290
And myself and my office neighbor, we generally chat with the custodians when we see them because we're here at like seven in the morning.

418
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:41,260
But it's a real sad for me because they say that some, like faculty, won't even acknowledge their presence, you know, and kind of.

419
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:44,000
You know, you treat them like a subhuman, right.

420
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:51,350
But I know, like, Tony cleans the bathroom and, like, Brian, like, empties my trash and like, stuff like that.

421
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:58,399
And again, they're all they are placed at like comparable risk, especially in health care facilities,

422
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:04,969
if you think about the day to day, even just of the normal functions, but they're not receiving the same level of training.

423
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:09,680
They're definitely not making as much as a physician or even a registered nurse.

424
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:13,010
Right. And they're just trying to trying to get by.

425
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:19,760
So, you know, whenever I see, like, environmental service workers or custodial workers in particular,

426
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:26,450
like try to be considerate of their presence and like thanking them for for what they do.

427
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:36,170
Yeah. So before I move on to this part, any questions or comments about those roles that I've highlighted?

428
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:44,700
Okay. So interprofessional teams now in infectious disease outbreaks.

429
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:55,130
What does that look like in particular? This one here is not of any particular university.

430
00:46:55,130 --> 00:47:01,910
It's just a schematic that I asked the instructional designer to put for me.

431
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:06,649
But this is a typical like academic campus, medical campus, right?

432
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:10,130
Where, you know, you might have like a hospital kind of like we do,

433
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:14,629
but at the same time, like all these different other things surrounding the community,

434
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:22,370
whether that be like football stadiums, different research buildings, fire stations, utilities, etc.

435
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:31,309
So it's kind of just like plopped in the middle there. And if we're look thinking about the ten essential health services that we would

436
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:37,160
try to work on in public health with the major three branches being assurance,

437
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:42,530
assessment and policy development with equity being at its core.

438
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:50,580
Right. We're trying to do things like we've talked about before, equitable access, skilled workforce, innovative research, monitoring,

439
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:58,820
population health, but then also thinking about communication and then how to strengthen, mobilize those partnerships.

440
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:02,389
So what the public health level,

441
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:11,710
I want to highlight some folks that are part of the interprofessional team and the first being epidemiologists which are so many you

442
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:21,080
in the room this one is a take this picture here is of the deputy from the deputy director of public health science and surveillance.

443
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,770
So this is an egis officer. How many of you have thought about.

444
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:31,190
Yes, I see a couple of hands. Okay. You have to have a Ph.D. to be an Egis.

445
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:38,870
Yeah. So is that why you're getting the Ph.D.? It was one of the reasons I was looking at it.

446
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:45,260
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They serve post-doctorate on the frontlines of public health.

447
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:51,620
So, you know, in previous weeks, we had Commander Garza come talk about the public health service and the medical reserve,

448
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:55,309
for which you only need a master's degree to do. Yes.

449
00:48:55,310 --> 00:49:00,800
In particular, they kind of take it to the next level in terms of outbreak investigation,

450
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:06,110
identifying the cause, implementing control measures and collecting evidence.

451
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:11,870
So generally as a IAS officer, you have assignments and deployments just like the Public Health Service.

452
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:22,100
But active officers in comparison to public health service deploy more than 200 times a year to support field investigations,

453
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:28,460
where, as Commander Garza was doing in the Public Health Service, she generally is not deployed for more than six weeks at a time.

454
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:33,620
If you're an officer, you could be gone for months and months and months.

455
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:43,010
And I know a particular IAS officer, Captain Joe Schubert, who is at NIH and during the Ebola outbreak,

456
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:51,799
she was deployed to like Guinea and Liberia for a good year on the frontlines,

457
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:59,180
not only providing care, but collecting whatever epidemiological data that could be collected in.

458
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:06,349
So prevention went to in you. There was like a bunch of years of this and it was really interesting because

459
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:10,730
some of them were medical doctors there only like one actual epidemiologist,

460
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:15,080
the incident commander, he wasn't there and he was a sociologist.

461
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,719
And like some of them were like psychiatrists and it was a really, really diverse team.

462
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,590
But now one epidemiologist yeah.

463
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:33,380
So, so I guess bit more for us they accept issue but they also accept other terminal degrees as well like MDs for that it was flooding, right?

464
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:38,810
Yes, it was. Well, it was the community assessment of community needs assessment.

465
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:47,599
Okay. So I mean, I guess that kind of makes sense that they would have a sociologist and physician there,

466
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:51,230
but surprisingly would only have one epidemiologist.

467
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:57,230
Yeah, well, my perception going in was that they were going to be primarily epidemiologists doing public health professionals.

468
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:02,300
Yeah, I was surprised as well. I wonder if they were deployed elsewhere during that time.

469
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:07,040
Maybe we also felt like it was a little sudden so we could have just been whoever was available.

470
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:10,610
Yeah, whoever. Three, maybe they need more.

471
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:24,020
You know, another population mine to highlight is first responders going to focus particularly on EMS, EMR and firefighting in particular,

472
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:30,920
depending on the locality that you live in and the municipality, sometimes you don't have a separate EMS service.

473
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,980
The firefighters are also the EMT.

474
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:40,530
And interestingly, I didn't realize this until I started. Doing all this, you know, work and research with the biocontainment unit,

475
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:46,799
that first responders are not considered health care workers and therefore they're not offered the same protections.

476
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:55,280
Right. So in terms of like training, if we go back to like respiratory protection, they do wear CBAs, right?

477
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:57,600
And they're trained to wear escape respirators.

478
00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:06,030
But when I was training them on a 90 fives in particular, they had this was Bloomington Fire Department.

479
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:10,079
They had an outcome that fit them for the respirator model.

480
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:18,390
And they did the quantitative fit testing with the port account. And the training officer was standing in the back and out of.

481
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:28,649
I don't think I've told the story yet. And then I asked like the firefighters, like, oh, what model and 95 do you wear?

482
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:32,370
And they said, and 95. And I said, No, no, no.

483
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:36,719
What model of a 95 do you wear? And none of them knew.

484
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:43,260
And health care facilities, sometimes on people's badges that like right on the back, like you can wear three and blah, blah, blah or whatever.

485
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:51,900
And so the guys at that fire service thought that the N95 that they were given during fit testing was the one for the year,

486
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:58,710
so they were reusing the same and 95 for the entire year.

487
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:05,040
And I said, okay, this was pre-COVID, okay. So they were just like folding it up and putting it back in their shirt pocket.

488
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:14,549
And the training officer was like, Guys, guys, guys, I've had a whole box in the kitchen and you're supposed to like refill them in the rigs.

489
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:19,770
And they were like, We didn't know that. So there was again, this like lapse of communication.

490
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:24,570
But because of the services they provide, this was a fire service that did EMT.

491
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:34,620
They're responding to like heart attacks, people giving birth fires, cats in trees, all that kind of stuff.

492
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:44,550
So not all of them necessarily fell under a respiratory respiratory protection program where some of the respirator use was voluntary.

493
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:51,780
But, you know, generally with this, you just have to get a certification and continuing and continuing education.

494
00:53:52,170 --> 00:54:00,629
But we consider them the absolute frontline of infectious diseases because every time they respond to a call,

495
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:05,830
they don't know what they're rolling up to. And everybody is going to present with something influenza like.

496
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:16,470
So it could very well just be the influenza shooter or it could be Ebola because the symptoms at the beginning are essentially the same.

497
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:26,100
So it's so important for first responders in particular to at least be able to make some very preliminary,

498
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:36,180
preliminary differential diagnoses or know how to protect themselves from potential respiratory infections.

499
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:39,720
They don't make that much, honestly,

500
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:53,490
and a lot of them get desensitized to protocols after a while that they kind of become less careful in their practices, let's say.

501
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,770
So like this fire service in particular,

502
00:54:55,770 --> 00:55:03,980
the guys were telling me like they've delivered babies without wearing like gloves or aprons on no eye protection,

503
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:09,760
you know, like all kind of kinds of stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

504
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:20,249
Bradley I just love the questions I get, whether they're not classified as health care workers, which is also kind of confusing, right?

505
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,430
Because you're caring for.

506
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:30,160
I'm just trying to understand, like this lack of training come from not being considered a health care workers, then you don't get funding.

507
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:39,880
And what is that? Yeah, I live there now under contract, and it depends on how they're funded by the government.

508
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:48,330
So like some some towns are so small that they don't have what we call career firefighters or like career EMT.

509
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:53,410
A lot of them are volunteer. So they have like a whole lot of lives that they lead in.

510
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:55,720
Like this is something they do on the side for fun.

511
00:55:56,050 --> 00:56:04,360
And oftentimes because they're like the the the local government of the city didn't set aside that pot of money for them to,

512
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:12,909
like, get the training or get the resources. Whereas like health care, they're generally funded either like by the federal like herself,

513
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:18,130
for example, or through a health system, or they're reimbursed in like some sort of way.

514
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:25,719
It's kind of like that gray area, like I mentioned, like nursing homes and long care residential facilities,

515
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,840
and like folks like my mom who work with the elderly,

516
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:37,450
they're not considered health care workers either, even though they provide health services and have comparable exposures.

517
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:40,809
But they're technically not considered health care workers.

518
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:46,510
And so by that, through the eyes of the way OSHA regulations are set up,

519
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:51,720
they're not necessarily covered by like the respiratory protection regulation.

520
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:55,660
They might be considered protected by like the Bloodborne Pathogens standard.

521
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:03,460
But, you know, in terms of like employer responsibility, it's it's more lax.

522
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:08,200
What is the definition for a health care worker? Where does it.

523
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:18,570
Oh, that's a good question. Generally, they consider that somebody to be working in like a clinic or a health care facility or a hospital,

524
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:23,450
like a nurse or a like a respiratory tract, would be like a health care worker.

525
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:34,310
But then these folks who may receive their certifications or like go to vocational school may not be considered,

526
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:40,140
even though like you can go to vocational school to be an ultrasound technician and you're considered a health care worker.

527
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:46,640
So it's kind of like these, like it depends areas that almost makes it sound like it's more about the setting that you're doing.

528
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:49,530
The health care. Yeah. Versus the actual. Actual. Yeah.

529
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:54,660
That's confusing to me that the occupational or the industrial genesis consider that we're not.

530
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:58,160
Oh, no, we're not. Oh, we work with health care, but we're not.

531
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:06,629
Health care. If you think about like these folks, like the EMT, EMS, you know, nurses at nursing homes,

532
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:12,690
they're in the community rather than being, like in a designated facility.

533
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:18,540
Yeah. Yeah. It's all very gray and can be very confusing.

534
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:27,040
I'm not going to talk about police officers. Because I'll get very passionate about it.

535
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:30,880
They do stuff. They don't have a lot of training either. Mm hmm.

536
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:34,450
Mm hmm. Okay. Government officials.

537
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:44,470
So ideally, their goal is to look after the best interests of their constituency and serve their needs.

538
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:50,800
And they are responsible for mandates, regulations and guidelines and anything enforceable under the law.

539
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:56,890
But as we all know, they are not necessarily trained in public health, health care or science.

540
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:04,360
A lot of them do have bachelor's degrees. And you believe that a lot of presidents, surprisingly, mostly only have bachelor's degrees.

541
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:12,760
Some have law degrees. But if you think about the power they hold in terms of infectious disease in emergency response,

542
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:22,390
like what was going on during COVID here in Washtenaw County, look very different in Livingston County or Oakland County, for example.

543
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:30,100
So they fully decide what protections their citizens essentially have to follow.

544
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:33,640
And so for somewhere here, like Washtenaw County in particular,

545
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:39,760
we are considered more conservative in our public health guidelines, which is a good thing because,

546
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:48,520
you know, there's often a negative connotation with that word like vaccine mandates in particular masking social distancing markers.

547
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:58,030
So looking in particular about what their interests are are super important.

548
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:04,420
I was shocked to find out, y'all, we don't have a voting guide in Michigan.

549
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:14,280
Yeah. In California, before an election, everybody is mailed, you know, like how?

550
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:22,469
Trader Joe's has that fearless flier mailer that's, like, kind of like a cheap newspaper, but it's like a little magazine in California.

551
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:31,290
Before every midterm and regular election, every citizen is sent a booklet that comes in English,

552
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:38,399
Spanish, Mandarin, Vietnamese, like the common languages spoken in California.

553
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:50,340
You're like, Lexi, your mind is blood on all the candidates and what their like official platform is so that when you're doing your absentee ballot,

554
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:55,650
you just like flip and look at their platform, the paper you did.

555
01:00:55,980 --> 01:01:00,900
You should have that in my high school. Okay, well, we still don't have it.

556
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:03,330
So I did absentee voting and I,

557
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:14,369
I Googled people like on my laptop at home because don't just look at the name because some people's passwords actually surprise me a little bit,

558
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:22,920
but I didn't realize now you're allowed to have your phone when you phone out, when you vote at the polls because you used to not be able to before.

559
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:27,840
Like they were like, you're not allowed to take pictures of the ballot or anything. Are any of you voting today?

560
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:31,560
Yeah. Okay. It's a union. Yeah, okay.

561
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:35,639
Mine is a different. I'm okay. Yeah.

562
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:45,360
Yeah. So definitely important to look at folks platforms because they have so much power over what happens in our communities.

563
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:49,950
Other organizations. Yeah, that voter guide is the exception.

564
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:53,850
Not the yeah. Not the, not the norm. Yeah. Yeah.

565
01:01:54,140 --> 01:02:00,270
Registered in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. No, they don't have it here, you know, over there.

566
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:04,200
Yeah, Nebraska was a no and Indiana was also a no.

567
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:11,669
So I remember in Indiana, I, they didn't have absentee voting here, there,

568
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:19,350
which I'm so glad you can have it here because I just mail it in because I don't want to deal with that early voting centers.

569
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:28,470
But in Indiana, they make you point to a blue sticker or a red sticker.

570
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:32,160
Is that like that in Wisconsin and Minnesota?

571
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:37,850
Is that to say like what your party lines are? Yeah, I've never registered for like my.

572
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:41,969
Oh, okay. This yes.

573
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:47,550
Page. Where was the voter come coming from? Like the state itself or like a different organization, the state of California.

574
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:53,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's the only state I've lived in where they had a voter guide, which was very nice.

575
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:57,830
Thank you. It's but, but I mean, why wouldn't they?

576
01:02:57,930 --> 01:03:01,400
Why don't they do that, Adriana?

577
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:04,740
I don't know. I was just thinking about it. Oh, okay.

578
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:09,030
Oh, yeah. Oh, I know that at least the Democratic Party.

579
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:15,389
Yeah, they have a website. Things vote.org. Yes. So you all in the Democratic candidates, if you're voting Democrat, I'm sure there's one for public.

580
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:19,900
And do you know, like a voter guide? Exactly. But there are lots of resources that are widely available.

581
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:27,270
There be people at the farmers market in this thing. Yeah. I mean, what about your if you're like, super old and not like computer literate?

582
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:34,800
I know they have stuff at City Hall. Okay. I went there like at a party house and they like resources everywhere.

583
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:40,060
Why wouldn't they give out voter guides? I'm asking you.

584
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:48,020
Well, I mean, I haven't I have my answer, but I'm asking you. They don't want us to make informed decisions.

585
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:55,010
Yeah. Yeah. Well, and if they know there's this argument that it it costs money.

586
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:59,490
The government spends a lot of money on a lot of stuff we don't need.

587
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:08,210
Right. So it's it's kind of feeding into this. Are we making informed decisions, feeding into, like, you know, continuous, like, disenfranchisement,

588
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:15,920
expunging people from ballot, from voter registration guides like my sister got tossed in Brooklyn.

589
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:20,540
She lives she's lived there for 20 years and she's voted in like every election.

590
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:24,770
And she got tossed because of a signature issue.

591
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:29,090
So she had to she works for the mayor of New York. Like, how did this happen?

592
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:32,720
Right. And so think about if people aren't checking in, vigilant about it.

593
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:36,200
I've never had two signatures that look the same, honestly.

594
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:43,870
So. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

595
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:51,280
So. So if we think about other organizations that also might be involved as well, again,

596
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:58,120
we've talked about nonprofits and CBOs higher ed, but also workers unions and local media.

597
01:04:58,450 --> 01:05:05,499
We are really privileged, I would say in Michigan, this is like one of the nation's like hotbeds for unions,

598
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:12,550
the United Autoworkers, which is now International United Auto Workers, you have the Service Workers Union in particular.

599
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:19,370
United Steelworkers are mostly focused in like Pittsburgh and like the New England area as well.

600
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:27,969
But workers unions generally vote more so for for social issues and things of that nature.

601
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:38,290
I will say my personal experience with the United Autoworkers here in our department, we have a partnership with UAW.

602
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:49,390
And last in May of 2021, they asked me to speak at their workshops specifically on COVID 19 vaccines.

603
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:52,280
So their industrial hygiene is tapped on me to be like.

604
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:58,149
Rick And you talk about the COVID vaccines because they hear me talk about like safety and health stuff all the time.

605
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:11,050
So like, they don't necessarily want to hear from me anymore. And so they did pre and post workshops, surveys about intent to get the vaccine.

606
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:20,650
And Andy Cole, my who is an alumni of our age program from the nineties, said that he calls it the Aurora effect.

607
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:30,970
Some like it's not. But like after the workshop, there was an uptick about 20% of people who said they were going to get the vaccine.

608
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:41,530
Just because I talked more about the FDA process, you know, the development of many vaccines that has actually been in the works for like two decades.

609
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:49,210
I only spent about 15 minutes, 20 minutes actually talking and 30 minutes just answering questions.

610
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:58,330
Some people have really legitimate questions, like some women were worried about fertility and reproduction and all that kind of stuff.

611
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:04,180
But again, it's again, like I talked about before in previous weeks about public health communication.

612
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:09,819
Yeah, our goal is to create like crafty statements that do like blanket things.

613
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:18,790
But a lot of the work comes from like these one on one conversations and people generally tend to trust their union a lot more than their employer.

614
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:28,930
Sadly, there has been a decline in unionization in this country in the last 100 years and like right to work states and those kinds of things.

615
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:41,010
But think about like if unions were bad, why would companies spend millions and millions of dollars trying to union union bust?

616
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:43,720
Right. It's just bad for for profits.

617
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:53,440
Now, before I move on to the emergency response component, does anybody have any comments about what I just said?

618
01:07:56,100 --> 01:08:03,240
Okay. So last part. So I want to talk about certs or community of risk emergency response teams.

619
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:11,430
They're also sometimes called community emergency teams, cities or nurse neighborhood emergency response teams.

620
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:21,450
And these are also considered part of the social safety net, where they are essentially volunteer groups that are sponsored.

621
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:29,940
FEMA dishes out the funds to local counties and municipalities that then form a voluntary CERT team,

622
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:35,490
where these are people who live in the community and work and they probably have regular day jobs.

623
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:42,100
They may be, you know, the pastor, the EMT, the mortician, a teacher.

624
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:51,810
Right. And they are trained on fire safety, light search and rescue, disaster medical operations, some terrorism aspects, and then psychology.

625
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:58,890
So when they they assist when professional responders are not immediately available to help.

626
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:06,390
So when we talked about like the different levels of response at the beginning of the class, like local response, state response,

627
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:13,650
federal response, they're essentially the mutual aid when the local responders are busy or tied up with something else.

628
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:24,090
And the benefit of having a cert is that they, like the rest of emergency response teams, have an incident command system.

629
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:28,080
They are allowed to self deploy and self of that activate.

630
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:35,219
So they don't have to wait for anybody. So just say like your neighborhood in particular has like a carbon monoxide poisoning

631
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:40,760
issue or there is an ammonia tank on a cornfield in Nebraska that exploded.

632
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:47,010
Right. The cert can self deploy themselves and because they are folks who live in that neighborhood,

633
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:52,080
in that community, they already have inherent trust built with the folks.

634
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,500
They already know them. They know what resources are available.

635
01:09:55,710 --> 01:10:04,230
So it's literally like boots on the ground. So in this photo, here is Tallahassee, Florida in 2008.

636
01:10:04,590 --> 01:10:15,630
And you can see the certs in particular providing door to door information on flooding for those affected by Tropical Storm Fay.

637
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:24,270
So, you know, also they're like, yes, racially, ethnically concordant with the neighborhood as well.

638
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:27,660
Yes. The center is mostly volunteer.

639
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:33,120
Did they receive funding for things like PPE or any type of equipment that they would?

640
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:39,420
Yes. Yes, from FEMA. So like when it's time to go there, there are trainings that they have to do.

641
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:49,440
So like the mandatory like have to do like a like a mental health psychology training and like continuing education that's all funded.

642
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:54,959
Like if they need to like travel to like a local state site to do that, that's all funded.

643
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,230
They're there in and resources are all funded as well.

644
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:03,059
Yeah. So they have, like I said, an incident commander,

645
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:10,680
fire suppression safety officer who does dispatch people who can do medical triage and then again, search and rescue.

646
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:17,969
So I have a short video to show you just in case you're nauseous of blood.

647
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:23,430
There's fake blood in this simulation. So just let's see what commercial.

648
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:27,750
I'll get the commercial. Okay. All right.

649
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:37,200
So this is a 2018 operational cert exercise from City of Ukiah.

650
01:11:37,650 --> 01:12:01,470
You go up. I'm not saying they're. Music like the music.

651
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:43,750
I was the incident commander. Okay.

652
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:49,250
I think you get the idea. How did you do those kinds of things for fast?

653
01:13:49,920 --> 01:14:00,709
Yeah. You know, when I was on the Student Emergency Response Team at Nebraska, we didn't have full scale exercises like that.

654
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:05,480
For one, we used stuffed teddy bear. I was like, This is very different.

655
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:07,430
They like lifting up a person.

656
01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:15,170
But then, you know, when we do the anthrax simulations that were like county wide, that was like more representative of real life.

657
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:19,760
That was one of the few videos that I could find where there was actually videos,

658
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:25,940
because a lot of certain teams, they just did it like a slide show of pictures with music, essentially.

659
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:32,959
But essentially, the interdisciplinary teams that we find in general emergency response program managers,

660
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:41,480
medical building owners and facility managers. I played such a huge part in this because they actually know what the layout of the building is.

661
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:48,890
Special weapons and tactics, security officers, security analysts, hazard materials response,

662
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:54,260
firefighting, joint terrorism task force and then much, much more.

663
01:14:56,060 --> 01:15:04,580
So best practices for the teams. Obviously, we want to focus on all of these things here, but they don't necessarily have been.

664
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:17,090
So these photos in particular of a training exercise that we did with Omaha Fire Department in 2017, this was a two day operations level training.

665
01:15:17,450 --> 01:15:26,659
So here you can see Dr. Lowe there with OSD, where we spent essentially one day in the classroom doing scenario based and tabletop exercises.

666
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:33,640
So reintroducing the foundations of the principles of infectious disease, respiratory protection, PPE.

667
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:40,070
And then the second day was didactic training and hands on skills practice where these are my photos.

668
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:45,970
So that's why I don't have to caption them. But they practice essentially lining the back of the ambulance cabin.

669
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:52,940
How fast could they do it? How fast? Because they properly cut out the plastic sheeting and like seal all the seams with duct tape.

670
01:15:53,540 --> 01:16:04,340
And then once they got all of that set up, get in the PPE, Don, doff, Don, take down all the sheeting and then doff, how long does that actually take?

671
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:11,630
And then afterwards, we kind of do like a hot wash, a debrief to talk about what went well and then what went wrong.

672
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:17,210
Team building in particular. Some people have different stances about this.

673
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:26,210
I think it's really important to build rapport, especially with people who their lives are literally going to be in your hands.

674
01:16:26,810 --> 01:16:31,930
But some people are very anti team building, which I got that in certain settings, right?

675
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:38,900
Like if you work at an office, you might just want to go do your job, collect your paycheck and go home, right?

676
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:46,070
But in particular, with these types of interprofessional emergency response teams, it is so critical.

677
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:49,579
Even if you don't like someone, trust them enough.

678
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:53,720
Do you trust them enough to put your your life in their little hands?

679
01:16:54,680 --> 01:17:02,840
And then like we talked about the hot wash, this allows for continuous improvement and is a form of what we call process and outcomes evaluation.

680
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:16,700
Other important characteristics is personal rewards, whether that be tangible like money or compensation, not a pizza party, right.

681
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:27,229
And appropriate skills mix. So like Ian was talking about at the Kentucky Response, only one epidemiologist there and then a supportive team,

682
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:30,410
climate and safety culture, which is like a whole other class.

683
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:43,310
Maybe we'll do this big pairs share if we have time after Dr. Hurston's lecture, but we're getting to the end here, so I will stop there for today.

684
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:51,170
Based on completing the lecture, you should be able to successfully finish quiz three by tomorrow night.

685
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:59,389
Just remember Thursday we'll meet on Zoom and then Sunday you'll turn in your outline for your commentary.

686
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:05,330
I saw one person turn it in. So far I haven't looked at it yet though, because I just grade in batches, so.

687
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:10,250
All right. Thank you, everybody. I will see you on Zoom Thursday.
