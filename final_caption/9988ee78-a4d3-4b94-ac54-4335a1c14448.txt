00:00:14,578 --> 00:00:16,815
Hello, I'm Kate Bauer.

3
00:00:16,815 --> 00:00:20,524
I'm an epidemiologist whose program
of research focuses on social and

4
00:00:20,524 --> 00:00:23,008
behavioral determines
of childhood obesity.

5
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:24,783
For this portion of the course,

6
00:00:24,783 --> 00:00:29,453
I'm going to be giving you an introduction
to the topic of obesity and highlight some

7
00:00:29,453 --> 00:00:34,520
public health approaches that we have
been trying to stem this epidemic.

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,430
I'd like to start by defining obesity for
you.

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,881
Ultimately, obesity, or
whether a person is obese,

10
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:45,107
is defined by an excess of adiposity,
or body fat,

11
00:00:45,107 --> 00:00:49,250
and the negative effects of that
excess body fat on their health.

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,471
However, a problem in public health is
that its actually very difficult to

13
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:57,790
measure, on an individual basis,
a person's amount of body fat.

14
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:04,130
So we use a proxy measure of body fat
known as body mass index, or BMI.

15
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:08,320
So BMI is a ratio of
an individual's weight to height.

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,412
You can take their weight, in kilograms,
and divide it by their height,

17
00:01:13,412 --> 00:01:17,045
in meters squared, and
end up with a person's BMI.

18
00:01:17,045 --> 00:01:21,776
So for adults to identify obesity,
we can take their BMI and

19
00:01:21,776 --> 00:01:26,120
see where it falls within
a number of categories.

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:31,210
So individuals are underweight
if their BMI is under 18.5.

21
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:35,240
They're considered normal weight if
their BMI is in between 18.5 and 25.

22
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,380
They're considered overweight if
their BMI is in between 25 and 30.

23
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,860
And considered obese if
their BMI is above 30.

24
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,140
So when we talk about
obesity among adults,

25
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,400
we're really referring to individuals
who have a BMI of over 30.

26
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,410
So while we use BMI to
identify obesity among adults,

27
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,140
it's a different story among children.

28
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,820
We can't use their absolute BMI to
identify whether a child's obese or

29
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,960
not because we don't expect children
to grow in a linear fashion.

30
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,880
Children go through periods where they're
heavier, and they go through periods where

31
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,470
they're leaner, and
that's developmentally appropriate.

32
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,740
And we need to account for that when
we're identifying obesity among children.

33
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,240
So, what we use to identify obesity
among children are growth charts.

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,043
And these are gender-specific, so
there are different growth charts for

35
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:27,090
boys versus girls, because boys versus
girls grow differently during childhood.

36
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,082
So what we do with our growth charts,
is we can plot a child's BMI and

37
00:02:32,082 --> 00:02:34,193
identify a BMI percentile.

38
00:02:34,193 --> 00:02:38,838
So how the child's BMI relates to
other children of their same sex and

39
00:02:38,838 --> 00:02:40,290
their same age.

40
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,910
And from there, we can identify whether
a child is growing healthfully or

41
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,532
whether there's some concern
about that child's growth.

42
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:49,240
I wanna point out two things
about these growth charts

43
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,010
that are important to consider.

44
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:51,681
The first,

45
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:56,050
is the period in the growth chart where
you can see the bold line dips a little.

46
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,660
That's a period of growth
called adiposity rebound.

47
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,250
It's the point in childhood where we
expect the children are their leanest.

48
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,390
It usually occurs around ages four or
five.

49
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,655
The second point I want to point out,
is especially on the girls' BMI chart,

50
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:14,461
where there's a bit of a curve in
the chart around the teenage years,

51
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,126
this is when puberty occurs.

52
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:20,701
We expect during puberty that, especially
among girls, they're gaining fat mass, so

53
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,930
the growth chart are count for that.

54
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,880
It's okay to be a little heavier,
it's expected and healthy.

55
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,747
It's important to recognized for
adolescence, that this kind of growth and

56
00:03:30,747 --> 00:03:33,610
this kind of fat accumulation
is natural and important.

57
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,254
And that's something we often try to
communicate to families when we're working

58
00:03:37,254 --> 00:03:38,550
one on one with them.

59
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,294
That this is not a period where
girls are becoming obese and

60
00:03:41,294 --> 00:03:42,980
there's a great cause of concern.

61
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,748
It's really the natural development
as they're reaching reproductive age.

62
00:03:48,748 --> 00:03:51,960
So I wanna spend a minute talking
with you about what we've

63
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,770
seen in trends in both adults and
child obesity over the past few decades.

64
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,088
I'm sure many of you have heard that we
are in a period of epidemic obesity and

65
00:04:01,088 --> 00:04:05,017
our obesity prevalence has risen
greatly over the past two decades.

66
00:04:05,017 --> 00:04:09,975
So looking at this figure, we can see
how the prevalence of adult obesity has

67
00:04:09,975 --> 00:04:13,340
changed over the past several decades.

68
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,080
This figure, in particular, shows us
the prevalence of overweight among adults,

69
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,830
obesity among adults, and
a new category of obesity among adults,

70
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,340
which is extreme obesity,
or a BMI above 40.

71
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,600
And what we can see,

72
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,380
if we look at the patterns in both men and
women, is that the prevalence

73
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,740
of overweight has actually remained
fairly stable over the past few decades.

74
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,530
Where we're seeing our large
increases in prevalence

75
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,060
are in the category of obese adults and
adults with extreme obesity.

76
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,040
So what's happening is
not just that everyone

77
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,080
has been gaining a few pounds
over the past few decades, but

78
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,910
we're really getting extension
at the tail end of our curve.

79
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,370
The heavy individuals
are becoming even heavier, and

80
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,830
this is especially concerning,

81
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:03,230
if we think about the health consequences
of this high weight and extreme obesity.

82
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,010
The picture looks similar in children,

83
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,520
if we look at the trends
in childhood obesity.

84
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,601
This figure is laid out a little
differently than our adult obesity figure.

85
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:15,685
In this one, we are just looking at the
prevalence of obesity among children over

86
00:05:15,685 --> 00:05:19,740
the past several decades and
it's broken out by children's age.

87
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,126
So among all age groups
through the 1980s and

88
00:05:24,126 --> 00:05:27,555
90s, we saw that increases in
the prevalence of obesity.

89
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:31,695
In the past several years, however, it's
interesting to notice that obesity in our

90
00:05:31,695 --> 00:05:35,915
youngest children, our two to five
year olds, seems to have gone down.

91
00:05:35,915 --> 00:05:40,150
And when this happened, it received quite
a deal of media tension and excitement.

92
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,490
Unfortunately, it seemed this
maybe it has been a blip and

93
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:49,902
we've actually still only stabilized
among our preschool aged children.

94
00:05:49,902 --> 00:05:53,408
I wanna, briefly, also point out,
that the prevalence

95
00:05:53,408 --> 00:05:57,807
of childhood obesity varies quite a bit,
especially by racial group.

96
00:05:57,807 --> 00:06:01,987
So fortunately, over the past several
years, we've actually seen a plateau in

97
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:06,730
the prevalence of childhood obesity among
our non Hispanic weight populations.

98
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:11,920
Unfortunately, obesity prevalence
among non Hispanic black children and

99
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,590
Hispanic children, continues to increase.

100
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:19,560
And so what's happening, is that we
have an incredible growing disparity

101
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,280
in obesity prevalence between our
white and our minority children.

102
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,700
And childhood obesity is increasingly
becoming a disease outcome

103
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,090
that's heavily burdening our
minority populations within the US.

104
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:38,480
So to summarize, obesity is a disease
characterized by excess adiposity.

105
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,590
We can identify obesity among
individuals by calculating their BMI, or

106
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,460
BMI percentile.

107
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,653
Obesity has increased quite a bit
over the past several decades, and

108
00:06:48,653 --> 00:06:54,997
most recently we've seen disparities
in obesity widen quite a bit.
