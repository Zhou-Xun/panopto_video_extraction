1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:13,320
thanks Lee for the nice introduction. hello everyone. thank you for your life.

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,080
here is nice great package to please in my work here. so I'd home I

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,200
might make approach to the genetics of the complex easy.

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,420
so here's all I to talk. I'll have a little

5
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,960
introduction on myself. and I will give him a little view also let you know why the association

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,160
studies. we use visual efforts in the last fourteen

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,720
days after that. I'll call about to Saturday the first Saturday.

8
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,780
I'm going to Green Jean expression date to try to help in this

9
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,619
functional implication. I've been fighting to receive a very Ending this is.

10
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:02,939
I'm going to bring my solution to eight hundred two two five two. due to breach between environmental

11
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:08,139
factors and easy. I'll call and touch briefly about

12
00:01:08,139 --> 00:01:13,499
the future work. okay. so it's a little

13
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:18,819
information about myself. I stop by my store and studies and PhD

14
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:23,999
in psychology from the University of Michigan. so really I already introduced.

15
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:29,259
I started the mechanism of cocaine addiction. I got time. I realized

16
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:34,719
a new patient and will work. I also realized that United States Fortune

17
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:40,719
Realty. okay. because not all the people have the same moral ability to cocaine

18
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,899
and I think in into seating population genetics and have a great phone to

19
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,159
have join Doctor Carter this needs group to start working

20
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,161
field fifteenth two thousand nine. so over the last nine years

21
00:01:56,161 --> 00:02:01,601
we have found lots a of exciting and interesting work today. I'm going to show

22
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:06,761
some of to work with you here. so for the key home.

23
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:11,881
and also need know which and. when we talk about tonight. I

24
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:18,301
was also single news on multi zone

25
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:23,981
in the population. we send some people to participate

26
00:02:23,981 --> 00:02:29,421
in some people okay. this is this

27
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:34,841
one year this. is not next week shows very patient

28
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:40,281
and business. so in two thousand

29
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:45,381
dollars a breaks. you have you know rates have knowledge. which allow us to

30
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:50,521
measure media results. you know that you know how in

31
00:02:50,521 --> 00:03:01,033
the low side. I'd very rather low. and if you need

32
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:06,033
this is Lisa Ren. Theresa Olson. I'm correlated with each

33
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:11,553
other. so I'll need you don't. bye.

34
00:03:11,553 --> 00:03:16,833
we had new with high quality service

35
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:21,893
reference. I know we actually been all missing

36
00:03:21,893 --> 00:03:26,933
parts. so once measure one from

37
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:32,853
you. we could get a convenience and if we doing to cases.

38
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:37,973
my from Eugene residence. so we this so much.

39
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:42,993
date. the original policy is approach is not working any more.

40
00:03:42,993 --> 00:03:48,013
we need you not to force. we need to ask you

41
00:03:48,013 --> 00:03:53,113
know why the association. so that you know what association study to

42
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:59,841
clean the whole deal. the search phones aren't that are associated with I'll come

43
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:05,141
by the time for Westfield High. I have a meeting

44
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:10,381
with one question. four one three five time. repeating

45
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:16,001
this evening and look on there so sweet. we

46
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:22,461
so many testing. we have to try very strange and if she got cut off.

47
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:27,661
in this case. the original one single society

48
00:04:27,661 --> 00:04:32,681
would not have enough. Holler at you sexy text you a signal. so she was also

49
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:37,701
conducted. you know last week you asked for it. we called the consumer. so

50
00:04:37,701 --> 00:04:43,241
this is that you hard time. each hopeless we will contact you one

51
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:48,681
final time. okay and she said you to call me. bye. and course

52
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:53,961
welcome to show the same brand the model that

53
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:59,161
we we all summer set if you could touch base. sent I

54
00:04:59,161 --> 00:05:05,001
Carol central place and they will not. I don't need

55
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:10,141
that past you asking Ethan. whether you have it for

56
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:16,661
to the reputation stage. I need the reputation state. they will be tested independent.

57
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:21,941
so if this is was significant he discovered in his truck to

58
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:28,461
take it. you called and I will send.

59
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:34,201
I have a great. I don't know if you have refused then and connect you as many

60
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:39,341
showing here. it's essential that you're not. I'll let you know. bye-bye office

61
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:45,401
and the health of your children. and I also have an idea

62
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:51,041
of around from the traditional cardiovascular

63
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:56,201
disease disease diabetes. she will some psychological treatment.

64
00:05:56,201 --> 00:06:01,241
have any questions. also on Saturday. no

65
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:06,303
alcohol you this is

66
00:06:06,303 --> 00:06:11,463
Mini International Consortium. having car trouble. especially

67
00:06:11,463 --> 00:06:16,603
in corpus Lockhart I'm taking the search engine technology charge

68
00:06:16,603 --> 00:06:23,123
consortium and it was accomplished. there are many working groups. each focusing

69
00:06:23,123 --> 00:06:28,143
even I'll come.

70
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:33,543
so all of those effort has been very successful and we have found a lot of genetic

71
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:41,477
risk various floor floor at field Street. and publish a lot of papers

72
00:06:41,477 --> 00:06:47,217
p.m. I can show you the big achievement. we've made over the last ten years. so

73
00:06:47,217 --> 00:06:52,237
in two thousand and seven. the first. she was on p.m.

74
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:57,657
I was contacting him about forty thousand in. the only form one single Jean.

75
00:06:57,657 --> 00:07:02,717
that's associated with PMI veggies. the other most strong signal can only hold off

76
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:08,137
or names you originally in two thousand eighteen. we increase

77
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:13,157
the seven size to seven hundred thousand. and we saw almost a thousand

78
00:07:13,157 --> 00:07:19,197
the low side. associate you with.

79
00:07:19,197 --> 00:07:25,057
so here's a little summary. once we have loan from two so far from us as

80
00:07:25,057 --> 00:07:30,437
soon as you walk because many trees up on June eighth. with many various

81
00:07:30,437 --> 00:07:35,697
countries you converts voice back. so well the current

82
00:07:35,697 --> 00:07:41,336
effort is to see increase the sample size

83
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:46,796
and many the is and twenty five. I know I'm holding region which is Jack.

84
00:07:46,796 --> 00:07:51,816
Coleman this is Marisol result from changing. congratulations. right now there

85
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:57,996
is a loss of athletics going on trying to understand the functional skills and by

86
00:07:57,996 --> 00:08:03,296
using the Kaiser policy. talk I'll about that later.

87
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:08,516
and also they're originating among different happiness.

88
00:08:08,516 --> 00:08:13,536
so so far most of that last. I predominantly contacted on your payment

89
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:18,756
history. when we use the old and actually seven twenty five

90
00:08:18,756 --> 00:08:24,156
from US last to predict the Saint Paul. team not sure if you.

91
00:08:24,156 --> 00:08:29,516
they do not perform well. so another important

92
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:34,956
effort. this will food and many ninety nine European Street.

93
00:08:34,956 --> 00:08:40,972
thank you. bye

94
00:08:40,972 --> 00:08:47,592
so even though we have the phone on so many messages concerning Sheila.

95
00:08:47,592 --> 00:08:52,952
this is really just the beginning of June. because so functional implications

96
00:08:52,952 --> 00:08:58,392
those generous desire. I know we don't know what the two functional.

97
00:08:58,392 --> 00:09:05,212
well holiday I'll connect you to the screen. I'll call

98
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:10,532
one way to pass the problem is. two eight seven.

99
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:15,692
immediate need logical function. those. we go back

100
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:21,892
to allergy. so once again eight one check.

101
00:09:21,892 --> 00:09:27,612
you need to call Doctor is my.

102
00:09:27,612 --> 00:09:33,012
so. so my caller rate have knowledge. also the last to measure.

103
00:09:33,012 --> 00:09:38,156
you know March transcript. so we can try to you back later

104
00:09:38,156 --> 00:09:43,896
you fax me some of those transit. one thing I want to point out also is

105
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:49,096
see you later excluding the weekend and I'm calling to call you wish call. ask

106
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:55,496
him. so call and we go to

107
00:09:55,496 --> 00:10:00,916
the same Jean. you can have a different combination of those ask. we spoke to a few

108
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:06,276
different versions of the same sheet work for him. so once.

109
00:10:06,276 --> 00:10:11,276
I think the car.. know you most of thirty thousand.

110
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:23,236
however what we talked about. it could be more than two hundred thousand something.

111
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:28,836
so now I'm going to call a legal studies.

112
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:33,976
we did already through just use as an example to you straight. how usage and

113
00:10:33,976 --> 00:10:39,040
expression date how to understand the functional

114
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:45,080
so the outcome changes of here. so call me area actually Health Education.

115
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:50,540
this is a pre- screen for my call. so call me back to me please and indicate

116
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:55,720
the amount of the place field within the worth of the car actually

117
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,360
wasn't called. I feel grocery and

118
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,480
health education. Andy twenty five five. thank you again.

119
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:14,120
so he doesn't yet. there was a paper

120
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,480
copy. please reach contact. she was on this car actually ready

121
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,520
counts vacations about ten thousand individuals in the

122
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:31,860
lowest part. so so see this year.

123
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,020
showed the association about all this and it across

124
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:42,724
that you know just called that's so

125
00:11:42,724 --> 00:11:47,744
that's how we usually present that you results. so

126
00:11:47,744 --> 00:11:53,144
ask after is John Thompson location. you just need on the white accesses.

127
00:11:53,144 --> 00:11:58,904
so ask you. talk to you about voice. as you can see

128
00:11:58,904 --> 00:12:04,764
there was a very strong signal on the problems on that two twenty one region.

129
00:12:04,764 --> 00:12:12,184
and this is notice that bus. however

130
00:12:12,184 --> 00:12:17,784
we don't know what's functionally in the

131
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:22,804
next and current. so the goal of this

132
00:12:22,804 --> 00:12:28,064
study is week is done. the association of those bricks and the transcript

133
00:12:28,064 --> 00:12:33,284
the cost that you know and hopefully to get a sense inside.

134
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:39,318
I'll see you next

135
00:12:39,318 --> 00:12:44,358
call Corporation. Jeanette asked me Regina. to talk to

136
00:12:44,358 --> 00:12:49,538
your prophecy. so this is. have a tendency call for David

137
00:12:49,538 --> 00:12:54,978
Cruz. if she's with him. what and two individual four thousand

138
00:12:54,978 --> 00:13:00,218
extension two four eight two six. so seventy percent. talk to you soon.

139
00:13:00,218 --> 00:13:05,238
have test a have a change in the baseline. so for this Saturday I

140
00:13:05,238 --> 00:13:10,378
use about eight hundred European American who has sold. you know what type data.

141
00:13:10,378 --> 00:13:15,420
Jean question this is. happy

142
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,463
Black. using the mathematics the rate well I see noon already

143
00:13:20,463 --> 00:13:26,083
and both of them what you do to the one seventeen reference.

144
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:31,783
energy question. was collected from simple my from the transform.

145
00:13:31,783 --> 00:13:36,823
they have been processed and ready when you see the message

146
00:13:36,823 --> 00:13:42,043
to and one point rate. one. zero rate and which measure

147
00:13:42,043 --> 00:13:47,743
check with reliable Jean expression date.

148
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:54,863
so wanna talk about needs Jean on fashion.

149
00:13:54,863 --> 00:14:00,283
your search is right next to the Smith. we called the cc

150
00:14:00,283 --> 00:14:05,323
which is a local effect. called about a change

151
00:14:05,323 --> 00:14:10,403
as far away from this. we called to fax. so if

152
00:14:10,403 --> 00:14:19,042

00:16:51,963 --> 00:16:57,883
six five six one nine. shown we up.

179
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:03,062
and also another seizure. I just thought to call

180
00:17:03,062 --> 00:17:08,262
you. bye. correlation between me and. so there

181
00:17:08,262 --> 00:17:17,343
are many zero

182
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:23,062
and the flock on the it's Joan. so sweet so between this

183
00:17:23,062 --> 00:17:28,763
Hoffman. and this translates. as you can see eight Julio Levy. please

184
00:17:28,763 --> 00:17:35,663
press two. this is Jean. so we know

185
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:41,043
it's. this is your dad. she's actually not. this is not recording.

186
00:17:41,043 --> 00:17:46,283
nine seventy eight. it doesn't have for him for job. so we still

187
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:51,403
don't know the exact function. this is Jean. however

188
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:57,123
this population has been graphics and this else.

189
00:17:57,123 --> 00:18:02,163
GE is up there. our parking lot. that also experiment.

190
00:18:02,163 --> 00:18:09,703
I'm going out to try to understand the function for

191
00:18:09,703 --> 00:18:14,803
that. also the back gate or the check second of this Vision.

192
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:19,803
we always look at HSA fact is what you had because

193
00:18:19,803 --> 00:18:24,803
Melody Sarah with thirty five thousand. and now we

194
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:30,283
have one hundred eighty. we do association. one

195
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:35,583
season one time. this will be the number of test we have to contact

196
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:41,303
in business for only correct if you value. so we really have no power

197
00:18:41,303 --> 00:18:48,843
to the seasonal hold you know scale.

198
00:18:48,843 --> 00:18:54,543
so we took another approach. we need space.

199
00:18:54,543 --> 00:18:59,743
we need to Jean. so we tried to

200
00:18:59,743 --> 00:19:05,963
look at the old release back. this one hundred eighty

201
00:19:05,963 --> 00:19:12,083
one. the time. so this will reduce the number of test is

202
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:17,503
manageable. scale so that we have enough power to the Texas.

203
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:22,583
so we we use statement. know don't I. so she

204
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:27,723
just called. so the traditional way. well we talked

205
00:19:27,723 --> 00:19:33,183
about. this message.

206
00:19:33,183 --> 00:19:38,863
you should use one is successful one.

207
00:19:38,863 --> 00:19:43,919
we have one hundred and eight. we have to contact one hundred eight.

208
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,519
as of now classes is one eight hundred eight one two eight.

209
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:55,015
thank you zero that's enough. I mean this Catherine

210
00:19:55,015 --> 00:20:00,153
Rainwater. work we assume you straight hospital follow which

211
00:20:00,153 --> 00:20:05,293
means zero and very. so instead of testing each

212
00:20:05,293 --> 00:20:11,613
day at eight four two zero. we're testing Weathers of the Arizona State House. the whole

213
00:20:11,613 --> 00:20:18,773
TV from there. thanks. have Thomas's testing. Catherine

214
00:20:18,773 --> 00:20:25,153
another feature. this weekend sign up in the wait each.

215
00:20:25,153 --> 00:20:30,593
please have hot. so we probably rather have large effect.

216
00:20:30,593 --> 00:20:37,413
we can be. I'll wait.

217
00:20:37,413 --> 00:20:42,833
so we did this analysis cross the whole channel.

218
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:48,033
and we do this two way. one two three. you call late.

219
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:53,293
all with all the other ways. we

220
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:58,693
gradually real bad. so by doing this test. thank you. bye

221
00:20:58,693 --> 00:21:03,753
jeans that are associated with this week. I wanted to point

222

227
00:21:30,693 --> 00:21:37,093
so it's gonna take lesion.

228
00:21:37,093 --> 00:21:42,293
so this is kind of a summary the end of this

229
00:21:42,293 --> 00:21:47,313
first part. the completion of this part is. was I calling to see what

232
00:21:57,853 --> 00:22:03,153
ball this is the College of Education. your call

233
00:22:03,153 --> 00:22:08,953
was needed. and also functional validation team animal studies and models.

234
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:14,713
it's key next day.

235
00:22:14,713 --> 00:22:19,873
so I had talked about previous primary

236
00:22:19,873 --> 00:22:25,893
on June know. so we won't know that. on top of the church in that

237
00:22:25,893 --> 00:22:31,533
environment. also please and important role in the development.

238
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:36,693
it's a long environment. as you know

239
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:43,033
after genetics. this is a message from kind off

240
00:22:43,033 --> 00:22:48,133
cheese ration without changing the sequence. and I think you if know you

241
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:53,373
was you friends both site you know and environmental factors.

242
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:58,373
show me show as a mechanism patient. and again eight

243
00:22:58,373 --> 00:23:05,573
isolation. so today I'm going to talk about game actually.

244
00:23:05,573 --> 00:23:11,113
so again it's Alicia. I need the electrician on the master group

245
00:23:11,113 --> 00:23:16,253
to the cc on the DNA sequel and only

246
00:23:16,253 --> 00:23:21,973
congress. space CD sequence. so we also called CPG side.

247
00:23:21,973 --> 00:23:28,113
this message. sorry. so

248
00:23:28,113 --> 00:23:33,893
let me know about those false assumption the message.

249
00:23:33,893 --> 00:23:38,993
as a promoter we usually use the promo. I'm sorry. if

250
00:23:38,993 --> 00:23:44,973
you ask to you later. bye. bye. oh movie was actually

251
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:50,453
open shot ration. however the installation

252
00:23:50,453 --> 00:23:55,793
as the functional restoration. reaching out to you.

253
00:23:55,793 --> 00:24:02,646
we don't know if this all off. Jesus Christ

254
00:24:02,646 --> 00:24:07,746
so Sally I'm going to investigate the camera to the fact

255
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:13,366
also of cycle social status in the message. actually listen.

256
00:24:13,366 --> 00:24:18,546
we have a lot of zeros on Saturday to look at all social

257
00:24:18,546 --> 00:24:23,746
environment. the fact is the same escalation that today. so project

258
00:24:23,746 --> 00:24:28,926
is focusing on social economic seven and this is on property State House is

259
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:34,026
still working progress. the rational for this

260
00:24:34,026 --> 00:24:39,026
Saturday is social economic status. this six seven eight

261
00:24:39,026 --> 00:24:44,606
two related to chronic disease including a back up ECT diabetes and cardiovascular

262
00:24:44,606 --> 00:24:50,426
disease and studies have found that helpful.

263
00:24:50,426 --> 00:24:56,086
and all adult. social economic status. associated with application

264
00:24:56,086 --> 00:25:01,253
measurement and isolation. second this. global has an isolation

265
00:25:01,253 --> 00:25:07,073
with Global. have an nice and also you know earlier on Saturday.

266
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:12,233
we use encourage GM approach to expand our association

267
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:17,373
teaching the social economic status. with the select G Jackson

268
00:25:17,373 --> 00:25:22,793
new response possibly in phone the absence. of association.

269
00:25:22,793 --> 00:25:27,893
so based on this. the goal was two and five is the end ceiling

270
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:33,493
restoration size across regional associate which help with attendance all.

271
00:25:33,493 --> 00:25:38,933
yes. so this is the status on

272
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:43,933
you. it's Mike. I think Saturday afternoon. it's a

273
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:49,193
population based on choosing a call back. they

274
00:25:49,193 --> 00:25:54,413
have they have flash. I think it's Hispanic

275
00:25:54,413 --> 00:25:59,573
European American African American and

276
00:25:59,573 --> 00:26:05,333
and they cracked eight six zero seven and eight weeks and every two years.

277
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:10,813
so to Saturday. I'm going to use. has about hundred people.

278
00:26:10,813 --> 00:26:18,933
who had an installation date. measure seven eight five.

279
00:26:18,933 --> 00:26:24,333
so so social economic management. I'm calling for

280
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:29,573
Chelsea Susan on Saturday. I'm going to use much education. this

281
00:26:29,573 --> 00:26:34,613
was selected because that is has phone back. call later. well

282
00:26:34,613 --> 00:26:39,654
hello hello and we called you doing last. I just to see if we

283
00:26:39,654 --> 00:26:45,674
were great and yet. we use

284
00:26:45,674 --> 00:26:52,414
College Street and College with some college education.

285
00:26:52,414 --> 00:27:00,334
here's the scoop. that is the option

286
00:27:00,334 --> 00:27:05,734
to attend. there is no Chinese

287
00:27:05,734 --> 00:27:11,194
licenses in mountains and he said.

288
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:16,954
okay. so see in and she said was imagine

289
00:27:16,954 --> 00:27:23,094
shoes by the mono side and installation date. imagine losing

290
00:27:23,094 --> 00:27:28,294
a solution this. she has for more than four hundred

291
00:27:28,294 --> 00:27:33,374
fifty thousand. if you decide. we applied a very rigorous to study.

292
00:27:33,374 --> 00:27:41,249
so and only one hundred twenty dollars and see if you decide

293
00:27:41,249 --> 00:27:50,409
that she's precious. also trash will update have.

294
00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:55,889
so we modeled the escalation site

295
00:27:55,889 --> 00:28:01,029
as a function also social economic status. bye. is

296
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:06,349
call back. eight. Ginger. Michelle it's Missy.

297
00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:12,089
ninety bye. so we connected sooner. both their of

298
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:17,129
social economic status. we. we have to contact.

299
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:22,229
one hundred twenty models twenty thousand. and only

300
00:28:22,229 --> 00:28:27,549
applies for seats relate collection. at this discovery later.

301
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:33,089
blessings. bye. is there no funds in Ethan's in isolation

302
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:38,711
site. associates social economics Lisa. seven

303
00:28:38,711 --> 00:28:46,471
eight seven. the escalation. associated with all social and

304
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:52,071
this table shows this seven. very interesting

305
00:28:52,071 --> 00:28:57,091
see. my number is seven five two.

306
00:28:57,091 --> 00:29:02,251
I from the same G S three. and I when

307
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:07,451
look this up Jean. it's very interested. this Jean. say unfortunately

308
00:29:07,451 --> 00:29:14,251
no have a rental beast. so the next

309
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:19,591
whether escalation level two CPG side mediate

310
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:26,011
that use S PMI.

311
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:31,911
so I contacted a mediation on that. so

312
00:29:31,911 --> 00:29:37,001
the mediation that is we tried to use the parts.

313
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:42,441
fact all social economic status is on the nine two two components. one

314
00:29:42,441 --> 00:29:47,601
is directly that fax at Independent Hill. if you do you said the other

315
00:29:47,601 --> 00:29:52,701
is incorrect with. which happens to this. if you that. so by

316
00:29:52,701 --> 00:29:58,801
using any of question model. we can get estimate on those

317
00:29:58,801 --> 00:30:03,981
and so. this is a test we

318
00:30:03,981 --> 00:30:10,781
conducted. and this is proportion that was mediate. we choose.

319
00:30:10,781 --> 00:30:16,021
thank you actually set up a portion of the totally sack in the back

320
00:30:16,021 --> 00:30:21,641
piece. and then we use for strap. to schedule confidence

321
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:28,301
interval and if you buy. and this

322
00:30:28,301 --> 00:30:33,773
supposed to have posses that both if see you did not mediate

323
00:30:33,773 --> 00:30:40,193
the use active social economic status. line.

324
00:30:40,193 --> 00:30:45,393
so it's Tasha. forgot I

325
00:30:45,393 --> 00:30:50,673
to bring this Jean. in this day has said there's only

326
00:30:50,673 --> 00:30:55,853
one sensors for this Jean. last ring back. I pulled all

327
00:30:55,853 --> 00:31:01,053
this together. this is one of the local social

328
00:31:01,053 --> 00:31:06,853
economic status. is associated with decrease the in isolation.

329
00:31:06,853 --> 00:31:12,293
this is Jean. and this is Chris. the escalation is associated with increased

330
00:31:12,293 --> 00:31:17,513
transcript. that will change the impression that this is Jean. and this includes

331
00:31:17,513 --> 00:31:22,593
transcript is associated with higher PMI and all. this is

332
00:31:22,593 --> 00:31:27,713
kinda consistent with lots information about this. Jean. actually

333
00:31:27,713 --> 00:31:32,935
this GE is involved in additional and black insulin signaling

334
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:37,955
old expression. this Jesus associated with increased

335
00:31:37,955 --> 00:31:43,215
insulin resistance. and the reduce energy expenditure and increase

336
00:31:43,215 --> 00:31:49,335
in. so the direction will be sacked. what kind of companies.

337
00:31:49,335 --> 00:31:54,475
actually this this is Jean. was. right now there is for Judy Ballard

338
00:31:54,475 --> 00:32:00,375
from City. come County. if this is Jean. she's not happy with this order.

339
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:05,595
so I think that's a better course sorry. very

340
00:32:05,595 --> 00:32:10,695
excited about it. so

341
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:16,515
as I said this is your uncle he asked for. so I'm going to bring

342
00:32:16,515 --> 00:32:21,795
cheese fresh and they have to do an analysis and try to do. to answer any.

343
00:32:21,795 --> 00:32:27,195
rather than jeans and possibly that might be associated with those

344
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:32,695
EMS donation site in the club. looking for applications.

345
00:32:32,695 --> 00:32:38,135
call four two five. to replicate all. bye

346
00:32:38,135 --> 00:32:43,395
okay now I'm going to actually free about official

347
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:49,055
work and country Mutual uses my

348
00:32:49,055 --> 00:32:54,495
approach. two eight two two eight. you know transcript home maximum

349
00:32:54,495 --> 00:32:59,675
as well as environmental factors. to try to understand Jeanette's architectural

350
00:32:59,675 --> 00:33:05,115
so busy. I'll come and help all calm because my background

351

352
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:15,925
so the kind a few functions are all the Rockies. we're asking for this we okay

353
00:33:15,925 --> 00:33:22,305
normal conversation. have need a to decline the matia. I was on the CDs.

354
00:33:22,305 --> 00:33:27,385
so in the next few years. I will focus on this

355
00:33:27,385 --> 00:33:32,845
so many lines with Zach.

356
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:37,885
go see few a projects. you know

357
00:33:37,885 --> 00:33:43,085
what will happen. so

358
00:33:43,085 --> 00:33:48,165
we partial. I shall be a chance call me before proceeding Madison.

359
00:33:48,165 --> 00:33:53,225
you know the sickness and you may have for the top program. this

360
00:33:53,225 --> 00:33:58,805
program has sequence and down one hundred twenty thousand.

361
00:33:58,805 --> 00:34:04,345
and because this is to let you know the secret. it will give the most comprehensive catalog

362
00:34:04,345 --> 00:34:09,365
in your neck of areas. the cost that you know. so the car is ready it's already

363
00:34:09,365 --> 00:34:14,660
have four hundred and six. P mediums three very

364
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:19,800
so we submitted a proposal to Lisa.

365
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,920
you know statement for General Company. general kinda me to

366
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,940
function in this top-notch program. and this proposal has been approved

367
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:35,080
and you know how work. I decided to call to try

368
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:40,760
home myself. another exciting project

369
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:46,320
on the line to to know do eight thirty eight. thank you. this this Saturday

370
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,620
unique because it has very reached kinda make you feel tired. is that your company if you declined

371
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:56,760
you shop may and it's over sixty thousand. India and Pakistan. so

372
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,860
right now we are developing a research proposal to try to stop yet.

373
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:07,340
you know the sequencing the eight hundred seven. so I think this

374
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:12,460
will greatly. in the sending about the time function.

375
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:17,642
I'm very excited about that and also close how

376
00:35:17,642 --> 00:35:22,962
condition it's in France by. the social behavioral factors.

377
00:35:22,962 --> 00:35:28,742
so I'll continue to investigate association. I'm between

378
00:35:28,742 --> 00:35:34,482
social and behavioral risk factors for presentation with

379
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:39,562
an escalation National. we do focus to understand the

380
00:35:39,562 --> 00:35:46,162
role in company to function. so so far I have identified for starters who.

381
00:35:46,162 --> 00:35:51,442
has an both expiration date as well as kinda needy

382
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:56,602
functions and some of them all or this social

383
00:35:56,602 --> 00:36:01,642
and behavioral factors. so as far as I

384
00:36:01,642 --> 00:36:07,322
know at least we'll business ideas also have you know Jean expression date.

385
00:36:07,322 --> 00:36:12,342
so I plan to develop a research proposal to conduct an analysis

386
00:36:12,342 --> 00:36:18,210
in business for at large market I hope this Ann is Dan.

387
