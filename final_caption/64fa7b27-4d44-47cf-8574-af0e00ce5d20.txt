1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:12,270
That's great in terms of just supporting the needs of everyone in the class and a week.

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,930
And if anybody, you know, if people have concerns, just, you know, email me and let me know.

3
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,879
But let's see. Okay. We can get started. Thank you for the name things.

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,600
I will really try to get everybody's name. It is I do with the masks too.

5
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:42,280
So but I think I can kind of have like a sight line to I'm like going like this on the first you guys names and okay, so today we will talk about it.

6
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:49,799
I call this like infant health concerns because I try to do each like new unit with like sort of the basics and do that little video and say like,

7
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,740
here's what infants are like and or early childhood is like. And then I sort of have a like here's some health concerns to consider here.

8
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,579
There are certainly other health, infant health concerns we'll talk about,

9
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,860
but really like in public health and thinking about what we can do on a broad scale for many infants,

10
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:14,280
in addition to all the kind of policy level interventions upstream we've talked about already, vaccinations is like where we can make a huge impact.

11
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:22,500
And it's certainly a really critical issue for thinking about how to work with parents, how to do public health,

12
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,790
you know, communication, education, all of the things that we like to think about in lots of different domains.

13
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,840
It all kind of like comes crashing in around vaccination.

14
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,239
It's certainly become more obviously an issue in in the COVID era.

15
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:47,280
But I also just wanted to point out that this is certainly on everyone's radar that thinks about this stuff earlier.

16
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:57,569
And measles cases, which we'll talk about a few things in that space today had certainly been on the rise and then these spikes in recent years.

17
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:06,240
So people were already certainly alerted. And then COVID has like as with everything kind of layered on an additional set of issues to consider.

18
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:15,659
So and I, I sort of, I feel like this picture like sums up so much, sort of just like I'm wary of wearing a mask.

19
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,959
It's trying to be like cute little cat face, so I'll wear it.

20
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,860
But I don't like this. Like, there's just so much wrapped up in vaccination.

21
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:29,070
And so I'll do a little bit. Hopefully we can kind of get ourselves in sort of parents mindsets too,

22
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:35,490
because I think that there's a lot to consider and there's certainly a lot to consider when we're talking

23
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:41,280
about family and talking about these issues with families and especially at families of young babies who are,

24
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,200
you know, getting most of these vaccinations. Okay.

25
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,040
So we'll talk about infant vaccination under VAX.

26
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:57,840
I think to tell a that like under vaccination is a key public health threat to infant health is the translation there?

27
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:04,620
And I just so I gave you a few different media around like an academic paper,

28
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,420
that radio piece and then the New York Times, which is like all about this, are political beasts.

29
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:16,020
So we'll talk about that. And hopefully people heard some new information in that in that article.

30
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,799
And I know it's it's it's New York Times, but it's kind of dense.

31
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:29,940
So they like cover a lot of ground. And then we'll also talk about the vaccination schedule as well as what kind of what happened in

32
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:36,060
terms of these measles outbreaks and kind of walk through one example of those and think about,

33
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:42,270
again, the policy level by which we can switch up vaccination behavior.

34
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,370
Okay. So first, the unit, those readings,

35
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:59,699
anything that people kind of noted that again would sort of new that that New York Times article in particular like from early fall,

36
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,470
late summer really went through a lot of different topics.

37
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:11,020
And any meant that anyone like learning something new in that that piece they had thought about before,

38
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,310
things they hadn't heard, heard about before, sort of an update of some ongoing drama.

39
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,820
So I guess I would say in the field of vaccination, yeah.

40
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:27,450
Currently I didn't really realize that pediatricians have stuck in the middle between families who are vaccinating their children

41
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:35,640
on time and to delay or let's just not do it altogether in terms of keeping up with their practice is like a public health concern.

42
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,990
It's a concern to the families who are doing the right thing for their kids.

43
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:47,050
But also like. It's a. It's a. Do they have a personal stake?

44
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,550
But also, I did the right thing.

45
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:56,230
It was a lot more complicated relationship the pediatrician and I thought it was going to be, which complicates the whole issue even further.

46
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,180
So. Wow. That was a really good summary of.

47
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,850
Yeah. Like people who are caught in the middle.

48
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:11,190
And if you guys remember like that AP video from day one, it was just like, here are all the amazing things that we're doing and we can do.

49
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:17,519
And a lot of that is like medicine related, right? These sort of amazing, amazing medications that are saving lives.

50
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:24,810
Children are not dying in infancy because of them. And yet, like, here's what we're faced with in our clinic.

51
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,350
And if we say no to those parents, then what? You know, what could happen?

52
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,130
Could they leave and not get care?

53
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:43,590
Thinking about that pediatric medical home idea from last time, you know, how to how to make a pediatric encounter sort of trusting.

54
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:54,000
And, you know, I think that these sort of vaccination pressures, recommendations, mandates can can really place stress on that context.

55
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:00,580
Absolutely. And yeah, I was kind of rereading that article.

56
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:11,390
Yes, that's. What else did people think about or knew this from any any of the concerts really.

57
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,700
And I guess they hadn't really thought about this aspect of.

58
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,240
The angle I agree.

59
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:39,070
And that I it's like if you think about and I you guys can probably tell I spent a lot of time looking around for like images and videos and like,

60
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:45,669
you know, it's very easy to kind of and I think this happens to all of us, probably just you mean,

61
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:49,989
but like you're looking for something and all of a sudden you're like in a world and you're like, what?

62
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,879
What? Where is this information coming from?

63
00:06:51,880 --> 00:07:01,780
Like, it's so easy to be on a site and especially if you're looking at things like vaccination, because as with many controversial topics,

64
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:08,060
it's like the naming of the sites is sound really legit and they sound like, oh, of course this, you know.

65
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,200
Sounds like it's going to give me real information and then you kind of track it back,

66
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,040
which is hard to do, and you try to figure out like, Wait, what is it?

67
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:22,040
So I was I was looking at some videos for today and I was watching one and it was really sort of fascinating.

68
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,450
It was a whole pediatric visit.

69
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:29,629
And then kind of at the end, they came in and talked about, you know, just like alternate vaccination schedules and stuff.

70
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:34,130
And I was like then looking deeper into the website was like, Oh, I think this is not making,

71
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,680
you know, I mean, it's one piece of information that's out there.

72
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,440
So I was actually going to link to it in that further reading so that you guys can also see like it can be really hard.

73
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,089
And that's like for us we were like educated and thinking about this and you know,

74
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,200
in my case, like obsessing on it sometimes and parents just don't have the time to do that.

75
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:57,830
So there's so much around figuring out, you know, again, as with many issues about where the info comes from.

76
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:11,470
So that was an interesting part of it too. I never mentioned that, but like vaccine and like public health in general are all about compliant.

77
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,760
But trying to make people comply with mandates is like doing the opposite.

78
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:31,509
So like, how do we navigate? But giving people choices that they really didn't care about before.

79
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:35,240
But now it's like very much like back like you had a choice where whether.

80
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,390
Much more, you know, politicized, amplified, you know.

81
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:52,729
And absolutely, there's. We'll talk about the California case, but that's sort of been thought about in recent years as like,

82
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,790
wow, this great victory because it led to a policy mandate.

83
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:03,350
And now we're seeing all kinds of things change in that sort of policy with a small piece like school policy type changes.

84
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,570
It's a really transitional space, for sure.

85
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:20,020
Caroline. Yeah, I just. There's a fascination with the paradox because as the.

86
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,780
But. So.

87
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:54,319
Although that in case in point is a. We heard one it kind of it relates also back to like the vaping thing because we think

88
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,330
like oh well there aren't as many smokers around on average certainly differs by,

89
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:07,430
you know, group membership of various types. But here we've all sort of benefited from vaccines, we've benefited from the herd immunity of vaccines.

90
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,209
And we're like it's like, you know, the victim of your own success kind of thing.

91
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:21,500
And so how do you again in a non sort of fear mongering way but maybe a little bit kind of highlight, gosh, these things are really bad and kids,

92
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:27,530
you know that's why I also started that history unit is thinking about like, wow, we are really in a different place now.

93
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:36,620
If people know there's a pediatrician in Perry class, she writes an article in the New York Times also like it, just like a blog.

94
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,819
And she has a lot of and I've given you guys some readings from her,

95
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:47,270
but she has a book and fortunately it came out in 2020 and the title was a Good Time to be Born.

96
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,890
And so it was like an ironic title unintentionally, and it's now been rereleased.

97
00:10:51,970 --> 00:11:02,570
It has a different title. Oops, sorry, but she's giving a talk at in this like bioethics center if people are interested.

98
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,820
I mean, I probably sent out an announcement with a link.

99
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:10,610
I think it might overlap a little bit timing wise with the class, but it'll also be on a webinar.

100
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,659
But so she has a lot of interesting observations about that point.

101
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,040
Caroline was kind of just making like we have sort of forgotten how dire things used to be.

102
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:28,400
It's like sort of unimaginable, especially in the US to think, you know, this many babies were just going to die right then.

103
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:34,130
It's hard to kind of like summon up that sort of.

104
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,630
But that is what vaccines have been preventing.

105
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:50,850
So yeah, when I was reading it, I was saying to me, I'm thinking about the parallel between vaccines and the abortion of overturning Roe versus Wade.

106
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:59,759
Also understanding from like the anti-vaxxers like watching a documentary how, you know, they thought it was, you know,

107
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:06,270
kind of raping like their civil liberties and freedoms and like choice and like the concept of like if you give a mouse a cookie.

108
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:13,830
But then so being like against mandates for like vaccinations but then also being for mandates, you know.

109
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:23,180
Like with the state's choice. I think that was like an interesting parallel to compare the two different topics.

110
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:30,059
It's very complex and it's very, you know, hot button in lots of directions.

111
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:40,020
And I also want to acknowledge, like, you know, I think here sitting in the school of Public Health, the the, you know, general, you know,

112
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:50,190
party line is like pretty hard core liberal progressive like anti-vaxxers are like not, you know, what, anybody wants to be, right?

113
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:58,960
However, I'm sure. Who are like maybe not a hardcore anti-vaxxer, but maybe we have people in our family who are of anti-vaxxers,

114
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,830
or maybe we have people who are like, just had a baby and are like, and we'll see.

115
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:07,420
It's a lot of stuff. So do they really have to give them all together?

116
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:12,910
Like what you know? So there's nuance. And I want to just make sure to acknowledge that because I know, like,

117
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:19,900
I think that's part of this public health challenge is that we're all sitting here like we're all in masks, we're all, you know.

118
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:27,900
I would venture we're all vaccinated for COVID, but that is not the world that we're kind of going back out into.

119
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,310
And I think that's always so critical to keep in mind.

120
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:40,770
And how about just thinking about is it okay for doctors to refuse people who don't want to vaccinate?

121
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:58,380
Serving those patients. Well, it's like something government funded.

122
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:09,570
You would think about like who that would. Versus or what populations will be served by legitimate doctors and.

123
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,549
But no,

124
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:22,800
I just I also like one of the readings that prompted me to also think about where it is required or mandate or something made like illegal or illegal,

125
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:30,290
like what are the consequences? Like if the physician if it was required and the physician, you know,

126
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:37,390
actually didn't decide to provide the vaccinations, what what then happened, the sanctions on that position?

127
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,010
Yeah, absolutely. And so there's absolutely that parallel with Roe right now.

128
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:48,600
And then also just sort of like knowing it's kind of like finding what the source of your website information is like,

129
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,780
knowing what your institution kind of stands for.

130
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,919
And I don't know if you guys are following this big debate in university in Seattle right now,

131
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,159
but there's like sort of anti LGBTQ statements and then there's like now a lawsuit.

132
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:10,110
And it's just very interesting. Also, what do you think about a lot of educational institutions, for example, Jesuit institutions,

133
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,959
you know, historically have not covered birth control and this kind of thing.

134
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:19,320
So it's like a very kind of high level policy thing that as with many other things, you know, we don't have this.

135
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:25,590
The implications are many and not often like super spelled out until you're like in the moment.

136
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:40,530
So. Absolutely. And what about had everybody heard of the like Wakefield study and the autism linkages which are not sort have been disproven.

137
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:51,000
But I feel like it's become more known but I liked that what they did is they presented enough of this sort of

138
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,489
study details like it's 12 kids and there were the selection of these participants was a little questionable.

139
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:02,790
And there are lots of things around that study design that were very problematic.

140
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:13,620
And then also that the you know, that was sort of one study that got retracted and that physician was, you know, one of the disbarred.

141
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:20,700
But like, you know, medical exams was taken away. But then now he's kind of promoting the message in different ways.

142
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:30,569
So it's just very hard to kind of keep all of the information current in one's head because we have so much information.

143
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:47,330
But I like to point that out. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And kind of. But I feel like it almost had the opposite effect.

144
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,270
It is very like a sort of conspiracy theory, like or.

145
00:17:02,080 --> 00:18:29,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it wasn't really. That's a hard that's a that's not a productive way to go about it.

146
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:35,590
And it's and it's but it's hard. It's really hard. And like who has flashier materials, I think is always important to think about.

147
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,490
Yeah. How, um. And like opinions.

148
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,510
And you have no idea where they happen. Uh huh.

149
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:51,930
The article, I think it was the article it went through all the reasons, popular reasons for parents wanting to delay or not vaccinate.

150
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:56,670
And I actually kind of laughed out loud when I read the one that said they don't believe that these.

151
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,370
Like there's a whole side of our. It can't happen to me.

152
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,839
I can't get it. I get that part. It's not valid.

153
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,450
But I understand where you get that from. But. That this a vaccine for a why.

154
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:23,740
I said we vaccinate an entire population of the country worldwide.

155
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:33,610
I just thought that was interesting. Yeah. Yeah, that does tie back to like there's not a lot of lived experience with a lot of these diseases.

156
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:39,550
I was just reading something, this historical piece around like diphtheria and it's awful.

157
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,650
It's awful. And kids, like, die really frequently from it.

158
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:51,670
And that's tucked into one of these vaccines. Yeah. You get to the point where.

159
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:10,910
Yeah, it seems like. Oh.

160
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:30,940
It. The response being previously discarded.

161
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,530
I am feeling that's not just proving his point. So they should have replicated this.

162
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:43,120
And I'm like, Hey, we figured his spending like that would have been more obvious evidence like that.

163
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:53,700
It doesn't work and just. Or up or something.

164
00:20:53,810 --> 00:21:08,770
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe there needs to be like. Yeah, I it's such a good question.

165
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,759
I'm like, who funded that study? And I don't know, I'll step ahead of others now.

166
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,020
But that scientific review process.

167
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,550
Yeah, there's a lot of flaws in it. It's very imperfect.

168
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:28,479
The idea that like over time we will arrive at closer to what we believe is the

169
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,140
truth and supported by like all this research on like what the mechanisms are.

170
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:41,210
Interesting process, but any one study could sneak in.

171
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:48,259
And I think that's sort of what happened. And they did try to do some replication which kind of started leading to like what's going on.

172
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:53,840
And they also impact the study design. But it was published initially and then.

173
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:58,270
But I thought. What was it? The Lancet?

174
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:05,060
Yes, the. So like you got a paper in The Lancet and you're like, Woo hoo, you know?

175
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,560
Yeah, I agree. It's a lot of lot to delve into.

176
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:17,230
Yeah. Um, I think that's one of the challenges of libraries. They stay with people.

177
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,600
But like some of the behind a paywall you have to be.

178
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:36,530
But that's a disadvantage when you have something like this come out and people are like, Well, this doctor did it.

179
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:44,850
We're like, Yeah, but also like 12 other people have done the same thing in the past, so they wouldn't know that unless they read.

180
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:50,719
Totally. And it's much less like sexy and exciting to be like, wait, I replicated.

181
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,430
And it didn't replicate as opposed to like have the, like, you know, finding where people are like,

182
00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:00,050
oh, let's have headlines because we've heard all this before and there's so many reasons.

183
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:06,740
I mean, I think for those of you in you who, you know, take like materials and methods, take courses, program development,

184
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:16,760
this idea of like a lot of what we are effective at is like when materials are good and messaging is good and messaging is like sticky,

185
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,810
like bryanston communications class and it's so important.

186
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:26,520
But there is, as we probably all can appreciate, like there's a huge gap between like, oh,

187
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:31,490
I got my paper in The Lancet and like parents or someone else getting this information.

188
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:40,160
And I think that is a space like where each [INAUDIBLE] like should dominate, you know, this translational space.

189
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:50,420
But the skills that we have to kind of pick up to do that need to be like fancy cool website and flashy materials and all these things that,

190
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,120
you know, it is a long way from like kind of doing your research in your lab to that.

191
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:02,360
And if people heard about like that sort of uptake of intervention figure of like 17 years from

192
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,190
like a successful intervention to like implementation of that intervention in the community,

193
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,330
17 years is a long time. And so we want to really shrink that.

194
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:17,180
So we'll talk about that, that issue more as well with like parenting interventions and lots of different things.

195
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,340
Um. Okay, let's see. Is there something?

196
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:32,429
Or we can that is reliable to understand what all the vaccines are and the times because I was like,

197
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:37,370
I personally don't even know what all these vaccines are. That's Oh, this is a great lead into the next slide, I think.

198
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:42,390
But I would say the American Academy of Pediatrics.

199
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:50,230
Okay, that's what I was thinking. And the CDC, those both have a lot of good information about like, what do we know?

200
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:53,850
Why do we do this? What's it for it to do? What's the requirement?

201
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:59,130
And I would say they do a very good job there and.

202
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:04,170
Okay, okay, I'm going to move on. This is awesome.

203
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:11,340
Thank you, guys. And I think we'll come back to this guy, too, I think next week or next time, whenever that isn't a little more.

204
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:17,370
I'm about social media screening. So that idea of like screening for like food insecurity or do you have stable housing, that kind of thing.

205
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,840
Okay. And I saw some of the responses and I'll and I'll respond to more.

206
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:26,729
But here's the vaccine schedule. Here's the vaccine schedule.

207
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,030
I think I did this in 2019.

208
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:41,930
They updated. And so just to, like, let this wash over you, these are a lot of vaccines, right?

209
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,950
It's a lot of posts for your child.

210
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:55,830
And if you're like we were up in the in the reading respond like in the pharmacy or in the clinic, like there's, you know, sort of things to consider.

211
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:02,520
But this is a lot of visits. Each of these visits is sort of like, I got to make the appointment, I got to get there,

212
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,589
I got to get my kid there, you know, I got to take time off work, you know, all of these things, right?

213
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:14,550
With any doctor appointment type stuff that we do, it sort of disrupts our life for that period of time.

214
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,709
I go there and talk to the pediatrician a little bit and at the end we are looking forward to getting like,

215
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:24,930
you know, if it's a baby that poked in the legs, if you guys have like seen that or I really don't personally remember,

216
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:30,330
but like seeing babies get shots of chubby little legs and he's like, you know, poke him in the leg.

217
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,370
And so most of these also are multiple administrations.

218
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:42,330
And so Michigan has this electronic record of what immunizations your child has had.

219
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,470
I had my first child in Rhode Island, and they had like a different schedule.

220
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:52,350
And so for her whole, like kind of early growing up life, I would go and say, she's had this one.

221
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:59,010
I was on a slightly different scale. It was like a big explanation. And so there's a lot of sort of opportunity to like miss.

222
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:11,660
You highlighting why it's kind of hard to embrace the spreading out of vaccines because you think about, you know,

223
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:21,050
if you have a parent there sitting in your office and you could vaccinate that child, then the parent says, can we come back and and do the other one?

224
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:26,209
And it may be sort of like from a clinic perspective, like, okay, sure, you could have a nurse visit.

225
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,440
You can just come to the vaccination.

226
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:33,290
But like from that parenting side, like in another month, I'm going to do another visit and I'm going to, you know,

227
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:40,130
I don't want my kid to be sick because I know that if they get fever after the immunization, then, you know, how am I going to manage that?

228
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:44,690
So it's a lot of like complexity when we think about breaking these up,

229
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:48,920
just sort of from a logistics point of perspective, which is an important perspective.

230
00:27:51,570 --> 00:28:30,490
Yeah. In my. Yeah, but like.

231
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:55,890
So I close that door. Sorry. I know it's kind of loud and. Equate pets and infants.

232
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:06,510
But. But. If this chart or pediatrician that's.

233
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:18,350
But if they were just on surface this chart right here, I could see why they may not understand like what is the MMR,

234
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:26,500
what is DTaP, what is a link is a language that wouldn't be necessarily familiar with the parent.

235
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:30,650
So I feel like that in itself starts the hesitancy right there.

236
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:36,650
And it's going like, why do I need to get three of these?

237
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,320
And this is like made to be parent facing and parent friendly. Right?

238
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,950
This is not a document for physicians for the.

239
00:30:49,680 --> 00:31:01,200
Yeah. I think this looks like a lot. It was like combining a lot of them into one single like vaccines and.

240
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:23,840
The shot. Like a lot of parents, we're like, oh, that's like a lot of.

241
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:31,000
But it's not my fault. Okay. Kind of helps.

242
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,260
But for people who are already kind of coming in.

243
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:47,970
And if you're and if you're concerned, you could be concerned about the number of folks and then you can be concerned about the combination.

244
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:51,750
Like, oh, should I give it all in one company? Like, what does that mean?

245
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:57,090
You know, we've talked already a little bit about like how infant development is complex and it's got all these different domains.

246
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:01,170
It's hard to kind of tell something's going wrong so you can see the anxiety.

247
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:14,760
Oh, yeah. It says shaded boxes indicate the vaccine can be given during stone age range.

248
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:19,410
Oh, okay. So you can kind of spread out.

249
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:24,840
But those are the identified types. And they are.

250
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,610
And they are. And again, like pediatricians in the room, kids can speak, but.

251
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:35,270
There are certain times for well visits and it's not like you go in every month,

252
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:38,570
you go in more or when your baby's littler and then you spread it out.

253
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,790
And that's to do with all kinds of things,

254
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:50,239
including like insurance reimbursement and roughly tag to like sort of child age milestones and things to check in on.

255
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,090
So pediatricians do what's called anticipatory guidance,

256
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:58,710
which is like let me like lay out for you what to expect in terms of your child's development and the

257
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:05,030
sort of the the times that you go in for these well-child visits are are trying to accomplish a lot.

258
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,790
So including vaccination. I'm just going to say that in a way like.

259
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:33,350
Okay. I mean, that's fine.

260
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:41,440
People aren't going. And they have to go no matter what.

261
00:33:41,530 --> 00:34:03,110
So I'll read it. As we learn more, it's like easier to kind of shape that decision making and advice getting around that.

262
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:11,700
So yeah. It seems like throw all this paperwork at you like I know I.

263
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,560
I can imagine if you're like me, but.

264
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:35,780
The negative effects are visible side effects.

265
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:45,130
Yeah, yeah, that's the first thing. So just like if they had something similar to RB this, you know.

266
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:49,650
Bullet points. Side effects and bullet points.

267
00:34:49,660 --> 00:35:05,520
And then just leave it and more. You know, the farms.

268
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:10,629
Right, right, right. So there's a lot of information on there. It's like any sort of insert in a medication package.

269
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:14,070
Right. But it's that balance of like, could we have a cover page?

270
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:17,440
It's like the user friendly version and then if you want more information.

271
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:21,279
Yeah. So there's like lots of room for improvement.

272
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:29,260
And I think one of the things, you know, and this is like I would say like this is an example of an improvement over like that page.

273
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:36,970
But there's a lot that we can think about from sort of that public health communication hat to say like,

274
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:44,379
how can we make this match better to families needs? And what I did want to show, how is it gonna work?

275
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:49,240
Let's see. I'll just show like a few, just a few seconds of this if it works.

276
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:55,569
But what are we preventing? And so for that point of like, what do these things look like?

277
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:59,890
You know, like probably most of us who are not, you know.

278
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:04,930
I see you. Pediatric activities are not going to see this.

279
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,390
We hope they are kind of coming back and on the rise. So I just I want to show this.

280
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:18,989
It's a little like distressing to watch, but just to sort of I think that, you know,

281
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:24,350
if we think about these sort of health education efforts that are around like making,

282
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:32,420
you know, anti smoking material more graphic and that kind of stuff, like thinking about ways to balance like fear mongering to parents.

283
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:37,910
But also these are serious things like you don't want your kid to have this, you know, so let's see if this works.

284
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:51,560
She's really little. Oh.

285
00:36:53,690 --> 00:37:01,610
It goes on. But like even watching that for like 4 seconds or whatever that was, you know what you're going to see that you're going to see.

286
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,860
Know their way, trying to get something in there.

287
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:16,200
And it's just like little infants, like they don't have a ton of like muscle control and stuff yet.

288
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,059
So like, imagine being kind of flat and like not really able to sit up and can't breathe.

289
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,290
And you're like, you know, it just makes you kind of tense.

290
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:33,070
Yeah. This is like tucked in one of these nominated combination shots.

291
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,309
And then here's a picture of a child with measles.

292
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:44,120
And I'm like, this is like a like fairly innocuous picture.

293
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:48,620
Like, there's, you know, again, like if you roam around, there's a lot of pictures.

294
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:52,969
But just to sort of show like and if everybody can see that picture well,

295
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:59,030
but like he basically gets, you know, rash all over his torso and so and on his face.

296
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:04,740
And that's just sort of that immediate visual signals like this is, you know,

297
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:11,479
something that is unpleasant and it doesn't feel good and it's very obvious.

298
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,920
But like most of our lived experience of we haven't had measles around, we haven't seen it.

299
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:23,600
And the other thing, of course, is that there's lots of various long term risks from, you know, these illnesses.

300
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:31,250
And so not only are they, like, unpleasant in the moment and potentially fatal to infants, and that is one that is fatal to a lot of infants,

301
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:39,790
but there's lots of long term outcomes that can sort of shape development in a negative way over time.

302
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:47,270
And so I think that those two points of, you know, talking points, if you will, like with parents,

303
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:55,580
it's probably there's got to be some way to reach parents who are not wanting

304
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,460
to do vaccinations or hesitant for vaccinations to sort of highlight like,

305
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:07,970
you know, this idea of like, yeah, the vaccinations carry a little bit of risk, but these things are much worse if you were to encounter them.

306
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:15,510
So let's see. This is a super busy slide.

307
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,570
I just give it to you guys as kind of a reference.

308
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:29,080
But there are here, like there's this AP statement on countering vaccine hesitancy and it's talking about sort of concerns.

309
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:35,410
And I think, again, we know from sort of motivational interviewing and sticky communication and all

310
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:41,020
of these health communication perspectives and theories that like just saying,

311
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:47,169
like, you're wrong, that's it, you got to do this is not a great way to approach families.

312
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:50,890
And so knowing sort of what these concerns are, I think is important.

313
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:55,500
And then this graph is really just sort of showing like this idea of, okay,

314
00:39:55,510 --> 00:40:00,340
the disease and in decline, people are losing confidence that we even need to do it.

315
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,890
And now there's an outbreak and now people think we have to do it and then it's eradicated.

316
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,900
And so, like, vaccines are sort of.

317
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:18,829
This idea of like the prevalence in the population and people's familiarity with it, or at least people kind of maybe getting in their heads like,

318
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:23,000
Oh gosh, I don't want my kids to have trouble breathing like that little baby on the video.

319
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,810
And so I'm going to do a vaccination. Okay.

320
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,210
So I think that's a good piece for people who are interested in this in particular.

321
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:39,420
And I think certainly it's relevant because of COVID.

322
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,280
COVID looks really different in little kids. Right.

323
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:50,280
And this is sort of an unusual. Not unusual, but it's a different kind of virus that isn't.

324
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:56,070
I mean, if it's in little kids, it's not good sometimes, but it's less affecting little kids.

325
00:40:56,070 --> 00:41:01,020
And so it's a whole sort of different level of discussion and types of debate.

326
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:06,720
Yeah, I think. I remember before and.

327
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:12,010
There is still vaccine hesitancy and then when COVID hit it.

328
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:19,910
And vaccines and activism, but I feel like it has come back even worse.

329
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:25,850
And I am. I like to struggle with the idea that maybe.

330
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:31,020
I mean, like, what could have taught us about vaccine?

331
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:43,890
Like does the disease have to be like measles or polio or smallpox where like, they're visually, like, jarring, kind of.

332
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:51,500
Or does it have to be in, let's say, populations that are deemed important in our society?

333
00:41:51,500 --> 00:42:00,290
So it's not like cover to cover doesn't if your children are younger people as much as like older population or immunocompromised populations.

334
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:03,319
But I don't know. I think I struggle with that so much.

335
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,460
It's like, what? What will actually like improve?

336
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,309
It's an important observation.

337
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:23,690
And I think there's so that's like the characteristics of the disease, the population that's being most affected by the disease.

338
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:30,229
Yeah, like you said, the visual like a, you know, if there was something that were causing kids to get, you know,

339
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:37,040
spots are pretty obvious but something really turn green or, I don't know, something that's like shocking in that way.

340
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,589
Yeah. How would that would be different? It's it's a great question.

341
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:45,350
And I and you kind of wonder like,

342
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:53,120
is it because adults were being told to get something that they sort of like started having a lived experience of like parents of young children?

343
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:57,680
You know what I mean? Like more broadly. And that's had sort of led to a lot.

344
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,860
Is it the broader political context that there's.

345
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:05,300
Yeah, there's so much. But I agree. You think you.

346
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:16,540
That as awful as the depths of the COVID pandemic have been, and we can all I mean, it's interesting because we can all,

347
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:27,130
like, really remember that in the additive and years, people might not remember it in the way that we.

348
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:32,060
It's like, Oh, yeah, I saw those pictures. I was like a little kid, you know?

349
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:40,340
And so, like, you know, how. In situations where there need to be.

350
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,630
If that wasn't enough to sort of say, oh, great, there's a, you know. Yeah, I agree.

351
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,170
It's very hard to, like, pass out.

352
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:55,820
So. Um.

353
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:03,990
Let's see. Yeah. And I think that, like, kid, COVID vaccines are sort of another, like, level of discussion.

354
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:10,160
Let's see. Thinking about. Let's see. Okay.

355
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:16,019
And it's so great to like. Yeah, I know.

356
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:30,920
I talk a lot. So, um. So just think, how have these things kind of rolled out in different ways and how like what are like regulators vaccine stuff?

357
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:42,800
And so this is to say a changing space is kind of starting out right at the beginning because school policies,

358
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:48,379
I feel like right now look very much like being changed in lots of different ways.

359
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:57,920
Like a little bit, really. This is something that's also school policies, state mandates.

360
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:05,600
We also have with Roe and other things have seen lots of different examples of how states are handling things differently.

361
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:09,650
So this is just something to know about vaccines.

362
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,600
States have on the books that there are school and their vaccines required for school entry.

363
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:27,300
That varies by state, and an important way that it varies is that this exemption,

364
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:36,360
these exemption clauses kind of are different ways for families to say, I am going to choose not to vaccinate because of.

365
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:47,040
You know. States vary in what exemptions they allow and how easy those exemptions are to acquire.

366
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,730
And so this one is one.

367
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:54,150
This is Utah, Oregon or Utah. I think it's Utah.

368
00:45:55,080 --> 00:46:00,400
But you kind of go through a training module like we've all kind of maybe done Pierce training or something here at the university,

369
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,499
know like it's like one of those modules and you go through and do a little

370
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,550
bit education thing and then you can like opt in or out of after that module.

371
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:16,470
And so it's not actually even a visit with a physician or some other kind of higher like burden of proof,

372
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:21,659
but they make it pretty easy to opt out of vaccination.

373
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:27,570
And so that's where this like big wiggle room happens by states.

374
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:33,450
And this Vermont says no article I used to give as a reading, but it's basically talking about like,

375
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:37,620
no, as a state, we're going to require kind of a higher bar.

376
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:45,540
And so this this was sort of that Disneyland piece that they talked about in the reading.

377
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:54,060
And, you know, this is just sort of a graph of, you know, one kid went to Disneyland and all this measles ensued.

378
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:57,750
Basically, you know, among kids and adults, most were unvaccinated.

379
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:08,490
And at that time in 2014, it was the California law that you could have personal belief exemptions like pretty easily.

380
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:14,040
So the idea of saying like, I am just choosing not to vaccine for personal reasons.

381
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:23,280
To avoid vaccination. It is not really enforced.

382
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,310
And you guys can imagine, like, that's a hard thing to enforce.

383
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:34,680
But at the same time, like, if kids are entering public schools, it's just it's resources to enforce something like that.

384
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:40,139
So a single child kind of sparked this piece.

385
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:47,910
And what happened as a result of that is that this is, again, kind of another way of representing the amount of exemption.

386
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:53,370
So here, this dash line has personal belief exemptions by states.

387
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:57,320
You can see a lot of states. And it's kind of interesting to think about it politically.

388
00:47:57,330 --> 00:48:01,260
Michigan is in there for kids to go to school.

389
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:07,200
So you could have a personal belief exemption saying like, I believe my child should not be vaccinated at school.

390
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:12,870
And then here the dark blue is religious exemptions, which the.

391
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:22,260
And what California said is that they were like, okay, this vax,

392
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:32,489
this Disneyland measles outbreak really made us think twice about how easy we will make it be for people to get exempt from vaccines.

393
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:37,010
So if you're, like undergoing chemotherapy, if you have an immune compromised medical condition,

394
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:43,860
that you can be exempt from vaccines because they don't work. But what they did is they removed the personal belief in the sort of conditional.

395
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:49,020
Other reasons. Exemptions. Yeah. I'm like, is this a no?

396
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:58,760
This. Sorry. Great question. So this was an article from 2015, but the map is from 2022.

397
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:03,590
So I did. I still have it.

398
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:09,050
I think I took it away. I had a slide that was kind of show teams like you are teams and obesity rates.

399
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:16,639
But yeah, I think what has been interesting to watch is that, I mean,

400
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:23,780
if you look at the states that have like sort of the strictest exemptions or requirements for exemption.

401
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:31,880
Mississippi, West Virginia, we I think of as like West Virginia certainly is like an individual rates kind of state your.

402
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,480
So like, I don't know why that's not on the map. It's actually kind of funny.

403
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:52,610
A map of the world that is now New Zealand or something anyway. ST But anyway, so yeah there are.

404
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:58,460
It's like passing out. Okay, why do different states break out differently?

405
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:04,819
And I think this Mississippi is really interesting. It's like it's pretty surrounded by exemptions.

406
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:09,240
And there's, you know, it'd be interesting to overlay like a road map onto this, too, right?

407
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:19,000
So how these sort of bigger political features of states along that dimension of I want to make personal exemption decisions versus,

408
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:25,280
okay, I'll do a vaccine mandate, have a sticker that the asterisks stand for.

409
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:37,310
There's like a few states that have a lot. Like pending legislation, like it's being debated.

410
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:41,870
Gotcha. But that is a good question and all.

411
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:48,550
This is where I put my sauce because that's like looking around for this vaccine.

412
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:57,730
And it's and I think it is pending legislation. I'm almost positive because that's why I updated the map, because it shifts.

413
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:16,670
You know, I have not read the latest. I'm not I don't know if people have been following that one.

414
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:19,430
Yeah. I mean,

415
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:33,079
what happened with measles in New York is that Hasidic Jew population's kids were not vaccinated and looked in like all went to the same schools.

416
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:39,170
And so those populations had a lot more measles outbreak,

417
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:45,820
I don't know in terms of polio if there and I just haven't read and I'm not up to date on the polio.

418
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:54,340
York, I think. Yeah, that's a good question.

419
00:51:54,370 --> 00:52:06,280
Well, there's also the like public school, charter school, religious school kind of overlay because these are exemptions for.

420
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:18,270
I'm getting like I don't want to misstate anything. So you probably Google, but public schools.

421
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:23,790
It's like the highest like level of tracking and exemption.

422
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:34,670
And you can like if if this. It's like for the public schools, and it varies by state how much they can regulate every other kind of school.

423
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:46,400
And so my my hunch is that that is probably what happened with the measles is religious schools were not obligated to be under this exemption.

424
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:53,660
And I think New York was also kind of gone the way of California in terms of reducing the number and type of exemptions for vaccines over time.

425
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:59,030
Again, partly in response to new. Yeah.

426
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:06,450
Holy. I'll have to check about the polio outbreak because I'm not sure how that's, like, playing out.

427
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:13,010
Um, but, yeah, like, and unfortunately, a lot of kids, I think some kids did die in New York too.

428
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:20,710
Um, from these. This is good.

429
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:24,570
It's I will say I'm not a policy expert,

430
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:34,900
but it is there's so much flux in this system and it like makes you think about how hard it is to enforce or, you know,

431
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:40,139
mandate and follow up on the implementation of the mandate in schools,

432
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:46,140
because there's so many different like, you know, loopholes, I guess I would say.

433
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:51,110
I. Okay.

434
00:53:52,140 --> 00:54:00,900
One thing to note, too, just sort of thinking following on that California policy is that it did change vaccination rates.

435
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,660
And so this is just sort of showing with the overall drop.

436
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:10,500
But what I did want to highlight, too, related to this, that's what I was just talking about, is that it does still vary by like school type.

437
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:21,000
And because this is focused on measles, but because measles is way more easily transmitted than COVID, even like Omaha.

438
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:26,070
It's just like it can hang in the room like hours after someone leaves.

439
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:35,670
They just breathe it in. When there is geographic clustering like that in a select populations or like in Marin County,

440
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:40,780
which I'm from California, so it's like, oh, it only makes me crazy, but very beautiful.

441
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:47,820
But like, there are a lot of people who are sort of like super wealthy, highly resourced.

442
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:52,559
We're like, we're not going to vaccinate. Lots of different reasons for that in lots of different ways.

443
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:57,510
But what what ultimately happens is that like then the herd immunity goes down

444
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:02,190
in that popular in that community and then they start getting really big.

445
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:11,610
Um. What else? So school type still kind of battered, but it went.

446
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:17,550
Vaccination rates went up. But these kind of private schools were.

447
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,680
Okay. There's another good summary.

448
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:31,210
I get like these things to my inbox that if people are interested in that, sort of like a quick take on different policy things.

449
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:37,629
The upshot is a good little feature from the New York Times that just sort of like comes to your inbox and it's like,

450
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:41,110
Hey, this is a policy change and here's how it is relevant for sort of life.

451
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:49,480
And Emily Oster is an economist at Brown, and she got a lot of coverage in the COVID era because she talked a lot about schools opening.

452
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:54,850
And she writes a lot about, like, children and families and how different policies can impact them.

453
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:59,140
So that's kind of a nice description also of the whole California measles outbreak.

454
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:14,230
It's you. I'll show you guys one more. Well, here in Michigan and Michigan had, again, this sort of like person is kind of like a personal belief.

455
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:18,760
Religious. Anything sort of non-medical exemption.

456
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:24,610
And this is, again, varies by state. So you have to know which state you're talking about when trying to figure out what type of exemption.

457
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:26,890
But Michigan had a really high rate.

458
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:34,419
And so this idea that you guys will see kind of like obsessed with, but like how can we reach parents at other places?

459
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:38,950
So what they did was they talked to parents like how to parent outreach kind of groups at the health department.

460
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:43,570
And we're really trying to encourage vaccination. And there was some success.

461
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:50,230
But then it was a very quick unfortunately, like a short lived, short lived success story.

462
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:56,230
And here this is what I was just saying. Not married, but wealthier.

463
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:59,770
Whiter families were the ones who were in. Yeah.

464
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:10,930
It is problematic because of the nature of the disease and that we all benefit from herd immunity.

465
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:18,400
Okay. So that was an example of just here in Michigan. I'll take you through these last few ones.

466
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,520
But this is kind of like back to the that chart, right?

467
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:30,430
There are so many vaccines kids benefit from early in their development and because of COVID.

468
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:37,540
Kids are behind on their vaccines because parents couldn't go to all those well-child visits during COVID.

469
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:42,820
Certainly the deaths of COVID. And so thinking about like, okay, there's already some vaccine hesitancy.

470
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:49,010
And look, with, you know, COVID kind of added to it. It just sort of increased this lower level.

471
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:57,950
And this is kind of the same type of data just sort of showing another piece.

472
00:57:57,950 --> 00:58:02,029
And I think that we had good discussion about what the implications were.

473
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:08,450
And I just show this one also this just a bunch of references, but just to sort of show here also in teens,

474
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:15,709
like teens get vaccinations for like HPV going to college, they get meningitis vaccinations.

475
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:21,050
And so there's all sorts of populations, not just infants who are impacted by this.

476
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:30,980
And I will say the gap for me and so like here was sort of a in my research we call the coded pause and it's like what the university term is for it.

477
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:34,430
But then even after that, like people are kind of getting out of the habit,

478
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:39,260
hesitant to kind of go back maybe to the doctor's offices if they don't need to.

479
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:42,880
So lots of different reasons for that. Yeah.

480
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:54,649
And so this was a piece that came out kind of as the vaccine was getting developed for kids.

481
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:57,680
And I think that is like a bigger question because of that.

482
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:04,010
You know, how much are kids suffering from the disease versus how much are they spreading the disease?

483
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:11,150
Versus like we have no idea. Like if they get a mild version of the disease in 25 years, will that not look so mild?

484
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:15,499
So that is like a big unknown that we'll be finding out more before.

485
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:19,729
But these are sort of these considerations like to tick through from like an ethical and

486
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:26,629
pediatric public health perspective around children and remembering that if we decide,

487
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:29,090
oh, yes, we want to mandate this vaccine for all these reasons,

488
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:32,990
we're still going to run up into every other problem that we were just discussing around school.

489
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:43,669
Um. Okay. So I would say, like, and it really hit me because I, when I talk about these vaccines,

490
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:46,430
I think about like infants and then I think about this school age because it's

491
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:51,169
like a great place to test for families right into like we do eye exams,

492
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:59,610
we do all sorts of things in a school context. But so, number one, infants who are 24 months old are kind of I would call them toddlers now.

493
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:04,640
Two year olds, they've all been born during the pandemic at this point.

494
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:09,079
Their entire existence so far is that.

495
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:16,100
And so I think we just are going to be seeing these cohort effects in lots of ways at the cost of that.

496
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:21,259
Certainly in terms of this vaccination issue, they're all behind in lots of areas of development,

497
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:28,010
we think, but we know they're behind in their vaccines and their school age kids.

498
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:35,840
Certainly with COVID testing and approval, which it is approved and parents are getting it, but at lower rates than you might think.

499
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:44,930
And then I talked about school entry policies and how you can kind of shift around school entry policies to enforce or encourage.

500
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:51,520
Um. Okay. We. Really.

501
01:00:51,520 --> 01:01:00,100
I wanted to give people a chance to come and chat about paper stuff or any other question, like people or ideas that they had.

502
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:07,930
But next time we'll talk about we're still in the infancy zone, but we'll talk about that sort of family influences.

503
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:15,670
We'll talk about aces and kind of mechanisms of stress and transmission of stress and that kind of thing.

504
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:20,020
And. That is it.

505
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:29,910
So I wanted to give you guys a little bit of extra time if people need. Thank you for awesome discussion and.

506
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:06,880
Yeah. Yeah. You know. Got real value.

507
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:22,600
And like you. In other words.

508
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:36,490
Yeah, I guess I can. This is likely to be another one of the stories.

509
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:48,270
And statements about. But.

510
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:56,660
Knowing that the children of the.

511
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:29,160
I love new life, but I think you need to consider. You could yeah.

512
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:33,640
Sort of think through like is there is there and I talked them it I like.

513
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:40,900
There's no. Others might look by age.

514
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:45,390
And one of the articles. But it's.

515
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:53,760
There's one by MIA for Gareth. Oh, and that's racism.

516
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,030
Even like the.

517
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:07,190
One recent study by Michael Eisner, which is so funny because it's totally not like for areas like moral development and categorization.

518
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:17,120
And it's been something that she through that has pieces where she's like working with people to create things about like how do we have kids,

519
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:21,580
understand others, we're not like them and how do we like intervene?

520
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:25,880
Just sort of. And she's worked a lot with like in the Palestinian conflict.

521
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:39,329
And it's very interesting and certainly. Meaning with like preschool age kids, maybe school age kids around, just similar different things like that.

522
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:43,160
And then they read it. They have like some Internet that was the intervention.

523
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:52,470
So think about lots of different ways to think about.

524
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:01,770
So I'll definitely look at the book next week can.

525
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:10,720
Ways that you might talk about it across development. Her name if you want to look that up.

526
01:05:10,840 --> 01:06:26,240
Is Melanie all in? I think there's one that's also.

527
01:06:54,830 --> 01:07:01,700
Mr. Speaker. Absolutely.

528
01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:07,160
Sounds good. I just missed the sign. And Jada. It's.

529
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:32,150
I have to. Don't have to ponder. But you're. Really helpful.

530
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:36,900
Yeah. Uh.

531
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:43,490
Yeah. Challenging, but, you know. So perfect.

532
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:51,190
All right, it's. Can you give us a little?

533
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:56,640
Not that I had a class just like, oh, Twizzlers in high.

534
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:03,339
I was wondering. I was like, Do you work for Jenny or Tiffany? Yeah, it's great.

535
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:11,350
Yeah, I love that work. I mean, like, I it's one of those things like I don't want to claim it too much because it's totally their Jenny's domain.

536
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:17,469
But like, not only that, I have a lot of experience with before, but now I'm like, he gets so amped up about this.

537
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:21,160
It's an exciting it's so great. Yeah, it's really great.

538
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:25,900
And Jenny, I mean, I love Jenny. I just think she's so great, but she isn't.

539
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:33,610
Yeah. Yeah. And she really does like she does a lot of this policy work around that cover legislation or policy.

540
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:41,260
And then yeah, and she and I also talk a lot about now she's going to be she's like head of her division now.

541
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:46,149
So we talk a lot about on this like screening for social determinants of health too.

542
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:50,740
It's like another thing and I'm like, okay, how can we do this together? How could it not? So yeah, I love work.

543
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,300
I love how like, she's great. Okay.

544
01:08:53,920 --> 01:09:01,239
Yeah, I think it's the research got really just like reason she but she's so about like how do we take what we're figuring out?

545
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:04,480
We're learning or hearing from kids and like, yeah, get it out there.

546
01:09:04,570 --> 01:09:12,050
Yeah, I. Well and see, are you doing like any of these groups with parents or what?

547
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:15,540
Oh, yeah. So I worked full time for her this past year. Oh, great.

548
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,690
I'm just down to, like, grad student part time. Okay.

549
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:27,020
But I'm doing the main study with her, like we do the home visit and the child all day.

550
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:30,770
And then we have been doing our, like, community advisory board.

551
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:40,550
Oh, good. Okay. And we this summer did some workshops with bottles and backpacks, which is a like kids daycare kids camp in Ypsi.

552
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:46,340
So we went in and that was. I think it was four or five weeks.

553
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:52,220
We did like a one hour, one or two hour session with them about like technology use,

554
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:58,130
just kind of pick their brains about it and taught them some stuff about it and did some workshops now.

555
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:02,470
And so it was really cool. Oh, I love it. I love it. That's how I love it too.

556
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:06,670
Yeah, yeah. That's where I was like. I feel like I've been probably emailed with you and it's because I knew that if

557
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:09,740
I looked at those transcripts and we had a lot of conversations about like,

558
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:15,810
like Jenny and now maybe you two like things would roll off or tongue like, oh, dark patterns in the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

559
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:20,720
And I don't know what that is. And then I feel like I'm also often saying like, does a parent know what that is?

560
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:25,250
Yeah, but that's so cool. Oh, good, good.

561
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:30,080
So I'm still saying my topic, but I feel like it might be in that realm.

562
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:35,930
Yeah, that's. Yeah. Thanks for reawakening that link.

563
01:10:40,050 --> 01:16:03,910
Oh, yeah, I think I just. We. What's this?

564
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:35,200
Especially you're trying. Yeah. They can't let me leave.

565
01:16:35,200 --> 01:19:17,820
I don't know anything. Okay.

566
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:29,290
I know. Okay.

567
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:41,500
That Black Lives Matter philosophy. I'm hoping you can see our machine until I do a brand.

568
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:50,090
And obviously this was a very serious investment.

569
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:50,630
President Felipe.
