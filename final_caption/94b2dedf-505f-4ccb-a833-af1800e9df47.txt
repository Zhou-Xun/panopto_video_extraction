1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:17,200
Make. Oh, it's just the of that they're always opening.

2
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:29,100
And it seems like everybody.

3
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:37,840
So if you want a break from Tuesday's Festival of Content Mornings, today is a nice little technocratic health policy conversation.

4
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,970
So therefore, also less opportunity for my sense of humor.

5
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:47,860
So I'm going to have a quick lecture on the three E's, which are going to be our friend for approximately the next week,

6
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:53,889
and with sort of two little exercises built in addition to Objective-C and a key one,

7
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,250
as I wrote, to understand the normative space of policy analysis.

8
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:06,430
What that means is the training policy analysis is for a lot of reasons that you can figure out pretty easily portrayed as an apolitical,

9
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:12,640
technocratic thing. And actually analysis and evaluation is intensely political.

10
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,849
I tend to keep my own work in contracting and so forth.

11
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:20,050
Like the first thing you learn as an independent research consultant is like,

12
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:26,650
I choose the type of evaluation in order to get what the client wants and do their time right.

13
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:31,570
Sort of a cost benefit evaluation is not the same thing as a cost effectiveness evaluation,

14
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,220
and that's going to skew in a very political direction, everything you're doing.

15
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:44,350
So furthermore, a lot of the evaluative techniques, for very understandable reasons, focus on money and resource costs,

16
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:49,450
which also means that it's very easy to forget about other entirely different frameworks like rights.

17
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,550
So we're going to talk through some ways to evaluate policy.

18
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:02,020
But the latter point is to sort of make sure that you're on guard in all the future classes that you take here and

19
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:09,880
life as to when something is being evaluated or analyzed as a proposal and closely at the way that it's being done,

20
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,480
because the decisions made by are often very boring, very technical.

21
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,440
They sound very reasonable. They're presented by a very reasonable sampling of people.

22
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:24,760
And then you start digging into it and you say this is actually making it a political outcome that I think is fundamentally a hoax.

23
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:35,050
Well, then apply it to the Affordable Care Act, which there is a former graduate of this program who decided to make me feel old.

24
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,360
She's an assistant professor at Harvard, which gives you some sense of how far along she is in her career.

25
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,270
She did it at the age us.

26
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,540
She blithely told me I was too young to be interested in the Affordable Care Act when it was passing, but I got interested in the court cases.

27
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,790
Just imagine trying to teach this to the undergrads, right? They were mine.

28
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,669
But knowing about the Affordable Care Act is going to matter for a couple of better reasons.

29
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:07,180
One is, this is a huge chunk of the American health care system. One is that we only stopped the Republican Party,

30
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:14,910
only stopped trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act by name in 27 when they finally narrowly failed to do so in the Senate in 2017.

31
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,370
So it's not that far back in history. And finally,

32
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:25,389
because anybody who has been in politics for more than ten years has had their understanding of American politics fundamentally

33
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,970
shaped by their interpretation of all the stuff that happened in the early Obama years of the Affordable Care Act.

34
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:38,740
And that includes voters whose understanding of issues in health policy is substantially linked now to their views on Barack Obama.

35
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:46,300
It also includes political elites who learned a lot about how to do politics on both sides from the ACA ballots.

36
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,730
Broadly, what they learned, by the way, is the other party should never be trusted on both sides.

37
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:51,880
Right.

38
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:57,850
The Democrats decided that reaching out to Republicans was pointless and the Republicans learned that Democrats are going to go ahead and do it,

39
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:03,600
even if they seem to be nice to. So we're doing what is a good policy fundamentally.

40
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:10,770
And of course, that's in the eye of the beholder. Here is three of the most common things that you have to balance.

41
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,530
Raise your hand. Oh, thank you. Thank you.

42
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:23,000
When you said that the views on this policy were based on how people talk about it, kind of give me a question.

43
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:29,230
So is the colloquialism Obamacare the best thing to do as a form of writing?

44
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:38,180
Why not? And Obama really didn't like it because Obama had a social science grounded theory like I suspect he talked to social scientists.

45
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:46,030
If it's intuitive enough to him that associating his name with something had effects on public opinion,

46
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,010
but he had a junior version of the Trump effect,

47
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:56,720
which is that you attach his name to it and suddenly you snap into place based on something else that is not evaluation of the policy.

48
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:03,290
So it's trivially simple to find voters like about a third of the American electorate who detest

49
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,880
Obamacare because they detest Obama and love every single component of the actual policy.

50
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:15,069
So that was why when Obama was in office. They shied away from calling it that,

51
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:20,830
and Republicans called it Obamacare because Democrats had Baghdad and nobody wanted

52
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,760
to open that particular can of worms in the White House after Obama left office.

53
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,149
It started to turn into Obamacare because it mobilized Democrats who compared to Donald Trump,

54
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,910
Obama was a much happier memory than the Trump years for your average Democratic partizan.

55
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:44,660
Trump, of course, took this to the next level where essentially he managed to align opinions of Donald Trump with absolutely everything.

56
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,750
Obama never cracked the issue of having your attitude towards the NFL quarterback associated with the president.

57
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:57,440
Obama certainly never wanted the weather to be associated with them that he and Trump managed to pull that off as well.

58
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,160
Anyway, so that's the reason Obamacare associated with Obama.

59
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,300
Under Obama,

60
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:09,710
the White House explicitly didn't want that because they didn't think that specialized health care policy any more was going to be helpful.

61
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,720
As soon as Obama was out of office, it turned into a useful mobilizing thing for Democrats.

62
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,579
So people started talking about here, plus the public.

63
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,850
And then you go, okay,

64
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:30,200
now I think you know these three words I thought about putting up the famous thing about people standing on boxes to watch a ball game.

65
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:40,370
We've all seen it, right? I thought about going back and putting up a little history of that image and how it gets used to be used,

66
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,040
including one version where they're just giving tickets and they don't do boxes at all because they can actually sit on the bleachers.

67
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:52,700
But that is basically the concept of equity, right? And it's here and it's the reason we talk about that.

68
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,820
The reason we use that graphic is that it's not the same thing as equality. Right.

69
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:02,720
Put another way, you know, maybe everybody has the right to sleep under a bridge, but that probably is not going to be used the same way.

70
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:08,780
Everybody has a right to put stuff on the Internet, but obviously that matters a great deal more if everybody has Facebook.

71
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,720
So equality as its values, it's treating everybody the same.

72
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,559
But if you're actually trying to achieve equitable outcomes,

73
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,370
you're probably going to need to treat people differently because we don't all start at the same place.

74
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:30,530
So that's the reason for the distinction between the two and a lot of actual debates in public health and health policy and social policy in general.

75
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:38,630
Boil down to that. How much do you need to ethically in policy reflect the different starting places and capacities of individual people?

76
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,070
And your answer to that tends to be your opinion of equity versus equality.

77
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,660
Efficiency is more fun. I assume you're all enrolled in an economics class at low valuations.

78
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,469
But the one I want to draw your attention to is a distinction between technical allocated.

79
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,800
Is this new? No New Deal.

80
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,560
Okay. This is this is a great way to trip people up when they start talking about efficiency.

81
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,340
Technical efficiency is you get the most output for your input.

82
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,690
You get the largest production of stuff for every dollar that you put in.

83
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,260
You get the largest number of hernias for the surgeons shaft, whatever.

84
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:28,400
That is what we tend to refer to by efficiency. Right, and really efficient if your input gives you a bunch of output.

85
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,940
Allocated efficiency is a different thing entirely.

86
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,730
It is. Should you be producing this right? So you can be extremely technically efficient at producing peaks,

87
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,410
but you can have a legitimate question as to whether peeps are a good use of resources.

88
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:51,030
My daughter is technically very efficient at eating peeps and as an allocated efficiency proposition the results are disastrous if she should.

89
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,560
So when you talk about efficiency, a lot of the time this leads to two different ways of thinking, right?

90
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:05,309
So do you produce hernias or your little sorry surgeries at the technically efficient point,

91
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,920
which is this is the most efficient way to get it done, this is the most efficient use of resources.

92
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:18,819
And we won't do any more after that point or. Or do you say we have this many hernias and we're just going to try and produce them as efficiently

93
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,710
as possible because allocated efficiency says we're going to treat every hernia that we've got,

94
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:32,910
even if that's not the most technically a way to do it right. Are you following us and allocating efficiencies really, really a different base,

95
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,719
the technical efficiency that's very, very common for people to speak clearly in terms of technical efficiency.

96
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,490
It forget should we be doing this at all? Should we be doing it in this quantity?

97
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,420
And finally, there's efficacy, which is brilliant and efficacy is accomplishes the goal.

98
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,590
And it's always a great deal of fun when efficacy is being prioritized, right?

99
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:59,610
So Uber was given essentially unlimited amounts of money by the Saudi Arabians to achieve the goal of putting mass transit out of business.

100
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:09,270
It did unbelievably wasteful, but they did come close to establishing a monopoly in the taxi business that was very effective,

101
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:13,319
even if it was staggeringly inefficient. And they let a lot of Saudi Arabian money on fire.

102
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,889
Well, doing it warfare. Have you noticed?

103
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:24,510
Nobody seems to be counting the vast sums of money that are being spent supporting the projects because we're emphasizing effectiveness.

104
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,049
Right. The point is to get the Russians out of Ukraine and support the Ukrainians.

105
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:33,780
In doing that, the military has an entire thing called cost plus contracts, which, you know,

106
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:41,790
I think everybody in the world business would love a cost plus contract in which you basically say, this cost me $1,000,000 to make this product.

107
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,830
I have a fixed 8% profit on top of that.

108
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:53,009
Notice there's no cost discipline at all in a cost plus contract, but you've got to deliver the product that's prioritizing efficacy over efficiency.

109
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:57,090
And that's why arms companies are not efficient, but they do tend to deliver the product.

110
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,440
General. Okay,

111
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:09,200
so these are three values and you notice each of them has a different place in public policy and can be discussed and measured in different ways.

112
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,320
They're the ones I'm going to be focusing on because they are ones that are applied to health policy.

113
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,690
Now, this is just going to be a fast shot. It pairs to apply it to think it through.

114
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,410
So each of these four policy areas, just talk to somebody next to you.

115
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,750
Right. First of all, what seems to be the main priority in the policy design?

116
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,040
What are we doing in this policy? What problem emerges from it?

117
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,470
Right. My cost plus contract is great on efficacy and obviously terrible on efficiency.

118
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,470
I equally it can be very efficient and fail because you didn't put enough resources in.

119
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:53,260
And one of their values seem to be entirely missing. Here's your for Medicare coverage of SRT end stage renal disease.

120
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,940
Basically when they were passing Medicare, they had just come up with the technology to do dialysis,

121
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,300
which meant the kidney failure was no longer a death sentence. You could live for a long time.

122
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:14,410
But basically two things coincided. Nephrologists who were a field coming into existence said We really would prefer not to like torture people.

123
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,180
And Congress said,

124
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:23,079
because Congress said at the same time it seems to have this lovely new technology and make it accessible to people who will die without it.

125
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:34,300
So end stage renal became part of Medicare. To this day, if you have something deep, that surgery disease, you get on Medicare.

126
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,930
It's not incentive to have kidney failure, but it's, you know, better than the alternative.

127
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:44,230
So Medicare covers SRT pretty much uniquely among the things that can happen to you before you're old enough.

128
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:51,579
Just in time. Procurement of PPE by hospitals. Right. This is let's keep down the warehousing and order exactly what we need.

129
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:56,530
And we are 100% confident that the cardinal or whatever will perform within a half hour window,

130
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:00,429
that we get into it, deliver exactly as much products as we need for the next 24 hours.

131
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:05,720
That's just in time. If you drive I-69 past Charlotte and Michigan,

132
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:11,520
you'll see a lot full of trucks and they're all going to General Motors plants in Lansing and Delta Township

133
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,470
because GM finds you $1,000 a minute if your truck arrives at the factory outside the half hour window,

134
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,910
that's just in time delivery.

135
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:25,050
While hospitals do the same thing, they're not quite as brutal as General Motors because they're not quite as big as General Motors.

136
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,540
So just in time, delivery of PPE, I raised it because it worked out really, really well.

137
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,830
And 2020. Translation services for Medicaid patients.

138
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,800
If you are Medicaid patient population, do you start translating in all the different languages?

139
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,790
And finally, COVID 19 elementary school closures. So these are four fairly complicated policies.

140
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:58,530
What are we prioritizing in the decisions to close schools by our adjusted time instead of warehousing it to provide translation services?

141
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,820
What are we emphasizing? What costs are we paying? What's the trade off?

142
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,090
And is there something else that's missing from the conversation when you just focus on the 3DS?

143
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:22,200
So that's what.

144
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:48,660
We're going to ask for.

145
00:14:49,870 --> 00:15:05,620
It's not exactly right.

146
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,580
And essentially, I'll die with analysis.

147
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:56,280
I can't read this, but other issues are just like, Oh no, I would like to be identified.

148
00:15:59,880 --> 00:17:08,870
So I think it's I think it's just that every year there is a basic interactivity, something obviously that would be more precise.

149
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:23,210
And I actually think that's going to happen.

150
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:49,680
There is a comfort zone also.

151
00:17:52,350 --> 00:18:26,100
I don't think that people are going to go to the hospital after all that's going to save lives right now.

152
00:18:29,600 --> 00:19:31,110
And I. I mean, I, I don't like I said, I don't want to be responsible, but I don't like giving up on my mother, you know?

153
00:19:32,700 --> 00:20:08,340
And I feel that I have to ask, you know, how often do you stay home?

154
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:36,240
It's kind of like you said, because I think that's what most would also be concerned that I still have,

155
00:20:38,370 --> 00:21:43,560
no matter how hard it is to make it through life right now to try to learn your health already anyway.

156
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:52,160
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my God.

157
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:03,510
I don't know. I guess.

158
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:46,500
I guess I just want to let you know that I'm so happy about it.

159
00:22:47,910 --> 00:23:02,640
I really want to do it.

160
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:09,600
So I'm down after I really ride someone pretty.

161
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:19,110
I did run around with a little cube instead of my. Okay.

162
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:25,840
Who wants to speak up, first of all, on how you thought about our Medicare coverage?

163
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:43,760
The Medicare coverage is pretty intensive, and the main priority is improving the quality of life or decreasing life expectancy of our patients.

164
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:53,390
So that is equitable medicines. We do think it is deficient because people need dialysis like no other option other than kidney transplants,

165
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,580
which are which which are hard to come by.

166
00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:01,820
However, we could be using Medicare dollars to prevent progression of disease to the point where dialysis is needed.

167
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:11,899
When we know that Medicare does not do that, and we do think the way it is right now with patients with yes,

168
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:18,350
I think it is efficacious because those it does reachable and it's because it keeps them alive.

169
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,890
Continual active financial and health care, quality of life.

170
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:28,660
So it's inefficient in several ways. We see a really extreme example of this, the Somali.

171
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,100
Somali. Hepatitis C treatment.

172
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:37,380
Very, very nice because the alternative was a liver transplant. It is astonishingly expensive.

173
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:43,170
I mean, of course, this starts at something like $120,000 a week's worth of medicine.

174
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:48,670
The drug companies response. Have you seen what a liver transplant costs in seven figures?

175
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:56,819
So our mid six figure drug is great value compared to a $2 million surgery and rehab and so forth.

176
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,080
Plus you getting get the liver. So that's the idea.

177
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,110
We keep having health care right here. So all the bargains, which is what the pharmacy,

178
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:12,529
the company making it would say collect silver or is small the absolute bank robbery

179
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,800
because you're paying you could buy a house for the price of one little pillow.

180
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:21,750
Anything else, obviously. We like it.

181
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:32,310
I wasn't sure it was equitable because there are so many other conditions that are outside the scope.

182
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:41,969
Just say it again. I'm sure that it's that it's equitable because it excludes so many other medical conditions.

183
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:46,950
It's just really specific. And I think that was within the scope of that.

184
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:54,540
I think it is a bit weird that we've sort of structured it. You know, if you if you have HIV, you know, too bad.

185
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:59,200
So sad. But if you've got kidney failure, you know, welcome, sir.

186
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:01,290
Is that is that equitable? Yeah.

187
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:10,570
Nephrologists drive a lot of these, by the way, because dialysis is not that far from low key torture, even when things are going fine.

188
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,820
And so, for example, if people move in and out of yesterday, which despite days is possible,

189
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:20,560
you basically need to wait for it to get really sick again and then you can treat them as they go home to get really sick again.

190
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:24,189
And as you can imagine, this makes the problem just extremely angry.

191
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,540
It gets them involved in politics.

192
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:34,690
Donna, I was just going to say, I think that also brings into question kind of like the framing of SRP, the framing those final frames,

193
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:40,110
framing this population as like a population worthy of specific care that people with

194
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:46,260
other diseases aren't framed as like HIV as being worthy of specific Medicare coverage.

195
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,840
Yeah. It's weird because most of the people who have kidney failure have kidney failure because they have diabetes,

196
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,110
which can be coded as you and your bad lifestyle.

197
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:04,240
That's wrong. But that is the break of a lot of diabetes cases. So we're a little bit unsure about the equity.

198
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,020
And part of it is notice that the framework is kind of bulging there, right?

199
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:13,470
Because on one hand, it is pretty unmistakable. Let's take care of this manifest, manifestly save people's lives.

200
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,050
But the other and you can see how he starts to begin with saying, well, these are not good for you either.

201
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:25,070
PPE procurement. Absolute standard of practice for hospital management.

202
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:43,010
2019. How's it looking now? We talk about how the procurement may have been effective in that you got the PPE,

203
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:51,530
but it was pretty and efficient and that often it wasn't enough and most people ran out very quickly.

204
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:59,030
And we also made an argument for maybe attacking Equitable because depending on the resources at your specific hospital,

205
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:05,870
for example, of your more urban hospital, you may not have had the resources to get as much as you thought you needed.

206
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,200
So you ran out quicker than, say, a hospital like you.

207
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:16,399
It was an absolutely astonishing article in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2020, which I recommended pulling up called In Search of PPE.

208
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,970
If you ever want a memory of just how screwed up the United States was in those years,

209
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:25,459
it's literally a memoir by the chief executive of Big Hospital in Massachusetts about how,

210
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:31,760
for example, they got this shipment of PPE and they got multiple trucks in order to have decoy trucks.

211
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,790
And the trucks took different routes in order to avoid tails.

212
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,469
And still,

213
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:45,050
FEMA found the truck and showed up with police and wanted to confiscate the context to redeploy them to another hospital that they brought in more.

214
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:51,410
And this was being run more or less directly by the White House. And they got a member of Congress from Massachusetts on the phone.

215
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,810
They been in touch with like three top politicians in the whole way, like the trucking settlement, Maryland.

216
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,969
And they ended up having multiple members of Congress basically having to call high level field

217
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:06,770
administrators to yell at them to get the FBI agents out of the truck so the hospital could get a copy.

218
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:13,570
So that obviously score is off the charts in terms of effective and efficient ability.

219
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,950
And so what would we prioritize? Would we set up just a time?

220
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:31,200
It actually said I would stockpile. Well, nobody stockpile, but we're all equally screwed.

221
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:36,350
Prices, I suppose, as equity. Or are you emphasizing what you put in just in time?

222
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,019
What don't you do if you're using just in time for here? You don't warehouse it.

223
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:44,970
You don't store extra stuff. Yeah. Warehouse costs down, inventory down.

224
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,600
Do you have anything sitting around approaching its expiry date on used?

225
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,540
No. Easy. You have exactly what you want.

226
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:59,980
Except does it turn out to be effective at getting you through the biggest crisis that you see in the hospital in your entire life?

227
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:08,440
And so we prioritized efficiency. Now, if we were to in the freeze, you would say that's an efficacy problem as a result.

228
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:13,570
But it turns out you're absolutely starved if there's a worldwide run on PPE and you had nothing.

229
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:25,060
Translation services. There's not a.

230
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,460
This issue fundamentally seems like an equity issue.

231
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:39,880
You get students excuse me, for medical reasons, for you get patients what they need to be able to communicate with the providers.

232
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:48,160
So I would automatically assume that we would as vs emphasize equity.

233
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:55,740
So yeah. So if you and I don't think efficiency.

234
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:02,020
Yeah. I mean of course to an extent but only in the sense that you want,

235
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,150
you have a goal to get translators for many, let's be honest, it's inefficient, right?

236
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:14,110
Just a Panopto inefficient. You know, I spent time fiddling with Panopto instead of something I would rather be doing.

237
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,970
I'm doing it for accessibility and likewise translating something into 12 languages.

238
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:25,180
That's work that you know you're doing because you're not prioritizing efficiency.

239
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,030
It's not properly allocated either because you may only have 1% of the population speak Swahili

240
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:36,730
and you're spending the same amount of time that you're translating for Spanish instance.

241
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:41,450
Yeah, and that's also that we're saying we're actually trying to emphasize equity.

242
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:47,059
You might find yourself providing translation services for some languages that are not widely spoken where you are,

243
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:52,180
but as they are spoken, you know that I guess you're going to have to do it.

244
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:58,219
Overvalue the equity and it gets inefficient really quickly. My favorite story about this is from Wales.

245
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,140
You're not allowed to put up a sign in the public sector in Wales if you don't have it in Welsh as well.

246
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:11,170
And so there's a regular undercurrent of these stories where there's a sign, say something like a parking garage, 200 meters that.

247
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:19,070
And then underneath it is a statement in Welsh which reads something like, you have reached the Welsh translation service.

248
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:23,130
We are currently at lunch and we will be available for consultation starting at 130.

249
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,090
Somebody sent their translation request to the Welsh line.

250
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:33,000
They got an automatic thing back in Welsh and that's how they put it on the sign.

251
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,420
It's like a regular comedy thing over and over again.

252
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:42,090
Like you send it to the Welsh translator and you put up like an out of office reply or something on your sign,

253
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:45,870
and then the Welsh speakers photograph and laugh at you. And everybody has a good time.

254
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:52,450
But you get to see some grumpy person saying, I'm ordering a sign for a parking garage.

255
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:57,300
This is not the most fulfilling activity in my entire week, and now I got to go and translate it into Welsh.

256
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:03,830
Okay, here's a Welsh. And then why are the Welsh speakers all laughing at me?

257
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:14,200
Okay. So that one is an equity thing and it makes people grumpy because it feels inefficient despite the fact that it's necessary.

258
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:24,910
Okay, Kinsey And you're talking about how the efficiency aspect depends on what you're looking at overall,

259
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,839
because I think if you are actually providing better quality care and care,

260
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:35,829
that people can see the changes through with better and more efficiency in the whole system and have

261
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:42,120
people not having to compete for the care and or understanding that you're providing information.

262
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:49,510
There's a great example of that in Rhode Island where absolutely inexplicably they didn't translate their vaccination access stuff into Portuguese,

263
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:54,670
and Rhode Island is stuffed with elderly at risk. People who don't speak English but do speak Portuguese.

264
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,080
It's like, how could you forget that?

265
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:02,560
You point out the biggest reason Rhode Island had the worst mortality in New England, but it was surely a contributor.

266
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:10,700
Okay. And finally, elementary school closures. Oh, you want to know what's going to happen next?

267
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:16,420
I'll go for the schools. Everybody likes to talk about. Okay.

268
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:21,870
So when we were discussing this one, we thought the good part was that it was almost the goal.

269
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:28,930
So it was efficacy because it was to stop transmission of COVID and just get people to stay home.

270
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:35,440
But we thought that there was a problem with the affordability of this because a lot

271
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,470
of school children rely on their lunch meal as their one meal of the day or thing.

272
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:46,930
I guess people or whenever making the policy, you're supposed to get everybody to stay home.

273
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,570
So they didn't think about it. Some people don't have Internet service. Some people don't have access, some people need extra help.

274
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,430
And their parents were still having to work. So it was just not equitable.

275
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:01,989
For all geographic given here, 2020 was an absolute treat.

276
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:06,670
Trying to teach a class up to the presenter. Is it required the parking lot of McDonald's for the life?

277
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,520
You know,

278
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:22,930
one thing that was great is that actually for the last few years of working out for minimum wage jobs and their parents who are working with me,

279
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:27,639
who also often had to take care of childcare, not only making make like toddlers,

280
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:32,080
now being able to afford that would basically be overextending their actual income.

281
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:40,840
And then if you look at the fact that those people are actually providing some of the primary resources of a community like shops, grocery stores,

282
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:49,570
stuff like that, I don't know if this actually was efficient and reducing the number of working out there, but actually I up overall.

283
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:59,320
It was actually very much in my head of the problem. So we have an efficiency question, which is in a sense derived from the equity question, right?

284
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:04,890
Because the frontline workers, they still got to be there and now they have no childcare.

285
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:10,560
Brilliant. What systems start to fall apart when you put people in that situation over time?

286
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,989
We're not. Incidentally,

287
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:21,649
the headline outcome we're getting the data on school closures is that it was a disaster for

288
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:26,540
pretty much the last three years have been a disaster for pretty much every American kid,

289
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:35,629
no matter how you slice it. And it's been worst in particular for bipoc communities and poorer people in rural areas,

290
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:43,550
which is adds up to like a huge amount of the kids in America. But it's actually really hard to figure out exactly what went wrong.

291
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:49,850
Like, is it that Zoom school is bad or is it, for example, that the communities I just described also had really high bereavement?

292
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:53,989
I know people personally were 27 deaths in their extended family.

293
00:36:53,990 --> 00:37:00,650
You know what? That's not grave. You're six years old. So a lot of people would come in a very good conclusions.

294
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:04,610
It's like, well, I can tell you it was a disaster for quality. It was a disaster for education.

295
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:07,870
But what the disaster was precisely is hard to specify, very high.

296
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,860
So we're kind of talking about our kids. Kids, right.

297
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,170
Social interaction. And as a younger age,

298
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:25,670
kind of in some ways their development for growth because they weren't able to kind of develop a social ladder that

299
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:35,269
they could use later in life because they spend most of the time in the middle section or something like that.

300
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:39,440
So if you had any, in a sense as an equity thing with regard to age is right,

301
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:46,209
have we done something convenient for the adults at the price of the kids? I mean, it says everything you needed to know about the United States.

302
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:49,310
So we got the bars open before we got the schools of public health.

303
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:54,420
Want to what you close the bars where people take off their masks and drink and yell at each other to leave the schools open.

304
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,180
What do we do? Exactly the reverse. Public.

305
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:06,679
One of us had a bad two years. Okay. Now the point of this exercise is probably that these are fun things to think about and

306
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,060
partly to get you into the groove of thinking about how these policies look quite different.

307
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:16,100
And typically what people like to do, be it on Twitter or be in politics, is kind of pick their favorite one.

308
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:25,240
And if you're all smart, you follow exactly the rhetorical techniques to say equality, the schools, equity to close the schools or efficiency.

309
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:28,790
What's the threshold at which we aren't about users of a language service for us

310
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:31,879
to provide the language service to save the money and directed to patient care,

311
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:39,100
which is what we're doing here. Right. Or the thing that I want that looks inefficient actually is much more effective if we care about.

312
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:45,920
Right. This sort of the rhetoric of policy debate and making it sound technical while they get in your values is an important skill.

313
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:52,020
Did you miss some? Did you find yourself like saying, this is not capturing what I want to say?

314
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,850
You know where this value is missing?

315
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:09,800
One thing that we were talking about when I was talking about our coverage of the asset is equitable because other services are not covered.

316
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:15,980
That's one thing I've been noticing recently was you can do this for something that people.

317
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:23,000
It doesn't mean they have to criticize those people that are getting coverage.

318
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,860
I want people to get coverage of their own coverage.

319
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:32,090
And a lot of times, you know, this is what gets talked about.

320
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:36,229
We need coverage for them and for other people. It's not like they're the problem.

321
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:45,500
They're not the problem. It's symptoms. In other words, in a sense, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but you hear the word rights.

322
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,450
I mean, I think that's what everyone wants.

323
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:59,120
But the way we have the illusion of some the illusion of money is going to many other things that I don't agree with.

324
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:05,270
So if we three different kinds of services and it is really pernicious.

325
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:08,690
Right. You know he's getting SRT. My problem is HIV, right?

326
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:16,220
You set it up so that people with HIV that aren't getting any health care are instead R&B invited as sexually, tourists at people with kidney failure.

327
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,340
And it's like, stand back, right? This is exactly like passengers on an airplane.

328
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,440
It's like, I hate you because you just recline in my face. But actually we should united delta.

329
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,880
Right. So the really big one. Right. This whole language doesn't include rights.

330
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:40,880
So, for example, the Clean Air Act violates the basic tenets of economic policy analysis.

331
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:49,690
And this says you have to use the best available technology. Because precisely the framers of the law didn't want it to run into the sand.

332
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:52,780
On a question of is this the most cost effective technology?

333
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:59,080
And maybe we should just give up and accept with everybody in between that in New Orleans is at risk for cancer.

334
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:08,709
They said no best available technology. You don't get to say it's not the same most efficient technology, best available.

335
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:12,820
And that's because it's grounded in rights and, say, cost effectiveness analysis.

336
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:17,260
So race talk is excluded. The spirit of that I thought about three D's.

337
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,400
The ontology. That's the fancy word for Do the Right Thing.

338
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:27,420
So there are actions like the religions of the world to follow this.

339
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:31,560
Right. This is an action you have to take. This is an action you cannot take.

340
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:37,610
And there isn't an exception. Even if the consequences of the action are morally very important.

341
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:43,249
Right. You do not steal, even if it means your family starves, for example.

342
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:48,920
Is it not a logical argument? You do not invade other countries, even if Pol Pot is ruling in other countries.

343
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:53,390
That's a decent, logical argument. Another one is deterrence, right?

344
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:57,590
Let's make it really, really hard to get Medicaid in order to keep people from doing it on a whim.

345
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:06,680
Let's have really, really nasty penalties for criminal activity in order to deter people from engaging in criminal activities.

346
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,010
Another one is simply deference. Preserve the existing hierarchies.

347
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:16,290
How many people right now are really, really mad because they employed someone who goes to.

348
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:25,100
Partly because it's inconvenient and partly also because, like in America, up to 2022, you don't have mass ghosting of employees.

349
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:34,340
These are all things that really motivated, right? The help getting uppity is very much a thing that angers people who aren't accustomed to it.

350
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,190
And likewise, deterrence is sort of how do you prevent more Oxford shootings?

351
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:45,560
Well, you know, gun control, one way to do it, but equally coming down really, really hard on the parents of the kid who shot up the high school.

352
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,180
That's a deterrence argument. We can debate whether it will work.

353
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,690
But equally, a lot of people say morally like that is how the world works.

354
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,590
You multiply the probability of getting caught by the consequences of getting caught.

355
00:42:56,590 --> 00:43:02,620
You decide whether to do it. The other thing I just want to go inside is, does it matter?

356
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:10,600
I meant, well, technically the phrase I love the same philosophy.

357
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,580
For people who think content is how you should judge people's actions is moral idiot.

358
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:22,360
It actually has the technical. If you call someone a moral idiot, all you mean is that they're not making any of these fancy arguments.

359
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,839
They're not consequentialist standards.

360
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:32,440
The ontologies they meant well, and that's that is the phenomenon of moral idiocy that you find a lot of religious in politics that way.

361
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:41,139
Okay. Here's the main exercise, Jan, you're going to grade, I realize in University of Michigan,

362
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:46,030
you're going to curb it on a C grade like it's the University of Michigan at 1930.

363
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:57,880
We're going to see that go around the state. Okay. I want you to go through and the box readings had nice discussions of these which no bunch of them.

364
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,850
Some of these things have been heavily modified. Right.

365
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:06,520
But that the Supreme Court rewrote the Medicaid expansion, for example, and the exams go on, etc., etc.

366
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:13,870
Right. So use the bill as it passed. Don't use the bill as it has evolved in the past around it modified over the subsequent 12 years.

367
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:19,650
And I just want you to grade them, right? So you get three grades. Each policy.

368
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:31,570
Equity efficiency. Efficacy. And some might say the public health fund is as a B on equity and a C on efficiency and a D on efficacy.

369
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:37,090
The point is to talk it through and sharpen your skills at this kind of policy analysis.

370
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:44,570
Take it away. 20 minutes. Can you tell us what IPAB is? Independent payment advisory boards.

371
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:49,330
I'm tempted to say go look at the box articles because they're really going to do a better job explaining it.

372
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:53,890
It is now extinct, which tells you something about its political career.

373
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,950
Yeah, it does.

374
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:11,450
Okay. Thank you. I don't enjoy it.

375
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:32,380
And I would like to think that I was aware of the transaction that I was going to be to read the book.

376
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:39,550
I don't know the exact same thing.

377
00:45:43,600 --> 00:46:02,470
I have no doubt that I am lucky that I know this is important.

378
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:07,210
Sorry, but it looks like each group is one. You guys are doing all of them.

379
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:12,470
So just go through to discuss it and then put your grades on sticky notes.

380
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:16,120
I guess you chose the name, so I'm sorry.

381
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:26,140
I'm getting in the way in a way. Now, in the ninth grade.

382
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:36,720
Every single season, my job is to provide practical.

383
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:58,720
Oh, my baby isn't exactly what you might want to start a business.

384
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:52,000
So I guess that I like the families that have not given me a straight line to make money here because I think efficiency is running out of their time.

385
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:59,590
I also like to think of this not I feel like I'm able to access.

386
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:24,280
I can do what I do. I mean, I love the idea of this.

387
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,870
Definitely reduce the number of people who are uninsured.

388
00:48:29,610 --> 00:49:19,560
That is I that though it utilizes exactly how I see what's going on and I like to see where you might be to have any type of activity that does help.

389
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:45,870
Yeah. I guess I'm not quite as accomplished as this one has.

390
00:49:48,420 --> 00:50:06,990
So much it would be interesting to find out.

391
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:21,150
So it was a question of its own.

392
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:59,490
Although, you know, I don't remember the first time I heard that the five of them.

393
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:42,460
I think I was sitting in that room of the movies, but I was like, I don't think there's any way that I would have been able to make it so crazy.

394
00:51:45,530 --> 00:52:16,620
So that's how I learned about the law.

395
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:23,490
But I didn't to know.

396
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:37,210
Like I said, I really had no idea that we had.

397
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:41,610
This is how I do. I like it. So why not just stare at it?

398
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:48,329
Mean what I want to ask you.

399
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:52,700
Ask me that question.

400
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:04,260
I remember something else.

401
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:39,150
It says to me. It used to be like, No, no, I do not want to take your time.

402
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:56,910
Yeah, I like to think it is, because I'm going to be fine.

403
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:20,340
So far as I can tell, the most popular ones like this.

404
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:33,589
Well, I think that's like I don't know, actually.

405
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:37,510
I think that to say I don't know.

406
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:44,510
I think it all gets really nasty.

407
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:56,090
So I don't know. I forgot what I said.

408
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:11,060
This is like some level I know. Mean the recommendations are not only there.

409
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:23,310
Right. I know. I know.

410
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:37,940
Was like, I don't know about the topic.

411
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:46,570
Like equity and energy.

412
00:55:50,990 --> 00:56:38,030
You know, how much money and putting out negative news to say something like, you know, for them, it's just as much as could be.

413
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:46,470
Yeah. Yeah.

414
00:56:48,140 --> 00:57:25,810
Yeah. It it was eventually like one of the things that they had really a lot of money being spent on.

415
00:57:26,240 --> 00:58:11,110
What exactly would you be like? And I would say, you know, when people say that, like I like like that's like what you you idea for me?

416
00:58:12,070 --> 00:59:19,440
Because I feel like this morning Joe has no idea how much I was planning to do to working since I got out of the building.

417
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:31,580
I was not gonna make it.

418
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:42,950
Yeah, yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah.

419
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:57,250
Guess, you know, I was gonna go back there.

420
00:59:57,550 --> 01:00:02,890
Okay. As for Shades, when I did pretty good down there averaging the grades.

421
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:10,510
Aren't you glad we don't pretend like everything's. I'm so old.

422
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:14,110
I remember what a B-plus was. Roughly the topic, but the students accepted it.

423
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:23,270
Since we're on this one, does anybody who gave the characteristic d a f want to explain their thinking?

424
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:41,930
Get through any of these is we can. For young people, for equity, we spoke about technology.

425
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:48,330
Okay. I spoke about how different people like, say, 24 year olds.

426
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:57,040
They have parents who have good insurance and then there's just all the great insurance and there's some people who don't have insurance at all.

427
01:00:57,060 --> 01:01:00,520
That's how we add to the other creditors with different life insurance.

428
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:09,190
So it is really it is very dependent on individuals and what their parents may have heard from an effectiveness.

429
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:19,880
It's effective in the sense that those who do have insurance benefit from it and it's efficient in the sense that you're covered and something.

430
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:27,610
One of the funny effects it had, by the way, in terms of inequality was that it absolutely cratered the students health plans, universities offered.

431
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:34,480
So you have is basically subsidizing grad care out of everybody else's premiums so that it's affordable enough for anyone to buy it.

432
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:39,730
Because when you take out all the undergrads, guess what? Universities are no longer quite such a dreamy risk pool.

433
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:47,200
Okay, so what's good for middle?

434
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:51,880
If you accept the basic premise that this is an intelligent way to deal with an equity problem?

435
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:55,899
Okay. Mandatory coverage of preventative services.

436
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:58,960
We all like this one. And I want to explain why it's so great.

437
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:20,150
And you can find out why people like Moss and we didn't discuss why we did like what goes on in people that have a lot of.

438
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:29,610
So people who are healthy, are ethical and have committed again and it can be quite close to cut down.

439
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:45,959
So. Deeper than the technical side, and the long term cost would be cheaper if you spend that much longer.

440
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:53,130
But that has gone even to the insurance cost of the stadium.

441
01:02:54,100 --> 01:03:00,149
I just this is not my wheelhouse. But bear in mind, the economic case for preventative care is often not good.

442
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:02,010
If you screened people, then you find things.

443
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:07,260
If you just wait for them to die, they might not even die that they would have found had you screened them.

444
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:14,129
For example, you know, you discover problems and you put them on some drug for like 20 years versus if

445
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:17,700
they just drop dead with a stroke in the middle of the street that you said onset.

446
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:29,400
But okay, we all like preventative services subsidizing the marketplace purchasers.

447
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:33,670
That's an interesting one. Okay. So who's kind of a, B, C, C,

448
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:47,550
my ass is pretty much in sync on the same my when I think Republicans could just heartless and whoever cashes it has to answer the question.

449
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:59,460
So I think in terms of excellence, because the subsidy is based on that, because not everyone is included.

450
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:05,610
So it's like I'm reaching out to everyone because it's effective and it shouldn't.

451
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:14,399
People who actually are on it, they have coverage which obviously improves the outcomes compared to if you don't have coverage.

452
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,590
So the fact that it has subsidies,

453
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:31,709
but you also want to motivate you to get insurance versus not having chance to be in the bubble business or B and C and trivia

454
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:37,860
is that the size of the Medicaid expansion was substantially because Medicaid expansion was cheaper than the marketplaces,

455
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:43,620
a projected costs, which meant that they added Medicaid as and when they couldn't have the marketplaces do it.

456
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:52,589
So they actually the marketplaces were more costly, but they ideologically like them, they are not very equitable, but they work.

457
01:04:52,590 --> 01:05:04,650
Okay. The spokespeople for that point of view are definitely this close to cold throwing.

458
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:16,860
It was very expensive. I mean, I've looked at the marketplace for other members and unless you're under 30 help

459
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:25,679
you stay in under two months or so of intensive selection based on your advice,

460
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:39,390
because you can just buy insurance before you can. And so it's not clear who should they have come down and cost them.

461
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:43,050
I mean, it was very expensive at first, but over time they came down.

462
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:48,900
The great expense of getting it was my understanding from reading the article specific, came down quite a bit.

463
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:54,090
You can cut down quite a bit and still be expensive. Okay.

464
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:02,640
Medicaid expansion. Okay. Equitable, effective.

465
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:07,910
And really, really negative on official negative, but not positive about efficiency.

466
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:14,040
Anybody want to explain that with an emphasis on waste inefficiency? I would extend.

467
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:24,980
So we have a pretty good score for grade because for the states that did expand, it helps a lot of people get insurance.

468
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,129
But in terms of efficiency,

469
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:35,900
because each state has their own specific regulations and controls what it covers is not as efficient because it's just really variable.

470
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:41,420
But it takes a lot of money from the states to regulate the program themselves.

471
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:48,579
Is that kind of consensus on Medicaid or is it because it look it could look efficient

472
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:52,719
on the top line because you're buying a lot of health care for the relative to,

473
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:58,240
say, the marketplaces. Also things like not pursuing fraud very aggressively.

474
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,300
Always a good strategy for lowering the burdens of fraud.

475
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:11,060
The IPAB. You're all fans. What's wrong with it?

476
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:20,120
It's. It's like an economist strain, but there's no regulatory oversight of it.

477
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,959
There is. I don't even think they have any current members,

478
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:32,900
because one of the provisions was that the costs had outpaced the growth of the economy, which so far has not done.

479
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:40,370
There's they're not elected officials, so they're not in any way accountable other than to their own interests.

480
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:47,239
So I think that's kind of why it's so important to expunge bad grades accountable as professionals in health technology

481
01:07:47,240 --> 01:08:01,130
assessment and any more takes on that in terms of too late and things like trying to control the costs after the costs.

482
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:07,970
Yeah, health care costs kind of plateaued at which you know, how what what's what exactly is going on is unclear.

483
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:16,610
Okay. So finally and then finally the mandate and all over the place on this.

484
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:28,430
But it's not a super positive take. Let's focus on effectiveness where I'm seeing some big fat ups with who gave the mandate at half.

485
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:36,750
John. I mean, just telling someone that they have to purchase health insurance if they can't afford

486
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:40,980
it isn't exactly the best way to accomplish your goal of getting them coverage.

487
01:08:42,230 --> 01:08:49,330
You know, look. Is in charge of the taxes.

488
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:53,350
You could tell this is where the one that you can see Mitt Romney's fingerprints on it.

489
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:58,900
So the original logic was sort of why am I paying for care at hospitals?

490
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:06,080
That isn't for uninsured people. Either jack up their taxes in order to compensate for their failure to buy insurance or pay to buy insurance.

491
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:13,900
That was the original logic as heavily changed by Democrats because you can see why the Democratic Party would be okay.

492
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:22,480
It's 1120. I hope you enjoyed the exercise and woke up with a better thinking about this and better thinking about.
