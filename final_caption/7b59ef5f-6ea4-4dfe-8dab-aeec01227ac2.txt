1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:04,920
amondul: and

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,049
amondul: i'm gonna share my screen with.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:09,990
You okay.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,820
amondul: Well, I was able to record, so I guess so.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:19,950
amondul: All right.

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,700
amondul: Wait were you up there that's a bit weird everything's moving hang on one second.

7
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:44,850
amondul: There we go sorry I dragged something like one of the little zoom windows and it ended up in a very weird place and I was like oh no I can't have this.

8
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,720
amondul: Okay, I think I think i've rearranged everything to my liking now alright so.

9
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:58,080
amondul: We are today going to talk about case control and cross sectional studies so yesterday we covered you.

10
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,150
amondul: know the screens, not on your right you're not okay can't see anything.

11
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:12,510
amondul: I didn't turn on the in Room AV system, I couldn't hear me just a mess today guys, I really apologize, I thought I was you know.

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,330
amondul: ready to go.

13
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,330
amondul: it's not ready to go.

14
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,260
Nolaundron Harris: you're always ready to go it is okay to have a moment.

15
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:25,740
Nolaundron Harris: We deserve it.

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,120
amondul: Okay, I think I got it all right, everybody can see everything.

17
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:49,500
amondul: Alright, so EPI 709 today we are talking about case control and cross sectional studies so yesterday, we did our CTS and cohort studies and we're kind of working our way down the evidence pyramid right so like people will often say that again with this is the thing.

18
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,580
amondul: Fighting technology, the whole time no I.

19
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:58,560
amondul: don't wanna.

20
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,230
amondul: I don't want the racer.

21
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:16,350
amondul: Alright, so we're getting ugly today because I can't use the pen so like often you'll see these little pyramids right where people kind of talk about.

22
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:31,260
amondul: The best evidence up here isn't a randomized control trial meaning, it has the least bias is the best evidence of causality and then followed by a cohort study and then now we're getting further down the pyramid where we're talking about case control at cross sectional studies okay.

23
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,970
amondul: Oh that's exciting, what if I don't want any of this.

24
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,800
amondul: Alright, so a case control study is the type of observational study.

25
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:55,290
amondul: in which a group of individuals with the disease, the cases are compared to people without that disease controls and you can identify exposures that are different among the cases and controls.

26
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:07,590
amondul: and your study participants are selected based upon their disease status so yesterday, we talked about cohorts where you either get a group of people who don't have your disease you access assess their exposure and then wait over time for them to develop it.

27
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,680
amondul: Or you can choose exposed and unexposed people and then wait over time for them to develop the disease.

28
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:23,460
amondul: Here you're choosing cases, people who already have the disease and you're choosing a group of people who don't have the disease to compare them to and you're looking at exposure and those two groups.

29
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,220
amondul: All right, so.

30
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,550
amondul: you're standing here in time you have people who have the disease, people who do not have the disease.

31
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:39,690
amondul: And now you're kind of finding out if, in the past, they were or were not exposed to your factor of interest.

32
00:03:53,160 --> 00:04:04,230
amondul: So as an example of a case control study let's talk about a breast cancer study, so we recruit women with breast cancer and then some controls, without breast cancer and then.

33
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:10,590
amondul: We asked them about in the past, did you or did you not breastfeed that would be our exposure of interest.

34
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:18,270
amondul: We might also ask about physical activity right did you have higher low physical activity, we can also asked about alcohol consumption.

35
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:30,570
amondul: So the thing about a case control study is that you can only study one disease, you can study one outcome because you're choosing your people, based on your study population based on outcome, but you can study multiple exposures.

36
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:42,780
amondul: So, once again, we will conduct construct a two by two table for case control study, so in this case you've got your cases, people with disease and your controls were without disease.

37
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:58,200
amondul: And those who are and are not exposed and you again have the A, B, C D so in our breastfeeding example you've got women who breastfed and women who did not breastfeed in our cases are those with breast cancer and our controls are those without breast cancer.

38
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,370
amondul: So our goal is to compare cases and controls to see which group has a greater proportion of exposure.

39
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,520
amondul: So one way, we could do, that is, we could just look at the proportion of cases, who were exposed right so.

40
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:28,860
amondul: Among our cases, so instead of going kind of across with are exposed right like we did with our cohorts right now we're going down among our cases what's our what's our proportion of cases that were exposed so that would be at one over at one plus 85 which gives us 48.8%.

41
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:43,980
amondul: You can also then calculate the proportion of controls that were exposed, it should be 114 divided by the total one which is 114 plus 71 for 61.6%.

42
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:54,690
amondul: However, more commonly the actual measure of association that is used in case control studies is the odds ratio and we've seen this a couple of times and examples and papers that you've been given.

43
00:05:55,290 --> 00:06:02,340
amondul: And then we're going to learn how to calculate it, so this is the odds, that a case was exposed divided by the odds that they control was exposed.

44
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:20,400
amondul: OK, so the odds, rather than being the number exposed over the total of cases is the number exposed divided by the number of exposed and then the cases Okay, so a over a oversee and the odds, that a control was exposed is then be over 30 114 divided by 71.

45
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:31,500
amondul: So you can read it that way, or the equivalent mathematical expression is the Cross product, and this is going to be easy calculation for an odds ratio so eight times D over be time see.

46
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:42,120
amondul: So this case it will be at one time 71 divided by 114 types 85 which, if you multiply and divide that out, you get point 593.

47
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:52,620
amondul: So you can interpret the odds ratio essentially the same way that you interpret the other relative measures that we have talked about if it's one that's the no value.

48
00:06:53,070 --> 00:07:00,510
amondul: Greater than one means that there is a greater proportion of exposure in your cases for cases are more likely to be exposed.

49
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:13,560
amondul: and less than one cases you're less likely to be exposed okay So here we can say women with breast cancer had a point 9.593 times the odds of breastfeeding for 24 months or more than did women without breast cancer.

50
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,420
amondul: That make sense to everybody.

51
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,050
amondul: All right.

52
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:34,020
amondul: Importantly, one thing you cannot get from case control studies is the prevalence of disease or the incidence of disease okay.

53
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:39,300
amondul: Because you have picked you have you have created the prevalence of disease in your study population.

54
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:49,380
amondul: Because you have picked people with it and people without it usually in a one to one ratio so usually your prevalence is 50% in your study population which is not the prevalence of disease.

55
00:07:49,800 --> 00:08:01,560
amondul: In the general population right, so you cannot get information on that, from a case control study, because you have created that ratio of cases to non cases because of the way you picked your people, for your study okay.

56
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,200
amondul: It will often be one to one people will often pick the same number of controls as cases sometimes.

57
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:22,320
amondul: you'll see two to one you know twice the number of controls or or even three or four times the number of controls to cases that's kind of a sample size and study power decision that biostatistician will help you make, but more most frequently I see either one to one or wanted to.

58
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,750
amondul: Alright, so the strength of the case control study you can study multiple exposures.

59
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:42,240
amondul: it's useful as a first step and searching for a cause of disease, because it is generally less expensive and can be carried out more quickly you're not waiting over time for healthy people to develop your disease right.

60
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,860
amondul: you're going out and getting people already have your disease you're comparing them to people who.

61
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:55,950
amondul: don't have your disease and you're asking about things that they were exposed to or assessing things that they've already been exposed to right so it's much quicker to do and generally less expensive.

62
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:08,010
amondul: it's really good for studying think rare diseases right because in a cohort study you have to have an enormous cohort study to study something rare because you have to have a huge number of people.

63
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,430
amondul: If only a small proportion of them are going to develop your disease.

64
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:19,890
amondul: And sometimes like with our example with that metabolic disorder that was like nine for 1 million you just cannot study that there's no way to study that.

65
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:28,260
amondul: Excuse me in a cohort study you would have to do a case control study, because you go out and collect all the case you can find at this disease and then find some people to compare them to.

66
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:38,250
amondul: So very good premier diseases or those with a long latency period right because, again, if you do a covert Center you're going to wait decades potentially for disease to develop.

67
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,650
amondul: And as when I say useful as a first step.

68
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:51,210
amondul: I will tell you, you know some things you're always, I mean the very rare things like, for example, that metabolic disorder again.

69
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:58,140
amondul: you're always going to kind of have to do a case control study it's going to be very difficult to to study things that rare in a cohort.

70
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:04,290
amondul: But again, if cohort data already exists, nobody is going to fund you to do a case control study on something.

71
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,130
amondul: Right does that make sense, because it's kind of lower on the hierarchy of evidence so.

72
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:19,230
amondul: If you know people have done a case control study and said yep there's something here it's interesting, we need to take the next step and get better data by doing a cohort and they've done that no one's going to you know fund you as a researcher.

73
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,960
amondul: To kind of take a take a step down on the evidence ladder and do a case control so that makes sense.

74
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:34,590
amondul: Okay limitations, you cannot assess the prevalence or incidence of disease like we discussed, you can only study one outcome at a time.

75
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:41,460
amondul: And you may have some concerns about generalize ability, depending upon you know who you're who your cases are and how you got the.

76
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:52,140
amondul: Right, so this sums up what we've just discussed and i'm going to read it to you, but it's a good place to go for studying purposes.

77
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,010
amondul: And now we're going to talk about some design issues.

78
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,750
amondul: So currently doing a case control study is challenging okay.

79
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,170
amondul: When you select your case let's talk for a so first thing you do is you would go select your cases right.

80
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:21,870
amondul: And even this can be a bit of a challenge you can get cases from lots of places hospital or medical clinics Disease Registry is the Community one question you might be asking yourself is should we select prevalent cases or incident cases.

81
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,120
amondul: Do you guys think.

82
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,120
problems.

83
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,160
amondul: could be.

84
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:41,430
amondul: a downside to that, though, is what's listed here is that that may be a function of surviving with your disease.

85
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:57,840
amondul: Jihad says incidents so there's no right answer here right it kind of depends on your disease that you're studying what you're trying to assess what you're trying to understand i'm Ray you said, probably cases.

86
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,830
amondul: The issue there is let's take something that is.

87
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:22,590
amondul: Very rapidly fatal like ovarian cancer, for example, is a really nasty cancer, people do not live that long most people do not live that long Okay, so if you are taking prevalent cases, you have a group of people who have, by definition, survived with this disease right.

88
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:32,160
amondul: And they may be different than most people who get this disease right people who survived 510 years with a varian cancer are just different than people who.

89
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:41,160
amondul: than the general group of people who get ovarian cancer right it's a select group so prevalent cases may not work well there but they might work fine for something else right.

90
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:48,600
amondul: incident cases again, you might need to wait to get newly diagnosed cases, you might have to go ahead and take whatever already exists hmm.

91
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,410
amondul: So it's kind of it's a it's a mix of like.

92
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:07,200
amondul: Is it going to give you the wrong answer versus is it feasible to wait, you know what I mean so you're going to it's like a mix of logistics and science to kind of try to come up with what the right answer is for this and it's always a bit about.

93
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,120
amondul: Sorry go ahead.

94
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,750
Nolaundron Harris: best case scenario type of situation for what you're looking for.

95
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:20,250
amondul: Yes, exactly yeah, and I mean sometimes you get what you get you don't throw a fit right because you can't do everything perfectly all the time.

96
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:31,500
amondul: But there's no point in doing it if it's going to give you such a wrong answer that it's not going to be useful information right so it's kind of a it's kind of a balancing act between what's plausible and logistically feasible and.

97
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:41,160
amondul: All of that and also am I going to get a very wrong answer from doing it this way, just because it's easier right you kind of have to make all of those decisions.

98
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,080
amondul: All right.

99
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,370
amondul: Okay now let's stop so you've picked your cases.

100
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:59,460
amondul: you've made some decisions about that, and you have your group of cases now, you need people to compare them to now you have to select your controls.

101
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:13,440
amondul: And I will tell you that this is critically important and it is very difficult to do correctly, this is where most problems happen and doing a case control study is picking the wrong controls, because ideally what you will have done i'm going to try this pen again.

102
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,330
amondul: see if I can.

103
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:28,650
amondul: want the pen Oh, did I do it, I didn't look technical genius in our backyard stuck on my friend Okay, so this ideally remember our pictures, where we had our source population.

104
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:41,460
amondul: And then we've chosen our study population from that as a sample what you have done in a case control study is you still got this source population and you've got cases that you've.

105
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:47,040
amondul: sampled from your source population, you have to get your controls from that same source population.

106
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:59,700
amondul: If you don't you're not comparing people your controls must come from the same reference population, the same source population as your controls, or else you are making a biased.

107
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,660
amondul: comparison you are not going to have internal validity okay.

108
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:14,520
amondul: You have what you want is for them to provide information about the exposure distribution in this source population don't have the disease right because that's what you want to know how are our cases different.

109
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:27,390
amondul: From the people in that same population who did not get the disease in terms of their exposure and if you pick people from a different source population, you might be comparing your cases to the wrong underlying exposure distribution.

110
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:36,750
amondul: Alright, so there's lots of choices for this, you could get it from the Community right you could do some sort of probability sample you could look in the same neighborhood is your cases.

111
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:41,940
amondul: You could do random digit dialing for people who live in that area, you could ask people to recruit their best friend.

112
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:50,460
amondul: The process, this is more likely to come from the same reference population as the cases, but this can be time consuming and expensive and hard to find people.

113
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:59,820
amondul: People will also do hospital based recruitment where they pick hospitalized patients who are admitted for conditions that are not related to exposure of interest.

114
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:10,830
amondul: I will tell you that this is very much not cool in most people's mind because there's very specific type of bias called brooks's bias.

115
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:20,430
amondul: Did did the reading mentioned the pancreatic cancer and coffee study yes Okay, so this is the problem in the pancreatic cancer and coffee study right.

116
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:29,820
amondul: they've picked pancreatic cancer cases were being seen by GI docs and then they pick those doctors patients who weren't there for pancreatic cancer and they asked him about a bunch of exposures.

117
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:37,320
amondul: The problem is that if you're going to a GI Doc you probably have a stomach problem, and if you have a stomach problem you've probably stopped drinking coffee.

118
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,570
amondul: Because it upset your stomach right.

119
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:51,420
amondul: So what they saw is that it looked like the people pancreatic cancer drink more coffee, but the people who didn't which would make it seem like there might be a causal association between coffee drinking and pancreatic cancer risk, but that is not thankfully.

120
00:16:51,630 --> 00:17:02,700
amondul: Everybody it's Okay, you can have coffee it doesn't cause pancreatic cancer, because they had hospital, they have brooks's bias, which is a very specific kind of.

121
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:15,480
amondul: hospital based control selection bias Okay, so I will tell you now that, if you propose a hospital based case control study almost nobody is going to be excited about that you're going to get dunked.

122
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,960
amondul: On because, even if you.

123
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:25,020
amondul: There we've just shown that people who are at the hospital have a higher distribution of, for example, smoking.

124
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:37,140
amondul: Because it's like associated with everything almost that you're going to go to the hospital for right, and so you just it's not a representative population of the general public that you're kind of trying to draw your cases from.

125
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,170
amondul: um.

126
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:46,290
amondul: I will say that you know there's some examples where it's really hard to do this so imagine that you're going to do.

127
00:17:47,730 --> 00:18:00,690
amondul: let's see I mean my my cancer example is a good one imagine you're going to do a study of head and neck cancer at the University of Michigan hospital having that cancer requires a very specialized surgeon, to do all the reconstruction and all the surgery that you need.

128
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,130
amondul: they've got they've got.

129
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:15,000
amondul: You know it's it's cancers Tucker anyone anywhere from like the vermilion surface of the lip all the way down through the throat and so they're doing they're doing all kinds of surgery in here right, and so they do facial reconstruction their their reconstructing jawbones.

130
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:23,790
amondul: they're dealing with all of the nerves and vasculature that's in the throat trying to get this cancer out and not you know kill you in the process so.

131
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:35,340
amondul: This is not something that is frequently treated at a Community hospital right we get like 30% of all of the head and neck cancer cases that occur in Michigan come to the University of Michigan for treatment so we're getting people from up all over the place.

132
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:42,150
amondul: If you were trying to do a hospital based case control study and you were picking people who I don't know came from a broken leg.

133
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,140
amondul: I just told you that have neck cancer patients are coming from all over the state where the broken leg people coming from.

134
00:18:53,130 --> 00:19:05,940
amondul: area yeah they're coming from here right they're coming from Ann arbor, which is very different than the rest of the State Chelsea says the same thing locally that's correct right and then are both very different than that up the rest of Michigan to right.

135
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:17,190
amondul: So I mean, then you could so what's a better way to do it, you could then go with those people and say hey okay this guy lives in the zip code, we could go try to find a control from Mexico.

136
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:18,840
amondul: Okay.

137
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:29,190
amondul: So you can see how this is difficult to do well, but critically important to do well.

138
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,410
amondul: Okay matching.

139
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,060
amondul: Any questions about control selection before we get a matching.

140
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:48,780
amondul: Alright, so matching is a design element that helps us ensure that cases and controls are similar on selected factors okay.

141
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:56,610
amondul: You don't want to random people if you if you get cases of, say, heart disease, those people are likely to be older.

142
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:07,620
amondul: Right, if you take a random sample of the communities that they live in, you probably are going to get younger people and then you're not going to have good overlap in the age distribution you're going to have a very different age distribution.

143
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:16,080
amondul: In your controls and then your cases, so you might want to make sure that they are similar in terms of age when you pick your controls okay.

144
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:30,870
amondul: age is something we almost always match on in a case control study or very frequently would match on if you're going to do a match to study okay so there's two kinds you can do group matching, which is also called frequency matching or you can do individual matching.

145
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:39,330
amondul: group or frequency matching is where you select control so that the proportion of controls with a certain characteristic is the same as the proportion of cases with that characteristic.

146
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:49,680
amondul: You must enroll your cases first, because you have to have your whole group of cases in order to identify the proportion of cases with the characteristic of interest and then you can involve your controls.

147
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:59,370
amondul: And you can group match on more than one thing, so if 33% of your cases are female then you're going to enroll your control so that 33% are female okay so here you've got.

148
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,750
amondul: 1234 you got five females and males.

149
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:18,240
amondul: Here you've also got five females and males and we've also got 40% of our cases who live in urban areas and we're making sure that 40% of our controls delineated by the box also live in urban areas okay.

150
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:25,230
amondul: I will say the individual matching in my experience is much more common than frequency or group matching.

151
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:33,510
amondul: For each case this is where you're actually creating match pairs or match sets if you're if you're getting more than one control per case, for example.

152
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:42,900
amondul: So for each case that's selected you're going to pick a control that is similar to the case in terms of selected characteristics, this is nice, you can match more than one control to a case to increase your power.

153
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:52,380
amondul: it's much more practical to implement things you can enroll your cases and control simultaneously I go to my clinic i've got a 57 year old male.

154
00:21:52,890 --> 00:22:05,490
amondul: Cancer patient who's enrolled in my study now I can immediately go find a 57 year old male control to match him to I don't have to wait until i've enrolled all of my cases to go find my controls.

155
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:06,900
amondul: Okay.

156
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:21,060
amondul: So here's an individually, an example where we're gonna match on sex, age BMI and marital status, usually you're not matching I mean sex marital status or categorical things right, usually with with continuous variables you're matching within a certain.

157
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:29,490
amondul: range you're not matching exactly right so we're going to match on age within five years and BMI within two units at BMI.

158
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:36,780
amondul: Okay, so matched pair one you've got a case you've enrolled a 75 year old male with a BMI of 30 point 34.2 and he's married.

159
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:50,400
amondul: So we go find a control who's a 77 year old male BMI of 33 and married okay so we've matched on age within five years BMI within two sacks because they're both male and marital status.

160
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:59,850
amondul: match fair to you've got a 56 year old female it with a BMI of 29.7 who is married so you're going to find a 60 year old female is the control, whose BMI is 28.2 of this.

161
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,280
amondul: Does that make sense.

162
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,410
amondul: Okay considerations when you're doing matching.

163
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:20,160
amondul: If you if you have too many things you're trying to match on or you've got too narrow of your categories, it might be really difficult to find matches so you have to be a little bit.

164
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:32,880
amondul: You have to again strike that balance right between matching nearly enough that you've done what you wanted to do but also providing yourself with enough options to get people.

165
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:43,080
amondul: and keep in mind, you cannot look at your match characteristics as exposures of interest in your study, because you have determined the distribution of them.

166
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,950
amondul: Okay, so you cannot look at them in relation to your outcome, so we usually only match on things.

167
00:23:50,280 --> 00:24:01,650
amondul: That we already know are associated the outcome that there's no point in studying I know age is associated with cancer older people are more likely to get cancer I don't care about looking at age i'm going to match on it right.

168
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,230
amondul: Things like that.

169
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:23,190
amondul: There is a statistical problem hope over matching if you match on too many things, you can have this problem if you kind of stick to natural on a handful of things age, race, sex, that are sort of like known demographic things that are associated with your outcome you're going to be fine.

170
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:32,970
amondul: This does not frequently come up as a major issue, but it is something you should know about, because you can't just go matching i'm like everything.

171
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:42,690
amondul: And if you individually matched you have to conduct a match analysis which is slightly different okay we're going to talk about that.

172
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:55,230
amondul: I told you when you calculate the odds ratio it's a times D overby times see, but when you are doing a matched analysis, you really only using data from your discordant pairs.

173
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,380
amondul: and your two by two table represents your pairs not individuals okay.

174
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:11,100
amondul: component pairs are ones where the case and control parents are both exposed or both unexposed discordant pairs are where your pairs one.

175
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:25,470
amondul: Case control here through one is exposed in one is unexposed Okay, so in this study we have twice as many people as are shown in this table Okay, this is pairs.

176
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:34,800
amondul: So there are a pairs where the case and controller both exposed D pairs where they are both not expose those are your concordance pairs.

177
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:46,320
amondul: Here are your discord and parents, we have be pairs where the cases exposed in the control is not exposed and see pairs where the control is exposed, but the case it's not exposed.

178
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,660
amondul: So let's go through an example.

179
00:25:50,550 --> 00:26:05,160
amondul: Alright, so these are Paris, we have 10 pairs in this example Okay, so we have common core only one concordance exposed pair so number two here okay.

180
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:15,240
amondul: number two is where both the case and control are exposed okay so pair number two goes here, there is one pair were both the case and control are exposed.

181
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:22,770
amondul: Are concordance unexposed pairs are three six and 10.

182
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:31,470
amondul: See both are unexposed, so there are three pairs that are going to go in cell D.

183
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:41,190
amondul: We have four discordant key pairs where the cases exposed okay so that's number one.

184
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,040
amondul: Number four.

185
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:51,000
amondul: number seven and number nine so those four pairs go in selby.

186
00:26:52,350 --> 00:27:01,410
amondul: And we have two pairs left where the case is unexposed and the control is exposed that's terrified and pair eight those two pairs go there, so you can see.

187
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:11,550
amondul: We have 10 cases and 10 controls, so we have a total of 20 people in our study, but these numbers add up to 10 because these are numbers of pairs.

188
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,020
amondul: Okay.

189
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,600
amondul: That is how you set up your table.

190
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:30,840
amondul: The odds ratio calculation for a match analysis is just be oversee because remember, we are only considering the discordant pairs and imagine analysis, so in this case you're matched odds ratio is four divided by two or two.

191
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,770
amondul: That makes sense to everybody.

192
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:46,680
Okay.

193
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:59,190
amondul: One other issue that you can have in case control studies is we call bias, and this is something that you don't have in cohort studies, because you're collecting the exposure before the.

194
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:15,420
amondul: Disease ever happens right in case control study is you're doing it, the opposite way case exposure ascertain that is a retrospective right often is done by interviews, so you have people who already have the disease and people who don't and you're asking them about past exposures.

195
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:24,360
amondul: So both cases and controls may have limitations and recall of exposure, resulting in this classification meaning you're getting people in the wrong category of exposure.

196
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:38,820
amondul: we're going to talk about this in a few lectures this generally leads to an underestimate of the magnitude of the exposure, but if cases have different recall area errors them controls This can result in bias.

197
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:50,730
amondul: You could get an artificial association one reason this might happen is that cases might ruminate about the cause of their disease like cases might be really, really.

198
00:28:52,710 --> 00:29:05,160
amondul: motivated to remember everything because they know that you're studying their disease and they want to know why it happened right so maybe they give you very detailed information, whereas controls are less motivated to remember, and so they don't give you as much detail.

199
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:16,920
amondul: This example here we're both cases and controls may have limitations and recall dietary assessment is a really good example of this everybody remembers what they ate really badly.

200
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,500
amondul: Nobody is good at it.

201
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,780
amondul: Everybody try to remember what you ate for breakfast two days ago.

202
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:32,370
amondul: Can I show you the fate everybody everybody in the room is going like this.

203
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:42,480
amondul: they're all like looking at the ceiling no yeah no one knows no one knows what the eighth two days ago for breakfast.

204
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:51,030
amondul: So I mean it's actually really hard to remember things like that accurately right and so everybody remembers it equally badly.

205
00:29:54,030 --> 00:30:09,960
amondul: Alright, so here is your summary in the design of case control studies decisions about where to locate and recruit cases and controls is critical, I think joshua just told us, he has tylenol for breakfast I have, I have concerns I have concerns joshua.

206
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:22,410
amondul: This is not a case control study his decisions about where to locate and recruit cases and controls is critical right so picking those and making sure that they're coming from the same source population is really critical.

207
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:33,180
amondul: To make cases control similar with respect with respect to important characteristics, we can use matching as a design element and recall bias is a common concern and case control studies.

208
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:53,010
amondul: So you can kind of see with all of this, why we think cohort studies or a better standard of evidence right because there's a lot of these issues that come up in in in doing case control studies that just aren't a problem in cohort studies, because of how they're conducted.

209
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:59,280
amondul: But sometimes you can't do a complete study in case control studies are really good alternative.

210
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:09,450
amondul: Okay, any questions before we go on to talk about when the odds ratio approximates the relative risk.

211
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:15,300
amondul: alright.

212
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:20,850
amondul: When does the odds ratio approximate the relative risk well why are you even asking this question so.

213
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:33,510
amondul: It in a case control study, we can only calculate the odds ratio, we cannot calculate the relative risk because we can't calculate incidents or prevalence of the disease.

214
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:39,510
amondul: So we're kind of using the odds ratio to estimate the relative risk in a cohort study we could calculate both.

215
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:46,140
amondul: Technically, but we never calculate the odds ratio, because the relative risk is really the more interpretive will measure the more relevant measure.

216
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:54,000
amondul: So what we really want to know is the relative risk we just can't directly calculated in the case control study and so we're always sort of assuming.

217
00:31:54,330 --> 00:32:09,570
amondul: That the odds ratio approximates a relative risk, he will eat, you will see people frequently say relative risk in a paper when they have calculated and loss ratio without actually explicitly stating that they're kind of using these assumptions which.

218
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:17,130
amondul: bothers me should bother you too, after this I hope this bothers everyone after you take this class you're going to read papers and you're going to be bothered.

219
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:26,550
amondul: um so there's three conditions that you really have to have for an odds ratio to approximate relative risk when the cases are representative.

220
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:32,070
amondul: With respect to their exposure status of all people with the disease in the population from which the cases are drawn.

221
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:44,910
amondul: And when the controls are representative with respect their exposure population, excuse me with respect their exposure status of all people about the disease in the population, so we're just saying that you have.

222
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:50,040
amondul: You reference population here is save all adults in Denmark right.

223
00:32:50,490 --> 00:33:01,890
amondul: And you've gotten cases and controls and you're just saying that you have gotten a represent a representative sample of the cases and a representative sample of the controls from the same reference population, which really.

224
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:03,990
amondul: You have to.

225
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:22,320
amondul: You have to have that any way for it to be an internally valid study right like these are sort of the two requirements of a decent case control study like we just said so, yes, these are two of the three conditions that have to be met for the odds ratio to approximate the relative risk.

226
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:33,120
amondul: The real kind of sticky wicket is that the disease being studied has to be rare, it does not occur frequently.

227
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:39,960
amondul: And the reason for this is so, imagine, this is our case control study okay we've got.

228
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:53,940
amondul: Well, actually imagine that this is a cohort study Okay, so this is data from a cohort study where you've got 7000 expose people and 7000 not expose people to sunlight okay.

229
00:33:54,540 --> 00:34:06,210
amondul: And you've got people who developed the disease and people who didn't, so this is cohort data, so you can calculate the relative risk here, so if we did that the relative risk would be calculated as a over a plus B right.

230
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,670
amondul: divided by.

231
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,400
amondul: See overseas lusty.

232
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:12,990
amondul: Okay.

233
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:22,920
amondul: This approximates the odds ratio, which is mathematically a over be divided by cod when a MC are small.

234
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:24,930
amondul: Do you see that.

235
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,730
amondul: The denominator is very close to be with a is tiny.

236
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:38,580
amondul: So these are going to be approximately the same when A and C are small, which means when the diseases rare.

237
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,330
amondul: Right.

238
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:52,410
amondul: So if we calculate this out, this is, these are cohort data, so we can directly calculate both the relative risk and the odds ratio in these cases in these studies.

239
00:34:53,550 --> 00:35:04,440
amondul: So if we calculate our This is our melanoma study, which is a rare disease Okay, so if we calculate this out our relatives comes out to 2.3 and our odds ratio comes out to 2.4 very, very close.

240
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:16,200
amondul: Now, if we do this for a disease that is not rare like heart disease, where a greater proportion of our study population about our disease are relative risk is 1.53 but our odds ratio is 1.72.

241
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:28,920
amondul: Okay, so you can see here that the odds ratio is not a great approximation of relative risk now the odds ratio is a valid measure of association.

242
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:41,430
amondul: It is absolutely correct to say in this study the odds of heart of being sedentary and those with heart disease is point seven is 1.72 times that of being sedentary of those without a heart disease.

243
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:50,490
amondul: That is correct, you just cannot say that this approximates the relative risk because it does not, because your disease it's not rare.

244
00:35:52,320 --> 00:36:01,740
amondul: Okay, it is valid, it is, it is correct to say that the odds of being sedentary are hiring people with heart disease, the odds of being sedentary people about heart disease.

245
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:12,330
amondul: And it will tell you the direction of the Association, it is just that the magnitude of the odds ratio is not giving you a good sense of the magnitude of the relative risk.

246
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:23,730
amondul: The direction is correct statistical significance is correct, it is a true measure of association.

247
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,490
amondul: But it's not relative risk.

248
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,210
amondul: Does that make sense.

249
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,570
amondul: Okay, that is he's controlled studies.

250
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,510
amondul: Let me see where we're at.

251
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:48,570
amondul: In our slides here let's go and take a five minute break we'll come back at.

252
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:56,850
amondul: Everybody do a little stretch stretch and then we'll do cross sectional and a little couple couple slides on ecological studies okay.

253
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:08,400
amondul: Alright, so we're moving one more run down the ladder of or down the pyramid of.

254
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:17,880
amondul: Humans don't have wrongs you know what I mean one more level down in terms of the quality of evidence here so cross sectional studies.

255
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:32,400
amondul: So it's an observational study in which subjects exposure and disease data are measured at the same time, a snapshot of the population, at a certain point in time, and I think i'm giving away a couple of my slides coming up, but we've already seen a couple of examples of these in my.

256
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:39,390
amondul: lecture on publicly available data right purpose and enhance are both cross sectional studies.

257
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,570
amondul: So you're identifying prevalent cases of the disease, so this is also sometimes called a prevalence study.

258
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:51,450
amondul: And you're looking at exposure prevalence in relation to disease prevalence you have no incident cases.

259
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:58,860
amondul: it's just you're taking a snapshot of the population and seeing who's got disease right now and what their exposure is right now.

260
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:10,470
amondul: And because of that you're actually unable to determine temporality meaning, you cannot you have you have a chicken and an egg and you have no idea which one came first right.

261
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:20,160
amondul: Alright, so you start with some defined the population you gather data on exposure and disease, and then you can.

262
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:29,910
amondul: categorize categorize them into four groups they're exposed with disease exposed without disease not exposed with the disease and not exposed without the disease.

263
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:31,410
amondul: Okay.

264
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:39,720
amondul: examples like we said, our purpose i'm not going to go into the details here because I already talked about this in some detail in my lecture.

265
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,720
amondul: And also enhance like we said.

266
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:47,970
amondul: they're going out to the Community, they are getting 5000 people.

267
00:38:48,300 --> 00:39:00,180
amondul: There interviewing them and giving them physical exams on all kinds of potential exposures and diseases of interest, but it is at that time when they go see them and, in that group of people it's exposure prevalence and disease prevalence all measure, at the same time.

268
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:07,500
amondul: Alright, so this is really good for generating hypotheses it easily set up other analytic designs.

269
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:20,460
amondul: And temporarily is not temporality is not a problem for time in variant exposures right so there's some things for where time doesn't matter germline genetic markers right a person's DNA doesn't change.

270
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,600
amondul: race, ethnicity right.

271
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:32,520
amondul: That stays the same, so there are some things where it doesn't really matter temporality, and these are relatively low cost, usually.

272
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:37,170
amondul: limitations, you cannot Sherman temporality when that is important.

273
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:45,150
amondul: prevalent cases may not be the same as instead of cases remember for getting prevalent cases and again it might not be the same as it's.

274
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:55,560
amondul: Not useful for rare diseases again you're taking a snapshot of population so you're going to get whatever prevalence of disease there is in the population, and if it's a rare disease that's going to be low.

275
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:04,980
amondul: And this can be subject to selection bias we're going to talk about selection bias in more detail in the future lecture so i'm not going to belabor that point right now.

276
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:14,670
amondul: Okay, so i'm not going to read the summary to you, but useful wrap up for looking for maybe studying.

277
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:25,920
amondul: So what are our measures of association in a cross sectional study I have this picture again i'm not going to go into detail, but you can create that two by two table from these groups right.

278
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:36,030
amondul: disease to expose disease, who are not exposed disease to or no not disease to her and not disease, who are exposed, and not as easy to our unexposed.

279
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:46,470
amondul: Right, so it looks just the same from a two by two table you can't really tell if it's a case control study cross sectional studies or whatever right, but you know that this is problem.

280
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:57,090
amondul: So let's set up a two by two table, we have a cross sectional study that was conducted on health workers in Uganda in years they wanted to know his years of service.

281
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:05,460
amondul: associated with level of knowledge related to prenatal care Okay, and so you had people with adequate and inadequate knowledge so that's your outcome in the study.

282
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:19,230
amondul: And then your exposure is number of years of service that they have divided into these two categories okay so among those with zero to five years of service nine had adequate knowledge and 40 had inadequate knowledge.

283
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:26,100
amondul: And among those with six to 30 years experience 59 had adequate knowledge and 45 have inadequate knowledge.

284
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:34,950
amondul: So remember prevalence is the number of disease over the total population at a specific time.

285
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:41,100
amondul: An Oz is the probability that if that will occur divided the probability that it will not occur.

286
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:54,270
amondul: So the probability of being born a boy in the US is 51% the probability of being born a girl is 49% to the odds of being born a boy this point five one divided report point four nine or 1.4 okay.

287
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:05,040
amondul: So we can calculate the prevalence ratio, which is much like the risk ratio right except you're calculating the prevalence of the disease and they exposed.

288
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:18,420
amondul: divided by the prevalence of the disease and the unexposed so mathematically it looks very much like the risk ratio, but these are prevalent cases so it's a prevalence ratio does that make sense, so a low rate plus be divided by see oversee policy.

289
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:25,320
amondul: You can also calculate an odds ratio here, in this case, it will be a prevalence odds ratio.

290
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:29,220
amondul: Just because you're dealing with prevalent cases.

291
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,930
amondul: So we have our example here with our table.

292
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:55,260
amondul: number of people who we have in the table before now, we have nine, this is supposed to be nine well now it's 39 sorry we're going to do our calculations within us 39 so are our problems ratio would be 59 divided by 59 plus 45.

293
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:01,260
amondul: All of that divided by 39 over 39 plus 40.

294
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,060
amondul: which will give us 1.15.

295
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:16,470
amondul: or so the problem is can be interpreted as the prevalence data but knowledge is 15% greater among those with more experience compared to those with less experience.

296
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,490
amondul: Okay, we can also calculate our odds ratio.

297
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:29,430
amondul: which gives us 1.3 for the odds of having adequate knowledge or 34% greater among those with more experience compares to those less experience.

298
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:34,140
hey.

299
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:41,430
amondul: How about the problems ratio and the relative risk, how are those related to one another.

300
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:47,910
amondul: Remember that the prevalence is incidence times duration remember our little jars with beads.

301
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:56,610
amondul: So if the duration is the same, and the exposed and unexposed the prevalence ratio will approximately equal the relative risk.

302
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,260
amondul: That makes sense.

303
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:13,440
amondul: So, in summary, you can make a two by two table for cross sectional studies to illustrate the prevalence of exposure by prevalence of disease.

304
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:25,260
amondul: prevalence ratio and odds ratio or two measures association, you can use a cross sectional studies and the prevalence ratio approximates the relative risk when the duration of disease this the same between the exposed unexposed groups.

305
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,160
amondul: Any questions on cross sectional studies before we talk about ecological studies.

306
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:44,940
amondul: Okay, so now we're kind of at the very bottom of the evidence pyramid in terms of quality of evidence ecological studies or observational studies in which group level data is used for the exposure and the outcome.

307
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:58,770
amondul: We do not have individual level data in an eagle logic study okay subjects can be grouped by place time or place and time, and these are called multiple groups studies time trend studies are mixed studies.

308
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,560
amondul: Alright, so let's talk about this example bisphosphonates and hip fracture the group here is calendar year okay.

309
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:13,350
amondul: This so you have the calendar year is plotted on this plot, which is the.

310
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:16,710
amondul: The.

311
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:26,280
amondul: doses of bisphosphonates given, and this is the hip fractures the rate of hip fractures okay.

312
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:41,460
amondul: So you're getting pharmacy reports of prescriptions that were filled in this population, so this might be like in the whole us or in a state and they're getting the administrative database on hip fractures.

313
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:43,410
Okay.

314
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,640
amondul: So this is like i'm like maybe.

315
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:53,010
amondul: Health Insurance data right on how many hip fractures happens.

316
00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:12,960
amondul: Right so in 2002 there were not a lot of these prescriptions being written and there were a lot of hip fractures same in 2003 and, as you go forward in terms of yours more prescriptions are being written and fewer that hip fraction fractures are happening so this suggests what.

317
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:27,990
amondul: wants to take a stab at this about the relationship between this pasta mates and hip fracture.

318
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:49,740
amondul: hi there everyone's tired or no one knows Okay, so I would say that in years when more bisphosphonates for prescribed there were fewer hip fractures that's what this tells us.

319
00:46:51,090 --> 00:47:00,030
amondul: which suggests that perhaps this fascinates are associated with lower risk of hip fracture, but what we do not know from this data and from this plot, we have no idea.

320
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:09,030
amondul: If the people getting the bisphosphonates or the people who are not getting hip fractures we have no idea about that it could not be we don't know that the people.

321
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:17,910
amondul: that the same people getting the drugs are the ones who aren't getting hip fractures we just know that in this year, we have more more prescriptions and to your hip fractures.

322
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:19,920
Nolaundron Harris: My last quick question.

323
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:32,940
Nolaundron Harris: Absolutely, because it seems like is situations and we were discussing this yesterday isn't very iffy when you have to start taking into account outside factors it's like very iffy and it does.

324
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:33,660
Nolaundron Harris: There doesn't.

325
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:39,900
Nolaundron Harris: seem to be rules on when to account for and then, when not to and it's very like.

326
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,960
amondul: you're going to talk about yes.

327
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:49,170
amondul: That is a good noise, we are going to talk about that we'll be talking about confounding and more detail and a couple of lectures.

328
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:57,570
amondul: But you're right, it is kind of a judgment call about when you want to take into account of potential third factor, or can founder.

329
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:07,980
amondul: Here you can't really even do that because you don't have individual level data, so this is an example that shows you that the these kind of ecological studies or hypothesis generating.

330
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:18,660
amondul: You would have to follow this up with individual level data looking at individuals and whether they had a person had a hip fracture and whether they took a bisphosphonate and then looking at that.

331
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:26,310
amondul: Lots of stuff could be different in 2003 that in 2008 that has nothing to do with the bisphosphonates right.

332
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:27,720
Nolaundron Harris: mm hmm.

333
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:33,330
amondul: This is entirely like.

334
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:42,390
amondul: I really feel like ecological ecological studies our hypothesis generating studies usually they are.

335
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:52,950
amondul: going to talk about in a few slides spoilers usually they're very easy to do because it's just publicly available data that's out there, that you can you're just looking at sort of correlations between two things and a population.

336
00:48:53,610 --> 00:49:07,830
amondul: right which doesn't mean anything necessarily about whether that factor is really causing the the outcome, so we don't know in this case group is country we've got lots of countries plotted on this plot we've got BMI.

337
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:20,940
amondul: And we've got change in fast food transactions per capita Okay, so in countries with lower fast food transactions per capita, we have lower BMI.

338
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:26,340
amondul: And countries generally with higher fast food transactions, we have higher BMI.

339
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:38,970
amondul: So the implication here, of course, is that fast food is causing higher BMI we cannot conclude that from these data, because you do not know that the people in Italy who are eating fast food or the people in Italy who are fat.

340
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:47,520
Nolaundron Harris: But this is set up for investigating that did you got enough evidence, if you push this you have enough evidence to say y'all should go and looked into this.

341
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:48,390
Nolaundron Harris: Correct yeah.

342
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:52,410
amondul: Yes to this could be.

343
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:58,170
amondul: Fine.

344
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,660
amondul: To use as a.

345
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:06,540
amondul: As as justification for funding for a.

346
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:08,730
amondul: Study right individual level setting.

347
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,870
amondul: If there were no other like if there were no other data.

348
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:19,440
amondul: at all, and this was a brand new idea you'd be like hey you know this, this is the data we have there might be something here, we should check.

349
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:39,720
Nolaundron Harris: But then we can see, are you saying yesterday, if you do, what is it what was it the colored story studies or whatever that take too long, so if there's an emergency and you were doing a method that takes too long to get what you want it okay okay i'll shut up now.

350
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:50,520
amondul: So you know, the next step from this if this were an emergent situation might be to go to a cross sectional study and just look for individual individual data on like.

351
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:58,650
amondul: get some people in and ask about their BMI and ask about their fat food fast food consumption and see if, at the individual level, you still get that correlation.

352
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:00,720
amondul: Right.

353
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,450
Nolaundron Harris: Thank you so much worse.

354
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:09,660
amondul: Okay, so what we've been talking about here is called the ecological fallacy.

355
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:19,560
amondul: This is an error that could occur when associations, based on group level characteristics are ascribed to individuals when such associations, do not exist at the individual level.

356
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:25,170
amondul: right we don't know that the people of high BMI are the people who are eating the fast food in Australia.

357
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:33,810
amondul: Right, we do not know that we're kind of imagining that that's true but we don't know that's the ecological fallacy here's a good example of the ecological fallacy.

358
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:43,230
amondul: You know, you can do this kind of with anything right, you can this is, this is the proportion of people who are Protestant and the suicide rate I don't think there's really.

359
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:51,030
amondul: An association there, but you can make it look like, there is one, if you use this ecological if you use any glad to study design right so.

360
00:51:53,010 --> 00:52:04,080
amondul: This is just a silly example okay so ecological each equal logic states are useful with caution right the data is usually easy and cheap to obtain it's a good place to start.

361
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:12,120
amondul: Lots of relevant social occupational environmental exposures can't be ascribed to an individual right like if you're looking at air pollution.

362
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,160
amondul: that's not really an individual level thing it is kind of an area level exposure right.

363
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:25,620
amondul: And so that might be a really reasonable way to do any biologic study i've also seen ecological studies that are looking at population level.

364
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:40,620
amondul: Disease outcomes before and after implementation of the affordable care Act, the group is the people who work before and the people who were after and then you're just kind of it's the time period right and you're looking at those.

365
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:53,010
amondul: Whatever disease you're interested in before and after right so sometimes it's actually a reasonable thing because the exposure is kind of not an individual level exposure.

366
00:52:55,230 --> 00:53:06,240
amondul: disadvantages you're relying on group level data that may not correctly represent individual level associations so for most things, this is a first step that provides some evidence.

367
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,320
amondul: That is maybe hypothesis generating right.

368
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,380
amondul: Maybe there's something here, we should look into it.

369
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:26,340
amondul: Alright, so ecological studies are observational studies have used group level data for the exposure outcome, or both group level data and a lot of studies can be classified as group by time place or time and place.

370
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:32,850
amondul: The ecological fallacy, is when an association between variables based on group characteristics is used to make inferences about.

371
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:40,380
amondul: Individuals when that association does not exist, and these are useful for generation of new hypotheses because they're usually pretty easy and low cost to conduct.

372
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:53,010
amondul: Alright, so we have made it through the whole evidence pyramid from our CTS has kind of a gold standard of causality evidence, all the way down to ecological studies.

373
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:56,640
amondul: Any questions.

374
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:07,590
Nolaundron Harris: And we use a really great because i'm trying to tell you the brain is a wonderful thing, but it is being wasted right now.

375
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:08,610
amondul: I hear you.

376
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,750
Nolaundron Harris: Yes, I was planning to do.

377
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:12,360
amondul: A break before we went into our groups absolutely.

378
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:18,360
amondul: And then it's does that sound good get a drink walk around us bathroom.

379
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:20,010
Nolaundron Harris: Yes, pretty fully.

380
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:22,410
amondul: Outside get some vitamin D.

381
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:26,010
Geehan Suleyman: Right, how many minutes, do we get.

382
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,650
amondul: Is that good yep that's good.

383
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:29,070
Geehan Suleyman: Thank you.

384
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:30,690
amondul: No problem we'll be back at.

385
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:55,980
242.

386
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:58,200
amondul: hi.

387
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:15,090
amondul: it's it's a lot to.

388
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:20,610
amondul: Other people.

389
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,380
amondul: Well, let me change everything, because this.

390
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:50,520
Nolaundron Harris: yeah yay.

391
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:51,630
amondul: That better.

392
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:53,550
amondul: Okay.

393
00:55:54,840 --> 00:56:00,090
amondul: Good okay sorry guys I plug in my headphones while i'm going into breakout groups so that i'm not like.

394
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:17,790
amondul: So that other people in Room can also talk to other people, and then, when I unplug it apparently confuses the owl, which is the little room camera thing it actually looks like an hour it's kind of crazy okay um so.

395
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:29,700
amondul: yeah I was just gonna say totally get it, this is like the point in the class where everybody starts to feel a little glazed because it's just a lot to do, every day, but hang in there we're getting there you're all doing great.

396
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:31,620
amondul: Okay.

397
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:32,850
Nolaundron Harris: Thank you.

398
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:34,530
amondul: you're welcome.

399
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:41,070
amondul: let's i'm trying to share my screen, I would like to what's happening.

400
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:46,590
amondul: Well, here we go okay.

401
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:57,690
amondul: zoom mode so and so alright, so the first section was on case control studies, you had a lot of background there.

402
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:12,960
amondul: And you were asked why case control study design is better than a cohort study or randomized controlled trial for this particular study question and you were asked to consider the exposures and the outcomes so let's go with group five What did you guys think about this.

403
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:16,350
Lisa.

404
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:25,440
amondul: Has ideas in square events and start off with and you also said that instead, he wants to evaluate.

405
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:40,200
amondul: Potential exposures or conditions that can impact the occurrence of ideas, just like our disease events so it would really be as effective, because of course it takes wants to buy various disease problems.

406
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:45,330
And if we're thinking within that wants to see over time, the disease.

407
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:56,790
amondul: We also didn't say that he said that it would be great because that involves really assigning distance to a treatment groups and you can't believe assign.

408
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:00,960
amondul: People to agree with this ids yeah.

409
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:17,280
amondul: So, I guess, so I totally agree with your marriage your marriage to see is that right, so that makes it hard to do either a cohort or a randomized controlled trial because, in both cases you're getting disease free people.

410
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:25,530
amondul: And either exposing them in a random way or at collecting exposure information and following that right, so the rare disease problem is.

411
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,030
amondul: is a problem here for both of those.

412
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:44,400
amondul: And I guess the other thing too is the idea of the randomized control trial, I would say that you can't it's not that the outcome is severe is why you can't do a trial, you can do a trial for severe outcomes.

413
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:50,430
amondul: But it's only if you're going to try to randomly allocate to him exposure that you think is going to be beneficial.

414
00:58:50,700 --> 00:59:03,330
amondul: Right and really we're not doing that here we're looking at multiple exposures, some of which might actually be harmful exposures right so an observational study is better and the case control is really a good choice because it's.

415
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,540
amondul: rare disease okay.

416
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:14,460
amondul: So then, you were asked how the controls were selected and what the strengths of that were so, they identified to controls for each case.

417
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:19,710
amondul: And they use the birth immediately before and after the index case in the same maternity unit so.

418
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:29,910
amondul: By doing this, this way collecting people at the same time and in the same maternity unit they're really making cases and controls similar with respect to these factors that may influence the occurrence of sits.

419
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:31,950
amondul: So I know I told you that.

420
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:41,970
amondul: hospital base case control studies aren't good but you're not it's not a hospital based case control study in the same way cuz you're not getting people with a different disease as your controls it's all women who came.

421
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:53,880
amondul: The source population, I would say is all women who came to this hospital to give birth right and then you're getting a sample of those people, some of whom have the outcome of their baby dying of SIDS and some does.

422
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,430
amondul: That make sense.

423
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:05,970
amondul: All right, what is the rationale behind the investigator selection of multiple controls for each case and why do you think more we're not selected.

424
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:15,990
amondul: i'll go ahead and answer this one, because the seem to be one that gave people a little bit of trouble we didn't explicitly say this in I think this was more in the meeting we didn't explicitly discuss.

425
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,630
amondul: discuss this in the.

426
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:26,220
amondul: lecture but basically when you select multiple controls per case it increases your statistical power.

427
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:34,110
amondul: And that is a concept that you would learn more about in biostatistics course, but essentially power is your ability to find an association, if there is one.

428
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:46,830
amondul: So a larger study will always have more statistical power than a smaller study and if you have more people you'll be able to detect smaller differences between your groups, a more modest association.

429
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:52,620
amondul: And only a really big strong association, if you have a small study right so.

430
01:00:53,220 --> 01:01:05,010
amondul: With something like says you can't increase your sample size, by getting more cases right you've got all the cases, you can get it's rare you've gotten all the cases that says that will call you back or whatever at this hospital.

431
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:14,010
amondul: you're maxed out on cases you just can't have anymore that's all there is, and so the way to increase statistical power in that case is to recruit multiple controls per case.

432
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:20,910
amondul: there's kind of diminishing returns for increasing the number of controls, after a certain point four is kind of the rule of thumb.

433
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:35,790
amondul: It kind of like you get a lot more statistical power at first and then adding more controls doesn't really give you much right so kind of four to one matching or four to one ratio is the most power, you can get, but a lot of people stop it too.

434
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:38,430
amondul: Because of cost and feasibility.

435
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:40,830
That makes sense.

436
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:46,380
amondul: Alright, so what were the exposures of interest in how are they measured group for.

437
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:00,420
amondul: Is in Ashley.

438
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,830
amondul: Ashley Jordan eclipse.

439
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:06,150
Ashlee: I am so sorry.

440
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:10,020
Ashlee: For for number three.

441
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:12,240
amondul: Number four.

442
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,580
Ashlee: Number four number four okay.

443
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:25,950
Ashlee: The exposures of interest for the social and prenatal factors regimens sleeping habits sleeping environment exposure to smoking during the infants life and illnesses.

444
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,980
Ashlee: And the right by questionnaires that's right.

445
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:41,340
amondul: Self reported from parents by question exactly right great so, in what two ways were was parental smoking assessed and what do you think the rationale was behind collecting smoking exposure in these two ways.

446
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:43,410
amondul: group three.

447
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:46,500
Chelsey Kaasa: yeah so.

448
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,540
amondul: Sorry, I muted you I didn't mean to do that.

449
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:54,990
Chelsey Kaasa: Back I think you're.

450
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:56,700
amondul: Right yes.

451
01:02:57,270 --> 01:03:05,880
Chelsey Kaasa: Okay um so we said that the parental smoking was assessed you bring a categorical skills, so the.

452
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:26,070
Chelsey Kaasa: Yes, know of each parent and then also a dose response so that range question about how many cigarettes smoked and we said that by studying the exposure and multiple ways investigators can measure if there is an increased risk of SIDS with increased smoke exposure.

453
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:39,810
Chelsey Kaasa: So parents only smoking, you know one to two cigarettes a day versus the parents smoking more than 20 a day, and then we also said that using two different measures may also improve.

454
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:50,790
Chelsey Kaasa: The respondent or the parents honesty like it can be easier to say yes or no to do you smoke, but if you ask you know how much you're smoking.

455
01:03:53,070 --> 01:04:01,770
Chelsey Kaasa: People might I mean I guess it could go either way people might might underestimate how much you're smoking to you, but the two measures should should help with.

456
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:04,140
amondul: That makes sense.

457
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,120
amondul: Excuse me.

458
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:17,940
amondul: The only reason I wonder about, that is because usually on these kind of questionnaires there's like a skip pattern where you say, do you smoke ever.

459
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:21,750
amondul: know, then, if you smoke, how much right and they wouldn't ask the how much.

460
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:23,430
amondul: question of people who said no.

461
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:32,910
amondul: that's the only reason for it like this particular question, I wonder if that would really pan out but I, like the way you're thinking about.

462
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:45,600
amondul: kind of asking things in multiple ways to try to get at you know different different kinds of questions that will elicit honesty, so I think that that's a good line of thinking in this particular exposure It might not work out.

463
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,710
amondul: we'd have to actually see the questionnaire right.

464
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:53,220
amondul: But yeah great I think that's pretty.

465
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,600
amondul: Good good good okay.

466
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:09,960
amondul: group three given the parents are responsible for the safety and well being of their children, what concerns do you have with the measurement of these exposures did the authors employee any measures to minimize bias in their exposure measures.

467
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:17,670
amondul: who's group three.

468
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:20,820
Chelsey Kaasa: So that's that's me just.

469
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:23,250
amondul: i'm sorry group to let's do group to.

470
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:24,630
amondul: My apologies.

471
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:31,140
josh.

472
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:35,430
amondul: joshua Sarah Thank you.

473
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:36,450
Joshua Tucker: For this one you.

474
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:39,960
Sarah Ferri: I think so so.

475
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:46,860
Sarah Ferri: For number six and just overall the.

476
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:55,380
Sarah Ferri: The biggest i'm Sorry, I just wanted to reread the question for myself, given that parents are responsible for safety and well being of their children.

477
01:05:55,830 --> 01:06:05,550
Sarah Ferri: What concerns do you have with the measurements of these exposures, the big thing really is just that we're having a significant degree of recall buyers probably secondary to underreporting.

478
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:18,330
Sarah Ferri: of various exposures so, for instance, if parents know that they shouldn't be laying their baby on their stomach then they'll they have a greater chance of date potentially with not.

479
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:24,390
Sarah Ferri: Leave the baby like report that they laid the baby on her stomach.

480
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:36,990
Sarah Ferri: But they did try to minimize recall bias by obtaining exposure results within 21 days of death of the patient, so they tried to can have a pretty quick turnaround point great.

481
01:06:37,890 --> 01:06:40,470
amondul: So I just want to make a.

482
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:51,720
amondul: distinction here, and this is i'm not picking on you, this is something that I mean even our even our PhD students when they go to take their COMP exams Rachel can tell you.

483
01:06:52,050 --> 01:07:03,960
amondul: This is something everybody kind of struggles with poor recall is when it's equally bad in your cases in your controls right, and so I think they are minimizing poor recall generally by by doing it within 21 days.

484
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:07,260
amondul: So.

485
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:19,380
amondul: there's also this issue where recall bias is where that degree of battery call differs between the cases and the controls right.

486
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:24,660
amondul: So I think there's some amount of like generally parents might not want to admit to certain things.

487
01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:37,860
amondul: That you can imagine that, perhaps, in this case the cases are are more likely to feel guilt and therefore not admit to some of these things that might have if they feel like they might have done these things that caused problems with their baby.

488
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:45,000
amondul: So there may be just overall poor recall or overall reporting bias, where they don't want to tell you something that is.

489
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:53,640
amondul: Maybe socially unacceptable, but that might there might be a different degree of that in the parents, whose babies had said that those who didn't right.

490
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:56,550
amondul: Does that make sense.

491
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:11,430
amondul: yeah just keep in mind this interviewing within 21 days, I think it says here minimize this recall bias, I think that should say minimize poor recall, and then the recall bias issues are when it's difference between the cases and controls.

492
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:21,180
amondul: Okay, so and then in case control study exposure and outcome or ascertained, at the same time, which can sometimes result in temporal ambiguity.

493
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:34,680
amondul: Like difficulty telling whether or not the exposure preceded the outcome, and for this particular study comment and whether you think the findings are impacted by moral ambiguity so group one.

494
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:52,770
Divya Manohar: yeah so love what we came out with all the exposures well, I mean like preceded the outcome, so there is a less likely chance of having a temporal ambiguity.

495
01:08:53,370 --> 01:09:07,710
amondul: yeah and a lot of the stuff is about taking care of the baby infant care practices which clearly with predate baby stuff right, so I don't I don't think we have as much of an issue with that here there's kind of this big major life event right so.

496
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:21,660
amondul: I think that's pretty clear and even in the controls, where the baby didn't die, you know there's kind of this, you know you've only been taking care of this baby, for a very short time, these are very young instance, so I don't think that there's a big issue.

497
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:32,610
amondul: Okay, so the data below were presented in the paper and you were asked to construct a two by two table considering the exposure of put down to sleep in the prone position which is on your stomach.

498
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:46,530
amondul: And the outcome of SIDS So this is the table that you should have come up with were sleeping in the prone position, yes, no is you're exposed and unexposed and then you have cases and controls so did anybody come up with a different table than that.

499
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:52,950
amondul: Good.

500
01:09:54,450 --> 01:10:04,980
amondul: You were then asked to calculate the odds of sleeping in the prone position among says cases and the odds of sleeping in the prone position among controls, as well as the odds ratio okay.

501
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:22,260
amondul: So this confused some people remember that the odds, is, in this case the odds of exposure in the cases would be 13 divided by 133 the prevalence of exposure in the cases would be 13 over 146 right.

502
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:34,620
amondul: But we're talking about the odds so it's not over the total it's the number exposed divided by the number unexposed kids so that gives you the opposite point oh 977.

503
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:40,920
amondul: And then the odds and exposure and the controls is five divided by 270 which gives you point 185.

504
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:52,380
amondul: And then your odds ratio is these two numbers divided by one another, so the odds of exposure in the cases divided by the odds of exposure and the controls which gives you an odds ratio of 5.28.

505
01:10:53,070 --> 01:11:07,470
amondul: So the purpose of this exercise was to show you kind of conceptually what the odds ratio is the easy calculation would be 13 times to 70 divided by five times 133 which gives you the same 5.28 mathematically.

506
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:25,830
amondul: Right and then you would interpret that this way in Scotland, for the time period 1992 319 95 babies, who died of SIDS had a 5.28 times had 5.28 times the odds of being put to bed in the prone position compared with babies, who did not diocese or you could.

507
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:34,470
amondul: You can flip it around right and say the the so you can say that the odds.

508
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:50,040
amondul: The odds of being put to bed in the prone position we're hiring babies, who died of sense that a bathing suit right kind of slipped the exposure and in your interpretation you can kind of flip the exposure and the outcome it doesn't really matter either way is true for the odds ratio.

509
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:52,470
amondul: Right.

510
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,750
amondul: So yeah that's a real thing that we have discovered.

511
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:01,200
amondul: That you put babies on their back to go to sleep.

512
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:12,690
amondul: When I had my son, he was born in 2011 and I remember, they had all these like little Wednesdays, and like sleeping the obviously the babies and like little bags with them asleep like their little zip up things and their legs are.

513
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:15,390
amondul: Like just in there and that's a little bag at the bottom.

514
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:24,720
amondul: And they had all these sleeping things it says back to bed on it so there's this whole campaign of back to bed, you know which it sounds like you're going, you know it's like a phrase, but means put them on their back to that event.

515
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:34,620
amondul: And you're not supposed to put anything in the bed with them like no stuffed animals pillows or bumpers or blankets, or anything like that you're just supposed to put them in there, like that, and when my son was born, he was a breech baby.

516
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:44,160
amondul: So his legs were like all the way up with those angles and as yours, the whole time he was in utero and so when he came out his legs were like stuck in kind of this.

517
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:54,690
amondul: l position, like the nurses came in they're like oh it's a breech baby, you know and they're like kiss his legs every time you put it down his legs and just kind of slide up in the air and so he was like this little.

518
01:12:55,710 --> 01:13:05,130
amondul: Like fall over on the site, and I can remember being like exhausted and crying really supposed to be on his back and he kept like falling other side and everything feels like a giant.

519
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:07,230
amondul: You no.

520
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:15,390
amondul: problem, so I would rather I would roll out the tiny little receiving blankets, using like baby chocks and then put them on either side of them, so he could roll over.

521
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,000
amondul: His legs are fine now it's okay.

522
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:21,990
amondul: He sleeps just fine on his back no problem he's 11.

523
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:23,580
amondul: All right.

524
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:26,670
amondul: sure he would love that I told you that story soon.

525
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:30,390
amondul: All right, that was your story time for today.

526
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:41,490
amondul: Cross sectional design, so now we're moving into cross sectional so you were asked to calculate and interpret the prevalence of H pylori zero positivity in the study population.

527
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:56,730
amondul: So you should have gotten 47.6% so in 1999 a month public public school students aged 11 through 24 years in 33 municipalities of borealis Mexico the prevalence of H pylori Sarah positivity was 47.6%.

528
01:13:58,800 --> 01:13:59,220
amondul: Okay.

529
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:05,100
amondul: You were then asked to set up to two by two tables.

530
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:19,140
amondul: With in both you are repeating the 11 to 14 year old group, so this was always the unexposed and you were then in this table you're exposed was 15 to 17 year olds, and in this table you're exposed was the 18 to 24 year olds.

531
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:32,040
amondul: Does that look right to everybody, I think we were checking as we went along that you guys were getting that right, so that we didn't have to have wrong answers going for it, but that is what you should have constructed there.

532
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:50,340
amondul: So then, you were asked asked to calculate the prevalence ratio for each exposed group compared to the unexposed group so 15 to 17 verses 11 to 14 and an order, therefore, there you would basically be calculating the prevalence of disease.

533
01:14:54,750 --> 01:15:08,940
amondul: In the exposed right so here, this is your exposed population and the prevalence of H pylori is 1052 divided by 216 30 right so of the 2163 expose people 1050 to have H pylori.

534
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:19,980
amondul: And we would then do the same for the unexposed for prevalence ratio of 1.2 and if you did that in the in the bottom table, you would get a prevalence ratio of 1.47.

535
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:26,520
amondul: Using the measurements of association calculated number three you were asked to describe what you found.

536
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:37,860
amondul: So there's a positive positive association between higher age group and prevalence H pylori infection and this group of students from 32 minutes to tell municipalities of miraculous Mexico in 1999, so this is always.

537
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:44,100
amondul: anchored in terms of what your study population is like where it is in the world, the age range of the people, the year.

538
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:53,430
amondul: Compared to 11 to 14 group the prevalence was 20% higher than 15 to 17 year old group and 47% higher in the 18 to 24 year old group.

539
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:56,580
amondul: That makes sense to everybody.

540
01:15:59,370 --> 01:16:13,020
amondul: So now you're asked to basically do the same thing, except calculate the prevalence odds ratio, just for the 18 to 24 compared to 11 to 14 and if you did, that you would get 2.18 which is now interpreted here.

541
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:16,890
Okay.

542
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:23,670
amondul: And then you were asked to compare the results in number, well, I guess it's in number.

543
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:32,280
amondul: I don't know why it says this i'm sorry this these numbers are wrong you're supposed to hear that one number 12 the ones that number 14 right.

544
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:43,320
amondul: And so, this was a little bit tricky for some groups, and I think we talked it through with many of you, but this is analogous to the rare disease assumption for the odds ratio compared to the relative risk right.

545
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:52,410
amondul: So the prevalence odds ratio compared to the prevalence ratio, the same like assumption holds like in order for the prevalence odds ratio to be a good.

546
01:16:52,890 --> 01:17:01,020
amondul: Approximation of the prevalence ratio the disease must be rare in this case it's not right, because your prevalence odds ratio was 2.18.

547
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:12,900
amondul: and your prevalence ratio is what 1.47 so that's quite a bit larger right, and so, because this H pylori Sarah positivity is not rare that's why they aren't closer together.

548
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:14,580
amondul: Right.

549
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:17,910
amondul: Here right.

550
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:26,730
amondul: So, in a second part, to the same study you find an association between the intake of milk products as your positivity H pylori.

551
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:37,770
amondul: So you're briefly asked to describe why the Cross sectional studies design is problematic for studying milk, milk intake and that's because you can't distinguish whether milk and take proceeded H pylori infection.

552
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:46,770
amondul: that's your observed association may reflect what we cause called reverse causation right so it's not necessarily that milk intake caused H pylori.

553
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:56,670
amondul: It could be that, because you have H pylori you might drink milk to decrease your discomfort right, so we can't tell whether we have chickens or X.

554
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:09,420
amondul: All right, if we look at the ecological design here, you were asked to plot this which is should look something like this, you didn't have to do an excel you could have just done it by hand.

555
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:16,980
amondul: But this makes it pretty clear that you have increasing pretty coronary heart disease mortality, with increasing milk consumption at the country level right.

556
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:27,660
amondul: So, all we can really say from this is that European countries in 1977 with higher milk consumption had higher chg mortality rates so at the country level there's an association here.

557
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:29,850
amondul: And you were asked to.

558
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:39,600
amondul: Talk about the limitations and strengths, essentially the limitations are that you don't have individual level data, and this could be causing the ecological fallacy, which we talked about right.

559
01:18:40,290 --> 01:18:48,660
amondul: Because you don't actually know if the coronary heart disease deaths were among those people with higher, the people who died of coronary heart disease, where the people drink more milk we don't know that.

560
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:54,090
amondul: And you might you can't really control for other individual level factors that might be associated right.

561
01:18:55,980 --> 01:19:02,100
amondul: and advantages of course are that it uses this existing data it's inexpensive and it can be used to generate hypotheses.

562
01:19:03,570 --> 01:19:04,140
amondul: So.

563
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,760
amondul: When you have individual level data, this is what you find.

564
01:19:10,650 --> 01:19:20,760
amondul: So you were asked to what is the likely explanation for these findings, compared to what was found in the figure generated number eight, so the relative risk for all of these is less than one which suggests what.

565
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:27,060
amondul: That no consumption is what pausing pouring your heart disease or is protective coronary heart disease.

566
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:37,260
amondul: protective right, so this is the opposite of what was seen an ecological study.

567
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:48,600
amondul: So this is based on individual level data which is based and the ecological study was based on group level data, so you actually can't be sure, with group level data that those with the outcome, are the same people that the exposure.

568
01:19:48,930 --> 01:20:00,780
amondul: So, given the results, based on these individual level data, it appears that milk drinkers are protected and so that group level data was wrong is what we conclude right so when you find something that's different in an individual level study from the ecological study.

569
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:09,750
amondul: You pretty much always assume that the galactic study was just not correct, and that was separate from the ecological fallacy right, because any individual level data is probably better than the logic study.

570
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:14,070
amondul: All right.
