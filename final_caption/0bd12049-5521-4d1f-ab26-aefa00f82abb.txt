1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,660
But I'm even going to increase Waitrose.

2
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:34,550
Oh, yes. So, yeah. Is there any way to work towards restoring like we said, we want revolution.

3
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:58,570
What's it like to get, like, 160 miles an hour?

4
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:25,360
Oh, man. I was just really, you know, like, I understand it was kind of like and so I was just like, I don't know.

5
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:33,299
I think it is interesting.

6
00:01:33,300 --> 00:02:05,310
So, like, we're not going to do that and pretty lot like a tremendous person, but it wasn't like the White House to be chopped down.

7
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:13,570
And so, I mean, I was like, yeah, I like.

8
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:29,770
Oh, well, I think about what he was saying.

9
00:02:34,250 --> 00:03:18,970
You know what? He texted me that, you know, like this last bit that seemed like this, you know what?

10
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:40,120
They they saw the shuttle every time I was back.

11
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,180
I would like to see this person.

12
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:51,210
I think, you know, I don't know.

13
00:03:51,360 --> 00:04:31,080
I was thinking, judging from that, you know, it's you know, it's like I look at it like, I guess.

14
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:57,960
I mean, you've got a guy who is picking out the last two weeks.

15
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:23,820
I want to tell you that I'm not going to choose to do so.

16
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:43,250
I mean, I'm right here with her because I love her so much.

17
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,540
I can tell you anything.

18
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,320
I like that. Okay.

19
00:05:52,410 --> 00:06:03,970
Hello, everybody. Good morning. Very nice to see so many faces, you know?

20
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:11,580
All right. So who day is still counting?

21
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,460
Some view of you. I feel good.

22
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:39,120
Well, I mean, certainly, if you cannot be here and have been where you are going to be here and you really can't get any closer than that, the prize.

23
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:48,420
And so what happened is going to be that one be one day at random.

24
00:06:48,840 --> 00:07:00,480
I am going to count. And if I see that these people are not here, are not they are not there anymore.

25
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:19,810
Even though they have. So I'm going to open up a conversation with those individuals who I certainly think that they're coming to class.

26
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:27,770
We will have you on the front. And again, it is in the making.

27
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:44,250
But I decide what I think is going because I will be taking these classes and because you always forget to watch the videos and you use they.

28
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:50,370
I just have to do the homework and I don't have to go through all the material

29
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:56,100
and then I don't go because you don't have time to review all these material.

30
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:03,200
For example, you have the one so you out and then you go learn the process.

31
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:12,630
All right. So enough of that. We were dealing with this issue of Wolf Hall last time.

32
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:20,010
And I think that I made a mistake when I again, when I did this average.

33
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:29,640
If the reason is you see says BS three to meet with these things in the these columns.

34
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:40,200
Which is the moment from the three to these eight to be 26.

35
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,090
But we don't have a forecast for.

36
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:52,410
We don't have a hold on for the first moment. So I think with that, we had 20 things.

37
00:08:52,410 --> 00:09:01,830
And then I think that the whole forecast from before so the healthy mind you, otherwise you'll get it wrong results.

38
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:13,530
So my apologies for that. I just quickly made an error highlighting these numbers.

39
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,370
This has to be for 26. Thank you.

40
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:25,450
There. Now we have 1483.

41
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:33,010
That's my seasonal factor for one. And then I can see all these numbers and they're going to be this.

42
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:39,430
So the remains of at one point or 91, we're going to see this and so on and so forth.

43
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:45,940
So everything stay the same. I said that.

44
00:09:48,770 --> 00:10:03,920
The. C4 to C4 to see 30 to 4.

45
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:16,670
Okay, so let's see. Those are holes in al Qaeda.

46
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:27,380
The key here. Yeah.

47
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:36,110
So this blue line is the forecast and the whole forecast is better than we thought last time is better than we thought.

48
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,350
But it's not as good as we thought.

49
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:49,820
We said. With with the progression data.

50
00:10:50,240 --> 00:11:00,020
So we have the whole speed was the whole trend was 2,000,788 so and so forth.

51
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:12,520
But this is. We should be in the middle of it.

52
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,960
So now that's that's where the whole threat to our economy.

53
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:25,229
That's why now what I'm going to do is compare it to things and I'll forecast with the audience always the

54
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:33,780
observations to see what ever so and going through that presentation seasonal regulation them and see.

55
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:00,820
And then I'm going to get the all the seasonal homes that we've seen.

56
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:18,939
Right. And now they may even compute the seasonal progression we see.

57
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:27,430
And that's going to be the sum of X minus Y Square on the root causes.

58
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:37,729
And then I'm going to compare the seasonal regression, the seasonal forecast that you see here.

59
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:43,510
And those are a seasonal regression for the seasonal regression.

60
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:58,300
Right. So I'm going to compare these number two here comma with the claims, you know, claims.

61
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:09,569
And I'm going to divide us by the number of conservation for which we have worked.

62
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,750
That's going to work best for anyone.

63
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,140
So I'm going to highlight because this is important.

64
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:44,700
And so we have for 28 days to the homes is going to be some of X minus wise we're going to get the alternate homes

65
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:51,630
going to be one fewer observations of people so I'm going to normalize by taking the average should be fine.

66
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,320
So the seasonal forecast for homes.

67
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:13,130
Start. All seasonal forecasts or from and for.

68
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,910
Oh two and 26. They come.

69
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,720
On the observations for.

70
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:49,130
Only 26 and then divided by the kind of observations we can have worth that you can take this column or do that on the bottom line.

71
00:14:50,060 --> 00:15:01,200
I think this one, because it's already highlighted for you where you don't see it in five for 18.

72
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:08,940
Thank you. Thank you so much for your.

73
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:25,400
Okay. Specifically the first time we were in Springfield, I think chief of police, you hear me?

74
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,940
Approximately a year.

75
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:33,680
I have lived in these streets.

76
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:40,830
I finished. And you're not willing to take the reins?

77
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:47,290
Right. And then we have the whole Timothy seven 4966.

78
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:58,840
So you see that the regulation is another regulation is a mrs. which is has more or less than that.

79
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,129
The whole regulation that they hold them mean, see.

80
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,820
So we are going to forecast with this seasonal regression.

81
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:15,790
We may see a we already need not. So no need to repeat those numbers and.

82
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,280
So that's what you do.

83
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:34,249
Most of the time, you most of the time you would try to go for the regression analysis rather than being able to see for seasonality.

84
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,490
But sometimes sometimes, you know, you get a better result.

85
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,020
Yeah. What are your values for outlook data for these values.

86
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:47,930
Yeah. I've been that that's 1.5.

87
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,170
Well. Yeah.

88
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:13,210
That's what we we did last time. So I maximize I minimize the NSC or geospatial trends to get the best outcome better for that.

89
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:18,370
I think it's because of. Right.

90
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:37,120
But the point is that if we get rid of the piano line in huge falls and we think the real problem is the blue line here,

91
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:45,490
which is also so you see that they call for, you know, observation.

92
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:56,350
The island blue are very, very close to the the predicted observation that, you know, yeah,

93
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:01,450
that predictive observation and the predictive information will will give you a much

94
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:07,750
better and a much better depiction of what's going to happen in this interval,

95
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:15,730
in following the pattern. So I'm going to move on now and you'll see this tree line that we were computing people.

96
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:23,740
So that's what I wanted to say about seasonality. Any questions?

97
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:38,190
So today we are going to start dealing with this issue and analysis and dealt with this issue and analysis.

98
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:46,690
We are going to be using later on some software and the software I'm gonna introduce you to the software right now,

99
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:54,260
and this is what we're going to do. I just.

100
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,530
So I go to our sister site.

101
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:21,840
So you will see on the syllabus. Now we have a decision tools, you know, link and a Rosevear to a lab.

102
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:31,380
So let's start with a virtual lab. So for those of you who have Mac, this is your only option goes to the goal.

103
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,709
I go through that process into a lab. You don't have to start.

104
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:56,440
Yeah. Your bike isn't working well, so. I think when I don't feel good, I'm out of that.

105
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,070
Student news this.

106
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,710
As time passes, I hope.

107
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:05,390
What did you tell us? Okay.

108
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:21,410
All right. So we are going to the rose viewing to allow first those with moms and those which

109
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:26,720
are pieces you can do that when you get windows or not go as you can do this.

110
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,170
We'll go to that Rosemary to allow and in doing the install of the VM where

111
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:42,740
so we're just going to directly to the HD HD email axis is easier to canvas,

112
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:51,680
which you accept and you enter your unique name and your primary password.

113
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:58,150
Then the one password just oh yeah, that's right.

114
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:19,630
You know, my husband, you know, and once you are here, you just want to rose anywhere.

115
00:22:26,590 --> 00:23:02,610
You think sometimes. You know.

116
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,540
You can try it.

117
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:37,920
And then once you are here and you are connected to one of the need for a lot of and then you go in

118
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:48,810
do you select them many of the into programs and then you you go to the P and then the P on the P,

119
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:52,200
you say you get poly saying decision to.

120
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:08,240
I think the poly syndication tools are there a series of menus and digital programs that you need so that you can

121
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:17,570
you can work as an add ons to excel so you don't have to do anything but click on the one that you would need.

122
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,649
So finally, say this issue of tools.

123
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:28,820
Let's open what we're going to use starting to use next week or the following month.

124
00:24:29,120 --> 00:25:04,340
And let's go to position three. I think it's a lot of.

125
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:31,500
Yeah. You. Beat anyone.

126
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:40,940
And so you are loading. Then you should have the courage to.

127
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:57,000
Which is true.

128
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,940
Okay. So I don't want to waste more of their time here.

129
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,360
The idea is that you should open exhale and you should have a menu.

130
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,770
Same position. 3:00? Yes.

131
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:22,920
And then we will use that thing. Suites, positions. And you want to log out of the Rosarito lab?

132
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:27,690
You'll simply just learn out there.

133
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:42,090
Right. So one thing it is important to note is that you are not going to be able to store permanently your work in in those machines.

134
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:58,380
So what I recommend is that you map either your Google drive Uma, if you will, probably, or simply, you know, if you are working,

135
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:13,260
you can actually create a new border in that computer to say and you can say it can exist before and then work on that folder.

136
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:18,160
And at the end you simply zip that folder, right?

137
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,510
You will go and send it to compressed folder and email that to yourself.

138
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:33,920
So you you'll simply create a zip file with what you have done that day.

139
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,700
You'll email that to yourself, and then you don't.

140
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:46,100
You won't work. You will lose your order. Because the next time you try to get into the procedure, into a new plan,

141
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:52,520
you are going to be in another computer and they clean up all those computers every night.

142
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:01,890
So let's log out of date from 2003.

143
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:30,960
I just. Look, I'm simply going to try to.

144
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,330
Account X in this window.

145
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:46,159
And that's it. Now, for those of you who do not mind, some don't want to do that.

146
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,770
Do not have that. When you have a Windows computer and you don't want to go to the grocery store.

147
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,210
You can install the software in your computers, in your Windows machine.

148
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:04,610
And if we go to our campus site that.

149
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:59,020
Each. Let's go back to our campus side and.

150
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:16,560
Then let's go to the main.

151
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:25,030
When you hear and then we go into decision tools and in the decision tools

152
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:33,120
you have one file to download downloaded into a separate folder if you want.

153
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:49,370
This is. Okay.

154
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:57,350
So what if what I recommend you to do this is the decision too.

155
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,590
They have to have two files. What I recommend you to do.

156
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:07,620
First is extract those file first and put it in them.

157
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:25,200
In in so it's in download and the decision tools in your cell just to to know where they are and you

158
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:36,690
can leave it there but you can if you want just create a new a new folder where you put those file.

159
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:49,900
So you're going to delete everything that you want. And once you do that, simply just double click on the set of files they have.

160
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:58,990
Those files have to be together. You don't have to do anything with the license, but you know, I cannot install it on and so forth here.

161
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:11,170
But you put your your you have admin rights in your computer and if you do that, then you will install the decision tools in your computer.

162
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:16,660
So you have that available. When you use Excel, you've got it.

163
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:21,490
When you use Excel, you can say, Well, I want to use position, precision train.

164
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:26,690
So you double click on the and I'm going to open decision tree and you will add on,

165
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:37,390
but it's going to be a menu and in the ribbon you're going to have an older, you know, many options as to position three and so on.

166
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:44,840
So I'm going to get that installed here. Well, that's all there is to it.

167
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:55,979
So make sure that they are in the same folder so the two files and you don't have to do anything with the license file so that it is done.

168
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:02,010
So far it is best for the powerful if you where to buy it.

169
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:09,540
And the the industry version that I have I think is in 2000, 3004.

170
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:22,620
But and you said the industry standard to do simulation and decision analysis and so on, they they means that we are going to learn from practice.

171
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:26,579
You can do most of them. We solved this.

172
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:34,469
So for I am going to be generic enough and introduce you to the theory so you

173
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:39,390
can use either online software or you can do a lot of the things in Excel.

174
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:47,250
They are going to be a lot more work now with it with these tools, but you'll use a theory to do it.

175
00:33:48,780 --> 00:34:05,309
So they view is that these software is available to you for a year either a year from now I'm 38 over 31st is going to be unavailable.

176
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:15,040
So if you find a job that that you think you'll need or you'll use software like that,

177
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:28,469
this company is likely to have it and not you can always download a free version for like 15 days

178
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:34,890
or something and ask them your company to write that so that they should be able to help them.

179
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:47,240
So or you can do it yourself and you make them more or no more difficult, cumbersome.

180
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:54,310
All right, that's it. So today what I'm going to do is introduce this issue,

181
00:34:54,310 --> 00:35:05,459
an analysis I want as a homework that you simply download the software or access the decision to in the view,

182
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:11,190
to allow and see whether it's working right and does so next week.

183
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:16,470
If we have to use it, then you'll have it available to you.

184
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:25,680
All right. So now I am going to go in to assignments.

185
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:37,770
Let's start with a homeowner before you have a decision to write a decision or not.

186
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:46,050
So I am we are going to do programing 15.5 first and then doing probably 15.5.

187
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:53,520
I am proud. You know, we are going to familiarize ourselves with the.

188
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:01,850
With what? With with the theory. Okay.

189
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:20,620
15 10.5 because one of the fittest man's investment is going to mature and he wants to determine how to invest the proceeds of $30,000.

190
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:28,180
Phillip is considering two new investment is both mutual fund and a one year certificate of deposit.

191
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:34,449
See the policy these guarantee to pay an 8% return visit estimate.

192
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:46,910
The return of this dumping plan is 16% because 9% or -2% depending on whether the market conditions are good, average or poor respectively.

193
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:55,840
Our feelings estimate the probability of a good average bull market to be 41.80 5.05 respectively.

194
00:36:56,350 --> 00:37:00,640
First is construct a of main things for this problem.

195
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:08,860
So now I'm going to open and sale. We have to sell here and then I am going to start by.

196
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:20,580
Selecting first put on 15.5% in writing in the.

197
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:53,660
And so this is the decision is in in a nutshell, this is a series of scientific methodologies to help you make a decision on their uncertain future.

198
00:37:54,230 --> 00:38:05,180
So you have choices now and you pick one choice, and then you like that choice to give you the best outcome in the future, but you're not sure.

199
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:13,070
So what you're doing now is trying to pick the decision that maximizes your chance of being,

200
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:18,380
you know, getting them to the best, the optimal earning, if you want,

201
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:29,870
and the optimal earning can be maximize profit or revenue or minimize cause to maximize the number of patients you see,

202
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:38,600
maximize the number of life or save whatever, you know, a goal you have in mind, right?

203
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:48,649
So what we are going to do is introduce that to decision analysis.

204
00:38:48,650 --> 00:39:04,129
What we call simple decision analysis and simple decision analysis is said is a kind of situation in that you have one is been it's a one step game.

205
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:12,050
You start you're playing a game against nature and then is you make a move.

206
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:15,860
That's your decision. And then nature makes a move.

207
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:20,900
That's the uncertainty and that's it. You want to win that game.

208
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:25,040
So you're, you know, you're making that an play.

209
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:32,810
What is one move? One move from you, one move from nature in which so would you?

210
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:37,760
The first thing you have to do is list all the things that you can do.

211
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:49,940
And those are decisions and then list all the things that nature can respond with and that those are what we call is things of nature.

212
00:39:50,270 --> 00:40:00,110
And so now I am going to do that, create a table.

213
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:10,430
And in that table I'm going to list on the on the side the possible decision on on all the possible states of nature.

214
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:16,910
Okay. So what are the possible decisions? Now.

215
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:22,190
You got me. Invest in a CD.

216
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:26,840
Invest in a mutual fund and do so.

217
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:34,020
So you have the stocks of Citi. So is of.

218
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:59,709
And CD. And what are the they?

219
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:04,900
Then they respond from nature. What are the possible responses from the Incas?

220
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:17,440
So things that are uncertain, you you invest in stocks or you invest in seed, then that's now.

221
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:24,220
And you make your decision and then you wait. And then what are the things that need to be done?

222
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:30,300
You. One of the things are uncertain here.

223
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:38,800
The market demand exactly the market. And what are the possible outcomes from the market?

224
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:42,760
For average users, not for average and good.

225
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:46,780
Exactly. So the market response would be or.

226
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:57,650
The average. And you can be good.

227
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:07,800
For them, they are mutually exclusive you to have a combination.

228
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:17,880
Those are the only possibilities right now. What we want to do is maximize our return from the investment.

229
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:27,610
Right. So you invest something that I think is 10,000, $20,000 and remember $50,000 investment.

230
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:43,420
Let's put here. And then 30,000.

231
00:42:50,370 --> 00:43:02,030
Right now. What what I would like now to know is going to be all these these they or better.

232
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:14,630
I want to know how much money I would be making if I invest in stocks and I get a poor mark.

233
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:28,000
So this game, let's gave me the market return here first and then I guess then they will come compute the payoff table.

234
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:34,010
What is the market returns or see these 8% no matter where right now.

235
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:43,970
Okay, so it's 8%. And 8% no matter where.

236
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:54,049
And could you please tell me what are the dogs and what is the return from this dog?

237
00:43:54,050 --> 00:44:00,890
So awful? Averaging negative to 2%.

238
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:11,740
Right now, you do need to do 2% and then the average at nine.

239
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,240
And good 16%.

240
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:30,360
So going to starve it would be preferable, except that you have the possibility of losing money.

241
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:35,520
Right. So and going to see these is more stable.

242
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:43,980
Right. You minimize the risk going into CDs because at the same, you are sure to earn a 8%.

243
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:50,300
Right. So what what you're going to do is translate that those percentages return.

244
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:57,300
We can leave it like that, but we can then get to translate the percentage returns into wanting.

245
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:22,340
Do this here and then. The structure is right, and I don't need these anymore.

246
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:30,050
So let's say that I want that this is going to be the payload they want.

247
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:43,880
Let's. And this is going to be the return of my money.

248
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:53,110
So the 30,000 so you just multiply 30,000 times these numbers is there is one there

249
00:45:53,120 --> 00:46:00,479
money in this so you can add the investment or you can just leave that as a return.

250
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,420
That doesn't matter. So I'm going to leave the investment out.

251
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:15,460
So but this is the same thing, right? So it's going to be equal to the low.

252
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:20,360
If we go to the investment and we call that the investment.

253
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:46,130
Now that sale is called the investment and then I am going to get that return going to be equal to the investment.

254
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:59,200
He's over here. Hines is going to be the first stop on.

255
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:04,800
Right. So for every single possibility, I'm going to compute.

256
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,460
What is the that we don't.

257
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:17,180
So I am now thinking making.

258
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,870
-600. I know it's nice, but it shouldn't. It should be sent.

259
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:36,740
You think so?

260
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:47,760
Right. And then I'm just simply going to copy this formula.

261
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,280
And I have all my entries. Right?

262
00:47:53,310 --> 00:48:08,340
So those are going to be my every turn is I think if I if I go for the stubs and there's a $30,000 in stock, then I lose $600.

263
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:11,450
Right. So a debit card. Yeah.

264
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:21,660
When I do 600 go. If I invest in the stock and get an average market average return, then I'm going to get 20 $700.

265
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:26,700
If I invest and see the no matter what, I'm going to get 20 $400.

266
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:33,420
Right. So that's so this is a game once called the pay your thing.

267
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,860
You know, you can have many decisions in many states of nature.

268
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:44,040
And then you just go into the in the very section of decisions that is state of nature.

269
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:48,959
Then you put your bail. Okay.

270
00:48:48,960 --> 00:49:05,090
So what we are going to do now? What I'm going to do is that these people.

271
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:17,250
Let's. What I'm going to do now is start making decisions.

272
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,740
And if you see, I'm asking one of you.

273
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:28,850
Any of you. So if you have that situation, then you have to analyze this.

274
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:35,700
What decision would you make? You don't know anything about how likely those states of nature are right now.

275
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:47,100
They told you so. We we have at least it would assume that you have absolutely no idea of the, you know, how likely those states of nature are.

276
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:59,400
What decision would you make? You probably won't most risk averse because you are risk averse.

277
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:17,490
And, you know, some of you might say, oh, well, I am going to Starbucks because I have, you know, all these things of nature.

278
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:22,589
You know, give me the 2020 740 800.

279
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:30,480
It's not that I'm I know there are more probable, but I have the opportunity in this case to earn up to 40 $800.

280
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:40,140
Right. So I don't care about losing 600 if I have the opportunity to make 4800.

281
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:46,560
So some of you might say that some of you might say I'm going toward a sure thing.

282
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,760
That depends on your risk tolerance.

283
00:50:52,080 --> 00:51:03,150
That's an individual decision. Now, for situations like these to capitalize or to to formalize your individual decision making,

284
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:09,360
we have a series of rule about what in your mind you are trying to achieve.

285
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:14,100
Maybe you are a risk seeking individual,

286
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:24,390
and what you are trying to do is to make that decision that potentially maximizes the amount of money that you're going to get.

287
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:38,250
So in this case, you would say, like, what is the best that I can do in stocks?

288
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:45,080
Well, it's 40 $800. Right. But I'm going to formalize that by putting the maximum.

289
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:55,690
Of these injuries.

290
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:02,870
20 $800. And then what about the CDs?

291
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:07,480
What is the maximum that you're going to? 2400.

292
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:16,090
And then your decision is I am going to maximize out of those two decisions.

293
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:22,840
I want to maximize their I'm going to take the one that gave me the possibility of earning the most amount of money.

294
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:26,770
And that's going to be the stocks right there, their stocks.

295
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:32,560
And in this case, you are using what we call the max c max rule.

296
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:38,950
So this is maximized for risk in individual three, you know.

297
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:46,300
And you are going to be making.

298
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:49,570
You are going to be making 4800 or.

299
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:59,510
That correspond with stocks. So a decision is that you're going to invest $30,000 in the stock.

300
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:09,140
Now, let's assume that you are a risk averse individual.

301
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:27,620
So let me all the you. Suppose that you are risk averse individual and you want to maximize your profit.

302
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:34,220
But you want to hedge against the losses and big losses.

303
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:39,080
Right. So what you are going to do is the following.

304
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:43,640
You are going to pay for.

305
00:53:43,670 --> 00:54:02,080
Sorry. You are.

306
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:10,020
You are going to look for the worst thing that can happen in each one of those entries,

307
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:18,270
in each one of those decisions, and then pick the one that minimizes that maximum loss.

308
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:33,780
So you are saying, okay, I may be able to make 4800 fine, but I can lose 600 in the stock and I don't like to lose 600.

309
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:39,360
And what about in see these? Only I can make 2400.

310
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:50,350
Right. So you just go for each this issue being the minimum, the worst thing that can happen because you want to prevent catastrophes.

311
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:55,740
And then you go, here is what we call the maximum rule.

312
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:10,010
You're going to go into the fall and you say, okay, I wonder if anyone.

313
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:16,270
Oh. Thank you. Thank you.

314
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:22,239
And. I just called.

315
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:29,320
I just look for it, replicate that formula, look for the medium on each decision.

316
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:37,500
And then I'm going to say, okay, what is the maximum of those minimum, you know, out of the worst thing that can happen?

317
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:40,930
How can we perform and how can I perform best?

318
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:44,920
And how can I get the best of the worst situation?

319
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:50,170
And then you go for CDs because if you go for a stocks who are going can lose 600.

320
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:56,049
If you go for C these you the worst that can happen is you've made 20 $400.

321
00:55:56,050 --> 00:56:07,360
So you go you maximize that and this is going to be your and your decision going forward.

322
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:22,540
See these so if something the names are chosen so you have t and they are mnemonic so they remind you what's the one thing that you are trying to do?

323
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:26,560
Maximize means maximize the maximum profit.

324
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:35,319
So you take the maximum profit for each one of those entries by by decision and then

325
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:41,680
maximize that the maximum will be maximum maximizing is maximize the minimum profit.

326
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:51,840
So you think the minimum the worst thing that can happen in each stock some C need and the maximum of it so is the

327
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:59,920
the some people operationalize that saying okay I'm going to play it a I'm going to play a game against nature.

328
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:10,030
And nature is either in my favor, nature is playing trying to help me or nature is against me.

329
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:14,169
So if you think these are a risk categories, you are an optimist.

330
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:18,190
This is what call an optimist rule. And then you say, nature is in my favor.

331
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:24,160
So whatever thing I think nature is going to respond with the best decision for me.

332
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:29,799
And in this case you say, okay, if I think start nature is going to pick a good economy.

333
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:35,170
If I go get a C, the nature is going to pick any of them because they're the same.

334
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:41,230
So I'm good. I'm going to get the one that makes my and my profit get it my profit maximizing.

335
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:50,530
On the other hand, if you're a pessimist and so translate into a very risk averse individual, you're a pessimist.

336
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:55,790
You say, it doesn't matter what I do, I'm going to get the worst possible scenario.

337
00:57:55,990 --> 00:58:00,639
Nature is going to respond with the worst possible scenario for me.

338
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:09,040
So if I go for stocks, nature is going to give me a poor market that I'm going to be losing six on the record.

339
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:15,820
And if I go for C, these nature is going to respond with any of them because they are all the same.

340
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:22,899
So 2400. So why are you in the know you're maximizing and then get then 2400.

341
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:26,680
So is the best of the bad situations, right?

342
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:39,339
So go maximum. You know this this is also for the optimistic criterion and this is a pessimistic criterion usually with

343
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:46,510
people don't come on that pessimistic optimistic decision making in in pessimistic decision making.

344
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:56,400
When you don't have any idea of how likely those entries are, then we're talking about maxing out some.

345
00:58:56,410 --> 00:59:00,340
I'd say there's another one and going to.

346
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:20,490
Sure. You know. The cities where I live.

347
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:30,330
So there's another one that I want to show you, another decision making rule.

348
00:59:42,280 --> 01:00:15,260
You know this. That's.

349
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:29,790
I know, I know.

350
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:44,370
There is another way to make decisions is trying to minimize your regret instead of minimizing or maximizing your potential earnings.

351
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:50,849
Right. You want to minimize your potential regrets.

352
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:56,909
So you're right. I'm making 400, but I could be making a thousand.

353
01:00:56,910 --> 01:01:08,190
That I regret is 600, right. So I don't think I want the decision that minimizes that or what we call the opportunity loss or regrets in this game.

354
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:12,720
And that's another way to make decisions. And.

355
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:17,420
So in that you said pessimistic criteria.

356
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:28,670
Right. So the pessimistic criterion is I am going to take a look at the worst scenario that I can have.

357
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:37,170
Right. So this is going to be. I've been to the.

358
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,260
This is my story. This is my state of things.

359
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:52,270
So what I'm going to do first, I was joking here is going strong.

360
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:56,100
I know the table called the red table. So this is it.

361
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:05,260
This is the opportunity loss table that I want to compute, something that is called that regret pain.

362
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:18,070
He's also for the opportunity lost able and then the opportunity lost the table.

363
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:28,760
I'm going to compute regrets in how much money I'm losing because I didn't make the best decisions under state of the code.

364
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:32,230
Let's say that I pick stocks.

365
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:42,640
I suppose that I pick stocks and my column and the state of nature happens to be poor.

366
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:52,990
So what would be my regret there? I'm sorry.

367
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:57,390
Well, let's see what happens. I am losing 600.

368
01:02:57,410 --> 01:03:00,700
Right. And I could have been making 2400.

369
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:08,080
So my regret is going to be the maximum that I can make my nose what I'm making.

370
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:14,380
So take a look at the maximum that you see in that in that courtroom.

371
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:22,100
I'm surprised they you know, the the entry that that you got.

372
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:29,260
So it's going to be, in this case, the maximum of these call them.

373
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:43,350
Mine is in three opening cylinders, and then you got 3000 on it.

374
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:48,590
You, you you are seeing somewhere in the hole where you could have been making three 2400.

375
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:56,360
Then your regret is 3000. I am going to do the same thing for the kids.

376
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:06,589
Right. And the point is these. They say that I am going to fix that in this case.

377
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:10,810
And then I think that by my quarters.

378
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:19,910
So I'm going to leave the and, you know, things like column by row by rose, I'm going to leave the flooding.

379
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:29,180
So this is going to be. One this is going to be.

380
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:43,980
So you see, what I'm doing is by by doing this whenever I copy that formula is going to get the,

381
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:52,770
the, the maximum of each column is going to be the maximum of the, the maximum of the maximum of S.

382
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:58,380
But any formula in this column is going to remain the same, the maximum of that column.

383
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:04,650
And then I'm going to subtract the the corresponding cell.

384
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:14,520
Okay. Okay.

385
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:22,480
So what should be the regret of these equation zero.

386
01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:35,190
Right. You make the best decision. So you if you make that, if you decided to go for c these, then you could be making 2400, but you are making 2400.

387
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:39,090
So you have no regret that they might copy this formula.

388
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:46,310
I think we had zero. What about here?

389
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:53,650
It stops in an average. So you suppose that a big start and I get an average entry?

390
01:05:53,670 --> 01:06:01,500
What is going to be the rate? There is zero because that's the maximum right on the ground.

391
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:04,919
The regret here is going to be 300.

392
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:08,220
Right. So let me copy now all these formula.

393
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:31,060
So I have my regrets. So 30,000 for his thugs and then CBS 320 for me.

394
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:37,010
All right. So I think that nature is against me is a pessimistic criteria.

395
01:06:37,610 --> 01:06:42,170
And nature is going to try to maximize my regrets.

396
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:52,370
Right. So whatever whatever decision I make, nature is going to because I'm pessimist, nature is going to say,

397
01:06:52,580 --> 01:07:02,420
oh, if you if you go for a start, nature is going to select a poor state of nature.

398
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:09,410
And if I go for CB's, nature is going to be a good of mind, right?

399
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:18,580
So to maximize every grade, so you compute the maximum, the regrets, and that's going to be the maximum, the impact on the.

400
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:26,960
She? He's.

401
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:43,110
Just the maximum distance as these numbers.

402
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:55,970
I'm going to be the minimum of that 24 because I want to make I want to pick the

403
01:07:56,140 --> 01:08:07,970
the I want to pick the decision that will minimize my potential maximum regret.

404
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:18,490
So that's what we call these minimize or minimize regret greatly.

405
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:50,000
But so those if you have absolutely no idea of what you know, what what you know, what the probability of this state of nature.

406
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:59,030
You don't know anything about what is the potential likelihood of the state of danger before average or good.

407
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:04,850
Then you peak depending on how you feel about return and risk.

408
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:12,110
And so you say, okay, in this situation, I don't mind losing 600, but I would like to give them 4800.

409
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:22,240
So you pick the maximize criteria and you get okay, then you get the maximum of each each row and then going to maximize those maximum,

410
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:25,460
if this case is thought, will give you the opportunity to do that.

411
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:37,639
And remember, you don't know. It could be that if you knew that the that the law has a probability of 95%, you then pick it.

412
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:41,720
But you don't know it. You don't know anything about that.

413
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:50,060
In this case, you are a risk averse individual and you pick to see these because you want to minimize your risk.

414
01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:53,450
You don't want to be losing 600 lawyer.

415
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:58,690
And in this case, you want to minimize your regrets, your opportunity loss.

416
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,430
I did this, but I could have been getting that.

417
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:09,140
And, you know, you construct what we call the regret table is also called the opportunity loss statement.

418
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:19,070
And, you know, what is the worst that can happen for each decision in terms of and in terms of regret?

419
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:24,860
And then you minimize that and minimize regret rule.

420
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:33,710
So actually just let me also member this is the opportunity.

421
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:51,620
Last. To inject.

422
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:08,050
That it seems. I know most of the time you are going.

423
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:16,210
You have an idea. So you have data and you have knowledge about what's the likelihood of having it pull out of things that,

424
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:21,610
you know, in essence, you have an idea about the state of nature, about how likely they are.

425
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:30,520
You you see that the trend in the economy and you can kind of forecast you can, you know,

426
01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:43,680
do a whole lot matters with the trend of a regression if you want, within trends of of the,

427
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:47,860
you know, the market return and figure it out where, you know,

428
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:55,780
is it more likely to have a good market or important market to live for me or an average market.

429
01:11:56,020 --> 01:12:05,229
Right. Or. So it's you have that that kind of things that if you have data or if you have expert

430
01:12:05,230 --> 01:12:12,130
opinion or you have a a model that can try to predict what's going to happen in the future,

431
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:19,050
you can have a guess about the possibilities of the fate of nature.

432
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:25,990
You're not going to know exactly what's going to happen, but you know exactly you know, what is more likely.

433
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:28,030
So you if you forecast,

434
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:38,290
you see work your expectation model hold say that you're going to have a 17% return to sort of that that's that's a high margin right that

435
01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:50,559
and then you can say well you know let's let's take an and what is what is you know the worst that can happen and then what is the you know,

436
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:58,900
definitely best that can happen. So you can see they are after you get your your return that is,

437
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:08,469
you know high you know that this is less likely to have an average economy are very much less

438
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:15,340
likely be a a poor economy and so you can quantify income good numbers those probabilities.

439
01:13:15,490 --> 01:13:18,760
Yes, I do have an idea of those numbers.

440
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:22,450
And then you, you know, put the probabilities there.

441
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:39,640
So and we can we can do some computations that makes forecasting and decision analysis later on, probably next week, even though day in week ahead.

442
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:46,180
But for now, I'm going to pick my Bay of Table again.

443
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:15,360
Okay. So tell me on my bingo table again.

444
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:22,040
And right now they give me the probability how likely the state of nature of that.

445
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:28,680
Right. What are the probability of that watermark? Oh.

446
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:44,270
25 resigned to the 5%, 5%, 5%, 5%, 4.05 slide by 5% and then average.

447
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:50,940
85%. 85%. 85 and good.

448
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:56,320
There is a 10% rate.

449
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:05,790
So now we have those are the probabilities of a state of nature.

450
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:10,770
And you make we make sure that when you put probabilities on the state of nature,

451
01:15:10,770 --> 01:15:21,270
they're almost out of the one eye because that's a mutually exclusive and comprehensive display of what can happen in the future.

452
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:25,950
You can not have any other possibility there if we're not very good,

453
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:32,100
and then you put the probabilities up because that's the complete set of possibilities,

454
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,940
the probabilities most than one, and they are mutually exclusive.

455
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:49,890
Okay, now if you have that one would be a good way, a sensible way to pick either is or the city.

456
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:04,350
One sensible way. I'm not saying that it would be as or only.

457
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:10,410
The only one there is, but the one that we use the most is called respect the monitoring body.

458
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:17,880
So what you do is for each decision figured out what is the expectation?

459
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:28,440
If you actually can repeat this experiment many times every year, you do it stocks, right.

460
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:31,950
Some so many some years you're going to get for some.

461
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:36,770
So in some years, you're going to average some. Some years you're going to be do it.

462
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:39,840
And it doesn't matter. What if you please Dr. nobody.

463
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:54,660
But you know you know historically how many years was a the the potential of poor being the potential of average, the potential of good.

464
01:16:54,870 --> 01:17:02,340
And then you say, okay, I am going to because I invest in a stock on average in the long run,

465
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:06,540
how much money I would be making right now, then you compute that.

466
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:14,660
Whereas there will be the expectation of the return of this stock.

467
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:19,190
You just multiply the return by the probability.

468
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:27,900
Yeah. Yes, exactly. You multiply the return by the corresponding probability.

469
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:32,330
All right. And then add them all. And that's the print.

470
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:38,990
That's the number. The center of gravity of this dog.

471
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:42,440
What you are going to get, you know, with dogs.

472
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:48,110
And then you can use that as a representative of the the decision.

473
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:53,150
Now, you know that you are not going to get the expected monetary value.

474
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:59,420
But the idea is that you are going to be close, you know, with the entries.

475
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:03,470
You are going to be closer than, you know, any other number that you can.

476
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:10,360
And that you can have that the inspector more monetary value will minimize what we call the.

477
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:20,780
That means wherever. Right. So that's the monetary value will minimize the MSE if you do that.

478
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:28,920
So now I am going to go eat with dogs.

479
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:36,900
And then when I got here, I spent ten more than three body.

480
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:51,360
You and the. And then with respect to monetary value, I am going to some I'm going to take the products on some everything.

481
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:56,600
So is essentially doing what there's some problem, right?

482
01:18:57,210 --> 01:19:02,010
So that's that's a function in itself that can do that that is quoted some from.

483
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:06,120
And there's some problem. I'm going to show you the.

484
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:19,220
Equal to. In parentheses.

485
01:19:19,690 --> 01:19:29,349
And then I'm going to get this dog's feel and then I'm going to multiply them times and all their range.

486
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:37,390
That is going to be the same magnitude that that same configuration and number of corresponding elements.

487
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:39,729
And these are going to be the probabilities, right?

488
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:47,480
And the probabilities I'm going to fix because I want to copy that formula and then I'm going to close by three.

489
01:19:47,950 --> 01:20:04,360
And then I got 27, 45, $2,745 is going to be my expectation is I using expected monetary value and if I use the AC D,

490
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:12,700
this is the same rate because it's one number multiplied by, you know, the numbers that I did that doesn't add up to one.

491
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:21,099
So have to be the same. So the average pretty much that weighted average of these numbers is right.

492
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:34,450
So, so they just get paid.

493
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:44,150
So in this case, you would be getting 2745 into account.

494
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:58,060
That is the expected 20, 39% and 15.

495
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:38,350
Just means anything, you know, very long.

496
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:43,450
I mean, it's just.

497
01:21:48,250 --> 01:22:03,740
If. Let's just do.

498
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:24,129
Okay. So. There is an assignment that you need to contribute to complete right now.

499
01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:35,120
So go and say I'm here and I need to publish it.

500
01:22:35,170 --> 01:22:39,180
Thank you. I was just calling you.

501
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:46,750
You know, I'm sorry for doing this.

502
01:22:47,350 --> 01:22:53,450
Me right now. I mean, who is gonna take this assignment in two years?

503
01:22:55,170 --> 01:23:04,810
Yeah. This is.

504
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:17,940
You are done. You're free to go. I know.

505
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:39,790
I exclaimed over 11 years ago when I was just like, Get out of here.

506
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:46,419
But I was like, I know, like straight up.

507
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:55,660
Like, I don't like you. Tell her that I love you.

508
01:23:55,720 --> 01:24:12,130
I was like, Oh, yes, I can see you in forever.

509
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:20,140
You can do bad, bro. So you're Punjabi night?

510
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:25,120
Yeah, I know. Last year, I just.

511
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:51,930
I was going to take you with you because I know you're going to get hurt.

512
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:58,660
It just. It just takes what I feel like.
