00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,426
Hello, this is the first in a set
of two lectures covering hypothesis

2
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,112
testing in biostatistics.

3
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:16,172
This lecture will cover the concepts
of Type I and Type II errors.

4
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:20,183
I'd like to take your attention back to
two things that I mentioned in previous

5
00:00:20,183 --> 00:00:20,804
lectures.

6
00:00:20,804 --> 00:00:23,895
The first to remember is
that your sample by itself

7
00:00:23,895 --> 00:00:26,035
is not of primary interest to you.

8
00:00:26,035 --> 00:00:30,367
Your primary goal is instead to use
the sample to describe the rest of

9
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:33,493
the population that you
were unable to observe.

10
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:35,776
We would like to make inference or

11
00:00:35,776 --> 00:00:40,759
conclusions from the sample about
what the population might look like.

12
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:45,374
And remember that just as your sample
has two values we call statistics.

13
00:00:45,374 --> 00:00:47,091
The first is the sample mean,

14
00:00:47,091 --> 00:00:50,880
X bar, and the second is the sample
standard deviation, S sub X.

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,385
There are corresponding values in
the population that we call parameters.

16
00:00:55,385 --> 00:00:57,073
They are represented by Greek letters.

17
00:00:57,073 --> 00:01:00,675
The Greek letter mu represents
the population mean, and

18
00:01:00,675 --> 00:01:05,261
the Greek letter sigma represents
the population standard deviation.

19
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:10,453
The Greek letter mu, the population mean,
is the parameter where we are interested.

20
00:01:10,453 --> 00:01:13,838
The Greek letter sigma is
viewed as a nuisance parameter.

21
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:18,047
We do not have any interest
in that parameter except how

22
00:01:18,047 --> 00:01:21,537
it affects our inference for
the value of mu.

23
00:01:21,537 --> 00:01:24,527
We use the values of X bar and
S sub X, the sample mean and

24
00:01:24,527 --> 00:01:26,352
the sample standard deviation.

25
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:32,419
To make inference about what we think the
value for the population mean might be.

26
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:36,992
So we might want to know what a specific
value of the population mean might be and

27
00:01:36,992 --> 00:01:39,646
whether or
not we can refute it with the data.

28
00:01:39,646 --> 00:01:43,231
We have a hypothesis therefore
about what mu might be, and

29
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:46,974
we would like to show that the data
do not support this value.

30
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:51,061
For example, my population might be
all six year old children who live

31
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:53,010
in the United States in poverty.

32
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,803
The Greek letter mu represents the mean
number of teeth with cavities by age six

33
00:01:57,803 --> 00:01:59,047
in these children.

34
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:01,508
And my hypothesis is that mu equals 8.

35
00:02:01,508 --> 00:02:05,433
In other words, I might think in the
population that the children who are six

36
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:08,021
years old living in poverty
in the United States.

37
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:13,437
On average, have about 8 carious
teeth by the time they are six,

38
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:15,810
this is my null hypothesis.

39
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,420
In statistical hypothesis testing,

40
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,748
every null hypothesis is compared
to its contrary statement.

41
00:02:22,748 --> 00:02:26,104
We call this contrary statement
the alternative hypothesis.

42
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,193
And it includes every value for

43
00:02:28,193 --> 00:02:32,699
the population mean that is not
specified by the null hypothesis.

44
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,699
Therefore, in my previous example,

45
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:37,829
the null hypothesis says that
the population mean mu is 8.

46
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:42,911
The alternative is therefore that
the population mean mu is not equal to 8.

47
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:47,420
Our goal now is to determine whether or
not the data support the truth of

48
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,719
the alternative relative
to the null hypothesis.

49
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,428
It is important to note
that we are only trying to

50
00:02:53,428 --> 00:02:56,288
assess the truth of
the alternative hypothesis.

51
00:02:56,288 --> 00:03:02,079
We are never trying to assess
the truth of the null hypothesis.

52
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:05,485
Now, hypothesis testing in science
might seem somewhat abstract.

53
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:10,375
But it is analagous to how the US
criminal court system determines guilt.

54
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,728
The null hypothesis is that
the defendant is innocent, and

55
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:16,553
the alternative is that
the defendant is guilty.

56
00:03:16,553 --> 00:03:19,333
We first assume innocence
of the defendant, so

57
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,912
we assume that the null
hypothesis is true.

58
00:03:21,912 --> 00:03:25,533
We then present data,
evidence in the court system,

59
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:28,355
that might support guilt of a defendant.

60
00:03:28,355 --> 00:03:31,032
Again, guilt is
the alternative hypothesis.

61
00:03:31,032 --> 00:03:35,092
And we hope that the data present
results that are beyond a reasonable

62
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:37,899
doubt that support
the guilt of the defendant.

63
00:03:37,899 --> 00:03:42,257
The idea of beyond a reasonable
doubt is what we call statistical

64
00:03:42,257 --> 00:03:44,930
significance in hypothesis testing.

65
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,028
Now once the data have been presented,
the jury.

66
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,297
Which are the researchers in science,

67
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:53,058
are able to make one of
two possible decisions.

68
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:57,267
They would either conclude that
the defendant is guilty which means that

69
00:03:57,267 --> 00:03:58,786
the alternative is true.

70
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:02,126
Or they might conclude that
the defendant is not guilty and

71
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:04,659
that the alternative hypothesis is false.

72
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:07,857
It is important to note that
in both of these decisions,

73
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:11,266
a jury never concludes whether or
not someone is innocent.

74
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:14,021
So, there is never
a conclusion about whether or

75
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:15,916
not the null hypothesis is true.

76
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:20,256
Conclusions are only made about
the alternative hypothesis.

77
00:04:20,256 --> 00:04:25,086
Now, let's compare these two decisions
that are made by the jury relative to

78
00:04:25,086 --> 00:04:25,839
the truth.

79
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,693
In truth, the defendant is
either truly not guilty, or

80
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:32,159
the defendant is actually guilty.

81
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:36,726
Now, if the defendant is truly not guilty,
the jury could make a correct decision and

82
00:04:36,726 --> 00:04:39,339
also conclude that
the defendant is not guilty.

83
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:43,703
But they may incorrectly conclude
that the defendant is guilty.

84
00:04:43,703 --> 00:04:47,114
They will send this person to jail
even though they are innocent.

85
00:04:47,114 --> 00:04:50,139
This is what we call a false
positive conclusion,

86
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:53,171
with positive meaning
the person is sent to jail.

87
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:58,064
In hypothesis testing, this is
a situation we call a Type I error.

88
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:01,768
Now, the other truth is if
the defendant is actually guilty,

89
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:05,841
the jury could make a correct decision,
say this person is guilty.

90
00:05:05,841 --> 00:05:09,962
However, they might find that the evidence
presented in the trial was not strong

91
00:05:09,962 --> 00:05:11,120
enough to find guilt.

92
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,987
And they find that
the defendant is not guilty.

93
00:05:13,987 --> 00:05:19,008
This sends a guilty person free and
is known as a false negative conclusion.

94
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:24,742
In statistical hypothesis testing,
this is known as a Type II error.

95
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:30,450
Now, any decision that is made is
fraught with one of two possible errors,

96
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,362
either Type I or Type II.

97
00:05:32,362 --> 00:05:37,200
We are willing to have some people
go free, which is a Type II error.

98
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,582
And we rarely would like to put
an innocent person in jail,

99
00:05:40,582 --> 00:05:41,971
which is a Type I error.

100
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:46,519
So just as this example,
in a statistical hypothesis testing,

101
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:50,824
Type I errors are seen as more
egregious than Type II errors.

102
00:05:50,824 --> 00:05:55,509
We would like to make a Type I error much
less frequently than we would a Type II

103
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:56,030
error.

104
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,511
The values that are chosen as
acceptable for these two errors.

105
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:04,515
For our Type I error, we set the
probability of making this error at 5%,

106
00:06:04,515 --> 00:06:08,005
we denote this number with
the Greek letter alpha.

107
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:09,598
So what does this mean?

108
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:12,301
This means that every 100 sets of data,

109
00:06:12,301 --> 00:06:15,314
that truly do not support
the null hypothesis.

110
00:06:15,314 --> 00:06:19,326
5 of them will still conclude
that the alternative is true.

111
00:06:19,326 --> 00:06:23,661
In other words, in 100 studies of
a truly ineffective treatment,

112
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:26,535
5 of them will still say
the treatment works.

113
00:06:26,535 --> 00:06:29,561
In 100 studies of a truly
ineffective policy,

114
00:06:29,561 --> 00:06:32,956
5 studies will conclude that
the policy is effective.

115
00:06:32,956 --> 00:06:36,937
They will make the wrong
conclusion 5% of the time.

116
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:41,201
A Type II error is usually set to 0.20,
or 20% and

117
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:44,207
is denoted with the Greek letter beta.

118
00:06:44,207 --> 00:06:50,031
This means that in every 100 sets of data
that truly do support the alternative.

119
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:55,298
20 of those studies will still make the
conclusion that the alternative is false.

120
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:59,193
In other words, in 100 studies
of a truly effective treatment,

121
00:06:59,193 --> 00:07:02,693
20 studies will fail to find
that treatment is effective.

122
00:07:02,693 --> 00:07:06,579
Or in 100 studies of
a truly effective policy,

123
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:11,864
20 of the studies will fail to find
that that policy is effective.

124
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,419
Note that the Type I error rate, and

125
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:18,601
the Type II error rate are never
set exactly equal to zero.

126
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:23,292
We are always potentially making incorrect
conclusions in statistical hypothesis

127
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:23,892
testing.

128
00:07:23,892 --> 00:07:29,636
And we are never able to prove
anything with 100% certainty.

129
00:07:29,636 --> 00:07:32,375
In terms of statistical
hypothesis testing,

130
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:35,122
these concepts are typically
shown in a grid.

131
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,210
With the rows representing
the decisions that we make.

132
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:43,806
And the columns representing the truth or
the reality, which we do not know.

133
00:07:43,806 --> 00:07:48,763
I first shade the first column in
which the null hypothesis is true.

134
00:07:48,763 --> 00:07:53,409
So, again we can make the correct decision
and not reject this true null hypothesis.

135
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:56,669
Or we might reject it and
make a Type 1 error, again,

136
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:59,650
we refer to this as a false
positive conclusion.

137
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:04,880
We have falsely found an ineffective
treatment to be effective, for example.

138
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,569
I now shade the second column in which
in truth the null hypothesis is false.

139
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:14,117
Again, we could correctly conclude
that the null hypothesis is false,

140
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:16,586
or we might not and make a Type II error.

141
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:19,614
We refer to this as a false negative.

142
00:08:19,614 --> 00:08:23,325
Now in terms of the two correct decisions.

143
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:26,213
The one where the null
hypothesis is false and

144
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:30,477
we correctly conclude that,
that is known as statistical power.

145
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:35,055
So, if a Type II error has
a probability of 0.2 of occurring.

146
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:40,042
Then the probability of making
the correct decision is 0.8, and

147
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:42,411
we say that our power is 80%.

148
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:45,129
With these concepts of
hypothesis testing in place.

149
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:49,748
We are now able to discuss how to make
formal decisions with a numerical value

150
00:08:49,748 --> 00:08:52,298
known as a P value.
