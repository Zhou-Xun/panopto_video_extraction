1
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,010
In this module, we're going to be talking about the nature of the polishing process.

2
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:20,340
At this point, we're going to focus on a name polishing at a high level.

3
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:31,650
In other parts of your curriculum, you mean dealing with the actual when the government functions in various aspects of governmental policy?

4
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:40,260
When I want to think about today is how you should think about the process as a potential public health policymaker.

5
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,950
First issue is how do you identify a problem?

6
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:51,090
How do you recognize an important issue that would help improve the population health?

7
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,740
Certainly once you've identified the problem? How do you like your impact?

8
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:02,670
What do you want to achieve? What do you want the outcomes to be in formulating policy?

9
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:14,070
You therefore need to set an agenda. What's important about an agenda is to set your priorities at will see later on in the curriculum.

10
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,160
You can't do everything. Resources are limited, so you've got to make choices.

11
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:33,300
How you frame and appraise the options will therefore determine which policy get on your agenda, how you interest them, and what results you want.

12
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,310
And finally, the process of enactment matters.

13
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,300
How do you enact your policy,

14
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:48,900
either through regulations that the Health Department would issue or that the state legislature might enact as legislation?

15
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:56,280
But there are other important aspects of the policy process that tend to get lost that really,

16
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,110
I think, are essential for public health practitioners to understand.

17
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,870
First, in the implementation. No policy of self executing.

18
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,060
No matter how grand your policy, how noble your objectives.

19
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,480
If they're not implemented, they don't happen.

20
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,480
So you have to think about proper rulemaking program design.

21
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,190
Along with that, you must evaluate your programs.

22
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:34,130
You have to get feedback, make modifications, and then try to match the findings of the evaluation.

23
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,290
Back to the implementation process and then you have to communicate the results.

24
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:45,230
People need to be aware of what you're doing, how you're doing it, and why you're doing it.

25
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:53,870
So implementation and evaluation and communication are essential aspects of the policy process.

26
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:01,850
Thinking you must think about ahead of time, not after the policy has been developed.

27
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,730
So let's look at what we call the demand from policy and the supplier of policy.

28
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:21,030
Who demands policy? Who want? Well, elected officials, advocacy groups who want to improve the population, health, individual policy entrepreneurs,

29
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:29,220
academics who have research and advocacy organizations that want to pursue certain policies.

30
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:37,740
The media are very interested in what health departments are doing now, who applies the policy.

31
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,610
Here we have to look at the governmental process just briefly.

32
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,980
Elected officials, bureaucrats, John, choose.

33
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:53,850
Remember, the courts are very active in dealing with the policy and having an influence on policy.

34
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:01,860
Professional associations. The American Public Health Association, for example, will enact policy statements every year.

35
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:09,000
What do they do with them? How do they get the policies implemented through the policy process?

36
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:22,080
Then there are expert panels and again policy analysts, and we will come later in this curriculum to discuss the policy analysis process.

37
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,820
Turning now to serious politics.

38
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:37,140
John King and a University of Michigan political scientist developed an agenda setting process that results from three factors.

39
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,870
When he called the problem stream, the policy stream and the political stream,

40
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:51,160
remember I said earlier that agenda setting is a fundamental part of what public health practitioners do.

41
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:56,370
And kingdoms theoretical framework helps that process.

42
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:02,220
So what types? Moving policy from idea to reality?

43
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,930
Let's look first at what kingdom calls the problem stream.

44
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,980
Which issues are recognized, have significant problems?

45
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:19,050
For example, the opioid crisis is certainly a significant problem the country faces over the longer term,

46
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,000
public health practitioners have to worry about the ongoing obesity epidemic.

47
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:31,110
And I am meaning crisis, along with which issues are recognized as significant problems.

48
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,770
How do we translate those problems into questions and issues the government can address?

49
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,880
Remember, the public health department has a lot of problems.

50
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,510
And the problem stream has to be sorted.

51
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:55,140
And we'll come back to that in a bit. In addition, there's always a potential crisis that can emerge that will drive the problem stream.

52
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:07,170
For example, you can have an Ebola outbreak and in one part of the world you can have a measles outbreak in Washington State.

53
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,230
New crises often take precedence in driving the problem stream.

54
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,040
The second is the policy stream.

55
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:24,599
And what Kingdon talked about here is that ideas float in the stream, academics, you know,

56
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:33,120
with policy researchers, politicians all the time, you know, with different ideas that come up from the community.

57
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:41,999
What KENYON called like new laws in the primeval policy soup and the gradual accumulation of

58
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,160
knowledge and perspective among us and in given policy area that will drive the policy stream.

59
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:56,010
So once we have all these policies in the policy stream,

60
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:07,080
we have to then look at the wider political environment and the institutions and politician and decide on policy.

61
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:16,410
As Kingdon notes, the greatest policy changes fall out of that coupling of problems, policy proposals and politics.

62
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:24,870
Public health practitioners need to understand that politics is an important part of what they do.

63
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:37,850
If they want a particular policy to emerge out of this primeval soup of policy streams, you have to get the politicians to buy in.

64
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,990
That again, is part of the policy process.

65
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,390
What kingdom developed here is that window of opportunity.

66
00:07:49,960 --> 00:08:01,990
We see that most recently in the Affordable Care Act where the idea of health reform had been on the policy agenda for decades, for decades.

67
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,280
But what happened? More with the election of President Obama.

68
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,800
Everything came together. The problem had been known for a long time.

69
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,360
People lacking insurance. People not being able to afford insurance.

70
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:23,470
And all sorts of proposals from conservatives to have market based health reform to liberals

71
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:29,760
to have a governmental single payer system to libertarians who wanted no government,

72
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:40,510
lots of policies. What happened with the election of Barack Obama was it all came together in what kingdom calls the window of opportunity.

73
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:44,830
And out of that window of opportunity came the Affordable Care Act.

74
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:51,040
Important to note that that doesn't happen often in American policy and human learning.

75
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:58,420
In your other class system of government, we have, you know, the time for incremental, not radical change.

76
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:05,740
And we're already starting to see that with new proposals in Congress for a green environmental plan.

77
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:14,110
It will take years before the problem of climate change on the various policies and

78
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:19,930
then the window of opportunity come together to enact a green environmental policy.

79
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:28,600
Once we understand that the window of opportunity doesn't necessarily occur often in the United States.

80
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,990
It becomes important for US public health practitioners to focus more on what

81
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:40,399
you can achieve at the state and local levels where most public health policy,

82
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:49,990
you can't do that. You have to think through what the challenge issues are in your state or local community.

83
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,690
What assets you have in the assets include the resources, the community engagement,

84
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:01,030
the political culture in the environment there in the state or in locality.

85
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,170
What are the conflicts? What are the pressing problems?

86
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,910
Who are the key players and constituents? How do you talk to them?

87
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:18,460
One of the key events shaping the development of policy in your state or locality, and most importantly,

88
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:27,070
what's the culture and your setting is a trending liberal when you want to be a little more aggressive in talking about

89
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:35,650
social determinants of health and governmental intervention to improve the community's health or trending more conservative,

90
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:43,110
where you have to shape your policy in coordination with the private sector and being

91
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:50,980
aware of the market based economy and how your constituents will respond to these issues.
