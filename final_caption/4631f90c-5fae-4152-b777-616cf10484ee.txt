2
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:15,823
Hi, I'm Rick Neitzel.

3
00:00:15,823 --> 00:00:19,060
And I'm here today to talk to you about
a discipline within public health called

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,550
environmental health sciences.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,979
But before I do that I'd like to tell
you a little bit about what I do.

6
00:00:23,979 --> 00:00:27,746
I'm an exposure scientist, meaning
that I study exposures that happen in

7
00:00:27,746 --> 00:00:30,650
the community,
in the workplace, and at play.

8
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,410
And try to understand the health
impacts of these exposures on people.

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,590
And if I identify impacts
that are unacceptable,

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,920
I work to reduce those exposures and
improve people's health.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,200
So with that out of the way I'd like
to define environmental health for you.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,440
The world health organization
defines environmental health

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,860
as aspects of human health that are
impacted by factors in the environment.

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,930
These factors we typically categorize
into one of three categories,

15
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,670
biological hazards.

16
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,910
Meaning things in the environment
including micro organisms that

17
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,840
can hurt people for example
tuberculosis in a healthcare setting.

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,110
That's one factor.

19
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,070
Another would be chemical hazards
which might include things like lead

20
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,670
in a drinking supply of a city.

21
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,970
And the third factor are physical hazards,
these are things like noise and

22
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,730
nuclear radiation.

23
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,240
So those are the environmental
factors we're concerned about, but

24
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,620
of course we also need to define health.

25
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,470
And according to
the World Health Organization,

26
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:31,850
we can define health as simply the absence
of disease, but I think we can do better.

27
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,320
We also want to define health as
the presence of good health and

28
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,110
importantly we also want to
consider good quality of life.

29
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,860
So, what is environmental health?

30
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,920
Basically, it's the search to discover
how the environment affects people

31
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,300
in order to promote healthier lives.

32
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,660
It's a very simple mission, and

33
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,860
it's actually a very exciting
discipline to be in.

34
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,970
So for the next few minutes,

35
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,360
I'd like to walk you through a couple of
case studies in environmental health.

36
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,650
Examples where we've
identified problems and

37
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,770
worked through them to
improve people's health.

38
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,410
So I want you to imagine all
the way back to 1854 and

39
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,270
we'll transport ourselves to London,
England.

40
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,850
At the time, London was in
the middle of a cholera outbreak and

41
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,220
this was not uncommon at the time.

42
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,890
But for the first time, in 1854,

43
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,670
a scientist named John Snow
decided to draw a map.

44
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,820
And try to look at the relationship
of where these cases of cholera

45
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,710
were occurring to things
in the environment.

46
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:31,580
And in drawing this map, John Snow noticed
that most of these cholera cases for

47
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,420
this particular outbreak were
located around a single water pump.

48
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,580
Located on Broad Street in London, we now
call this the Broad Street Pump Incident.

49
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,990
So what John Snow did,
even though we didn't know anything about

50
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,350
the bacteria that causes
cholera related disease.

51
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,830
And we certainly didn't know where the
disease was coming from, water, food, air.

52
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:56,290
What Jon Snow did was convince the local
authorities to remove the handle on that

53
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,230
pump, forcing people to go
elsewhere to get their water.

54
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,420
Again, he didn't know if this
would solve the problem but

55
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,810
he did convince
the authorities to try this.

56
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,740
And in doing so,

57
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:11,160
the outbreak, which had ended up killing
616 people was brought to a halt.

58
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,410
So, John Snow is now known as
the father of the epidemiology.

59
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,650
And he also made a critical
first move to address

60
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,650
health issues by improving the environment
to people work and playing.

61
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,480
So, the next example I'd like to you
run through is also in London, England.

62
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,580
But we gonna fast forward to 1952.

63
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:35,580
Now London in the early 20th
century was mostly fueled by coal.

64
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,640
We burned coal to generate electricity and
to heat households.

65
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,850
And as you may know when we burn
coal there's a tremendous amount

66
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,930
of air pollutants released.

67
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,530
Now due to the topography and
the geographical layout, and

68
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,380
the weather patterns in London,

69
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,900
occasionally that city gets what
are called temperature inversions.

70
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,790
And when these incidents occur, pollutants
that normally go up into the high

71
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,320
atmosphere end up getting
trapped at ground level.

72
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,830
And these events were called London Fogs.

73
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,830
In fact, the air pollution would get so
bad, that the air would be so filled with

74
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:12,060
dust and smoke particles, you couldn't
see more than 20 or 30 feet at a time.

75
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,390
Now unfortunately in December of 1952 one
of these events lasted an entire week and

76
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,140
had horrible levels of pollution.

77
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,050
This came to be known as
The Great London Fog.

78
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:26,030
Even back in the 1950's we had already
begun starting to measure contaminants in

79
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,940
the environment including smoke.

80
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,860
And dust particles and
a gas called sulfur dioxide.

81
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,190
All of these things are bad for our lungs.

82
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,880
And someone else after
this event had the idea,

83
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,000
let's look at this concentrations
in the environment.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,450
And also look at how many people were
dying in London hospitals at that time.

85
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,280
Even then, they knew approximately
the normal number of

86
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,600
people who would die on
a given day in London.

87
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,080
What they found when they charted
the air pollution levels against deaths

88
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,620
is there was a huge spike in deaths during
this very intense seven day period.

89
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,440
And so looking back we realize.

90
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,520
That over 10,000 people died from this
one week air pollution event in London

91
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,630
as a direct result of their
exposure to air pollution.

92
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,930
This was a seminal event and

93
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,070
actually resulted in us recognizing
that air pollution could be bad for us.

94
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:17,020
And was a driving event to start to
pass regulations to clean up the air and

95
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,280
regulate how much pollution
can be put into the air.

96
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,780
So now we've talked about an example of
environmental health relating to water,

97
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,790
and one related to air.

98
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:30,420
The third and final example I'd like to
run through is one regarding pesticides.

99
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:36,770
So you may have heard of a chemical called
DDT or dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane.

100
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,150
This is a chemical that was
actually discovered in the 1870s.

101
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,720
But it wasn't until 1939 when a scientist
named Paul MÃ¼ller discovered that it was

102
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,300
a very potent insecticide that we
really began to get interested in DDT.

103
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,020
Paul Muller discovered that this
insecticide was incredibly efficient when

104
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,320
it came in contact at killing
things like mosquitoes.

105
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,310
And you may know mosquitoes,
beyond being a simple nuisance,

106
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,560
are actually a major source
of mortality in humans.

107
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,410
In fact it's estimated that more
humans have died from mosquito

108
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:12,480
related malaria transmission than from all
other causes in human history combined.

109
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,240
So anything we can do to reduce mosquitoes
is an excellent move for public health.

110
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,070
Paul Muller discovered this and
ended up getting the Nobel Prize for

111
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,330
this discovery.

112
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,240
And is an example for
how effective DDT was,

113
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,660
if we look at the island
of Taiwan in 1945.

114
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,490
There was something like 1 million
cases of malaria on that island.

115
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,780
Fast forward to 1969 after more
than a decade of DDT spraying and

116
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,240
we're down to 9 cases of malaria.

117
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,210
This is a tremendous public health and
environmental health success.

118
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,010
Unfortunately at the same time
an ecologist named Rachel Carson in

119
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,510
the United States started to notice
that as DDT spraying was picking up.

120
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,190
She was starting to see the disappearance
of songbirds and birds of prey.

121
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,090
In fact in her famous book, Silent Spring,
she noted that mornings were

122
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,460
strangely silent because these
birds were disappearing.

123
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,190
And some additional
research identified DTT

124
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,570
as having major reproductive
effects in these birds.

125
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,520
This is a chemical that bioaccumulates up
the food chain and these birds at the top

126
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,270
of the food chain were paying
the price and unable to reproduce.

127
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:19,370
So here we have a situation where we have
a major public health success through

128
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,157
the spraying of DDT and
the reduction of mosquitos.

129
00:07:22,157 --> 00:07:25,037
But unfortunately at the same
time we have a tremendous

130
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:26,925
impact on the ecosystem around us.

131
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:30,126
Which, of course, will ultimately
come back and impact our health.

132
00:07:30,126 --> 00:07:33,960
So, environmental health scientists were
faced with these decisions all the time.

133
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,840
And we have to weigh the costs and
benefits of different actions to ensure

134
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,083
that we're improving human health, without
damaging the environment around us.
