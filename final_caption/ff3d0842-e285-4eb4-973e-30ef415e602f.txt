1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,440
Okay, so what I hope that this discussion has covered is giving us a sense for

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,440
why we think that help like he can be such a powerful tool in improving quality

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,316
because in each of the domains we came up with several examples of how these

4
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:15,441
tools can help solve some of the root causes of failure, but

5
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:18,661
also a lot of ways in which they may have unintended, right?

6
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:21,311
So the question is all the good going to be done,

7
00:00:21,311 --> 00:00:25,290
how much of the unintended consequences are going to sort of creep in and

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,934
really get the key is how do we make sure we get the upside the wall,

9
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:34,340
making sure that we're careful to avoid the outside of the unintended consequence.

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,332
So I'm just gonna spend a few minutes going through and

11
00:00:36,332 --> 00:00:38,421
just giving you a feel for sort of let the evidence right.

12
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:41,567
This is all in the section about potential, how we could be imagined, but

13
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:43,240
this would really work well.

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,306
But now I want to think about what do we actually know about whether this works

15
00:00:47,306 --> 00:00:51,305
well or not and also from each of the domains and just sort of highlight one or

16
00:00:51,305 --> 00:00:55,530
more key studies where they can give you a sense of where the so safety.

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,528
So I think particularly we talked, I also mentioned,

18
00:00:58,528 --> 00:01:02,763
we've talked a lot about just sort of broad brushstrokes and there are a lot of

19
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:07,340
very specific ways in which you can use and we talked about tell about it.

20
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,741
We talked about the decision support.

21
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:13,139
We talked about HIV to also try to give you a sense of some of the specific types

22
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:15,740
of studied in each of these.

23
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,059
So in system we probably know the most about computerised provider order

24
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:20,860
entry CPOE.

25
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,750
Which is really a way to enter orders electronically.

26
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,942
Right? Instead of writing it down on a piece of

27
00:01:25,942 --> 00:01:29,408
paper and saying medication needs this medication or this lab test or

28
00:01:29,408 --> 00:01:32,660
this radiology practise entering that order electronically.

29
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,590
And there are a bunch of ways in which you can imagine that it improves safety.

30
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,881
You guys brought up of them but some of them we didn't talk about handwriting.

31
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:42,840
I don't think right possible lot of errors.

32
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,221
I can't read what the decision wrote down.

33
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,349
And so with these electronic systems you take out some of

34
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:53,340
the safety risks just associated with something as basic as bad handling.

35
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,997
But then there are a whole bunch of other reasons that you can imagine that these

36
00:01:56,997 --> 00:01:58,561
systems would help them brucei.

37
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,980
So the good news is that we actually have quite a few studies that shows

38
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,968
that that when you put in computerised provider order entry systems that

39
00:02:09,968 --> 00:02:11,710
they do make care safer.

40
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:16,440
It's mostly been focused on medication adverse drug events.

41
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,900
And most of the time where we see that there was improvement it was

42
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,791
CPOE that had some kind of clinical decisions, right?

43
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:28,952
Where there are cheques and reminders that say although don't prescribe those two

44
00:02:28,952 --> 00:02:31,011
drugs together or wait, that's a kid.

45
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:32,711
Are you sure you want to prescribe that dose?

46
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:34,540
That's probably not going to work for them?

47
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,813
Right. So a lot of these sort of safety net

48
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:40,900
features that help make sure that the order itself is going to be seen.

49
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,059
So a lot of evidence here, you guys go back to the official studies and

50
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:44,950
your understood.

51
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,274
But the point is right, there's pretty good evidence that CPOE.

52
00:02:48,274 --> 00:02:50,547
We usually with clinical decision support,

53
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:53,551
does improve patient safety in the domains of medication.

54
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,531
But we also talked about some of the safety downsides.

55
00:02:57,531 --> 00:03:01,881
And I think we have a growing literature on where there's opportunity where we're

56
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,760
seeing as these systems actually made care less safe.

57
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,347
And so rocks couple wrote an interesting paper where he found these sort

58
00:03:09,347 --> 00:03:14,089
of specific features really about how the systems were designed that made

59
00:03:14,089 --> 00:03:15,640
care less state.

60
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,740
So things like when you pick him a drop down menu, it's really easy to pick

61
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,440
the thing that's above or below that then you actually are intending to pick.

62
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,860
Okay, so those papers we have shown how the design of the system actually

63
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,351
increased the potential for some kinds of safety years.

64
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,150
And this was another study here that they got at this point of

65
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,440
sort of taking position time away.

66
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,545
And it had actually in this case resulted in an increased depth

67
00:03:44,545 --> 00:03:49,848
of Children were coming into a paediatric eventually it's built

68
00:03:49,848 --> 00:03:55,561
in different process in that took position time away from delivery?

69
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,040
Okay, these are just examples that you guys come up with and

70
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,529
we do have some evidence that these unintended consequences are in fact, so,

71
00:04:04,529 --> 00:04:05,940
effective care.

72
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,899
Again, it's an area where we have pretty good evidence that that when you put

73
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:14,920
in electronic health records with clinical decision support.

74
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,946
So this is gonna be sort of the common theme, is that clinical decision support

75
00:04:18,946 --> 00:04:22,119
piece reminding this position either not do the wrong thing or

76
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:25,940
to do the right thing, does increase adherence to evidence based care.

77
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,640
And across a whole bunch of studies here.

78
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,440
Yeah. Right.

79
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,259
So you can see the key point right here is that there were sort of 12 to 20 point

80
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:38,440
improvement in adherence to evidence based practise.

81
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,470
Right? So we go to the factory twin studies

82
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,621
that 55% of the time teachers were getting the right, thing what we think is okay

83
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:49,640
with clinical decision support that's going to be increased by 12 to 20 space.

84
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,240
That's pretty reasonable.

85
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,653
Right? We're doing the same things in pieces

86
00:04:53,653 --> 00:04:55,358
substantially higher factor.

87
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,291
So I can't.

88
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,551
But right.

89
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:06,953
The unintended consequence here we talked about, right, is this good fatigues,

90
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:10,157
a whole bunch of studies that show that a lot of positions, just sort of looking

91
00:05:10,157 --> 00:05:13,300
through all these streets, not even paying attention to these reminders.

92
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,271
And so it's certainly decreases the extent to which they're affected right there,

93
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:20,840
that they're not serving the purpose and the real challenges.

94
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,962
How do you know when the right time is to remind us right?

95
00:05:23,962 --> 00:05:27,790
And that's I think something really still trying to figure out is how do we know

96
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,167
should this person be reminded of it for this patient or not?

97
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:35,996
And you don't know what's going on in inside the physicians or

98
00:05:35,996 --> 00:05:39,558
nurses head to know whether there opportunity

99
00:05:42,473 --> 00:05:48,719
>> And he's working

100
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:54,130
the time when it

101
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:59,542
wasn't a lot of

102
00:06:02,457 --> 00:06:10,367
so maybe like alert for

103
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:19,541
more civilians.

104
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,035
The evidence is generalising.

105
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:36,230
>> Go back to this because you're bringing up important point Blazing over.

106
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,740
So this was 200 and some odd studies.

107
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,362
So it was not just a handful, but as you can see here, 25% of them came from,

108
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,340
as you said, some of the leading sites.

109
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,040
Right? So are there General Izabal?

110
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,540
Probably not.

111
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,630
They are probably the ones that we're going to do well, no matter what.

112
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,981
And they were earlier on developing this.

113
00:06:56,981 --> 00:07:00,293
So it was a world in which there were a lot less sort of reminders of awareness

114
00:07:00,293 --> 00:07:03,713
and right now I think physicians are bombarded with reminders of the evidence

115
00:07:03,713 --> 00:07:07,235
based care and every player sending them to report that says this percent of your

116
00:07:07,235 --> 00:07:09,420
diabetics didn't get their other foot screen.

117
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,430
So I think that that probably is an early access in that sense.

118
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,471
But there were 75% of studies didn't come from those leading institutions.

119
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:21,211
And so I think it gives you a ballpark what what is achievable?

120
00:07:21,211 --> 00:07:25,640
But my guess is that we've looked at today what we know that that would be.

121
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,638
But it's also because we've increased a lot from 5% in here because most

122
00:07:30,638 --> 00:07:34,861
of the rate of there's not much property but the normal heart.

123
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,776
But I think we've sort of maxed out perhaps on the low hanging fruit of

124
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:43,081
political decision support, right?

125
00:07:43,081 --> 00:07:45,920
And build reminders for sort of all these basic things.

126
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,110
So I think the real question is like going forward, where is there an opportunity for

127
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,061
clinical decision support to really improve adherence and

128
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:56,561
like what domains will be focused on sort of common chronic diseases.

129
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,050
So that's it.

130
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,061
That's beautiful challenges where you go next [INAUDIBLE].

131
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,535
And how do you do in a way where now we know we have alert fatigue that actually,

132
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:16,183
so I don't know, I think it's an area which continues to be a lot of

133
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:20,760
potential but how you actually realise that potential is getting
