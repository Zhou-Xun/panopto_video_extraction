1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:13,810
All right. Good morning, everyone. It's a couple of quick check ins announcements before we get going with today's material.

2
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:21,370
First, a question. Did everyone. Did anyone have trouble accessing the short video that I sent out yesterday?

3
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:31,510
Okay. All right. As a follow up, any questions or comments that people have about that video material?

4
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,459
Okay. Also, fair enough. The reminder, we're all on the same page.

5
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,200
Our exam is on Thursday in class right here.

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,860
Just a reminder to space yourself out a little bit as you get settled right away, you'll have the entire class period.

7
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,929
I will hang out after class in the hallway. If anyone has any questions.

8
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,649
Want to grab me? Between now and Thursday? I'm also available.

9
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,250
Reach out over email. I can provide the answer over email.

10
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,370
I'd be happy to do it if it's something more complicated.

11
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,210
And we want to meet you there in person over Zoom. I'm also happy to do that as well.

12
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,520
So today we're going to kind of wrap up a theme that we started last class period.

13
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:23,090
Last time you was at a kind of community environmental meeting or environmental settings,

14
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:29,840
and the regulatory agencies are set up primarily here in the U.S. But we also look a little

15
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,500
bit beyond our borders and how standards and limits are set to help address exposures.

16
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:44,090
We're going to continue on that theme, but shift gears a little bit and talk about it specifically within an occupational and workplace setting.

17
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,650
And to help us do that process. We're really happy to have back professional Neitzel to lead us through it.

18
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,990
All right, thank you so much. Good morning, everybody. I feel like there's fewer of you in the room than last time I lectured.

19
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:04,729
I try not to take it personally, but know it's I promise this will be much less dry than physical hazards.

20
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:11,840
So I'm going to chat with you for the whole class period about just issues we see in occupational settings.

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,710
This is directly relevant to each and every one of you who doesn't have a trust fund.

22
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:21,200
If you're going to have a job someday, and that job is undoubtedly going to have hazards associated with it.

23
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,240
And so part of our job in occupational health is to identify and prevent those hazards.

24
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,899
So in terms of what I'm hoping you get out of the lecture today, I'm going to give you an overview,

25
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:40,310
and I hope that you'll be able to describe sort of the scope, the dimensions of occupational health issues that we have in this country and globally.

26
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:46,820
And some of the trends that we're seeing, both in terms of exposures, but also in terms of health outcomes like diseases.

27
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:55,820
We're going to go over some of the agencies that are responsible for making workplaces healthy and safe in the United States and elsewhere,

28
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,530
and also agencies that put forth occupational exposure limits or codes.

29
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:09,170
And finally, you should get a better understanding of why two different agencies looking at the same hazard, the same chemical, for instance,

30
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:16,120
might come up with two different exposure limits for that hazard, just like with the Physical Hazards Lecture,

31
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,060
any time you've got a question or comment, please do raise your hand.

32
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,160
I would love for this to be interactive.

33
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:30,679
Any of you who have already had a job that involved any hazards at all might be familiar with this catch phrase that lots of companies throw out.

34
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:38,959
It's sort of like safety first, but not really. And that is an unfortunate theme in our country and elsewhere where lots of companies,

35
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:44,540
lots of employers out there may talk up safety, but may in reality not be doing that great a job.

36
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:51,049
It's sort of like the phenomenon of greenwashing, where lots of companies will say, Oh, look what great stuff we're doing for the environment.

37
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,740
You know, never mind that we're extracting oil and burning fossil fuels, etc.

38
00:03:54,740 --> 00:04:02,809
So we have to be a little cautious about companies that sort of seem overly aggressive about safety because sometimes they are not walking the walk,

39
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:11,060
as it were. Now I'm an industrial hygienist by training, so I've been doing occupational health and safety research for my entire career.

40
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:17,030
And I think one of the questions that you might reasonably ask me is, why should I even care about this?

41
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:23,840
And I've been asked this before, believe me. So I love to take a moment and put this into context for you.

42
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,409
And let's talk about some of the biggest killers of Americans.

43
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:32,959
So right here, I've listed some of the the at least in the last several years,

44
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:40,040
top three killers of Americans, both in terms of the number of people dying, as well as the economic toll.

45
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:48,499
And so for heart disease, there's almost 700,000 Americans that die every year at a cost of about half a trillion dollars.

46
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:57,980
That's a huge issue. Undeniably, cancer kills about 600,000 at a lower cost, actually, of $104 billion.

47
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:07,460
And then COVID 19, of course, this number should now be updated to 1 million Americans who have died over the course of the pandemic.

48
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:15,019
Shocking. And the economic toll of COVID 19, of course, has been incredibly large on the order of many trillions of dollars,

49
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:21,680
with all of the lost economic productivity and the cost of implementing exposure controls, etc.

50
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:32,180
So those are big problems, undeniably. However, I will say, for instance, there is a huge research endeavor in the United States on heart disease.

51
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,200
There is another sort of moonshot type approach to try to cure cancer.

52
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,830
So there's lots and lots of resources and energy being put towards reducing these things.

53
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,630
Likewise for COVID. On the other hand, when we switch to the workplace,

54
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:51,139
if we look at the number of workers who are dying every year just in the United States, every year, the numbers fluctuate a bit,

55
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:57,290
but it's typically somewhere around 4 to 6000 workers die sort of instantly on the job from an acute injury,

56
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,080
getting run over, crushed, electrocuted, whatever.

57
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:07,129
And another somewhere between 50 and 60,000 die every year of occupational diseases, maybe a lung disease.

58
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:13,400
They got from breathing in a chemical at work at a cost of about $51 billion a year pre-COVID.

59
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,919
And so that's more people, for instance, than die from the flu.

60
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:25,580
Every year we have a flu vaccine. Of course, we've spent a lot of time and energy trying to reduce flu fatalities.

61
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,630
And it's at a cost. It's about half of that of cancer.

62
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,540
But again, we don't see such a strong,

63
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:41,360
organized effort to reduce occupational illnesses and deaths that we do for some of these other sort of more recognized killers of Americans.

64
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:47,420
And if we zoom out to the entire globe, about 2 million workers are killed on the job every year.

65
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:55,790
So hopefully this gives you a sense that actually occupational health is really important and it's got a huge burden on our economy and our society.

66
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:02,149
I'll also highlight that a lot of what we know about what can harm the human body,

67
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,970
we've learned from workers who were exposed to nasty things and got diseases as a result.

68
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:14,330
So if you look at sort of scroll down the names of these diseases, some of them sound kind of funny, like bakers itch.

69
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,910
How many of you have read Alice in Wonderland and anybody know?

70
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,330
What was the deal with Mad Hatter? Historically, yeah.

71
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:33,020
Mercury poisoning. Absolutely. So people who felt in hats were using Mercury as part of that process and they would often get at or shakes.

72
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:40,400
Mercury is a very potent neurotoxin, and so as part of their job, these people were damaging their neurological system.

73
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,989
So you can see things like he signs disease, potters rod.

74
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:50,750
Again, some of these are very kind of anachronistic sounding names, but all of them, again,

75
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:57,640
are diseases that we learned by killing workers as part of their job and exposing them to things that we didn't understand could be harmful.

76
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,159
So let's take a look at sort of the workforce in the United States.

77
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,440
There's about 157 million workers out of a population of about 335 million Americans.

78
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:19,879
In 2018, there were almost 3 million reported work related injuries and illnesses.

79
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,240
So that's, again, a substantial burden on people.

80
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:30,350
And there's more than 100 workers that die every week on average in the United States from acute injuries in the workplace.

81
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,339
So that's about 14 preventable deaths per day.

82
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,419
And I say preventable because in occupational settings,

83
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:46,579
the employer has essentially complete control over how that work gets done and how safe or unsafe it is.

84
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:52,159
And so if you've got an employer who is not prioritizing safety and health, again,

85
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,530
they may be permitting or or even sort of encouraging these injuries and illnesses to occur.

86
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,379
We all, of course, have been dealing with and continue to deal with COVID 19.

87
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:09,080
And we think of this, of course, as a community burden, which it is, but it's also a substantial occupational burden.

88
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:17,720
So we think, particularly in the early months of the pandemic, when we had front line workers, you know, grocery workers, bus drivers, etc.,

89
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:23,120
some of our very lowest paid workers in the United States right on the front lines,

90
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:28,050
getting exposed to this virus that at the time we had a very poor understanding of it.

91
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,659
You know, that's that's a big deal. And so fortunately for the pandemic,

92
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:40,850
we were able to apply a lot of what we know historically in what we have developed in terms of knowledge to the pandemic to try to reduce exposures.

93
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,299
That's why we still see folks in the classroom in masks.

94
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,660
It's why we still see promotion of social distancing.

95
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,980
It's why we have tracing of contacts with illness.

96
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,840
A lot of these things have stemmed from historically workplace based exposures.

97
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,240
All right. So I'm going to jump around a little bit in terms of timeline.

98
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,819
I was just showing you sort of recent statistics for the United States.

99
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,060
Here's some more data and statistics now 21 years old.

100
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,310
But it was just the figure that showed exactly what I wanted to. So that's always the challenge is an academic.

101
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:23,159
So if we think about injuries and illnesses in the workplace for what gets reported to the government, injuries are the vast majority.

102
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:33,690
So this could be anything from getting a finger amputated to getting cut by a sharp object all the way up, of course, potentially to a fatal accident.

103
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,040
So we got lots of injuries. We have a relatively small number of injuries.

104
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:46,230
They find excuse me, illnesses they get reported every year. And of those we know a large number of them are associated with repeated trauma.

105
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:53,459
So doing some sort of physical activity over and over again can cause you suffering.

106
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,540
Any of you have ever had an elbow, for instance, or runner's knee?

107
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:05,219
All of these things are a repeated trauma. We've also got lots of skin diseases and then we've got sort of everything else lumped in here.

108
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:10,900
So again, in terms of what gets reported to the government, the vast majority of what people are reporting are injuries.

109
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,430
However, if we zoom in on the illnesses, we can sometimes see some very interesting trends.

110
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:25,509
So these are occupational illnesses reported between 1972, about one year after the Occupational Safety and Health Administration,

111
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:29,800
or OSHA was established all the way forward to the year 2001.

112
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:35,640
And we're looking at number of cases of different types of occupational illnesses, as you see here.

113
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,760
So we've got skin diseases kind of in the bright blue on the bottom here.

114
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,760
We've got poisoning cases and dark gray.

115
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,640
We've got disorders associated with repeated trauma in this light gray.

116
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:53,290
So I'll I'll highlight here, some of these diseases seem to be getting less common over time.

117
00:11:53,290 --> 00:12:00,099
So skin diseases, for instance, we've got maybe two thirds as many in 2000, one as we had in 1972.

118
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,400
So that's a success story, right? We want to see those numbers going down.

119
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,389
Poisonings is relatively static the whole time.

120
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:15,460
But if we look here, we have this enormous jump in repeated trauma illnesses that started in the mid 1980s,

121
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:19,749
kind of peaked in the mid 1990s and it started coming down since then.

122
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,409
So you're not occupational health professionals, obviously,

123
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:30,729
but does anybody have an idea what might have changed in the mid 1980s that might have made repeated trauma things,

124
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,170
things like carpal tunnel disorder really take that enormous increase.

125
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,500
The rise of the use of computers. Absolutely right.

126
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,260
So so kudos on the perfect answer here.

127
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:51,060
So, you know, if we look at work prior to the mid 1980s, certainly there were people that were typing and doing tiling and things like that.

128
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,120
But as computers started to get introduced,

129
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,470
we started to have lots of people doing what many of you were doing sitting in front of a keyboard and typing.

130
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:04,860
And the human body is not meant to do anything for long periods of time, quite frankly, including sitting there and typing.

131
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:13,230
And so we started to see this massive increase in the number of cases of carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, etc.

132
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,309
And it took us about ten years to figure out what the problem was.

133
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,360
So kind of heading into computers and critically in that ten year period,

134
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,700
starting to develop different kinds of keyboards, different sorts of ergonomic setups for offices.

135
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,620
So you can see once we've kind of figured this out and got a handle on it,

136
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:36,060
we were able to start reducing these and those illnesses have continued to come down.

137
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:44,630
So part of what we do in occupational health, of course, is try to look ahead and anticipate what's coming and prevent it before it ever happens.

138
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,760
But part of what we do is take a look at trends and data and figure out what's what's going on.

139
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,040
And if we see a blip like this, explain it. And then again, take whatever corrective action we need to.

140
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,750
All right. So let's get you all talking a little bit on the last night.

141
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,940
Why didn't we see, like, Secretary Gates having tendonitis or carpal tunnel?

142
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:12,549
Is it mostly because I'm just thinking culturally, that was unmarried women before they got married.

143
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,000
And then once they married, they have to, like, stop working because. Yeah.

144
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:23,770
And so they were doing it for a shorter period of time or it's like I just like I'm curious why typewriters wouldn't have caused all those same.

145
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,860
So I think the trick is the number of secretaries.

146
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:35,049
So people who sort of whole job relied on typing was relatively small across the economy and relatively stable.

147
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,900
So we saw the numbers were were going down,

148
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:44,350
but the relative fraction of the diseases attributed to repeated trauma, which was fairly constant over time.

149
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,700
I mean, you're absolutely right.

150
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:53,080
Of course, all of this is in the context of a society where historically, perhaps when women married, they exited the workforce.

151
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:57,850
In the past, we we have seen and this is encouraging, you know,

152
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:06,430
much more representation of women across all jobs in the industry, as you would expect, kind of from a statistical perspective.

153
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,470
But unfortunately, that, of course, has meant that now women are experiencing diseases that they didn't experience.

154
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:18,069
But in this case, this particular disease did tend to be more of a female dominant dominated disease,

155
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:22,630
excuse me, until kind of the explosion of computers did that sort of answer your question?

156
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:33,950
So let's think about jobs that are out there. And I just am curious what you folks think in terms of what might be the jobs that you're

157
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:40,470
most likely to die here in the United States as sort of the most deadly occupations?

158
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:48,110
I'd love to hear some ideas. Surely some of you have seen shows on the Discovery Channel that document Dangerous Jobs.

159
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,600
What do you think? Yeah, please. Fishing or like lobstering or something like that on a boat?

160
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,340
Commercial fishing? Absolutely. What? Other jobs? Yeah, please.

161
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,420
Working in the fields. Working in oil fields. Oil and gas extraction.

162
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,450
I was going to say, like mining. Yeah, mining. Absolutely. Construction.

163
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,990
Construction. Excellent. Others that come to mind.

164
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,970
Those. There are certainly some great ideas there.

165
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:24,030
So let's go ahead and run through this. And I will say the data that I'm showing you here come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

166
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:29,760
So this is a federal agency whose whole job is to essentially keep track of what's going on with the workforce.

167
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:35,159
They don't just focus on illnesses and injuries. They look at employment trends and things like that.

168
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,500
But they they are kind of the source for occupational injury and illness information.

169
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:46,049
So number one in 2020 was logging, which didn't get mentioned here.

170
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:52,080
But you might imagine that this is a really dangerous outdoor job with lots of very sharp machinery running around you.

171
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,570
And so the fatality rate here.

172
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:07,320
So for every 100,000 workers in the logging industry in 2020, 97.6 of them died in 2020 is how to interpret that statistic.

173
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:13,320
So that's that's considered a very high fatality rate, the highest of any job in the United States that year.

174
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:19,770
So from a sort of risk perspective, this is the most dangerous job.

175
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:25,560
On the other hand, we could also think about, well, how many actual workers died in 2020?

176
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,220
And that's going to sort of considerable. How big is the industry itself?

177
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:36,780
There's not a lot of loggers out there. So even though it's quite dangerous, the absolute number of deaths is still unacceptably high.

178
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,880
It's 56, but it might be much larger in other circumstances, as we'll see in a minute.

179
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:48,630
So phishing, you're absolutely right. This was number two most deadly occupation in 2020.

180
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:54,700
So the fatality rate here is dropped from 96 down 77, still crazy high.

181
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,979
And again, there's not that many commercial fishing people in the United States.

182
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,600
So the absolute number of deaths is, you know, relatively small at 30.

183
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,620
Number three is perhaps not what you'd expect.

184
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:14,970
So aircraft pilots and engineers and this is not commercial airline pilots who are flying you home for the holidays.

185
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:20,130
This is largely Bush pilots who work in remote regions, particularly in Alaska.

186
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:26,940
Crashes are incredibly common there. So again, our fatality rate has gone from 96 to 77, now down to 58.

187
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,769
So it's it's dropping pretty fast. But it turns out there's a lot of these pilots.

188
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:38,460
And so the absolute number of deaths is higher than it was for fishing at 70 per year.

189
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,170
Number four is a construction occupation. So you're absolutely right on that.

190
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:46,469
We could start to see the fatality rate kind of flattening out a little bit here.

191
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,640
So it's now down to 51.5 per 100,000 workers.

192
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,530
But there are a lot of roofers in the United States within the absolute number of deaths.

193
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:59,040
Here is the biggest we've seen so far at 96 in 2020.

194
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:07,590
Number five, again, one that no one mentioned here is essentially our garbage collectors in the United States.

195
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,010
So they have a fatality rate. Again, it's continuing to fall now.

196
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:15,180
It's down to 44 and 37 deaths in 2020.

197
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:22,140
So this one might be, again, a bit of a surprise. But you imagine people hanging on the side of a garbage truck jumping off,

198
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:27,960
going through traffic, picking up heavy stuff, working around this enormous compactor.

199
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:37,169
Lots of opportunities to get fatally injured. Now, number six also didn't come after to truck drivers and other drivers.

200
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:42,030
So the fatality rate here is has taken another nosedive. We're down to 26 per 100,000.

201
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:47,220
But look, there were almost a thousand deaths among these drivers in 2020.

202
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:52,470
So although the risk to any one worker is lower for this job than the others we talked about,

203
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:56,760
there are a ton of drivers out there because it's such a big workforce.

204
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,710
Even with a low risk, we end up getting the highest number of fatalities for any job.

205
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:07,530
In 2020, there were seven is one that also didn't come up.

206
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:14,040
So this is farming, ranching and agriculture. And again, the fatality rate is now pretty stable in the mid twenties,

207
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:20,700
lots of farmers in our country and so a pretty big number of absolute deaths of 257.

208
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,629
Number eight is another construction occupation. So I don't know about you all, but as I was coming down from the sixth floor,

209
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:32,230
I was looking out over the new hospital that's being built two blocks away.

210
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:39,250
And so iron and steel workers are the folks that put together the skeleton of those big, tall buildings, the steel girders.

211
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:46,570
So again, the fatality rate pretty stable in the mid twenties, 15 deaths among ironworkers in 2020.

212
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:53,290
Number nine here again, is not something that might come to mind immediately, at least.

213
00:20:53,290 --> 00:21:00,550
So this is supervisors in construction and extraction industries like oil and gas and construction.

214
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:04,260
So, you know, a lot of us are transients.

215
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:11,120
I don't want to put you into this, but I'll say oftentimes I think of supervisors as people that don't really do anything.

216
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:16,450
And I'll throw that out there. But it turns out, in fact, in the extraction and construction industries,

217
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:21,430
supervisors are often working right alongside sort of the production or the line workers.

218
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:27,030
But often supervisors have been sort of removed from that job.

219
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,910
They may come up through the ranks and you may not done that kind of work for a while.

220
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:39,760
And so they may be less safety conscious or less sort of remembering of how the process is done safely and that can put them at extra risk.

221
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,850
And so 144 deaths in 2020.

222
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:48,579
And then number ten, a giant surprise here is ground maintenance workers.

223
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:56,920
So the folks who are out on campus here on the right around lawnmowers and with weed whackers and leaf blowers, etc.

224
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:04,010
So again, the lowest fatality rate in the top ten of 20.2 per 100,000 workers and 48 deaths in 2020.

225
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,090
So, you know, taking a step back here, some of these occupations you guys nailed and you're absolutely right.

226
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:18,010
I mean, there are ones that are always on the list. Others of them like grounds, maintenance and supervisors might be a bit of a surprise.

227
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,749
Now, mining, you suggested, is not in the top ten in 2020.

228
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:31,899
Mining is an interesting industry. Historically, it has been so unsafe and dangerous in the mining industry that when OSHA was created,

229
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,950
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Congress said, OSHA,

230
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,040
you are going to deal with so-called general industry,

231
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:44,920
but mining is so dangerous that we're going to create a Mine Safety and Health Administration or MSHA,

232
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,740
that it's just going to focus on mining and try to make it safe.

233
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:57,970
So mining is not in the top ten in most years, frankly, but when there's a bad year in mining, mining is almost always number one.

234
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:04,720
And so the reason for this is big mining accidents can kill dozens of workers like that.

235
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:10,180
And it sort of shoots mining to the top. But we don't have big mining disasters every single year.

236
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:16,180
So mining is an industry that is in the top ten some years and is nowhere close to the top ten in one other years.

237
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:22,000
So it's kind of interesting. It can be terribly dangerous, but it's been consistent ever since.

238
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,780
All right. So again, here we're looking at 2016 data.

239
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:32,349
The trends over time are relatively shallow.

240
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:37,540
So jumping around between years, the sort of take home message remains consistent.

241
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:45,910
So as an occupational health person, I've already kind of described to you there are a number of different ways we can look at these statistics.

242
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:52,420
On the left side of this graph here, we can look at the number of fatal work injuries, the number of workers killed.

243
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,500
And on the right side, we could look at the fatal injury work rate.

244
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,320
So that's how many workers died per 100,000.

245
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:07,240
So this is sort of an absolute measure of human suffering and this is kind of a measure of the exposure and risk in the workforce.

246
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:13,510
They tell us two different things. And so, for instance, we look at the left side of the graph in red.

247
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:20,409
You can see in 2016, construction actually had the highest number of total workers killed,

248
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:27,010
almost 2000, followed by transportation and warehousing and then agriculture, forestry and fishing.

249
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:35,230
So if we just wanted to prevent as many deaths as we could, those would be the industries we would focus on in this particular year.

250
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:41,590
On the flip side, if we look at this fatal injury work rate on the right, well, here it's actually agriculture,

251
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:48,520
forestry and fishing at number one, followed by transportation and warehousing, followed by mining here.

252
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:55,180
And so if we want to look at the most at risk workers, we would look at those industries there.

253
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,870
So the statistics can give us two different messages.

254
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,080
And the challenge that we have is, well, which one of these is more important?

255
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:09,070
And the answer is they're both kind of equally important. We absolutely want to minimize the number of people dying or getting sick on the job.

256
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:16,870
But we want to make sure that the workers who are in the very most hazardous industries are also getting the help they need to be safe on the job.

257
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,890
So it's kind of a it's a challenge and with statistics.

258
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:25,439
There are always multiple ways that many things can be interpreted.

259
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:35,970
And so that's another challenge to us. So we're a very wealthy, high income nation with a very well-developed occupational health framework.

260
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:40,710
Why do we still have, like 60,000 people dying every year on the job?

261
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:45,870
Why don't we actually improve our policies and regulations to bring those numbers down?

262
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:57,990
Well, part of the issue here is we know scientifically how or I should say we understand the risk, we understand the number of people dying.

263
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:03,720
We understand the cause and effect of workplace exposure leading to an injury and illness.

264
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:10,290
So that part, we kind of get nailed down. The policy, though, is not just restricted to science and includes other things.

265
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:15,360
So, you know, ideally, if we have a problem like we are killing 60,000 workers a year,

266
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,790
we run this through our sort of scientific understanding and figure out what needs to be done.

267
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:28,350
And we come up with a standard that says, here is exactly how we need to go about successfully eliminating all these deaths.

268
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:33,310
In reality, in our policy process, we've got that problem.

269
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,290
We certainly add our scientific lens to that.

270
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:45,000
But frankly, most of what goes into making a standard is not scientific and involves other processes that we'll talk about.

271
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,690
And so we end up with a standard that is not the ideal.

272
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:56,340
It's something that's kind of a reduction away from the ideal toward something that's actually practical and achievable.

273
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:06,000
And so let's think for a minute about, gosh, we've got a new chemical that's just come into commerce and we think it might be dangerous for people.

274
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,620
So we want to set and yell and occupational exposure with it, basically a limit that says if you're a worker working with this chemical,

275
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:19,230
you can only be exposed to this much and no more because any more than that is too dangerous for you.

276
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,280
So let's think about what goes into the decision of setting that limit.

277
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,650
Well, first, we have so-called risk science decisions here.

278
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:34,110
So a lot of times, for instance, a particular chemical is associated with a particular disease.

279
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,879
And so let's say this particular chemical we think might cause lung cancer.

280
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,200
But of course, there are other things that cause lung cancer happens to like magnets.

281
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:53,190
So they have to decide on the so-called point of departure, how many additional cases of lung cancer do we think might be attributable specifically

282
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:58,680
to this chemical and the lung cancer cases that are not attributable to this chemical?

283
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,010
There's nothing we can do about those with an occupational exposure limit.

284
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,240
We also often have to apply what are called uncertainty factors.

285
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,360
So sometimes the reason we think a chemical is a carcinogen or a cancer causing agent is because

286
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,430
people dosed a bunch of lab rats or hamsters or chinchillas or whatever and they got cancer.

287
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:21,810
So, okay, it causes cancer in chinchillas. Does it cause cancer in humans?

288
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:25,830
And it's the same amount needed to cause cancer in humans.

289
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:35,520
It does spread to children, for instance. And so we will often put uncertainty factors and say, Well, here's what it took to give a rat cancer.

290
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:42,390
I'm going to assume that it takes ten times less than that to give a human cancer just to be kind of conservative in my assumptions.

291
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,470
So we have these uncertainty factors that go in. We also have the so-called integration of weight of evidence.

292
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:55,680
So sometimes we have toxicology studies from animals, sometimes we have epidemiology studies on workers,

293
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,710
sometimes we have surveillance data on the population.

294
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:04,110
All of these things we want to consider to decide, you know, how bad is this chemical for us?

295
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,910
So that's all scientific. We kind of have a handle on that in environmental health.

296
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:14,400
But there's these other equally or maybe even more important decisions like risk acceptance.

297
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:20,310
So if I go to a Congress, a congressional representative,

298
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:26,370
and say we need to do something about this particular chemical, you know, it's killing 50 workers a year.

299
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:30,970
That person is probably going to say, well, 50 workers a year doesn't sound like that much to me.

300
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:37,050
I've got bigger problems, bigger fish to fry. So that's an acceptable risk to them, even though it's not acceptable to me.

301
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,479
So we all have to sort of decide on Will, how many workers are we comfortable killing every year in this country?

302
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,120
And it appears that number is about 60,000 right now. There's also issues of feasibility.

303
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:55,680
So scientifically, I might say this is how we need to eliminate the risk of this chemical and being exposed to it.

304
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:02,460
Industry might say, you're telling me I have to eliminate this chemical and I can't make all these products without this chemical.

305
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,820
And consumers are going to be really unhappy if they can't find these products.

306
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:11,669
So that's not technically feasible for you to do it. Or you're telling me as a as a business owner,

307
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:17,790
I need to fully equipped my shop with ventilation and all sorts of other controls to reduce worker's exposures.

308
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,520
I can't afford to do that. You're going to put me out of business.

309
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:26,460
And so those factors get a lot of weight when we consider what that ultimate exposure limit is going to be.

310
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:35,009
So it's a pretty complicated process and it ends up with, at least for regulatory purposes, exposure limits that are a compromise.

311
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:40,500
They're not scientific best practices. They're sort of a combination of that and what is politically feasible.

312
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:47,730
And so we end up with these kind of watered down limits that aren't best practices, but they're the bare minimum that everybody could agree to.

313
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:57,230
Now, when we think about policymaking in the United States, we've got a couple of different actors here.

314
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,460
We have the government, of course, but we also have non-governmental policy.

315
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:06,170
So with the government, we have the legislature or Congress that can create laws.

316
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:13,700
And then the laws are essentially funded and executed by the executive office, the president and the cabinets.

317
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:18,650
And the laws are interpreted by the judiciary. You know, the Supreme Court in the United States.

318
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:24,799
We also have regulations. And so regulations are kind of how do we actually implement that law.

319
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,300
So Congress says we need laws on workplace health and safety.

320
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,310
They create an agency, OSHA, to do it.

321
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:38,120
And OSHA then goes and sets specific regulations to say, this is how we're going to reduce exposures for this particular chemical.

322
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:44,840
So that's kind of the governmental side on the nongovernmental side. We actually have private organizations.

323
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:51,739
There can be professional organizations, sort of trade groups, advocacy organizations,

324
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:59,840
even businesses can create sort of their own guidelines like this is how we do things here in this particular corporation.

325
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,670
And it's, for instance, more protective than we think what the government requires.

326
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:12,050
Or they can have sort of a directive that says not this is how we prefer things to do in this company, but this is actually how they do.

327
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:21,600
This is kind of our own binding internal policy. So I've already talked about OSHA a little bit, but let me dove into them a little bit more.

328
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:29,689
So when we think about workplace health and safety in the US, presumably if you think about this at all, OSHA is what comes to mind.

329
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:38,600
So the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is housed within the Department of Labor because they take care of workers established in 1971.

330
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,530
Now, you might think, well, OSHA, they must protect every single worker in the United States.

331
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:48,799
That is absolutely wrong. In fact, OSHA only has jurisdiction over non-governmental workers.

332
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:55,610
So all the millions of workers who work for federal and state and local government are not covered by OSHA at all.

333
00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:00,120
There's also other industries that are specifically excluded from associates.

334
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,430
Nevertheless, they're kind of our biggest agency for keeping workers safe.

335
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:11,060
I already talked to you about MSHA, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, also housed within the Department of Labor.

336
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:16,070
A little bit more of a newcomer. So MSHA wasn't established until 1977.

337
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,480
And again, they focus specifically on health and safety for miners.

338
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:28,069
We've also got, for instance, the Department of Transportation. So every time you were driving down the road or writing down the road and you

339
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:31,610
see a big truck go by with all sorts of flammable placards on it and stuff,

340
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:39,350
the Department of Transportation wants to make sure that your transporting edge of this materials, we're not putting the public at risk or workers.

341
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:45,620
Also, interestingly, if you work in that aviation sector, so if you're a pilot,

342
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,630
a flight attendant and a flight engineer or you worked for the railroads,

343
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:57,230
you're covered by different federal agencies, either the Federal Aviation Administration or the Federal Railroad Administration.

344
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:03,230
And I can give you an example here. When you start to think, gosh, that's a lot of agencies, how do they all get along?

345
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:10,700
Well, they don't, frankly. So for many years, until actually just last year, the Flight Attendants Union.

346
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:16,490
So the International Flight Attendants Organization was lobbying OSHA.

347
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,410
Can you please take over and be responsible for our health and safety?

348
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,940
Because the Federal Aviation Administration is ignoring us and ignoring our problems.

349
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,540
And OSHA's like, my God, that's terrible. Of course, we'd love to help.

350
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:36,169
And OSHA, every year we go to FAA and say, a bunch of your workers are asking us to step in and intervene.

351
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:39,380
And FAA would say, OSHA, mind your own business. We got this.

352
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:45,530
So we had this whole chunk of the workforce falling between the cracks of two agencies really, really bad.

353
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:49,790
Finally, last year, the FAA was like, My God, OSHA stopped asking, you can have them.

354
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:54,110
And so now they're actually the flight attendants covered by OSHA, which is progress.

355
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,709
Also, we have a huge chunk of folks who are employed in the military,

356
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:04,480
who are covered by the Department of Defense, which has their own health and safety.

357
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:09,290
So you can see it. It's kind of a patchwork system here.

358
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,450
The last slide was all regulatory responsibility.

359
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:18,110
So those are agencies that can set regulations and actually enforce them.

360
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,800
We also have an advisory or a research body here.

361
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:28,549
So the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, is responsible for,

362
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:34,010
again, making recommendations about lots of different health related exposures,

363
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:41,880
also for providing technical assistance and assessments to support states that are dealing with issues within the CDC.

364
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,200
There's a group called the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

365
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,700
That's really the federal government's health and safety research arm.

366
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:55,130
So they find virtually all of the occupational health research that happens in the United States.

367
00:35:55,850 --> 00:36:00,890
And they also have something called the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, or ATSDR,

368
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:07,250
which is responsible for evaluating specific chemicals and trying to figure out basically how bad and argues for us.

369
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:15,009
So occupational safety and health has has been around for a while in this country.

370
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:23,110
It's been around slightly longer than I have, for instance. And Congress passed the Occupational Safety and Health Act for the Act in 1970.

371
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:29,440
And so basically this was Congress saying worker health and safety needs to be a priority.

372
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:34,960
We are requiring that two different agencies be established to take care of this

373
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:41,100
OSHA that's going to regulate and set rules for occupational hazards and knowledge.

374
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,650
That's going to do research on sort of emerging occupational hazards.

375
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:52,950
Now, at the time when OSHA was created, they were given kind of two different avenues through which they could protect workers.

376
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:58,110
So the one is OSHA has the right to set specific standards.

377
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:03,960
So OSHA can and has says, hey, if you've got a worker in a workplace who's working with benzene,

378
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,549
here's how much benzene that worker can be exposed to over the course of anymore.

379
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:12,840
And you're breaking the law. We can come in and we can find and sanction or even shut you down.

380
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:21,870
But, you know, there's a lot of chemicals out there. And Congress recognized pollution may not have a limit for every single hazard in the workplace.

381
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,739
So they also provided them with a general duty clause.

382
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:30,600
And this basically says if you're an employer who has workers working for you,

383
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,080
you have a general duty to provide a workplace that's free of recognized health and safety hazards.

384
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:44,040
In other words, if I walk in as an ocean inspector to a workplace and I see people doing stuff that is clearly going to get them killed,

385
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:50,720
even if there's not a specific standard on that, I can say I'm still going to shut you down because this is obviously dangerous,

386
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:55,140
even though there's no specific standard on it. That's actually a quite powerful rule.

387
00:37:55,350 --> 00:38:04,500
Social media doesn't use as often as they should just to kind of reinforce how old the Occupational Safety and Health Act is.

388
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:09,600
And these were the styles that were infected. And God help me, I hope they never, ever come back.

389
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:15,030
OSHA has broad jurisdiction within private industry.

390
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:20,819
As I said, they've also kind of broken up their regulations to reflect that not every industry is the same.

391
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:29,910
Again, construction is not as dangerous as fishing or differently dangerous than logging, so those industries might need specific standards.

392
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:36,960
So there's something called the Code of Federal Regulations, which is basically how the government keeps track of everything that it does.

393
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,629
And within the code of Federal Regulations, there are rules for OSHA specific to general industry.

394
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:50,130
So things like manufacturing, there's a different set of rules that apply to maritime or longshore work, like dockworkers.

395
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:56,490
There is a specific set of rules that apply to construction and another specific set of rules that apply to agriculture.

396
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:05,390
Now, coming back to this general duty obligation or the general duty clause, this turns out to be a hugely powerful tool.

397
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:12,570
So again, if I'm an inspector now, OSHA inspectors are very well trained and they have to know all the different regulations that they could cite.

398
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:18,930
But if there is not a regulation and believe it or not, Ocean doesn't have a regulation for heat stress or heat stroke, for instance,

399
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:26,100
we have dozens of agricultural workers die every single year just in the state of California from being exposed to too much heat.

400
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:32,070
And OSHA doesn't have a limit on heat. So you can't walk out and say it's 113 degrees.

401
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,819
All these workers are breaking the rules by by working.

402
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:41,040
I'm going to give you a citation. They can't do that. But they can walk out and be like, my god, it's 113 degrees.

403
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:47,820
These workers have no shade, no brakes and no water. I'm going to cite you and maybe shut you down because one of these workers is going to die.

404
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:52,200
So very powerful rule that they maybe don't use as often as they should.

405
00:39:54,070 --> 00:40:03,720
The general duty clause refers to recognized hazards here and so recognized is inclusive of both things that OSHA already has a standard for,

406
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:14,380
but also things that OSHA doesn't have so-called promulgated standards, something that's actually been accepted into law and made a regulation excuse.

407
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:22,080
So have you talked about how many chemicals there are in commerce?

408
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:28,860
So how many chemicals are there in commerce and give or take like, oh, there's 85,000,

409
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,499
which that number is absolutely wrong, of course, but it's kind of our best guess.

410
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:40,380
It's something we can agree on. So if you think about OSHA, gosh, tried to set limits for 85,000 chemicals.

411
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:46,860
Each one of those limits needs to have allergy and toxicology and other data behind it not going to happen.

412
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:50,280
So what? We should just not have a limit for every one of those chemicals,

413
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:56,009
but they do have limits for some of the chemicals that have been sort of the worst for workers over time.

414
00:40:56,010 --> 00:41:06,479
So things like asbestos, there's a host of carcinogens for nitro by fennel chloride in organic arsenic.

415
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,040
All these things cost cancer led, of course, is bad for our urological systems.

416
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:16,120
Chromium six is a very strong carcinogen.

417
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:22,040
Some of you may have heard just a maybe two months ago there was a spill of chromium six.

418
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:28,350
And if you talked about this in class, thankfully, it turned out it was not nearly as much chromium as we thought was put into the river,

419
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:35,040
but nevertheless, some scary things like cadmium, benzene, cotton dust and other chemicals.

420
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,029
So what we should does have specific limits for these chemicals.

421
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:45,050
They've got a whole list of chemicals that, again, there's a regulation for as.

422
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:49,549
Bastos already appeared on the list. And here it appears again specifically to shipbuilding,

423
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:55,190
because historically the shipbuilding industry has had some of the worst asbestos exposures of any industry.

424
00:41:56,490 --> 00:42:05,100
You'll also see they have a specific limit, not just for lead, but also lead in construction, asbestos in construction and cadmium in construction.

425
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,330
So they try to, again,

426
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:13,590
be as specific as possible and recognize that construction and work and exposures in construction is not the same as working in a factory.

427
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:20,910
So we need some kind of more tailored regulations. It's just got a bunch of other regulations that relate to chemicals.

428
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:26,970
So they have requirements for ventilation, bringing fresh air into a workplace or sucking nasty hazards out.

429
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:32,670
They have regulations for specific kinds of manufacturing processes like drip tanks.

430
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:38,230
They have a regulation specifically for dealing with hazardous waste or an emergency response scenario.

431
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:43,700
They have regulations for welding, very important regulation for hazard communication.

432
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:48,150
Basically, that requires an employer to tell the workers at their worksite,

433
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:54,059
here are the dangerous chemicals you're working with, which seems like such a basic bit of information.

434
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,560
But before that regulation,

435
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:02,520
there was no requirement that you tell your workers that what you're working with can cause cancer or could kill you if you inhale it.

436
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:08,580
And then, for instance, there's a regulation specific to hazardous chemicals in laboratories,

437
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:14,190
which is also got a slew of regulations related to personal protective equipment.

438
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:24,600
So things like eye and face protection, respiratory protection, footwear, gloves and all sorts of other PPE, of which there are many, many types.

439
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:30,839
We should have some more general regulations to things like, gosh, if you've got workers working for you,

440
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:37,440
they need to have the ability to wash their hands and go to the bathroom, and that's to be sanitation facilities places for them to take a break.

441
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:44,790
There needs to be provision of medical services and first aid. There's a requirement by OSHA that if someone gets hurt on the job,

442
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:54,090
it gets reported to OSHA and also a requirement that OSHA has access to medical and bio monitoring data from workers.

443
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,780
Now, of course, the chemicals are not the only thing that workers have to worry about.

444
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:04,159
I've already talked to you about physical hazards previously,

445
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:10,190
so OSHA has regulations on noise exposure, ionizing radiation and non-ionizing radiation.

446
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,400
So lots of different regulations out there.

447
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:19,910
Not one for every hazard in the workplace ever, because that's kind of an infinite number, but a pretty decent selection.

448
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,950
However, the picture gets even more confusing at this point.

449
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:33,139
So when the act was passed in 1970, Congress said, we're going to establish this federal agency,

450
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:39,260
but if any state wants to establish their own state and they have the right to do that,

451
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:46,310
and so immediately about half of the states and so that half is the dark blue that you see on the map here.

452
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,330
Half of the state said, I don't want the feds dealing with workers in my state.

453
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:53,930
We know best how to protect workers, for instance, in Michigan.

454
00:44:53,930 --> 00:45:01,999
So we have Michigan State OSHA, where my OSHA's most of the West Coast states have their own state plan.

455
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,520
So there's a California OSHA or Cal OSHA.

456
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:10,370
The states that you see in Gray here said we don't need to do this ourselves, will rely on the federal government.

457
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:15,590
And so the curiosity that this creates is for someone like me.

458
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:17,510
When I was working at the University of Washington,

459
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:23,720
I was often doing research with logging workers right here at the point where Washington and Oregon and Idaho come together.

460
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:27,440
And so for some standards, noise is one example.

461
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:35,000
The limit is different in Washington, but it is in Oregon than it is in Idaho, which is just ridiculous.

462
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,129
But that's how it is. So when Congress said the states can create their own state, OSHA, the caveat,

463
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:43,880
they said, is, whatever you do, it has to be at least as good as what it does.

464
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:51,260
So Idaho has the federal limit and Washington and Oregon have both gone beyond and developed basically better, more protective limits.

465
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,430
But you might imagine this can get pretty confusing if you're a company that

466
00:45:55,430 --> 00:46:00,169
has offices or locations in lots of different states trying to keep track of,

467
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:05,329
well, what is the local regulation that applies here? There is no other country that does this this way.

468
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:10,850
It's kind of crazy, but it's where we are. And you'll see there's some additional shading here.

469
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:19,909
So a few states like New York and Connecticut have said we want to take responsibility for governmental workers who,

470
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:24,650
as I said earlier, are otherwise totally, basically ignored by OSHA.

471
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:31,460
And so so it's a very complicated framework, as I think you've probably grasped already.

472
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:38,509
So I could trash talk our occupational health situation in the US all day long and I will because you're interested.

473
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:46,579
But I do want to step back and say I don't mean to imply that what has been done is not effective, regulations have been effective.

474
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:54,560
So if you look at the table here, we've got the year the number of workers who've died, the fatality rate and the rate per 100,000 workers.

475
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:59,240
And so you can see if we go back to 1970, at the top of the table there,

476
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:06,320
there were about 14,000 workers who died that year and a fatality rate of 18 per 100,000 workers.

477
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:12,739
So OSHA was established in 1971. And if you look sort of scanned down the years here,

478
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:19,430
you can see the number of deaths has been steadily going down and the fatality rate has been steadily going down as well.

479
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:24,260
So I don't know that we can attribute all of that to OSHA.

480
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:33,800
And can anyone think of maybe another reason the workplace fatalities and illnesses might have been going down since the 1970s in this country?

481
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:41,410
It doesn't have anything to do with the ocean. Companies have moved manufacturing outside of the US.

482
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:42,940
Exactly right.

483
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:53,079
So this this notion of offshoring where lots of sort of traditional heavy industry, that also tends to be pretty dangerous companies figured out,

484
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:59,709
gosh, I can pay a worker in another country a fraction of what I have to pay them here, and they don't have any regulations there.

485
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,120
So I can just do whatever I want.

486
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:08,590
So it may be and it certainly is the case, at least partly, that some of our most dangerous jobs just don't exist in this country anymore.

487
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:14,290
But again, I do want to give OSHA credit where credit is due, because there have been improvements.

488
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,490
I do, though, want to acknowledge again, I can beat up on all day.

489
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:21,960
They have an impossible job to do, but they're a very small agency.

490
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:27,910
So if you talk to employers, you might get the impression that there's like an OSHA inspector just circling overhead,

491
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:31,390
like hanging off a drone, ready to swoop in the second they do anything wrong.

492
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:37,900
Nothing could be further from the truth. So OSHA has about one inspector for 60,000 workers.

493
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,540
They have 9 million workplaces to cover.

494
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:49,180
And so your odds as a random employer in the United States of ever seeing an ocean inspector are once in 57 years.

495
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:53,110
So most of you in your jobs will never see an ocean inspector.

496
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:58,510
Now, there are exceptions. If you're in an industry that's really dangerous, you're going to see OSHA more often.

497
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:04,870
If you have a fatality, if someone is killed in your workplace, you're going to see OSHA right away because they want to come and investigate that.

498
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:13,510
But if you're just working for kind of a regular old company or agency, you are not going to see an ocean inspector in your lifetime at work.

499
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:20,320
So they are not this giant, monolithic organization that they're sometimes made out to again.

500
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:29,739
So thinking about kind of the success of OSHA, because I don't want to downplay that what OSHA has done and what the predecessor agencies to OSHA

501
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:34,389
have done not only has reduced the number of workers were killing in this country every year,

502
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:42,190
but it's also reduced exposures, too, which is great. So what we're looking at here is different years, starting from 1914 to 2010,

503
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:47,060
and we're looking at as best as you, so as best as a very potent carcinogen,

504
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:52,059
because there's actually a couple of different types of cancer in in the numbers that

505
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:56,680
are listed here are limits that were put into place for workers working with asbestos.

506
00:49:56,690 --> 00:50:02,020
So 12 F over CC stands for 12 fibers per cubic centimeter.

507
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:04,620
So that's one way to express a limit.

508
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:12,670
So if you're breathing air, that limit says there can't be more than 12 asbestos fibers in any cubic centimeter of air you're breathing.

509
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:20,320
So that's a concentration. So you can see the use of asbestos in this country really didn't pick up until about 1910.

510
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:23,260
It kind of sputtered along until the start of World War Two.

511
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:28,930
And then we figured out, gosh, we don't want our ships to burn when they're attacked in the war.

512
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:35,859
And if we make them out of asbestos, they don't burn nearly as much. If we started using huge amounts of asbestos and a few years after that,

513
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:42,510
we started seeing lots of these shipyard workers coming down with mesothelioma, which is a cancer that's very characteristic processes.

514
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:50,650
And so at the time there was a limit put in place of 12 fibers per cubic centimeter and it was quickly realized that still way too much asbestos,

515
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:54,070
people are still getting very, very sick. And so over time,

516
00:50:54,070 --> 00:51:00,760
the amount of asbestos that was permitted for workers to breathe was steadily ratcheted down and ratcheted down so

517
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:08,110
far that it basically became economically infeasible to work with asbestos anymore because to reach these really,

518
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:12,700
really low concentrations that were allowed is kind of technically impossible for some industries.

519
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:17,560
It also helps that Congress passed that a complete asbestos ban,

520
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:24,040
but a partial ban on asbestos that made it just difficult or impossible for some industries to to use asbestos anyway.

521
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,890
Again, the idea that if we lower the limits down, we can get this stuff out of the workplace.

522
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:36,370
That's that's great. That's huge progress coming back to mining, which was mentioned earlier.

523
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:42,370
So OSHA, of course, is responsible for general industry in MSHA, responsible for mining.

524
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:48,550
So what we're looking at here are the number of fatalities. This is the rate per 100 miners across the years.

525
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:55,989
The rates used to be just incredibly high until about 1977 when MSHA was created.

526
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:59,590
And MSHA came in and said, look, we can't kill this many miners anymore.

527
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:03,819
This is not okay. Started studying more and more protective limits.

528
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:08,110
And we can see that the number of fatalities has declined substantially.

529
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:14,800
Now, the same story here applies that was mentioned earlier. So some of the most dangerous mining may not be done in this country anymore,

530
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:22,870
but we still absolutely have lots of mining going on and it is way safer today than it was 40 years ago, and I think we can credit them for that.

531
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:30,310
So those are success stories. Undeniably, we are doing a better job now than we were when I was a kid, for instance, 100 years ago.

532
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:36,970
But, you know, if we think back to that number that you all said, 85,000 chemicals.

533
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:40,920
That's a lot of chemicals out there. OSHA has limits for only about 500.

534
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:47,470
So I'm no mathematician, but that leaves a lot of chemicals that we don't have a limit for.

535
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:58,750
And in fact, if we look at the number of new limits that OSHA has passed since they were established in 1971, it's only about 30 agents.

536
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:09,850
So unfortunately, when OSHA goes to set a limit, they have to provide all this documentation, epidemiological data,

537
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:16,120
toxicology data specific to that chemical, and they have to essentially compile all this research themselves.

538
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:23,950
When OSHA was established in 1970, Congress said for one time and one time only OSHA,

539
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:28,029
you can look around and see what are the other limits that are in use in the US or around the world.

540
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:35,019
And you can take those and make them US law because we're not expecting a brand new agency to come out with hundreds of limits right off the bat.

541
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:43,570
And there are others out there. So OSHA did, and most of those 500 chemicals have limits that were established in 1971 with the agency.

542
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:49,680
Now, in the 1980s, OSHA was like, gosh, these limits are already way out of date.

543
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:53,920
They're like 20 years old. Science has progressed. We know more about all of these chemicals.

544
00:53:54,190 --> 00:54:00,610
Let's revise and improve our limits. And so they they went and they said, we want to update like 200 more chemicals.

545
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:05,630
And the Supreme Court told them, no, you have to do it chemical by chemical based chemical.

546
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:11,560
And so each one of these regulations for a specific chemical takes about ten years to get through the system.

547
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:16,930
So they're very slow. They're totally hamstrung. No matter what OSHA does, they get sued.

548
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:22,780
So when they try to set a new limit, industry will sue them and say, You're going to put us out of business.

549
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:26,200
How dare you? The dollar is important.

550
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:34,329
And then if they do something that's not considered protective enough, then labor unions will sue them and say, Why aren't you doing the job?

551
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:40,690
You should if you need to protect this better. And in some cases, like our current noise standard, OSHA gets sued by both.

552
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:47,590
So when OSHA put forth this new noise limit in 1982, industry sued them and said, This is impossible.

553
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:51,909
You're going to put us out of business. And Labor sued them and said, What a joke. How about actually protecting us?

554
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:55,690
And it was like, it's an impossible job, as I said.

555
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:00,579
So let's dove a little bit more into some of these exposure limits.

556
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:07,240
And so I already mentioned there's physical hazards, there's biological agents, there's certainly chemical hazards in the workplace.

557
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:13,149
And so OSHA can set different kinds of limits here, so they can specify an air concentration.

558
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:22,630
So fibers per cubic centimeter, for instance, or parts per million, where they would say, if you're exposed below this level in any given work shift,

559
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:29,259
we think you have a hopefully minimal risk of getting sick from that because for a physical agent, they might say,

560
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:35,020
well, how much could you be exposed to without getting sort of maybe any illness or a small reversible illness?

561
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,959
But they can also send a very different kind of limit. They could say if you're a truck driver, you can only drive 12 hours a day.

562
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,870
Any more than that. We think you're going to be too tired and you're going to crash.

563
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:47,590
So they have sort of lots of different options for setting regulations.

564
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,950
I talked kind of generically earlier about occupational exposure limits or.

565
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,550
LS So these are limits for specific chemicals or physical agents.

566
00:55:57,850 --> 00:56:03,640
When OSHA sets them, they become law in the United States and they're called the permissible exposure limits for.

567
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:13,950
So I've taken this from OSHA's website, and I'll go through this.

568
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:16,110
And let me just give you an analogy after that.

569
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:25,080
So again, OSHA recognizes that many people's permissible exposure limits are outdated and inadequate for ensuring protection of workers health.

570
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:33,930
Industrial experience and scientific data clearly indicate that in some instances, these adaptive limits are not sufficiently protective for workers.

571
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:43,560
OSHA spells remain in effect, however, OSHA recommends that employers consider using alternative exposure limits, basically because hours are crap.

572
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:49,500
Can you imagine logging on to the FAA website and seeing them say most planes are safe,

573
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:54,329
but we really don't feel like our limits are all that great and we can't guarantee that your plane is safe when you're flying out.

574
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:59,129
It's just outrageous to have a federal agency have to say, look, these are the law,

575
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:03,000
but they're not good and you should really go elsewhere if you really want to protect your workers.

576
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:11,939
It's an embarrassment, frankly. You have all, I think, talked about the Environmental Protection Agency here probably at some length in class already.

577
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:21,030
And so the EPA, as you know, is sort of responsible for monitoring air and water and soil and setting and enforcing pollution regulations.

578
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:27,030
They're a pretty big agency, something around 14,000 employees, about a $10 billion budget.

579
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:30,900
That's that's a lot of money. The EPA also has teeth.

580
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:40,139
Okay. What it does. So, for instance, they can apply civil penalties, $32,000 per incident per day.

581
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:44,850
So if you're actively, knowingly contaminating the environment and you get caught,

582
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:52,050
that can be a huge fine right up off the bat and up to 15 years in jail for breaking these environmental laws.

583
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:58,260
And the EPA typically considers a risk to be acceptable, for instance, for cancer.

584
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:04,950
If we've got a million people exposed to this chemical and one of them gets cancer, they would consider that to be an acceptable risk.

585
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:09,000
Any more than one would be unacceptable. Less than one per million is fine.

586
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:11,730
So that's kind of how we regulate the environment.

587
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:18,390
For OSHA, again, they have very broad powers to inspect working environments and set and enforce health and safety regs.

588
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:25,620
They're a very small agency. There are about 2300 employees, about 2000 inspectors for the whole United States.

589
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:32,310
They have a budget of only about half a billion dollars. So, you know, roughly a twice as big as the EPA.

590
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,430
They also don't have the same teeth in EPA.

591
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:46,409
So if OSHA can prove that someone sort of knowingly contributed to a worker death, they can find that person up to $70,000.

592
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:53,430
So that's what your life as a worker is amounts to basically to the federal government, $70,000.

593
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,969
And again, if OSHA can prove that your employer was so negligent that it directly and knowingly led to a worker death,

594
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:08,280
they could put that person in jail for up to six months. It's just we we have much better protections for the environment than we do the workforce.

595
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:14,430
And then unlike the EPA, where they would say if the risk is more than one in a million, that's not acceptable for OSHA.

596
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:19,680
It's often more like one in a thousand. So more than one in a thousand workers gets cancer.

597
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:28,020
That's bad, but less than one of the 1000. We're okay with that. It's orders of magnitude less protective than how we treat environmental limits.

598
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:33,450
So kind of circling back around to these occupational exposure limits,

599
00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:37,830
I said that OSHA can set limits on how many hours you could work or how much you can breathe.

600
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:43,920
They have a couple of different kinds of limits for for things that you breathe, for instance, so there can be a daily limit.

601
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:48,090
How much can you breathe in on an average over an eight hour work shift?

602
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,040
And again, those kinds of limits are designed to protect against the chronic hazards.

603
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:57,000
So keep you safe over your 40 year estimated working career.

604
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:03,239
They can also set short term limits. That's an average exposure over only a 15 minute period,

605
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:08,729
and that's specifically designed for chemicals that we're not necessarily worried about long term risk.

606
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:12,420
But if you breathe too much, it can poison you right now and maybe kill you or knock you out.

607
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,410
So that's more of a very short term acute effect.

608
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:22,260
They can set a ceiling limit where they say, we're not so concerned about your average day to day,

609
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:29,489
but you can never go above this specific level because maybe that sort of triggers an unacceptably high risk and then they can set

610
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:38,940
some emergency limits related to sort of your ability if you get exposed to a chemical to remove yourself from that situation,

611
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:41,969
if it's going to knock you out so fast, you don't have a chance to escape.

612
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:43,380
That's especially concerning.

613
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:55,160
And so if we imagine a job and most jobs fit this profile now, you know, some jobs maybe not, Professor, but some jobs work only 8 hours a day.

614
01:00:56,030 --> 01:01:01,790
And we might imagine that we don't sit and do the same thing for all straight 8 hours.

615
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:08,690
We might have breaks and make it up and do different activities. And so if we think about exposures that go along with those different activities,

616
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:13,760
most workers exposures are going to go up and down for different periods of the day.

617
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:19,710
And so what we generally focus on is this eight hour time weighted average exposure.

618
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:25,970
We think that's kind of the best representation of your your risk of most health effects.

619
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:32,810
But again, we might set a short term exposure limit and say, okay, for this 15 minute period, you can't go any higher than this.

620
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:38,839
And then again, the ceiling limit, we would say you can never, ever be exposed to this chemical or to this level.

621
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:46,760
It's just too dangerous. We actually have a lot of different types of occupational exposure limits.

622
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:51,730
So what I've been describing to you so far is sort of up at the top of this pyramid here.

623
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:55,400
So the limits that OSHA has are quantitative.

624
01:01:55,820 --> 01:02:00,680
They're based on science, on epidemiological and toxicological studies.

625
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:03,799
There's a lot of work required to put each of those together.

626
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:10,970
And again, the whole court process that I describe there is sort of lower level and maybe less rigorous standards.

627
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:15,850
So as I mentioned earlier, an individual company can say, I don't care what OSHA says,

628
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:20,360
here's how we do it in this company as long as it's at least as good as what it says.

629
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:23,840
So a company can't say we're going to ignore OSHA. That's that's bad.

630
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:30,470
But they can always say we're going to do a better job than, oh, sure, we're going to allow our workers less exposure than OSHA allows.

631
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:37,970
And sort of at the bottom here, there's been a move afoot for the last 15 years or so to recognize not every

632
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:41,600
company has an industrial hygienist who might be able to interpret these limits.

633
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:47,870
And so there's something called hazard banding, which is essentially a tool that's designed to allow a manager,

634
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:55,909
someone who doesn't have kind of deep scientific knowledge to look at a process and compare it to some different criteria and decide,

635
01:02:55,910 --> 01:03:01,400
like, is this something we think we can handle in house or is it something I really need to go get an industrial atmosphere?

636
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:07,590
Now I mentioned acceptable risk already, so acceptable risk being it.

637
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:16,159
How comfortable are we with a certain number of people getting sick or killed or harmed over the years in workplace limits,

638
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,590
we tend to have a much higher acceptable risk.

639
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:24,080
So the idea is, well, you're at work or you're choosing to be at that job so you can choose to take on that extra risk.

640
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:30,830
Whereas in a community or an environmental setting, we typically say people in the community don't really have control over their exposures.

641
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:35,660
So we should allow them much lower exposures because again, they don't have much control.

642
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:41,239
And this comes back again to sort of the idea that an occupational exposure though I think

643
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:44,930
we can think of lots of circumstances where the work you do is not at all volunteer.

644
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:52,430
It's the only job available. But the idea is that an occupational exposure is voluntary versus an involuntary community exposure.

645
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:55,999
You know, we can also think about different outcomes.

646
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:04,129
So if we've got a very unpleasant outcome like dying from cancer, we might be much more protective there than we would for an outcome that's like,

647
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:07,790
well, you might have a skin rash that will potentially go away over time.

648
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,299
You know, I think that's a little different than than death. And then, of course,

649
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:17,209
we have to think about cultural differences to what we consider acceptable here in America is quite

650
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:21,980
different in many cases than what's considered acceptable in some of the other countries I work in.

651
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:23,870
For instance, just, you know,

652
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:31,670
if you're if you're living and working in a country where the average life expectancy is is 50 years or 30 years less than it is in this country,

653
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:36,380
you're going to have a different take on risk than you do, for instance, living here.

654
01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:45,100
Now, I've already mentioned kind of all the obstacles that OSHA faces in doing their job and setting limits.

655
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:50,440
OSHA's goal really is to protect all employees in the workforce, at least all that they have jurisdiction over.

656
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:57,280
For many so called material impairment or health or any have functional capacity limitations.

657
01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:02,590
And so what it also wants to set a new limit they have to prove.

658
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:10,270
Well, let me let me step back. If OSHA says, gosh, we set a limit for benzene of so many parts per million and we've now realized that's way too high.

659
01:05:10,270 --> 01:05:16,180
There's still lots of workers getting sick. We want to lower the level to a more protective limit.

660
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:22,970
Legally, OSHA has to demonstrate that there are significant health risks associated with the existing limit.

661
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:27,710
So it's got to be at least as harmful as one in 1000 workers getting sick again.

662
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:34,189
Three orders of magnitude less protective. And they also have to prove that if new limits adopted,

663
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:41,540
it's going to actually reduce the risk to people and they have to demonstrate in whatever way they can that if the limits adopted,

664
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:46,820
it's technically and economically feasible. So those are huge burdens on OSHA to prove.

665
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:53,030
And the result is not that OSHA isn't trying. They're constantly trying to pass new limits.

666
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:59,929
But it's very complicated, it's very time consuming, and it's very expensive to have to come up with these limits,

667
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:10,149
run them by the public, and then go through the whole legal. I think I'm going to skip this one because I've already beaten that to death.

668
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:15,240
So let's think now, not about OSHA, but about some of the alternatives that are out there.

669
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:19,320
So there's a group called the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygiene.

670
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:27,250
It's quite a mouthful. They just go by ACG, which I actually am the chair of the Physical Agents Committee for HGH.

671
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:33,670
So the committee that comes up with recommendations for limits for things like the ways in radiation, physical hazards.

672
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:40,540
So HGH has been putting out recommendations on occupational hazards for more than 70 years.

673
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:45,339
They are occupational exposure limits they refer to as threshold limit values.

674
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:49,180
So this is the threshold that if you go above it, you might get sick.

675
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:55,180
They also have so-called biological exposure indices, not for things that are outside your body,

676
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:59,470
but for things that we can measure inside your body to see. Is that acceptable or not?

677
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:08,050
The key here, and this is its own language is they are a learned professional body.

678
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:15,010
So they are essentially rating limits that are designed to be interpreted by other industrial hygienists.

679
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:19,419
They're not intended to be laws in any way.

680
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:22,630
They don't consider technical or economic feasibility.

681
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:32,140
They are truly best practices. Now, when I said OSHA was able to suck in a bunch of existing rules in 1971 when they were established,

682
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:35,560
all the chemical limits that they got, they took from age.

683
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:39,940
So in some cases, HGH is recommendations do end up becoming law.

684
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:41,799
It's rare in the United States,

685
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:49,690
but actually many countries around the world take HGH as recommendations and say that's going to be legally enforceable, which is great.

686
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:59,839
We've also got Ash, which I mentioned to you earlier. So Naish is our own federal agency tasked with ideally working side by side with OSHA.

687
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:08,210
OSHA doing the enforcement and nice figuring out what should we be looking at, what's coming down, what's on the horizon in terms of emerging hazards?

688
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:13,849
Nash puts out its own recommended limits, which they call recommended exposure limits.

689
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:20,900
And these are, I would say, unfortunately, largely ignored even in the U.S. but they're definitely ignored outside of the U.S.

690
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:31,920
Now, HGH, just to come back to them is pretty distinctive because they they don't consider, you know, different applications in different countries.

691
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:36,600
As I said, they don't consider technical or socioeconomic feasibility.

692
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:42,570
They are purely scientific. So it's like if you want to do the absolute best job, you can't protect your workers.

693
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:46,800
This is the limit you should strive for and you are not legally obligated to do that.

694
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:52,800
But if you strive for this, we think you'll be doing the best job you possibly can at keeping your workforce safe.

695
01:08:53,550 --> 01:09:00,240
And the other thing, as I said, is these thresholds and the values that they put out are really designed to be interpreted by people like me,

696
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:04,620
trained industrial hygiene as to, who knows, sort of the art and science of the discipline.

697
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:13,020
Now, I have already mentioned this to you. But again, just to kind of reinforce, in 1971 when OSHA said, oh my God,

698
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:16,370
we're a brand new agency and we've got to come up with all these limits overnight.

699
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:21,000
Can't be done. They were able to pull in all the existing HGH copies.

700
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:27,300
Those are still the limits on the book, for the most part. So most of those TLB is dated to 1968.

701
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:32,850
So here we are in 2022, trying to protect our workers and for the vast majority of chemicals.

702
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:39,900
We're doing that with a limit set in 1968. You don't think our scientific knowledge has advanced since 1968?

703
01:09:40,230 --> 01:09:44,070
You haven't been paying attention. Of course, there's been lots of developments, lots of studies.

704
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:48,360
We know OSHA knows that their limits are out of date, but that's what they're stuck with.

705
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:56,700
I mentioned that OSHA in 1989 tried to come up with a new expanded list to say, hey, we're just going to pull all of these numbers again.

706
01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:01,860
They got spanked by the court and they had to essentially revert to just doing

707
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:07,050
every chemical one by one at a cost of millions of dollars a year of the time.

708
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:11,430
It's now winding down here.

709
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:14,610
I'll mention that, as I already alluded to,

710
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:22,140
the limits that OSHA sets for a particular chemical can be quite different than the limits that HGH sets are some other agency.

711
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:26,460
So what we're looking at here are a bunch of different chemicals. All of them are bad for us.

712
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:31,710
And then on the columns here, we're looking at different agencies around the world.

713
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:37,880
HGH we talked about you can see we've got an Australian agency, the European Commission,

714
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:44,720
a Finnish agency, a French agency, German agency, OSHA, and then the Swedish Work Environment Authority.

715
01:10:44,730 --> 01:10:48,750
So again, all of these agencies have access to the same data.

716
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:54,900
All of them have the opportunity to review our scientific knowledge.

717
01:10:55,230 --> 01:10:57,959
But you can see the numbers are quite different.

718
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:08,460
So, you know, just to pick one out here, the French agency NRC thinks that for pedophilia against a limit of 0.75 parts per million is reasonable,

719
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:14,940
whereas the rest of the world is up in the 10 to 28 and OSHA is it's 75, 100 times higher.

720
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:23,010
So the issue with OSHA, of course, is that number is now 50 plus years old and it just has never been updated.

721
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:28,200
But these other agencies have updated and they've all looked at the data and they come away with different conclusions.

722
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:33,629
And there's been different, you know, sort of impediments to making a decision.

723
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:38,940
So HGH, again, isn't constraining themselves with technical or economic feasibility.

724
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:46,630
It's it's a strictly scientific standard, whereas some of these other agencies are also considering, well, even if that's the level we should go for.

725
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:49,140
Is it economically possible to do that?

726
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:56,880
And so you can end up again with lots of different agencies, even for the same chemical having very different limits,

727
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:03,350
which means that workers in some countries might be much better protected against a specific chemical than they are in other countries.

728
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:07,350
So that immediately creates kind of an occupational justice issue, if you will.

729
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:14,760
So the good news is occupational exposure limits have tended to come down over time.

730
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:20,819
So this is looking at trends and, you know, across standards by agency.

731
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:29,670
So the average level of occupational exposure limits set by HGH has declined pretty dramatically since the 1940s.

732
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:31,890
The same has been true with Sweden.

733
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:39,060
The European Union is a relatively comer to the game, but their standards are also getting ratcheted down and this kind of makes sense.

734
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:44,370
You know, the original and initial limit you said, is typically based on not so much data.

735
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:47,639
You're kind of making a guess based on the the evidence.

736
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:53,340
And then as the chemical continues to be used, there's more studies, we learn more and we often figure out,

737
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:58,049
wow, what we thought was safe is actually nowhere close to safe and we need to continue lowering it.

738
01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:59,760
And that is generally happening.

739
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:09,479
And I'll also say, and this is sort of very complementary to what I said a moment ago, when we look at a list here, not just of dangerous chemicals,

740
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:13,620
but of potential carcinogens, cancer causing agents,

741
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:21,149
the agencies can't even agree on whether or not each of these chemicals causes cancer or is likely to cause cancer.

742
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:27,330
And again, it's because each different agency is coming at this with its own perspective, its own considerations.

743
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:35,910
HGH has a rigorous review process, but it might not be quite as rigorous as what a government agency goes through.

744
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:39,240
They may have other data that they are obligated to consider.

745
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:42,780
So we can't even agree again on what chemicals cause cancer.

746
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:48,500
I'd like to spend a couple of minutes now again, just to get you all thinking before I let you go here.

747
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:52,290
So we've been talking about occupational health now for close to an hour and a half.

748
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:58,499
I'd love to get you to put your occupational hazard recognition hat on and take a look at this picture.

749
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:05,040
So this is a worker working in an aluminum smelter. What do you see in this picture that might be dangerous for that worker?

750
01:14:09,690 --> 01:14:12,760
Is that fired? Coal fired?

751
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:16,620
Yeah, absolutely. So they're working their molten metal. The potential for fire.

752
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:20,410
What else might be bad for them? The heat. The heat, absolutely.

753
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:23,440
So this molten aluminum is about 1500 degrees.

754
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:26,740
That's quite warm. Certainly enough to burn the smoke.

755
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:31,419
The smoke. Right. So you can see there's fuel coming off of this molten aluminum.

756
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:34,629
And I can tell you it contains some pretty nasty stuff that I see.

757
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:43,790
Another hand. Anything else that might potentially be bad for this worker?

758
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:50,010
Yeah. The light coming off the fire. Yeah.

759
01:14:50,030 --> 01:14:56,770
So there's a lot of ultraviolet and infrared light to physical agents that could cause potentially harm to the workers bodies.

760
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:04,630
Anything else? How much do you suppose this bar weighs that he's tamping the aluminum with?

761
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:06,999
The answer is, I don't know, but a lot. It's quite heavy.

762
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,430
And so you can imagine some ergonomic issues there as he or she is trying to position that bar.

763
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,900
Now, of course, they're wearing personal protective equipment.

764
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:20,860
The visor here is gold plated to keep that ultraviolet and infrared light out there in some

765
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:25,840
heat protective clothing that keeps the heat out but actually also traps their bodies in.

766
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:30,360
So they may end up in a stress situation. Also, what happens to this worker if they get hurt?

767
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:34,090
Is there anyone else around? Maybe. Maybe not.

768
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:37,980
So what kind of remote work there? What about this worker?

769
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:42,670
So this is inside of a coal mine underground. Kinds of things might be harmful here.

770
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:51,280
The tunnel collapses, tunnel collapse? Absolutely.

771
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:56,830
That's what miners worry about most. In my experience, you have to add dust or just general irritants.

772
01:15:57,010 --> 01:16:02,390
Sure. So you you read about potters right on the second or third slide.

773
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:07,149
So black lung is something that coal mining workers have had or pneumoconiosis.

774
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:10,270
This is a lung disease from breathing in too much coal dust.

775
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:15,640
And there's also silica that the earth is made out of there breathing in that can cause silicosis.

776
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:21,610
Other things that might be harmful. Yeah. Noise. Noise. Of course, that heavy equipment is quite noisy.

777
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:30,249
What do you suppose this equipment is powered by? Generator could be generator.

778
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:33,310
So it could be gasoline, it could be diesel.

779
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:37,690
Both of those are going to put out combustion products that might asphyxiate the worker.

780
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:45,460
Could be an electrical. We don't know. I'll also say, you know, what happens if the gas runs out, then there's no light in there.

781
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:50,820
And this worker extract, if they have an emergency, what about this setting here?

782
01:16:50,830 --> 01:16:55,810
So kind of a standard American health care setting. What kinds of hazards might there be for these workers?

783
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:08,730
Just like the diseases and infections that are coming in through the patients.

784
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:17,070
Sure. So tuberculosis, HIV, you know, anything that someone might have the physicians and nurses and medical staff are potentially exposed to as well.

785
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:21,590
Other things we need to worry about. Sharps. Sharps.

786
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:28,470
Absolutely. So working with needles and scalpels, that kind of thing. Cuts and lacerations are unfortunately common.

787
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:33,090
Yep. Like back issues from the sedentary workers?

788
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:39,509
Sure. Back issues from sitting in front of a computer. Or increasingly back issues among the medical assistance who are lifting,

789
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:44,040
you know, enormously obese patients and don't have any AIDS to to help them lift.

790
01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:50,160
It's also like ergonomic issues where people are standing all the time.

791
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:53,880
Sure. Standing all the time is no better than sitting all the time. They're both not. Not great for you.

792
01:17:54,090 --> 01:17:59,590
I see. Yeah. These are dangerous with, like, medical machinery and x ray technician.

793
01:17:59,730 --> 01:18:02,880
Sure. Radiation exposure from an x ray machine gone wrong. Did you ever?

794
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:07,560
Yeah. Even, like alarms or monitors going off can be, like, stress inducing.

795
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:11,790
Absolutely. Also, what time of day is it here? No idea.

796
01:18:11,790 --> 01:18:16,260
I mean, this could be a night shift. People are kind of fighting their circadian rhythms, struggling to stay awake.

797
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:20,219
Patient violence, you know, coworker violence.

798
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:25,500
All those can be issues. What about this happy gentleman in his giant rig here?

799
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:31,540
What do we think might be harmful to him? Exhibition.

800
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:37,000
Vibration, of course, is sitting on top of a giant vibrating seat for who knows how many hours a day.

801
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:45,760
Other things you have, just like fatigue and general mental fatigue is a really, really big thing driving for a long time by yourself.

802
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:50,770
So absolutely fatigue from a concentration perspective, maybe sleep deprivation, too.

803
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:57,070
Did you have one as well? UV radiation? Yeah. So if this guy is going to get cancer on one arm, which one is it going to be?

804
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:05,499
My left arm if he's going to get a hearing loss in one ear, which is is it going to be also left from the window being open in the noise?

805
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:11,170
So there's a bunch of diseases that are very common among truck drivers and you've just hit on a couple of them.

806
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:18,160
So just in conclusion, I'll say, you know, we've got OSHA and ACG and other agencies in the U.S.,

807
01:19:18,610 --> 01:19:24,819
the World Health Organization and the International Labor Organization make recommendations related to worker health that are,

808
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:30,350
again, just that recommendations that are hopefully adopted by countries around the world, but often not.

809
01:19:31,570 --> 01:19:35,530
And then I'll I'll leave you just with the thought that not all workers are created equal either.

810
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:39,669
So we have to think about sort of more at risk populations.

811
01:19:39,670 --> 01:19:45,879
So women historically have been ignored by occupational health because their jobs were considered not dangerous.

812
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:52,300
But as we've started to look into them, into sort of historically female dominated jobs and realize these are just as dangerous as in others,

813
01:19:52,960 --> 01:20:00,970
child labor, of course, is a huge issue, which is not common in the United States unless you grow up on a farm, in which case it's very common.

814
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:09,030
Older workers are much more likely to die on the job than younger workers in socially and economically disadvantaged workers know.

815
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:13,690
If you're a worker in a country without proper documentation, you're going to take whatever job you can get,

816
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:18,040
and they're going to treat you as though you're taking whatever job you can get your credit report.

817
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:23,740
So we have to do that. Keep an eye out for those potential disparities as well.

818
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:27,490
So with that, thank you all for your attention. I appreciate it.

819
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:34,180
I know we're out of time. I'm happy to hang around if anyone has any questions, but otherwise, good luck on your exam later this week.

820
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:36,820
And thank you again to my.
