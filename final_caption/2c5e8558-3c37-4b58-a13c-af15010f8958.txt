1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,280
Also. They appreciate it when people have the cameras on.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:16,230
Otherwise, it's just like you're talking into a black hole. It's so nice to meet and see most of you.

3
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,480
My name is Lindsay Kobayashi. I'm an assistant professor in our department in epidemiology.

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,229
I am a faculty member in CCF.

5
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:34,020
I've also been really involved in global public health in our department as well as I actually taught this class last year.

6
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:42,929
So I'm really familiar with the curriculum and everything you all have been learning so far, as well as just how like the GHC program goes.

7
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,030
So I'm sorry that you still have to be over zoom for this class,

8
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:56,460
but I hope that all of your semesters are off to a good start and I hope to be able to meet many of you in person over the upcoming academic year.

9
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,890
So I'm just going to jump right into my lecture.

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,059
Just give me one sec. Okay. Can everybody see my screen?

11
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:14,160
Okay. Okay. So I'm just going to go right into it and then I'm just going to rely on you to like let me know if there's a question in the chat.

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:23,820
But also, everyone feel free if you want to interrupt me, if you have any questions, whether that is like for clarification or like discussion,

13
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,099
we can kind of like I can talk or we can also have this be kind of like interactive.

14
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:36,510
So like please do feel free to stop me at any point in time if you have questions or thoughts on anything that I'm bringing up.

15
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:44,639
So the title of this, the lecture today is Social Contextual Factors and Cognitive Aging in Rural South Africa.

16
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,180
So we're going to I don't think you've talked really at all about aging yet in the course,

17
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:57,689
but I want us to start thinking about aging on a population level and what that means for public health across various global settings.

18
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:03,839
But specifically for this talk, we're going to focus on South Africa and here's a little bit of an outline.

19
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,770
So we're going to talk a little bit broadly about cognitive health and aging.

20
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:14,160
And then I'm going to talk a bit more specifically about one specific study that I did on cognitive aging in South Africa.

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,520
And I'll also just apologize in advance. I have a bit of a cold, so I'm sorry for my voice if it kind of goes in and out.

22
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:32,360
So increasing evidence from the epidemiological literature suggests that dementia etiology or the subclinical period of dementia,

23
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:37,009
when its kind of chain of causation begins to occur, happens much,

24
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:42,919
much earlier in life than when the disease manifests, which of course, is later in life.

25
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:49,700
Most dementia cases, the symptoms start to appear and diagnosis typically occurs after age 65.

26
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:58,370
But we really think that the causes of dementia arise early in the life course and sort of accumulate as people live their lives.

27
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,700
And there's quite a lot of epidemiological evidence for this life course.

28
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:11,839
Social, contextual factors have consistently been associated with dementia risk as well as precursors to dementia risk,

29
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,600
such as rate of cognitive decline during aging.

30
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:23,299
So things like experiencing childhood adversity and experiencing adverse socioeconomic conditions in childhood kind of life course,

31
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:31,220
socioeconomic trajectories, education and social mobility and what that does for people's health and specifically their brain health,

32
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,610
things like social support, social networks, social engagement are thought to be protective of brain health,

33
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:42,049
sort of that idea of like cognitive reserve or use it or lose it sort of cognitively

34
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,110
stimulating social activities are thought to be good for cognitive health.

35
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:51,800
And again, the more that we maintain these things across the life course is thought to be, the better for cognitive aging.

36
00:03:52,490 --> 00:04:00,170
And then some really interesting recent evidence using natural experiments has shown things that compulsory schooling laws

37
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:08,720
that do things like increase the minimum age at which people can leave education is associated with reduced dementia risk,

38
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:17,900
and then doing things like handing out free public bus passes to older adults is also associated with risk of dementia, and that's thought to improve.

39
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:24,440
You know, improving access to transportation improves people's opportunities to do things like go to the doctor's office,

40
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,099
socialize, get out of the house, do groceries. So kind of getting these resources that are important for maintaining health,

41
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,950
but also to kind of expand the life space that we live in and increase opportunity for cognitive stimulation.

42
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:47,300
So in short, we feel pretty sure that a lot of these kind of social factors across the life course are associated with cognitive health in later life.

43
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,370
And so why is it important to take a global perspective when you start thinking

44
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,290
about how the social context across the life course shapes cognitive aging?

45
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,650
And I would argue aging like health and aging more broadly?

46
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:08,550
Well, first of all, global population aging is changing the demographics of low and middle income countries.

47
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:19,530
And this is happening to the extent that by 2050, over 75% of all global dementia cases are projected to occur in low and middle income countries.

48
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:24,540
And this is this is huge. And I will say this is not just happening for dementia,

49
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:31,530
but for several other chronic conditions that are associated with aging, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer.

50
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,090
So these are really major causes of death worldwide,

51
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:40,200
as well as responsible for a large global disease burden in terms of their prevalence and incidence.

52
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,610
So we really can't ignore population aging when we think about global health.

53
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:52,350
And this figure I really like to show, because I think it really illustrates the degree to which population aging is happening.

54
00:05:52,710 --> 00:06:00,990
So when I say population aging, I don't mean aging at an individual level where I get older, I kind of like a biological or cellular level.

55
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:09,990
When a population gets older, we think about it as the overall age structure of that population is shifting to having more people

56
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:15,299
aged under five or whatever age benchmark you want to think about to more people aged 65 and over.

57
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,230
I'm not sure if you have seen like population pyramids yet in the class, have you?

58
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,250
I mean, not yet, no. Okay. Okay. So you'll see population pyramid soon.

59
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,319
But those essentially kind of described like the age structure of a population like are

60
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,500
most people in the population aged under five or are they middle age or the older aged?

61
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:44,370
So when we talk about population aging, it's the share of a population that is aged over 65, which is the benchmark we're using here.

62
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,770
So in the top half of this figure,

63
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:56,280
we have the percentage of the population aged 65 and over in 2015 and it's color coded such that the sort of light yellow is the least,

64
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:03,180
the lowest percentage, which is in this figure less than 7%, and that increases up to 28% or more in the dark blue.

65
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,920
And then we have the kind of projection for 2050 all around the world.

66
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:17,729
And you'll see from this picture, of course, the rate or degree of population aging is the most pronounced across mostly kind of Western Europe,

67
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:22,200
North America, Russia, Australia, China, for example.

68
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,749
But it is absolutely also happening not just in high income countries.

69
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,410
It's happening you see across all countries in South America, Central America,

70
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,620
as well as many countries across Africa, as well as kind of Central Asia and Eastern Europe.

71
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,459
So it's really a population. Aging is really a global phenomenon.

72
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,200
And I think it would be a misconception to think of older people or aging populations as

73
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,640
something that is restricted to high income countries because that is just simply not true.

74
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:56,000
And this is another figure that kind of drives the same point home.

75
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,450
But I really like it because I think it's quite illustrative.

76
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:08,180
So we have time here on the x axis going all the way up to 2050 and then the percentage of the global population shown on the Y axis,

77
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:13,339
we have a red line showing the percentage of the global population that is under age five and

78
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,660
then the blue line showing the percentage of the global population that is age 65 and over.

79
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,420
So first we see a declining share of the population being under age five.

80
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,780
This is likely due to declining fertility,

81
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:30,799
but also due to these the aging structures of populations worldwide, which I mentioned on the previous slide.

82
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:38,930
And that's happening quite rapidly. And here in 2022, we're a few years beyond this point where we actually see a crossing over of these two curves.

83
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,100
So globally, there are more people aged 65 and over than there are under age five.

84
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,220
And this difference is only going to grow in the coming decades.

85
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:54,520
So I think I've convinced you that global population aging is really changing the demographics of low and middle income countries.

86
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:02,410
And we really need to think about what that means in terms of people's health in these regions and how the kind of social

87
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:10,870
and economic experiences that they've had across their life causes are kind of shaping their health in later life.

88
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:16,329
And I'm talking with respect to chronic disease here, I think one thing that's really important that I'm not going to touch on so much in

89
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,690
this lecture is the intersection of infectious and chronic disease and how many

90
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:24,700
people living in low and middle income countries are going to be aging in contexts

91
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,479
where there is a high double burden of both infectious and chronic diseases.

92
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,060
And we we are just simply not really equipped to deal with that, and we need strategies to deal with that.

93
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,750
But that's a topic for another lecture. And if anyone wants to take it on for further course paper, I think it's really, really interesting.

94
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:46,600
And one thing that I want to point here is that much of the epidemiologic and public

95
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,550
health evidence that we have on chronic diseases comes from high income countries.

96
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:57,340
So if you go to the literature and you want to learn about social risk factors for dementia, by and large,

97
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:03,880
you are going to be reading data from studies that have been conducted in the United States and Western Europe, in the UK, places like that.

98
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,899
There is really a dearth of evidence on social factors and how they influence

99
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,410
dementia risk among populations living in low and middle income settings.

100
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:17,200
And that's really important because this large share of the global dementia burden is going to

101
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,870
happen in these settings that are completely underrepresented in the epidemiological evidence base.

102
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:28,149
So we really need kind of life course studies and epidemiologic research happening that represent

103
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:33,549
populations who are going to be bearing the heaviest burden of these chronic diseases in later life.

104
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,080
And I think that commentary that was assigned in the readings for today really illustrates that point.

105
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:45,379
Yeah. And the other important thing is like we can actually learn more from a scientific perspective about the causes

106
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:51,410
of disease by studying social contextual exposures that either don't exist or are rare in high income countries.

107
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:58,200
And again, from a scientific perspective, in addition to issues of equity and representation,

108
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:06,220
this can help us actually to improve causal inference in the scientific literature by triangulating findings across diverse populations.

109
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,400
So if you want to be strategic, in addition to the equity argument,

110
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:17,680
you can also make a really strong scientific argument for improving the global representation in the epidemiologic evidence based.

111
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:28,460
So that's kind of the overall background. And now I want to get a little bit more specific in this talk and talk about Agincourt,

112
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:36,520
which is a region in rural South Africa where I've been working for a number of years, and this is a picture of Agincourt.

113
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,480
It is a rural, semi-arid region in northeast of Africa.

114
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:51,200
I'll show you a map in a second. It is a subdistrict which in South Africa is you can think of as equivalent to a county in the United States.

115
00:11:52,070 --> 00:12:00,470
It's a rural area. As I said, it consists of 31 villages that can be in an area of about 450 kilometers squared,

116
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:10,730
where there are about 222,000 household households that include about 110,000 people on a map.

117
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:15,769
Agincourt is up here in the northeast of South Africa, near the Mozambique border.

118
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:21,800
It's an informal Lunga province. And actually I'm going to say this now rather than going ahead,

119
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:28,969
Agincourt is a region of it's a former homeland region from the apartheid era in South Africa.

120
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:37,700
And what that means is that people who belonged to the ongoing ethnic group were forcibly relocated to and forced

121
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:45,290
to remain in this area due to policies of racial residential segregation during apartheid in South Africa.

122
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,410
So for those who don't know, apartheid was a very large.

123
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,960
I don't even know the right word. The country of South Africa, it was integral to the country of South Africa.

124
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:05,850
It was a large set of policies that enforced racial segregation in all aspects of life, from residents to education, to work to leisure, to travel.

125
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:13,190
It was it was everything. And that ended in 1994 with the first Democratic election where Nelson Mandela was elected.

126
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,040
You can read more about the history elsewhere.

127
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:26,389
But suffice to say, as the background to this work, Agincourt is a former region of forest residential segregation during apartheid.

128
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,890
And what that means is that everyone who lives there, not everyone,

129
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:35,000
but by and large the population who lives there belongs to the ongoing ethnic group.

130
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:43,340
They are black South Africans and there are still it is still like an economic it's still a low income area.

131
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,760
There's still a lot of economic deprivation. Unemployment is really high.

132
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,890
The area is still lacking a lot of basic services, such as tarred roads and piped water.

133
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:56,960
So while the socioeconomic conditions have improved greatly since the end of apartheid,

134
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:01,250
there's still a large amount of economic inequality in the area.

135
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:09,430
Any questions at this point? Okay.

136
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:16,260
I'll move on. And this is just a closer map of the Agincourt area.

137
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:20,270
So there are all the different villages are kind of in these different colors.

138
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:27,420
So you can see them sort of spread around and there are hospitals and health clinics kind of spread throughout the villages.

139
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:40,149
And if you're curious about these names such as Agincourt itself or things like Newington, Croquet Lawn, Kildare, Somerset, they sounds very British.

140
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:46,110
It's just a, it's a product of colonization, but. Yeah.

141
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,620
So I kind of skipped ahead and told you about apartheid.

142
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:56,910
Yeah. And one thing that's really important is the Bantu Education Act of 1953, which segregated schools and the curriculum of schools.

143
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:05,850
And this was expressly done to deny good quality education to black South Africans and keep them working in low paying manual labor.

144
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,850
That's really important for understanding dementia risk in this region,

145
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:16,500
because schooling and education is one of the strongest known modifiable protective factors against dementia.

146
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,130
And this population received very poor education.

147
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,410
That's a subject of a different talk.

148
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:30,929
So one of the overarching questions of my research program and that of my collaborators is how have social contextual

149
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:38,310
factors influenced by apartheid and its legacy affected the cognitive health of the older population living in this region?

150
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:45,450
And one thing that's important to note, again, is that individual level risk factors such as education,

151
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,560
such as some of these kind of adverse events in childhood that I mentioned earlier,

152
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:54,060
things like social engagement, transportation, even like kind of lifestyle, behavioral factors,

153
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:58,110
they are really shaped by broader social, cultural, economic and political environment.

154
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:01,740
And it's important to keep that in mind when we are designing research studies.

155
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:12,330
So one question that I asked along with my collaborators in this population is what is the role of childhood adversity in cognitive aging outcomes?

156
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:20,270
So what do I mean when I say childhood adversity? Some of you may have heard of aces or adverse childhood experiences.

157
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:26,730
There's a large amount of literature and kind of theoretical body of work on Aces and how they affect health.

158
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,360
Most of this work has been conducted in the United States.

159
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:35,130
Those are really famous study coming out of the Kaiser Health Insurance Program in California,

160
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:43,140
where they gave a survey to Kaiser members about their experiences of aces as children and then health outcomes in later life.

161
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:48,750
And that study was sort of foundational in kind of setting up this theoretical framework about how aces affect health.

162
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:55,410
But Aces and Aces are things like experiencing physical or sexual abuse as a child,

163
00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:04,350
experiencing extreme socioeconomic deprivation, having parents who drink or use drugs, witnessing violence, things like that.

164
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,550
So really severe kind of traumatic events that could happen in childhood.

165
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,860
And this figure that I show on the right hand side of the slide is the theoretical

166
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:19,349
model of how Aces influence health and well-being across the lifespan.

167
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:24,090
And again, this is influenced by evidence from high income countries.

168
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,660
But essentially, the the idea is that experiencing traumatic events in childhood disrupts neurodevelopment,

169
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:36,240
and this leads to social, emotional and cognitive impairment through disrupted development.

170
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:44,820
It kind of influences people to adopt health risk behaviors such as smoking or drinking or drug use, for example,

171
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:53,010
in order to cope psychologically with the experiences that they have gone through and also as a result of impaired development,

172
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,820
has a lot to lead to disability, social problems and several health outcomes and then early death.

173
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,999
But this model has not been tested in low and middle income settings.

174
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,649
And we almost not we know almost nothing about how traumatic events experienced by populations in low and middle income settings affect health,

175
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:17,700
and specifically cognitive health, which is quite relevant given that we think that aces disrupt neurodevelopment.

176
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,839
So the goal of the study that I'm going to present right now was to estimate the associations between

177
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:30,760
adverse childhood experiences and later life cognitive function among older adults in rural South Africa.

178
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,590
Data for this study came from a cohort called Healthy, which stands for Health and Aging in Africa.

179
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,590
A longitudinal study of an in-depth community in South Africa.

180
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,570
Halsey is harmonized with the U.S. Health and Retirement Study.

181
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:52,610
Some of you may have heard of the US Health Retirement Study. It's actually run out of here at the University of Michigan.

182
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,510
From the Institute for Social Research. And it involves a network of international partners,

183
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:05,570
studies of aging that all have harmonized designs to facilitate cross-national comparisons of the aging experience.

184
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:11,830
So Halsey is the first and only HRC international partner study on the African continent.

185
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:18,650
It is a population based cohort of just over 5000 black men and women who are aged 40 plus.

186
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:24,430
Recruitment. We typically don't think of 40 as like old or later life.

187
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:33,159
But the idea here is that chronological aging might not occur in the same way in this context as it does in the United States.

188
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:39,790
And we want to kind of recruit people from this age going forward to capture trajectories of aging as people get older,

189
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:48,730
especially with life expectancy. And that's a point I want to make, that life expectancy in this region is in the low sixties for both men and women.

190
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:53,890
So a study of aging necessarily needs to recruit people quite a bit younger than that.

191
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:58,770
There's a question, Christian. Hello.

192
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:05,070
Hi. How long? How far along is this money to the study?

193
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:14,740
So there are currently three waves of data. The baseline interviews happened in 2015, so that was seven years ago.

194
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:21,660
Wave two happened in 2018 and 2019 and Wave three was just collected in 2021.

195
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:27,569
So the the wave one and two data are publicly available online and I can send the

196
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,780
link like you can literally go download the data right now and do stuff with it.

197
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,000
The Wave three data have not been publicly shared.

198
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,270
I think the healthy team is still cleaning the data in preparation for release,

199
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:43,200
but I think they will be released sometime soon, which is really exciting.

200
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:51,180
So there should be there will be about, I guess, six years of longitudinal data once the wave three data are released.

201
00:20:53,220 --> 00:21:01,860
Well, yeah. So Halsey is conducted by the MRC vets Rural Public Health and Health Transitions

202
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,790
Research Unit at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg,

203
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,060
as well as Harvard University.

204
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:17,010
It's a study that I've been working with since its inception when it started, and so it's exciting to see it kind of come along this far.

205
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,720
And again, it has the sampling cream of 31 villages in the Agincourt area.

206
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:27,250
I'm not going to get too in-depth about the study design, but I'm happy to talk about it later.

207
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,970
Like more details about the design aside from these key points, if anyone has any questions or wants to talk further.

208
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:40,530
So the interviews that were conducted were done by trained local field workers.

209
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:45,060
There was a relatively high response rate, about 86% to the baseline survey.

210
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:51,179
And the baseline survey interview covered topics including sociodemographic factors, family structure,

211
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,840
health behaviors, health conditions and physical and cognitive function assessments.

212
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:02,220
An additional kind of layer of data collection that happened that allows us to study adverse childhood events.

213
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:12,059
Was that just about 2500 respondents who were aged 40 to 79 were randomly sampled to complete additional laboratory assessments,

214
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:16,530
and these people completed questions about the adverse childhood experiences.

215
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:22,140
So so what I'm going to talk about today is a subsample of policy, not the full cohort.

216
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:29,430
And these were the four questions that were asked about adverse childhood experiences.

217
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:36,860
So these were just simple yes, no questions that people were asked in this in-depth laboratory interview that a subsample completed.

218
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:44,180
These were questions including having either parent be unemployed for six months or more, having parents who fought or argued often,

219
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:51,320
having parents who drank excessively, used drugs or had mental health problems, and then experiencing physical abuse from parents.

220
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,600
And childhood was defined during the interview as being aged 16 or younger.

221
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:02,510
And as you can see, these are the percentages of the sample who said yes to each question.

222
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:09,140
They're actually quite high, like 35%. More than one in three people saying they experienced physical abuse from their parents.

223
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,850
One in four having parents who fodder argued often or drank excessively,

224
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:19,520
used drugs or had mental health problems and the 15% with unknown parental unemployment.

225
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:27,020
And these questions were adapted from a life history manual that was implemented in the English Longitudinal Study of Aging.

226
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,820
So that's where these questions came from.

227
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:41,770
Cognitive function was assessed using a tablet like a microsoft surface tablet using a measure called the Oxford Cognitive Screen.

228
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:46,329
The Oxford cognitive screen was developed by neuropsychologists,

229
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:51,159
and it was specifically designed for low income and low education settings by

230
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,330
minimizing the literacy and numeracy skills that are required in cognitive testing.

231
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,479
I could give a whole separate lecture about how we measure cognitive function and

232
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,100
how we measure cognitive function in culturally and educationally appropriate ways.

233
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:11,069
There is a very long history of cognitive testing in general,

234
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:16,740
like through like standardized educational testing through the U.S. military that has

235
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:24,149
been used in very racist ways because there is there has been norming that has occurred,

236
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:30,750
that is race specific. And there is a lot of cultural connotations and assumptions and different types of cognitive

237
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:36,630
tests that have been used historically that are biased against certain population groups.

238
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,040
That is something we are very aware of in the world of dementia research,

239
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,850
and it's something that we minimize, especially when we are doing global dementia research.

240
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,480
And so that's that's a topic for a whole other day.

241
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:57,480
But I will say this is something that we are very thoughtful of when we design screening tools to assess cognitive health in dementia,

242
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,160
and especially because educational attainment is so low.

243
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:08,550
In the study sample, about 42% of people in the hall see self-report that they're not able to read or write.

244
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:14,910
We absolutely want to minimize the literacy and numeracy skills that are required to assess cognition.

245
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:23,120
So, for example, in the United States, a common cognitive screening test is asking someone to count backwards from 100 in increments of seven.

246
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:27,690
You obviously can't do that if you're not numerate or, for example,

247
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:34,880
ask giving people kind of like a piece of paper or a screen and you have letters and numbers kind of randomly jumbled around.

248
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:43,350
Then you ask people to connect ABC one, two, three, and then A one, B two, etc. That also obviously does not work if you are not literature numerate.

249
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:49,049
And then of course that can be cultural. There can be cultural assumptions and tests as well.

250
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:54,840
Really straightforward example is there is again another common cognitive test that's used in the

251
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,300
United States where people are shown a picture of a cactus and asked to identify it as a cactus.

252
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:06,959
That doesn't work in Hulsey because cactus or cacti are not indigenous to the region.

253
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,910
So people just haven't seen the type of cactus that we might be used to seeing in the United States.

254
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,980
So just so things like that are really, really important to design just culturally and educationally appropriate cognitive testing for.

255
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,259
So this Oxford cognitive screen assesses memory, language,

256
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:27,710
executive function and visual spatial ability requiring minimal literacy and numeracy skills.

257
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,790
And I'll show you some examples now.

258
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:39,600
So the test that I just described as one of the examples connecting like A, B, C, D, one, two, three, four, rather than that test.

259
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:47,790
And this is a test of executive functioning. We use circles and squares and this is an example of the the tablet here.

260
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:52,679
So the instructions in the Shannon language are here at the top that the interviewer would read out.

261
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:59,580
And then the participant in the study would take the stylus on the tablet and connect the squares and the circles.

262
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:06,640
Any questions at this point? Okay.

263
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,440
Here's another one. This is kind of constructional practice and rule finding.

264
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,709
So the so for the constructional practices on the left,

265
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:20,260
the person would be asked to copy the diagram that's shown here with the kind of triangle and arrow,

266
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:24,429
and then the rule finding the red dot jumps around and then the person is meant

267
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:28,750
to kind of give the pattern of the dot as it moves around after it stops moving.

268
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,590
And here is a study participant completing the task using the tablet.

269
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,920
And this photograph was taken with permission and shared with permission.

270
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:46,169
So methods, statistical analysis. So if you're not interested in statistics, don't worry.

271
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,569
If you don't get what simple to come up on the slides.

272
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:56,760
But if you're into stats, this was a really fun modeling method that we implemented for this paper and I'm happy to talk about it further.

273
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:04,589
So we use what's called a multiple indicator, multiple cause model to estimate direct effects of the four different pieces that I told

274
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:09,060
you about on the four different cognitive domains that were assessed in this tablet.

275
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:14,040
And we adjusted for age, sex, country of birth and father's occupation during childhood.

276
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:21,000
And the reason for this very minimal set of model covariates is because the exposure variable,

277
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,270
the four cases, those are things that happened very early in life.

278
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:30,209
And we wanted to make sure to not adjust for things that might be on the causal pathway between aces and cognition.

279
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,590
So we didn't adjust for things like education or adulthood, occupation or things like that,

280
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:38,580
because those could be affected by aces and then affect cognition.

281
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,860
And in turn, so we wanted to adjust for things that would precede the experience of Aces.

282
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:51,389
So all very early life kind of demographic factors went into the models and this is what the model looked like.

283
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:56,190
So here's a visual schematic and again, if it doesn't make sense to you, don't worry about it.

284
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:04,620
But if you want to know. So the multiple indicator, multiple cause model is a simultaneous estimation of both a structural model,

285
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,079
which is just a straightforward linear regression,

286
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:14,850
which you should all be familiar with, and then a measurement model, which is a factor model that generates a latent variable.

287
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:22,350
So let's start with the measurement model. So we have here in the middle the latent cognitive function domain.

288
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,489
And that's because we think that we do a factor analysis.

289
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:34,830
So when you do a fact, you do a factor analysis to estimate unmeasured or latent variables that are where we

290
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:39,660
have what we think are indicators of the true construct that we are trying to measure.

291
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:45,059
So you'll see that there are arrows going from this latent cognitive function domain into

292
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:50,549
each of the different cognitive tests with betas indicating coefficients on those arrows.

293
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:56,850
Right? So all of those cognitive tests that I showed you previously, the rule finding the constructional practice,

294
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,630
the circles and squares, each of those is an individual cognitive test item.

295
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:06,179
And together we think all scores on all of those cognitive test items come together to represent this

296
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:10,139
thing called cognitive function that we have inside of our heads that we can't measure directly,

297
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,140
but we get at through individual cognitive tests. Right?

298
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:21,150
So we think that people's scores on these individual cognitive tests reflect their underlying latent cognitive function,

299
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:26,670
and that is represented by the arrows going from latent cognitive function into each cognitive test.

300
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,800
So this is just a factor analysis.

301
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:36,390
And what it essentially does is it takes the Common Core variation across all of these cognitive tests to generate this leading variable,

302
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:43,830
which has a mean of zero and a certain deviation of one. And these betas are they are regression coefficients, but they are factor loadings.

303
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:50,670
We refer to them as factor loadings in factor analysis that essentially tells you kind of the strength

304
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:55,170
of association between the cognitive test indicator and the legion cognitive function domain.

305
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,830
So the stronger a factor loading, the more that individual cognitive,

306
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:04,740
the more influence that an individual test has on the value of the Legion cognitive function variable.

307
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:11,340
So we estimate this latent cognitive function variable through factor analysis and

308
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:17,219
then we simultaneously use it as an outcome in a standard linear regression model,

309
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:23,430
which is the structural model. So we have the four adverse childhood experiences here, those are our four X variables,

310
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:30,210
and then we have arrows going from those four aces into the latent cognitive function domain.

311
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:35,790
We adjust for the covariates, which are the four confounders that I told you about on the previous slide.

312
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:41,010
And then we get the regression coefficients for the association between each of

313
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,370
these adverse childhood experiences and the latent cognitive function domain.

314
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,460
We do this four times over for each of the four cognitive function domains that I mentioned.

315
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,650
All good. Yeah.

316
00:31:54,660 --> 00:32:07,260
Christian. And I was just curious with the Epsilon thing to the right of the there's also the cognitive tests.

317
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,040
Oh, those are just the error terms. Oh, okay.

318
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:16,950
So the idea is that like the cognitive tests recovery with each other.

319
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:22,380
Right. Like my score on a memory test is probably going to correlate with my score on like an attention test,

320
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,280
which is also going to correlate with my score on like a processing speed test.

321
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:34,620
Right. But and I'll use that Common Core variation across the items to generate the latent cognitive variable,

322
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:42,150
but like some degree of like variance in my score on a test or some degree of like the overall variance,

323
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:47,100
sorry in the sample on the score in the cognitive test is going to be influenced by random error.

324
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,150
And that's what the Epsilon are. Mm hmm. Yeah, that's a good question.

325
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,309
Okay. So boring stuff. Analytic sample.

326
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:03,580
So 2498 people answered,

327
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:09,219
took part in the laboratory assessment and answered questions about the ACS and of those about 85%

328
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:15,280
consented to and took part in this box plus cognitive screening assessment and did the cognitive items.

329
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:26,740
And of these I included 1871 in the analysis 243 were excluded because there they reported that their parents died before the age of 16,

330
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:32,400
so they didn't have any data on ACS. And one piece of feedback that I've gotten in the past was like,

331
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:38,709
Look and see whether having a parent die before age 16 itself is an ace and how that relates to cognition.

332
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:42,940
I think that's a future step for future analysis, but it's just not included here.

333
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:51,160
So these were all people whose parents were alive before age 16, since the ACS related primarily to parental behavior.

334
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,790
So in the study sample, the mean age was 59 years.

335
00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:03,560
59% of the sample were female. Kind of reflecting that a larger share of the older population are women as compared to men.

336
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,839
71% were born in South Africa. 29% were born in Mozambique.

337
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:13,220
That's just a piece of kind of context, social context of the study population.

338
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:17,599
If you recall, the study region is very close to the border with Mozambique.

339
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:23,660
And it is it is actually the same ethnic group that lives in northeast South Africa, as well as southern Mozambique.

340
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:29,030
And there's a large share of people living in the north east South Africa who originally

341
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:35,390
came as refugees from a civil war in Mozambique in the late 1970s and 1980s.

342
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,610
About 40% said that they could not read or write.

343
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:42,879
43% of the sample had no formal education.

344
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:51,310
Only 8% had secondary education or more, and almost one quarter were HIV positive, according to dried blood spot testing.

345
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:57,730
So these are the results. So this is the measurement model of the cognitive domains.

346
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:05,730
So this is kind of reproduced from that previous figure that I showed you with the specific cognitive test items filled in in the rectangles.

347
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:11,230
And like I said, I've reproduced this four times for each of the four cognitive domains that we studied.

348
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:15,120
So these were executive function, language, visuospatial, ability and memory.

349
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,960
The model effect statistics are shown here. I'm not going to read them out.

350
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:24,270
The kind of take on point is that this factor model was of a good fit to the data.

351
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:31,440
And if you're interested in language specific cognitive tests mapped on to which domains they are shown here.

352
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:42,460
And this figure shows the unadjusted, mean, latent cognitive domain factor scores according to the different adverse childhood experiences.

353
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:46,870
So we have executive function on the left in dark blue language and this kind

354
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:52,060
of medium blue visuospatial ability in the bright teal and memory in green.

355
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,020
Again, don't forget, the scores are standardized to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one in the whole population.

356
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:06,610
And kind of what we're looking at or looking for here are differences in the mean scores between people who said no and people who said yes.

357
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:10,510
So looking really quickly at parental unemployment, they're very similar.

358
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:14,739
I don't show the 95% confidence intervals because it gets messy,

359
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:21,220
but none of these are statistically significantly different until we get to parents drug use drugs or had mental health problems.

360
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,960
So parents have argued often, not really many differences going on here.

361
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:33,160
When we look at parent having a parent who drank, used drugs or had mental health problems, we see that in the domain of memory.

362
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:38,620
People who responded, yes, had much lower memory scores, almost a 10th of a standard deviation.

363
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,890
And then moving on to the model results. So these are the estimates from that mimic model.

364
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:53,520
So just as a quick refresher, what I'm doing here is I'm simultaneously estimating the Legion scores in the domains of executive function,

365
00:36:54,150 --> 00:37:01,559
language, visuospatial, ability and memory, and then simultaneously kind of overlaying those linear regression models to get estimates

366
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:07,710
for the mean difference in scores in each cognitive domain according to each oops.

367
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,670
Each of the four adverse childhood experiences.

368
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,410
The takeaway point from this slide is that the effect estimates were generally null.

369
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:24,720
You can see that by these really, really small coefficients that often go to several decimal places or confidence intervals across the null.

370
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,399
But there was only one exception.

371
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:34,080
And this was that the mean memory scores were 0.067 standard deviations lower on average for people who reported that their parents drank excessively,

372
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:43,059
took drugs or had mental health problems. So the conclusion of the study and if you read the paper was basically that the results were null,

373
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:51,910
except for it seems that experiencing this specific ace early in life might be associated with memory aging, but we need to do some future research.

374
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:59,440
And we also did a lot of sensitivity analysis because I did not really and my collaborators did not really believe these findings.

375
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,790
And we wanted to do some more in-depth analysis to make sure that we were confident that

376
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:09,759
this was a true null result and not due to some kind of measurement error or bias.

377
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,320
And I'll get into those in a second. But first, I just want to make sure there's no questions.

378
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:26,930
Okay. Great. So one thing that I haven't talked about is this idea of differential aid and functioning.

379
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:31,880
I'm not going to go into different differential item functioning in a ton of detail.

380
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:41,150
But basically the idea is that because like I showed you earlier, about 40% of the sample had no formal education and were not literate.

381
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:46,400
There was concern that maybe people who were not literate or who sorry,

382
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:52,910
young people who are not literate were kind of performing differently on the cognitive test

383
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,830
screener because of their literacy and not because of any kind of real cognitive impairment.

384
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:02,240
So if you have literacy skills, the idea being if you have literacy skills,

385
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:07,390
you might perform better on cognitive tests just because of how your brain functions.

386
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,410
You might be able to look and perceive items on the test differently.

387
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:17,899
If the interviewer is reading off instructions, off a sheet of paper, maybe in addition to hearing the interviewer,

388
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,500
you can see what they're reading as well and kind of get stimuli in that way.

389
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,940
So you just want to make sure that there was no kind of residual bias in how

390
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:31,070
the cognitive screening tool was working according to education and literacy.

391
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:36,110
We did. And there are formal analysis you can do to check that, which I'm not going to get into here.

392
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:42,410
But we did find that there was negligible residual differential item functioning by education or literacy.

393
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:49,070
The take home point being that we were confident that differences in education and literacy across

394
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:54,440
our study population were not biasing the results that we got on the cognitive screening test.

395
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:01,430
Another issue was missing data, so between one and 7% of respondents were missing data on the adverse childhood experiences.

396
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:06,620
And hopefully we've all learned in your stats classes that kind of a missing data rate of 5%

397
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:11,929
is kind of the rule of thumb for whether or not you can safely ignore it in terms of like,

398
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:15,560
is it going to bias your results of more than 5% of data are missing?

399
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:20,060
Then we start to get a bit concerned that it might start to bias our findings.

400
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:26,630
We did a multiple imputation to fill in missing values of adverse childhood experiences,

401
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:33,770
and the results were actually similar to the complete case analysis, except that effect estimate for memory nearly doubled in size.

402
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:38,120
So we think that estimate that I showed you on the previous slide, if anything,

403
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:44,450
is probably an underestimate of the impact of having a parent who drank, used drugs or had mental health problems on memory, aging.

404
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:52,399
A big one here and maybe some of you have already thought about this is what if the ACS were underreported?

405
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,720
Like, what if people just didn't want to talk about it or tell us when these things happened?

406
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:02,280
Right. Like these were sensitive topics, you know, experiencing abuse from a parent know,

407
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:09,860
behavior of parents and people might not have wished to disclose them. And these things might also be subjective to reconstructive memory.

408
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:15,919
So like when we're asking people who are aged 40 and over whether these things happened to them as a kid and these are

409
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:22,809
memories that you like you might suppress or bury or reconstruct for yourself when something really traumatic has happened.

410
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:26,150
And that's absolutely that could absolutely happen.

411
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:32,390
And we have no way of empirically knowing whether that is the case or not.

412
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:37,520
And one thing I'll say is that a kind of indication here is that 15% of people

413
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:42,290
said they had a parent who was employed or unemployed for six months or more.

414
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:47,689
And unemployment rates and Agincourt, which we can actually track, are much, much higher than 15%.

415
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:52,730
So we think at least kind of the long term unemployment statistic is under-reported.

416
00:41:53,600 --> 00:42:00,740
Another layer of complication here is that because our outcome is cognitive health status,

417
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:06,770
it's possible that the degree of underreporting could differ according to cognitive health status.

418
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:12,320
So if you have learned, I'm not sure you're probably not there yet in your classes,

419
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:20,719
but you will get there in learning about misclassification, error and misclassification bias.

420
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:26,360
I think in our coursework at least if you take appendix one, we refer to it as information bias.

421
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:32,809
So if a person gets misclassified in your study according to their exposure status,

422
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:36,650
like you say that they were unexposed when in truth they were exposed.

423
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:44,270
If that misclassification is differential according to the outcome, then we have a problem with respect to bias.

424
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,499
So for example,

425
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:54,800
if people with poor cognitive health are disproportionately more likely to not tell us when it is to not disclose an X when in fact it had happened,

426
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,480
that can really distort or affect estimates that come out of our regression modeling.

427
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:04,320
And we can't really ever know the answer to this.

428
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:11,400
Like, we can't go back and collect the data again. There's no way of kind of getting some kind of gold standard objective truth.

429
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:15,880
We can only take what people tell us at face value right in the study interviews,

430
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:22,360
but we can do some sensitivity analysis where we can simulate what the results would have been under different,

431
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:29,440
plausible scenarios of different ways in which people might underreport their experiences of aces.

432
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:35,590
So we did a simulation study that examined different degrees of exposure misclassification.

433
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:40,629
By reproducing the analysis that I just told you about under a range of different

434
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:45,040
plausible sensitivity and specificity values for the four ACE measures.

435
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:50,840
So when we think about exposure, misclassification, it's really an issue of sensitivity and specificity.

436
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:55,420
So the survey question about says, like, did your parents ever abuse you?

437
00:43:55,450 --> 00:44:01,860
Yes. No, that question has a certain sensitivity and specificity for the truth.

438
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,740
Like there might be some people who say yes when in truth it didn't happen.

439
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:17,410
And that would be an issue of sensitivity, of low sensitivity, or it might be an issue of specificity where someone says no, but it really did happen.

440
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:21,370
I think I've got those correct that always get sensitivity and specificity backwards.

441
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:25,299
But you know what I mean? And we assume two different scenarios.

442
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:32,590
One, where the misclassification was non differential, and two, where the misclassification was differential according to cognitive function.

443
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:40,000
And so we kind of I assumed there was a very, very high sensitivity so that when someone said yes and A's had happened to them,

444
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,580
I assumed that was true because there's little incentive to tell an interviewer

445
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:49,360
in a research study that it happened to you if it really didn't happen.

446
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:56,020
So we assumed high sensitivity. I think it was something like 90 or 95%, but then varied the specificity.

447
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:02,920
So very so in a low specificity situation, someone might say no when in truth it did happen to them.

448
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:11,290
And then we varied the levels of specificity according to the cognitive function in order to make the misclassification differential.

449
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:17,680
And what this simulation study found was that non differential misclassification of the cases did not affect the findings.

450
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:25,750
So what that means is that even if ACS were underreported and if that underreporting is not differential according to cognitive status,

451
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,500
it doesn't really matter.

452
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:32,320
We still get the same results because everyone is underreporting in the same way, and that's not going to affect our regression estimates.

453
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,570
But if the misclassification of ACS is differential according to cognitive status.

454
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:42,220
And so what I think I did here was I made the sensitivity or the specificity much lower

455
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,240
among people who are cognitively impaired than among people who are cognitively healthy.

456
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:50,230
This could actually result in substantially underestimated effect estimates.

457
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:59,110
So if the scenario where people who have cognitive impairment are disproportionately or differentially not reporting A's is only happened to them.

458
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:06,400
This can result in a severe underestimate of the true of active cases on cognitive health in later life.

459
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:16,400
I know this is very in the weeds in terms of methods and probably more so than other lectures that you're going to get and have gotten in this class.

460
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:23,900
So I hope that was interesting. And if you're interested in these kinds of methods or simulation analysis, come talk to me later.

461
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:27,050
I'm always, like excited and happy to talk about this kind of stuff.

462
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:34,500
Any questions before I move on? We're almost done. We're good.

463
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:37,490
Okay. We'll keep moving through. So there are.

464
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:44,690
So when I kind of when we finished all these analysis and it came time to kind of kind of interpret the final results.

465
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:50,989
I, I don't know. I think they're I leave it open to multiple different explanations because I

466
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:54,229
don't think we have one definitive answer based on the results of this study.

467
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:57,140
And I think that's actually what makes it a really interesting piece of science.

468
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:03,290
One, it could be that there really is a true knowledge association between childhood adversity and later life cognition.

469
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:04,729
And if this is true,

470
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:11,270
we have to assume that any effects of aces on cognitive function in childhood don't last through to later life in this population.

471
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:18,860
And I think we have relatively robust literature that shows that experiencing trauma in early life is not good for cognitive health and development.

472
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:25,160
So if that is true, then for some reason in this population it doesn't last until later life.

473
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:30,830
So I'm not sure I feel skeptical about that. Issues of heterogenous exposures.

474
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:38,450
So maybe these aces that we measure don't mean the same thing in this context, in this population as they might in high income countries.

475
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:45,530
So and that could relate to kind of like people's interpretation of what constitutes physical abuse, for example,

476
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:53,150
or like what constitutes like parents who fought often and like, are those things bad or important?

477
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,620
I, I really don't know. It's kind of it's kind of hard to tell.

478
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:05,630
You also have to remember that the people in the study population, when they were children, they were growing up in apartheid and apartheid.

479
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:12,080
Violence was a daily part of life during apartheid, not just within the family or the household,

480
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:16,129
but political violence, violence on the street, violence from police.

481
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:24,770
And so maybe these types of measures or these types of violence that we're asking about were relatively not as bad.

482
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,660
Of course they are bad, but you know what I mean?

483
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:32,840
Not as bad as the types of state violence and police violence that were happening during the time of apartheid.

484
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:41,209
And so I think we need to think about them and what they might mean kind of in this kind of historical context of this study population.

485
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:48,710
We can't get at it empirically, but we can use kind of this kind of sociological information to help us interpret our results and try to explain them.

486
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:52,850
Another one is measurement error. So these were really crude binary.

487
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:56,450
Yes, no measures of really complex experiences and phenomena.

488
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:01,820
We had no information about the timing, the duration, like how did it happen once?

489
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:05,000
Did it happen for years? Like how often did it happen?

490
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,590
How severe was it? What were the psychological effects at the time? We don't have any of that information,

491
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:16,640
and that often happens in kind of these large cohort studies where there's a huge breadth of interview measures,

492
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:22,850
but that's at the cost of like depth on any one thing such as these cases, unfortunately.

493
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:31,470
Another issue is selective survival that could be patterned according to both experiences of childhood adversity and cognitive function,

494
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:36,810
which is plausible because this is a high mortality setting and there are things that kind of shape

495
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:42,870
survival to the time in which people either make it into the study or they don't because they've died.

496
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:50,160
And the people who died that we don't see as part of the study might have disproportionately experienced adversity and had poor cognitive health.

497
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:57,090
If you've seen a DAG in any of your lectures so far, then this will make sense if you haven't seen a DAG.

498
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:02,490
It's going to be the first of many that you're going to see throughout your two years here.

499
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:08,549
A dag is a directed acyclic graph or a basically a causal diagram where you write down all

500
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:13,020
the things you're trying to study and then you draw the arrows that you think links them. That's basically it.

501
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,340
But the idea here is that early life adversity is our exposure variable.

502
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:24,660
The dashed line of the question mark represents our research question, which is what is the effect of early adversity on cognitive decline?

503
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:30,930
After someone enters a research study. However, before the study happens,

504
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:39,300
early life adversity might have a negative effect on survival before your before it comes time to your study a new recruit for your study

505
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:47,520
and a person's rate of cognitive decline in later life before the time of your research study might also negatively impact survival.

506
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:55,290
And so we then have what's called a collider where we have survival to study

507
00:50:55,290 --> 00:51:00,689
entry being a necessary condition for someone to even get into your study,

508
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:06,750
to have early life adversity measured, and then subsequent cognitive decline after your study starts measured.

509
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:12,660
And if these two things both determine survival to study entry,

510
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:20,880
this opens up what we actually call a backdoor path between early life adversity and cognitive decline after the study entry,

511
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:26,280
which kind of flows through conditioning on survival and a regression model.

512
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:35,340
These kind of arrows and the way that different variables are linked using arrows is kind of like not shown in the regression model.

513
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:42,009
But since there is a path that is opened up between these two things and I need to give a more in-depth DAG lecture so that it makes sense.

514
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:47,919
If it doesn't make sense, just trust me that this is a backdoor path that in a regression model can spuriously

515
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,340
make early life adversity look like it's associated with cognitive decline,

516
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:55,749
even though it is not. And that is selection, bias and 30 seconds.

517
00:51:55,750 --> 00:52:00,700
You're going to learn about it in your other classes if you haven't already. So hopefully that's a useful introduction.

518
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:09,050
And that's it. So basically like what we ended up concluding was that, you know, in this study, based on what we observed in the data,

519
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:16,310
ACES were not associated with domain specific cognitive functioning among older adults in rural South Africa.

520
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,890
There are several plausible explanations for this finding.

521
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:24,560
I just told them all to you, and I think each of these deserves investigation in its own right.

522
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:30,020
We went we went over this idea of like underreporting of cases using simulated data.

523
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:37,250
And that was interesting. But I think we need to look into other explanations in more detail, possibly using other data.

524
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:44,030
And I think this study was important because it identifies several methodological considerations for attempting to conduct,

525
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:47,990
of course, social epidemiology in low and middle income settings.

526
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:57,190
And I'm glad you're going to be learning two tomorrow in 610, you got kind of a nice preview of future research directions is actually a lot.

527
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,790
So one, we need to have better data and better interview measures.

528
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,379
We knew contextually appropriate measures that try to get at things like adverse

529
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:10,010
childhood experiences and other relevant social factors in low income settings.

530
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,470
We need to get a handle on study bias,

531
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:20,570
so estimate the by the magnitude of bias that could be induced by selective survival in research on life course exposures in high mortality settings.

532
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:27,620
And most importantly, we need resources and collaboration and community participation for longitudinal research in low and

533
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:33,620
middle income settings to investigate social contextual causes of cognitive decline and dementia,

534
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,690
as well as other chronic and infectious diseases that older populations face.

535
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:44,570
And then find ways to improve cognitive health and healthy aging of diverse, older populations.

536
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:51,239
I have a research study that I'm currently working on where we're trying to do this.

537
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,810
This kind of builds off the work that I just showed you.

538
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:58,530
So we're using data from the healthy cohort that I just told you about to look at life course,

539
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:01,770
socioeconomic factors and cognitive decline and dementia risk.

540
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:07,530
And basically what we're doing is we're linking the Hulsey data to a regional census that occurred

541
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:15,479
in the same area to get information on kind of dynamic trajectories of household household assets,

542
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:19,140
employment and food insecurity in relation to cognition.

543
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:25,830
We're also linking Halsey to a randomized trial of conditional cash transfers in order

544
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:30,810
to see how cash transfers or increased income affect dementia for older adults.

545
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:38,370
And then we're also linking Hulsey to data from South African national social policy expansions that increase pension and family support grants.

546
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:44,310
And that aim is really exciting because it's actually using real world data on policy changes.

547
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:54,670
And I just want to acknowledge my collaborators who work on the Hulsey study and in Agincourt as well as sources of funding.

548
00:54:55,630 --> 00:55:05,310
And that's all that I have. These are discussion questions for you guys, because I think my understanding is you have discussion groups.

549
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,440
But before we do that, are there any questions?

550
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:20,980
I have two questions, if that's all right. Sorry. I don't know how to raise my hand with Zoom, but I think so.

551
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:26,810
I'll start with my first question, which was I'm just curious to know, why didn't you try to measure for verbal abuse or other types of aces?

552
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:34,639
Yeah, so I would have loved that. Unfortunately, when I came to analyze the data, it was already collected.

553
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:40,250
So this was a secondary data analysis and I think it's just really challenging when you're

554
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:43,700
doing secondary data analysis because you don't always get the data that you want.

555
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:51,260
And I don't know who made the final decisions of which questions were going to be in the study interview.

556
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:55,549
I know there's always kind of like competing priorities where you try to like measure as many

557
00:55:55,550 --> 00:56:00,020
things as you can in a short amount of time as you can and minimize participant burden.

558
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,430
And I'm sure those were all goals that they were trying to do.

559
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:09,170
I wish they had asked about things like verbal abuse or other forms of aces or trauma that people experience.

560
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:15,139
No, definitely. And then my second question and I might just be asking you to repeat what you've already said,

561
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:19,910
but particularly as it concerns the heterogeneous exposure, because this is something I was thinking about when reading the article,

562
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:25,729
is how do you account for perception differences about like what constitutes physical abuse or even what constitutes,

563
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:28,549
you know, having an adverse childhood experience?

564
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:36,230
Because certain things that we would consider in the U.S. as being really bad traumatic experiences is normalized for some international community.

565
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:42,410
So I suppose, particularly if you had the opportunity to redo that type of work or even in future work,

566
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:47,030
how would you try to account for those perception differences? Like would you break the questions down more to like,

567
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:52,970
I know ACES has a question of like if you were ever hit and it showed physical marks, like, did that happen?

568
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:56,510
So yeah, that is such a great question.

569
00:56:56,870 --> 00:57:00,290
I don't know, I, when I, when this paper was under review,

570
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:04,040
we got a similar question from reviewers and they wanted to know like is the

571
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:09,950
prevalence of ACS like similar in this study sample compared to in other studies?

572
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:15,620
And that's actually a really hard question to answer because it was the prevalence is like they ranged

573
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:24,199
from about 15 to 35% of people saying yes and they were similar to some samples but different to others.

574
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:33,530
And you're like, I don't know, like if 40% of people is that similar and if they are similar, can we conclude that the question means the same thing?

575
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:39,020
Is it just kind of like a random chance that the proportions are really similar?

576
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:48,800
So I think that's like one way to try. That is surprisingly not so informative in terms of like rephrasing the questions,

577
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:55,640
I think, yeah, questions like did they use a hard of physical mark up here?

578
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,260
That would be a good way to change that.

579
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:06,200
But I think you also want to get an idea of kind of like what was the like psychological impact or percent severity of it.

580
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:13,520
Right. And I think I honestly I think the best way to do that is to do some real in-depth qualitative research.

581
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:23,360
And I think it needs to be like beyond what epidemiologists are trained to do and maybe partner with like anthropologists or sociologists.

582
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:29,780
And this type of work I think would have we partnered with someone who is like from the local area and setting

583
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:35,690
and has someone standing of kind of like the culture and context and like what is appropriate to ask people,

584
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,709
you know, kind of the types of like ways to work, you know,

585
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:45,320
like kind of what to look out for and to sit down and have those depth like interviewing

586
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:51,200
to get a little bit more insight into people's like perceptions and experiences.

587
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:56,780
And then in a large scale survey, maybe reword the questions based on that in-depth interviewing.

588
00:58:57,230 --> 00:59:01,370
That's what I would do if I had like, no, and definitely that sounds amazing.

589
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:03,230
And actually, I'm sorry. One more quick question.

590
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:10,129
Since you particularly looking at it in the life force and particularly looking at it for later age groups,

591
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:13,010
do you think that it would be useful to measure a different time?

592
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:17,629
So just outside of childhood to if there might be different time points in the life course,

593
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:22,400
like young adulthood or something where something more traumatic could occur that could then influences outcomes in later life.

594
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:24,229
Yeah, that is so important.

595
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:32,450
So in that, in the study interview that I talked about, there actually were some questions about traumatic experiences during adulthood.

596
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,480
And I didn't look at them just because I was really focused.

597
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:40,520
I wanted to focus specifically on early life in this first paper and kind of take it a little

598
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:46,040
bit more like conceptually cohesive in that way before building out to the full life course.

599
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:55,069
But there were questions about about kind of violence and war and trauma and death and things like now seeing a death,

600
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:59,930
for example, in adulthood that were in that questionnaire.

601
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:03,350
And I don't think anyone has looked at them yet.

602
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:07,049
And that's the data are publicly available.

603
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:10,880
Like that's a really nice kind of analysis if someone wants to do it.

604
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:18,040
Another another interesting thing is looking at how it might be looking at like kind of resilience and like how things that happened

605
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:26,079
to you later on in your life might be might help with like later life resilience to negative things that occur in early life.

606
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:31,050
And I know some people are doing work on that in other populations, but I haven't seen too much in this population.

607
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:35,950
I think that's another important area. So thank you so much, Sara.

608
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:42,020
She. Oh, wait. I think there are two hands.

609
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:46,130
Okay. I'm not sure if I pronounce your name correctly. It's a Q.

610
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:51,349
Yeah, it's two. And I think, first of all, thank you so much for this presentation.

611
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:56,420
It's very helpful because it was hard for me to let some friends read the article and fully understand the study.

612
01:00:56,870 --> 01:01:00,740
And I think you kind of already answered this, but I was just wondering.

613
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:06,839
Well. I didn't see I didn't really understand if there were any kind of involvement of the local community.

614
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:11,190
Someone who was in the community who understands the cultural practices.

615
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:16,190
Yeah. Like in developing the interview measures, you mean? Yeah.

616
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:22,660
And then also related to that, I know that this was conducted like in their homes with like trained workers.

617
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:27,920
And I don't I don't really know the gender kind of like, dynamic in that population.

618
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:33,049
But I was just wondering if you take into account any kind of like gender dynamics

619
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:37,670
in putting interviewers into their homes and like asking them questions that make.

620
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:44,840
That is such a good question. So regarding involving the local community in the development of the interview.

621
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:50,000
So in Agincourt, one thing that I didn't talk about was the community engagement.

622
01:01:50,360 --> 01:02:00,870
So a healthy as a cohort is embedded in a larger regional census in the region that's been going on since the early 1990s.

623
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:07,220
That was part of kind of like a census to track population well-being with the end of apartheid.

624
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:12,350
And there has been really strong collaboration between the local public health unit that

625
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:18,380
runs the census and also runs the Hulsey study and tribal like local community leaders.

626
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:24,500
And they have regular kind of community engagement panels that have been going on for like a couple of decades.

627
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:31,429
And so there's like really like, I guess the overall context is that there's really strong integration between

628
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:35,000
the local community and the public health officers who are doing this work.

629
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:42,890
And then Hulsey is in collaboration with is like led by the Public Health Office in collaboration with her a team at Harvard University,

630
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:53,090
which is how I got involved the for Hulsey itself we tried to harmonize the interview questions and measures with other

631
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:59,860
longitudinal studies of aging around the world to like harmonize the data to help with kind of cross-national comparisons.

632
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:05,240
So there's a goal of both providing data that can be compared across countries,

633
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:08,720
but then also having things that are kind of locally specific and tailored.

634
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:15,920
So a lot of the interviews. So that's why those questions, what ACS were harmonized are came from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging.

635
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:23,180
But all of the interview materials are kind of translated and back translated and pilot

636
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:26,540
tested with people from the community just to make sure they're kind of appropriate.

637
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:33,500
Like, you know, people can understand them, that they make cultural sense before going out into the field.

638
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:39,050
So that's kind of a process of how the interviews are developed because you know what the relationship between

639
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:44,210
the local community and the public health office is regarding the interviewers that it's such a good question.

640
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:47,630
And now that you see that, I wish we had looked at that.

641
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:50,660
So the interviewers were both men and women.

642
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:58,010
All the interviewers are from that local community and they tend to be young people, like in their early twenties, both men and women.

643
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:01,549
And we didn't look at a gender mismatch.

644
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:13,850
And now that you see that, I wish that we had we've had a few other studies where we have actually adjusted for like in the data,

645
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:19,579
we have the idea of the interviewer, we don't have the gender of the interviewer recorded.

646
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:23,510
And I don't know, I'm sure it must be possible to get that information from somewhere.

647
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:28,610
But we do have a few other analysis where we have like statistically adjusted for interviewer

648
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:33,620
ID because we see systematic differences in people's response according to the interviewer.

649
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:40,220
A good example is there's a really in-depth social network module where we ask people to kind of list all of their friends.

650
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:48,169
And some interviewers were really in-depth and like went through the whole question, like the whole kind of like question sheet.

651
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:52,219
But you can imagine, like you get through the interviewer faster, they interview faster.

652
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:58,010
Someone is like, I have three friends and then stop and then move on as opposed to like probing them for like more information about their friends.

653
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:03,770
And some interviewers just did not like probe enough. So we got like systematically different responses.

654
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:09,110
So I guess what I'm saying is we don't know about gender mismatch and I think that's super important,

655
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:13,670
but I wouldn't be surprised if it was there because we have seen some systematic differences

656
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:17,990
in interviewing styles among interviewers that lead to differences in responses.

657
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:24,700
So thank you for that question. Q. Rachel.

658
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:33,510
Yeah. This is sort of like a follow up to Sarah's question, but you said like and the like full interview,

659
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:38,639
less like there were the the issues that you talked about. But then also like adverse events that happened later in life.

660
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:43,950
Were those like controlled for when you were just looking at the aces like somebody who experienced.

661
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:47,730
Okay. Oh, sorry. Yeah. No, they were going to just keep going.

662
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:56,010
I'm sorry. I did not like I understand. We did not control for them because we only wanted to put covariates in the

663
01:05:56,010 --> 01:06:01,889
model that were things that could be common causes of the aces and cognition.

664
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:07,200
So these would have to be things that came before the ACS like in time, right?

665
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:16,020
Like so ACS in adulthood could plausibly be like affected by whether or not you had an ace in childhood, right?

666
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:23,339
And then an ace in adult or I guess an adverse experience or traumatic experience in adulthood could then also affect cognition,

667
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:28,020
which would mean it would lie on the causal pathway between ACS and cognition.

668
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:30,299
And generally when you're doing statistical modeling,

669
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:35,070
you don't want to put variables that lie on the causal pathway between your exposure and your outcome,

670
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:39,299
because then you get like an underestimate of the total effect, which is why they weren't in language.

671
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,380
That's a really good question.

672
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:50,560
SIMON Would you say a solution to getting more responses would be to create a standard interview process for interviewers to follow?

673
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:55,180
Yes, absolutely. And we had a standard interview process for interviewers to follow.

674
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:58,690
But I think some people just sort of cut corners or didn't probe quite as hard.

675
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:04,480
So what we did to correct that was we did weekly data quality checks and we so

676
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,590
the interviewers would come back from the field and upload their responses,

677
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:12,640
and then we would go through them and just make sure there were no kind of systematic differences.

678
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:16,479
There's obviously going to be variation in responses across people being interviewed,

679
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:20,980
but you don't want to see like kind of stark, systematic differences by interviewers.

680
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:28,690
And when we did flag that happening, we would just like give that information back to the field site and then have the data

681
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:33,850
managers sit down for more kind of like refresher and depth training with the field workers.

682
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:46,530
The good question. And the other question.

683
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:58,830
Okay. So it looks like Jonathan's class ends at 420, is that right?

684
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:03,090
Correct. Typically. Okay. So we have like 10 minutes left.

685
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:11,220
I don't know. I might maybe. What do you think? I have these two discussion questions, but I don't know if we really have enough time.

686
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:16,829
What you want to do? I was thinking maybe we did one question for like 5 minutes.

687
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:20,250
The discussion and then 5 minutes for a quick group chat.

688
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:27,230
Yeah, that sounds that sounds good. Do you think question one or two in.

689
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:34,680
And so when I was teaching this class, if we were short on time, I would let people choose which question they thought was the most interesting.

690
01:08:36,370 --> 01:08:40,540
Okay. We can let people do that if you want. Sure, absolutely.

691
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:46,520
So just talk about one of the questions then and then I'll give you about 5 minutes and pull you back.

692
01:08:46,560 --> 01:09:10,660
Okay. And you can feel free to join one of the rooms if you want one, or you can stay with me or I don't know,

693
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:15,790
I feel like I don't want to like pressure the term pressured or stressed.

694
01:09:16,330 --> 01:09:17,310
But maybe after.

695
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:30,450
Did anyone from the groups go on to report on anything that you thought was especially interesting or compelling from your discussion?

696
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:40,790
From Group one Pop. Christian. Courtney.

697
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:47,800
Lucy. Marcus. Okay.

698
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:51,220
I can report a little bit about what we talked about.

699
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:59,710
We were talking about how it might have been like better to like tailor two aces to the particular

700
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:12,670
population as opposed to adapting it directly from like in the English like for core aces like and like

701
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:18,850
try to pick aces that are like more remember dribble because sometimes like I know I coming down the

702
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:27,100
paper like well you remember after like 2030 years of a parent was without work for eight months,

703
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:37,509
which counts as like A's. So I was talking about like if a close friend like committed suicide or a death

704
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:41,770
in the immediate family or like some of these other ones that are more like,

705
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:48,010
yeah, I remember that. So that's kind of like what we talked about.

706
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:55,090
Those are great points, Courtney. I agree with you completely.

707
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:02,090
Group two. Christopher. Jacob. Sara. Sofia.

708
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:07,380
Vincent. I can do a quick report.

709
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,860
So essentially we focused on the second question and what we talked about.

710
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:18,120
So for investments, we all agreed that definitely investing and building stronger and more standardized

711
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:21,750
health care infrastructure or these communities would definitely help.

712
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:28,379
And then when it came to the partnerships we discussed about how it'd probably be better to focus on partnerships

713
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:35,100
here developing with the villages and communities rather than necessarily looking to external federal entities,

714
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:40,320
particularly if these are countries where they have a history of inconsistent government stability.

715
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:50,140
So that was mostly what we focused on. Thanks, Sarah.

716
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:53,670
Thank you. And then room three tomorrow.

717
01:11:53,680 --> 01:12:01,240
Q Madison. Rachel, I didn't speak about it, so we started discussing question number one.

718
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:07,210
And then also we're just talking about some things that we would have liked to have seen or that would be important going forward.

719
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:18,099
One of those being the yes or no answer to the ACS would be important to have more of like an ordinal answers of how bad it was.

720
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:25,959
And seeing, you know, if someone only had an experience once, would that mean that they didn't have as bad of an effect on cognition?

721
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:29,140
Possibly or maybe, since they've never had something like that happen.

722
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:33,490
It was a really big deal for them and it impacted them more so than if it was a repeated incident.

723
01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:45,580
And then also looking at whether and when you were doing analysis, if you looked at whether multiple or aces occurred for an individual,

724
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:52,569
like if someone had a parent that was an alcoholic or used drugs or mental illness,

725
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:57,070
did they also have an increased risk of being physically abused by that parent?

726
01:12:57,070 --> 01:13:01,900
Would that lead to more increased chance of cognition changes or in life?

727
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:06,190
And also there's somewhat some reporting bias.

728
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:13,329
And if in that culture it was a norm or in a specific family, if it was more of a norm for alcoholism or drug abuse,

729
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:17,310
would they be likely to report it or do they see it as more normal and not necessarily an issue?

730
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:23,590
Thanks, Matt. I think those are all really, really important points.

731
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:31,230
And then anything that closes out from room for Carolina, Lisa marie Ricky Will.

732
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:38,969
I can speak for our group. We also discussed question one.

733
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:45,360
So a lot of you know what groups one and three, I believe spoke about.

734
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:51,120
We also discussed we were agreeing with, you know, potentially.

735
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:56,960
INTERVIEWER the way the interviewers were to questions or how much they probed, you know,

736
01:13:57,330 --> 01:14:02,910
like we're interested in whether it was a man or woman who was asking these questions and how they were responding.

737
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:12,450
And we were talking about how because everyone in this group experienced the apartheid

738
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:17,250
during these these years that they were being questioned and there wasn't really a control.

739
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:19,440
I mean, it's not the exact same sort of study,

740
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:28,020
but it would be interesting if we could have had an exchangeable group that didn't have this shared experience, but that could have had.

741
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:31,959
A lot of influence on the way people answer these questions.

742
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:37,840
And it would have been hypothetically, it would have been interesting to know, but it's kind of impossible.

743
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:42,190
But that was another thing we discussed. Thanks, Elise.

744
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:47,780
And I like the counterfactual for. All right.

745
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:51,800
I'm going to go ahead and stop recording. Thank you.
