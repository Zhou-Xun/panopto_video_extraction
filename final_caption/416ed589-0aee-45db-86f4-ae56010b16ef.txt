1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:07,020
Good morning, wake up, Detroit, listeners, my name is Sophie, and I'll be your host for today.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,070
Today, we're going to chat about environmental racism in southwest Detroit.

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:19,120
We're going to talk a lot about the differences and asthma rates in the African-American community living in southwest Detroit.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:27,910
In our second podcast, we're going to propose a solution and what you can do as a listener to push back on your

5
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:34,360
government officials to make this reduction in environmental pollution come to light.

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:40,580
So as you might know, the city of Detroit on the whole has one of the highest rates of asthma in the country,

7
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,660
the highest rate of asthma in the state of Michigan.

8
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:51,850
Let me just repeat that the city of Detroit has one of the highest rates of asthma in the country and the highest in the state of Michigan.

9
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,320
Specifically, when we zone in on our community southwest Detroit.

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,990
Those asthma rates are triple the state average. Again, that's triple the state average.

11
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:09,160
This is really unsurprising, though this zip code has been identified as one of the most polluted in the country due to

12
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:15,280
the placement of both a Marathon Petroleum refinery and trash incinerator in the community.

13
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:23,560
People of color are disproportionately or more severely impacted by gas and oil pollution,

14
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:31,320
and as a result, people of color experience respiratory issues like asthma and a way higher rate.

15
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:37,050
And at the highest in the southwest Detroit community relative to the surrounding zip codes.

16
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,920
So since you all are familiar with the Detroit landscape, you know, Grosse Pointe,

17
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:51,780
just a couple of miles east, that community is at a far lower asthma rate relative to southwest Detroit.

18
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:59,130
So we're going to address what we can do as citizens to increase government accountability over some of these polluting

19
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:06,300
bodies that are contributing to these asthma differences among African Americans living in southwest Detroit.

20
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:13,590
This is part of the broader issue of environmental racism and a broader part of the fight.

21
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,950
So we're going to address some of the reasons why there's such a difference in asthma impacts.

22
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,390
Through kind of a couple mechanisms or a couple of channels.

23
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,080
So first, poverty linked to structural racism,

24
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:35,340
the impact of that on environmental health and most specifically particulate emissions on respiratory health.

25
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:43,530
OK, that was a lot of language there. So first, we're starting with poverty that's linked to racial differences.

26
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:51,720
That's then linked to more severe impacts on communities that experience poverty linked to structural racism.

27
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:59,210
And then we're going to look in kind of zone out and see why there's higher particulate emissions in these communities.

28
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:10,130
So poverty and environmental racism are defined by the World Health Organization as the conditions in which people are born grow live, work and age.

29
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:18,470
And this is shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels.

30
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:26,420
In public health, we call these the social determinants of health, and they're part of the same system of structural racism,

31
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:31,940
and all said these all contribute to health differences in respiratory outcomes.

32
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,630
We're talking about asthma for Detroit residents.

33
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:44,810
This deep poverty has led to collateral or secondary and differential rates of poor health outcomes due to an unequal access of power,

34
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:54,110
including information, resources and representation. So in our second podcast, we're going to talk about what you can do as a citizen.

35
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,740
Although Detroit has had its share of economic booms and busts.

36
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:04,910
Detroit was one of the cities hardest hit by the national recession between 2007 and 2019.

37
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,390
So since you're from Detroit, you already know the auto industry is huge.

38
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:18,500
So as a result of the loss of auto industry jobs during that period compounded or made worse by the historic redlining policies and disinvestment,

39
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:29,050
many Detroit residents experienced really extreme poverty. So historical factors contribute to this unequal resource distribution as a result,

40
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:35,290
middle to upper class family, say, in Grosse Pointe, just a couple of miles east from southwest Detroit.

41
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:43,150
They have higher tax rates which privileges their educational opportunities, which further widen the educational gap,

42
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:51,100
reinforce de facto segregation and then simultaneously reduce political organizing and education efforts.

43
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,710
So that's all not to say the disadvantage runs deep in southwest Detroit.

44
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:06,150
So, so much of that is rooted in historical structures and systems that go way beyond any individual's capacity.

45
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:11,130
The prevalence of asthma in southwest Detroit is really not coincidental.

46
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,340
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention tracks data,

47
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:21,270
noting that asthma prevalence is way higher in people with incomes below the poverty line and in black communities.

48
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:28,440
So as you might imagine, this data aligns with the demographics of Detroit, in which 78 percent of residents are black.

49
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,470
The average household income is twenty nine thousand and thirty six percent of individuals live in poverty.

50
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:42,180
So all these statistics can really align with what we talked about earlier of the legacy of redlining policies,

51
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:51,410
the very deep historical roots that have led to segregation and especially among neighborhoods vulnerable to environmental racism.

52
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:57,830
Environmental racism is the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards on people of color.

53
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,680
This again creates layers of physical health differences.

54
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,290
So there are kind of three levels of racism, and we're talking about more of the institutionalized type of racism,

55
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:13,000
though there's personally mediated, internalized and environmental racism.

56
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,770
We're talking environmental racism as institutionalized, so systemic, broad, deep historically.

57
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:28,870
So we're going to focus on institutionalized racism as the primary contributor to disparate rates of asthma in the southwest Detroit community,

58
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:34,600
though obviously we're not discounting that personally or personally mediated racism and internalized

59
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:43,240
racism are both really important to understand these differences and the suffering of people of color.

60
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:49,030
So institutionalized racism relates to material and access to power differentials.

61
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:57,610
Each of these layers is really reflected in this polluting industry in the low resource community of Southwest Detroit.

62
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:08,020
This difference in access to a clean environment is the key to understanding environmental racism, leading to asthma disparities in southwest Detroit.

63
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,880
So we're going to kind of get into some of that nitty gritty in Detroit southwest neighborhood.

64
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,160
One of the major environmental hazards is the nation's largest trash incinerator.

65
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:25,030
This produces really heavy chemical fumes like ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide and other contaminants.

66
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:31,600
You don't really need a degree to understand that these chemicals are not good for our health.

67
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,660
Trash burned in the incinerator comes mostly to add insult to injury from wealthier,

68
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:46,470
whiter suburbs like Grosse Pointe and Westland, while low income Detroiters must deal with these cancer causing materials.

69
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:51,660
This classic example of environmental racism in which southwest Detroit community has felt

70
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:57,450
the most impacts of the incinerator while other whiter areas continue to breathe free,

71
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:02,920
has led to high prevalence of asthma. The 10th worst rate in the nation.

72
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Similarly, the presence of yet another major Putin body, the Marathon Petroleum refinery,

73
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,930
has really compounded these really dangerous asthma differences.

74
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:18,940
This refinery produces up to one hundred and forty thousand barrels of oil a day,

75
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,610
pumping out cancer causing nitrous oxide sulfur dioxide carbon monoxide.

76
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:33,300
The refinery also emits 29 different types of carcinogenic toxins, which obviously lead to cancer, heart disease and lung disease.

77
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:43,620
In Southwest community, particularly asthma, hospitalization rates were between 40 to 86 percent, sorry, 40 to 86 per 10000 people,

78
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:50,940
compared with 10 to 24 hospitalizations per 10000 in the whiter, more affluent Grosse Pointe Park community.

79
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:58,280
Again, just seven miles east of Detroit. Grosse Pointe Park is a community of 84 percent white individuals.

80
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:06,620
It's free from its owner, oil refinery and trash incinerator. Again, this difference is inherent of this analogy of the flower box, right?

81
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:17,060
The historical insult of separating these geographic areas, like literally a barrier, shuts out Detroit eastbound traffic into Grosse Pointe Park.

82
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,560
This is directly correlated with disparate environments. This is the roots here.

83
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,260
We're talking about. Well, one community is filled with gas and oil emitters.

84
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,810
The other is free from them and thus free from those differences in health outcomes.

85
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:39,070
On our next episode, we're going to talk about what needs to be done at a structural level, at an individual level, what you can do.

86
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,288
Thanks for listening.
