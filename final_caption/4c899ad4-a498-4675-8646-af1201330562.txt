1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,530
Okay. Now is the time.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,970
Okay. We're coming back to the second session.

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:23,420
I want to apologize for the fact that this happened the first session, but I think I now know how to avoid that, hopefully.

4
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:33,710
And I'm sorry, we have few students who missed the session, actually wanted to see the recording.

5
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:42,470
And but I think we're find the time to go through the lecture with them if they need.

6
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,580
And so now we are moving to our second session.

7
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:55,729
I think it's very good that we have this discussion today because the presenter

8
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:04,330
has recent experience in vaccine and industry besides being active pediatrician,

9
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:12,800
involved in cooking surveys. And this is really for a strong academic backbone to the leadership.

10
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:29,500
Vaccine for vaccine development. In order to I know he mentioned the so many technology and he also um you know highlights the some

11
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:43,360
milestones but I think we in order for everyone has a thorough understanding how the field has evolved.

12
00:01:43,810 --> 00:02:06,460
I'm going to also extensive he's the discussant after Dr. Frieden did with a review of milestones impacts and that was having more details that way.

13
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:26,260
You were really see how you evolved and then reflecting in order for the field to advance from the very first milestone to date,

14
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:35,800
all these exciting, exciting developments, advancements and Watson fields have been involved.

15
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:48,460
Just thinking about the technologies he mentioned from ICE, the passage to use on one platform for all.

16
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:59,800
For long time, the field was talking about the youth oriented approach, which I think I mentioned in one of the early talk.

17
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:09,100
But the remarks were the just one and the about the respiratory disease caused by different pathogens.

18
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,009
With this one platform approach,

19
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:24,850
we really couldn't hope that with one accident we would cover defensive pathogens that can cause the same system disease in a different system.

20
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,710
So this is very exciting.

21
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:39,729
But the how we could achieve these through all these the importance of the new stage of vaccine people and including the last thing we talked about,

22
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:55,600
presupposition vaccine. So I think this discussion is to help us to really see how all these different field disciplines relate to

23
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:07,810
vaccine development and advancement of vaccine related and some giving more part review for these few.

24
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:17,320
And then reflect on what you would talk about the fields and the disciplines involved.

25
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:29,470
That way, no matter you choose a public health practice or you choose epidemiology research and you can see how those work or public health policy.

26
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,800
You mentioned that they have to be precision.

27
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:41,080
Vaccinology is not inaccurate. It's really very precise based on good understanding when it says what are those things?

28
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:53,530
So I think I'm hoping this discussion will allow us to really see the big best vaccine people and to see how different the biomedical research,

29
00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:00,340
public health policy and approaches to disease surveillance are huge.

30
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:06,880
How that could all come together. Impact to how we develop.

31
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:16,709
Bucks and today and tomorrow. And we could also reflect, oh, you know, this is a long past, Max,

32
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:31,230
and a development and how how we could achieve to get to where we are today and how we can get to where we want to be in the future.

33
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,980
And so this is the goal of that.

34
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:47,310
Um, I first, the thoughts, if we have time, we could have for let's, uh, you know, warm up for looking at a very cool video,

35
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:55,410
but I don't know how much time you have, but I could quickly show you I can to do something on the vaccine immunology.

36
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:07,550
It's nature. And Max has some very nice, uh, materials, but I sort this 5 minutes video.

37
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,680
Maybe just a warm up. Okay. And. But you.

38
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,850
You like these?

39
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:51,830
I think the really kind of cool element of the what we discussed the earlier and including today that for next year now we are going to move

40
00:11:51,830 --> 00:12:08,390
to the second phase of activity today is to have a review of the kind of review of milestones before we go through some of the information.

41
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:19,899
I would like to ask a question and today that the freedom to ask the question the parties to the vaccination practice.

42
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:27,040
So who is the first? Introduce the vaccination.

43
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:41,770
Cancer. And so we talked talked about the fact that in England, the first is that consent is the first, the milestone vaccine.

44
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:52,580
Was the concept of vaccination or similar to vaccination?

45
00:12:52,610 --> 00:13:06,729
Actually, it was established before that. You know, and and you do I know a lot of time.

46
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:14,890
When did the teaching or text book or when we talked about the early banks and.

47
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:26,530
Vaccination. Jenner is Dr. Jenner is always the person we come from.

48
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:31,600
Of course, he is very important in the vaccination history.

49
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:37,660
But if you look at this, I thought that PDF file.

50
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:43,750
But I really want to. What I want is to introduce you to.

51
00:13:51,060 --> 00:14:00,360
So this is very interesting. We don't necessarily have time to go through details, but I have uploaded the PDF file.

52
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:09,780
You could also click here to look at the error major for miles and then try to relate

53
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:17,460
these to the technology advancements over which in fact mentioned mentions to date.

54
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:33,420
So when we think about the human vaccine development, the history of vaccination, the origin of vaccination really went back to 14 to 17th century.

55
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,220
That's the prior to Dr. Jim the.

56
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:46,930
Smallpox vaccination. So this is considered the the, you know, origins of vaccination.

57
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:51,910
This when you read this article,

58
00:14:51,920 --> 00:15:05,590
you were realize prior to the small pox vaccination or the vaccination for cowpox more accurately

59
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:20,010
it was really there have been practice and in part of the world occurred could here some countries

60
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:35,450
and that use the past from smallpox patients then use that to put able quarterbacks in battle illustrated

61
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:48,280
very very close to the onset patients with the purpose of to protect them like to basically.

62
00:15:49,060 --> 00:16:01,090
But the problem is that because that's from smallpox it's the violence of back to appearance virus so.

63
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,670
Why are some people protected?

64
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,270
There were also people that's actually the disease.

65
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:21,800
So this is prior to the concept of the pathogen vaccination and the if I say the contribution of that genocide,

66
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:31,680
it was really inspired to the development of live attenuated vaccine because of cowpox.

67
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,010
That's an orphan. In fact, the male, you know,

68
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:52,320
the milk made in farmers that those the course in relatively mild the disease but has the shields the antigen was virulence of smallpox.

69
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,590
So that's the very important to understand that before these.

70
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:07,680
It was authority of practice that. So that's the first milestone.

71
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:13,650
The second milestone definitely is putting smallpox out to pasture.

72
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:26,400
This is the famous story about, you know, Dr. Jennifer vaccinate this boy farmer's son, James.

73
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:35,070
This photo is in two days through a lot of the exhibition will come using.

74
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:45,670
So. Then the third milestone is the first, the live attenuated vaccines.

75
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:50,910
What have you got there? There's a lot of information here.

76
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,510
You can kind of read this as some of the early of vaccines.

77
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:01,640
That's a developed the and the two days of use.

78
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:09,670
So I'm not the I don't think we have time to go through the details.

79
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:15,940
And then following that, the life of the vaccine serum power.

80
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:25,950
This is then from you know a transfer of flu had to sera from individuals who had recovered from the infection to

81
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:33,460
individuals with the ongoing infection is the same pathogen was first described for peppermints and the different serial.

82
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,940
This is the basis of what we call this a passive artificial immune they say.

83
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:48,100
And so antiserum today, antiserum and the vaccine a concurrent.

84
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:55,870
The many full number of witnesses that can work is the hypothyroidism be and the tetanus.

85
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:02,320
When you don't have the opportunity to active immunization, you could use that.

86
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:08,550
So this is considered a milestone for and then standardize the units.

87
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:20,530
What if you see a antitoxin antitoxin basically it's so so you can see the technology from Discover Aber

88
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:30,990
is milestone also it's fairness of the from initiative copper to more refined formulation and units.

89
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:42,100
As you can see here, standards unit 44 Sera antitoxin antitoxin basically is antiserum that's the antibody and has been

90
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:54,650
introduced and then 1951 this the German doctor for the development of serum sirup up and over plus.

91
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:07,020
And here we come to also another important facts that I'm here you mean your product

92
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:16,370
is related to antibodies most vaccine today I use the for immunization where

93
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:26,730
the develop as antibody mediated used based on antibody mediated by the BCG is

94
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:36,660
the one of the vaccine that's one of very few actors currently on the market.

95
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:44,110
It's useful for routine immunization. That's the some cellular immune response in stuff.

96
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:52,150
And however some else, no matter if it's saliva Canada or it's a pure dose of subunit vaccines,

97
00:20:52,390 --> 00:21:04,060
they only do some antibodies either against the toxin causing the disease or directly neutralize the virus like measles and smallpox others.

98
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:12,700
So BCG is the first vaccine for tuberculosis, but unfortunately, it's still the only effects.

99
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:22,150
And we're talking about this one century since the BCG vaccine and that Dr. Frieden mentioned today,

100
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:32,720
three complicated, very complex pieces that we still face, many challenges to prevent HIV, malaria keeping.

101
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:41,020
This is a big mystery. I have all these big three in the late class or we're discussing more details.

102
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:54,399
So this is the first. The vaccine for horses is also the only vaccine for Cuba since then, before I moved to South Universe.

103
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,590
And I want to also ask the question and always to start to think about

104
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:07,630
penetration has been used in the vaccine development for a long time we have for

105
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:17,080
several major tried with the vaccine and are this the life vaccine so that's

106
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:25,870
the fruit of them also showed you a slide how the attenuation was achieved.

107
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:46,150
I but I wonder if you actually have to run across some vaccine research that to show use a different way to achieve that penetration.

108
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,760
Has anyone been involved in any vaccine? Yeah.

109
00:22:51,970 --> 00:23:05,110
So I want to emphasize once. And here is the way how scientists or vaccine people attenuate for a pathogen to make.

110
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:17,229
A vaccine has also evolved from classic drugs of conservation for generations to generations like the BCG backs.

111
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:32,530
And these are penetration as some kids of 12 or 13 years, 230, some generations capacity in bio potato medium.

112
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:41,860
I remember the you know, even when you test the BCG, we prepared for people connect the bio.

113
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,240
If you want to restore some virulence of the strain of potency.

114
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:54,740
So. This was a tenure so many generations, more than 100 years.

115
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:09,140
Every two weeks that has to a new batch of them during the passes of Rachel Copulation the pans which you lost some years back.

116
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:22,490
But this process is very random. Like a means is also a cancer of life vaccine for children, influenza vaccination.

117
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,240
And it was our former department chair, Dr. John was up under the academy.

118
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,670
So you probably know where you will have the award set for each year.

119
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:51,260
He was a former chair of the I think it took him 40 years, his entire career to develop this cold attack, flu strain, lawsuit violence basically.

120
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,290
Well, it's under 50 lower temperature induced some mutations.

121
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:03,890
So I think to summarize this, the methodology, basically,

122
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:16,220
you go with the violence of passage under certain environmental conditions, induce some mutation and which results the laws.

123
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:31,270
But for veterans that have been caught in the disease while maintaining important antigenic properties, that's how attenuation can happen.

124
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:37,660
But to date, back to the mentions of reverse vaccinology.

125
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:50,980
So what do you can learn from that? And basically today you could really identify what the genes are involved in making.

126
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,520
My copy. In fact, that's a pencil jam.

127
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:04,860
That's the virulence course, the basis of all virulence of the principle.

128
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:14,550
Then you could do molecular studies to remove those differences.

129
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:20,730
Q So it's. Coming to the concept of precision vaccinology.

130
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:31,080
It's not randomly by chance, and you use natural selection generation after generation of cartridge.

131
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:43,290
Instead, you try to understand what are the disease causing products of the bacteria or virus.

132
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:48,809
Then it's like a spike protein, right? You try to identify that.

133
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:53,520
And so the study of molecular biology of the Panzers,

134
00:26:54,090 --> 00:27:01,060
then I you remember Dr. Francis slides that was once the classic way you isolates

135
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:07,880
the pathogen from the basement that these doctors thought was among infection.

136
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:25,440
Then you go, you you replicate the past and you make the vaccine the reverse vaccinology machine that has been used for more more vaccine development.

137
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:36,620
Development, because you could purposely remove perhaps the sun from the past and the sense that of

138
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:45,750
causing disease while still being a antigen that's called a stimulated immune response.

139
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:49,060
But just of course, you want to be removed.

140
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:55,020
What's the point? Should be killed. What's the research need to be done?

141
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:04,250
What kind of data we need in order to determine which genes which.

142
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:14,390
Proteins of the cancer gene are easy, supportive and to what extent do we have to move?

143
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:22,460
I can tell you this was the story and the piece 18 was created in 1921.

144
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:33,320
That name was named after the scientist who developed this strength in his comments and during one friendship one.

145
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:44,330
Sometimes they invented this or generates this, but there was no information.

146
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:52,850
What's the basis for this mutation? And in the early times there was no refrigeration at all.

147
00:28:53,280 --> 00:29:03,560
And then in the lab, ever lab was the culturing, the passive strain in a different way.

148
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:08,840
So work like that resulted in many different strains of BCG.

149
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:16,850
Some are more potent than others, some cause more adverse events than other and they generate.

150
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:25,890
Generally, there is a tradeoff between remaining virulence and the immune potency.

151
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:37,300
So. So then a lot of the thought strains since the recent development of this vaccine strength

152
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:49,780
in Pasteur Institute of France than ever thought this has solid defensive characteristics.

153
00:29:49,800 --> 00:30:01,850
But it was not until 1990s when molecular epidemiology first the whole genome sequence full mycobacterium tuberculosis reference gene was

154
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:14,280
available and people tried to do a comparative genomics realize how the different parts of strain actually differed in their genetic account.

155
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:20,900
From some laws, the more genes circumvent than others.

156
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:28,040
Some are more potent in immobilization, while also causing more severe adverse event.

157
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:37,430
So for the first time, we understand, you know, the difference, the phenotypic difference,

158
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:45,230
the genetic basis for the present difficulty today with the, you know,

159
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:53,960
access to high throughput, to the ordinary sequence of molecular techniques,

160
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:04,190
we could make the you can use the strip and you can use this structure of vaccinology.

161
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:11,210
I'm trying to use some example to further discuss the top two freedoms.

162
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:20,480
Talk to me then. And you want to discover and the potency that the video I guess to show you how this enhances the.

163
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:25,190
The vaccine immunogenicity.

164
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:29,600
And if you remember, when we talk about immune response,

165
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:42,980
some directs some immune antibody induce a response that doesn't require T helper cells that do not go to

166
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:55,790
the spleens and microstructure cold or jim in the center where you can generate more robust antibody or.

167
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:09,540
So this is where the endurance and this copper had contributed to allow this antigen

168
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:16,680
that's called a natural induces strong potent immune responses can work better.

169
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,979
Yes. So that is the video I saw.

170
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:34,049
It was a very good review of what we talked about, the yellow fever, this some very old vaccine, as you can see at that time.

171
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:38,220
These are spread to other words. That was the slave story.

172
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:45,480
And it's very interesting case to go to take a look at the tetanus vaccine.

173
00:32:45,900 --> 00:33:00,750
And this is a toxoid. This is another concept I want to review a little that we mentioned that talks with the basically the toxin,

174
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,290
the bacteria, bacteria that cause diseases.

175
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:17,400
So produce and toxin based toxoid that basically is a chemically a vaccine that contains chemically,

176
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:30,510
you know, to change the toxin, meaning most of the toxic parts and then the antigen.

177
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:42,600
So toxoid has been used that be for some people and the milestone aids first thing

178
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:48,450
for vaccine for whooping cough this is an important one whooping cough pertussis.

179
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:54,270
And it's also true that different generation.

180
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:10,690
Initially it's them they're actually killed and then later also become a similar because you may want to think about the difference.

181
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:24,010
The pros and cons for a singular, you know wholesale vaccine versus subunit vaccine which is better what's the the advantages of.

182
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:31,229
And influenza vaccine, potent combination vaccine.

183
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:36,510
This is another concept I sort I want to use.

184
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:39,990
There are two terms in types of facts.

185
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:45,860
One you heard is the conjugate vaccine. Another is compilation vaccine.

186
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:47,220
And the.

187
00:34:52,320 --> 00:35:05,490
In our strict sense compilation vaccine basically is the different form of the different vaccine mix together they don't have all chemically done but

188
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:18,600
we you say conjugate vaccines basically it's supported sacrifice by the vaccine typically combined with upholding vaccine that enhances immunity.

189
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:30,030
So combination vaccine is for practical purposes, reduce the vaccination needs at times for pediatric immunization.

190
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:41,060
Then you can have today there are many different forms of compilation, a compilation vaccine than this, the famous work conducted.

191
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:49,160
You know, actually, we should read or spend the day to the clinical trial success.

192
00:35:49,230 --> 00:36:02,300
The polio vaccine was once at the Rackham building here, led by the founding chair of Epidemiology Department, Dr. Francis.

193
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:10,510
So read this history. You'll be proud to be part of this.

194
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,140
This is something we were looking at.

195
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:22,530
And another important front is covered in yellow fever and the how to come back, you know, relate to vaccine development.

196
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:26,190
Several fairprice have been awarded.

197
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:38,550
This is a discover I've been a supporter my spouse to go in culture of various type of tissue this really and made the.

198
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:53,490
You know, move to the field, polio vaccine development forward, then talk to polio vaccine for defeating a purpose.

199
00:36:54,410 --> 00:37:03,070
Why is the life once killed and the large part of the world population where using life

200
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:13,350
with vaccine and cure more recently and we talk about the benefits outweigh the risk.

201
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:20,500
You know, even at a very low, very real frequent occurrence.

202
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:28,210
Yeah. You still don't want to introduce any disease to the population,

203
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:35,980
give into the reduction of the disease of which this will be discussed in more and more details later.

204
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:43,360
When you talk about vaccine safety, 93 is another important milestone.

205
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:54,400
And the smallpox eradication, this is the most important milestone in infectious disease control.

206
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,680
So mumps vaccine.

207
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:08,829
So I'm not going to add to the detail here, but I want to highlight a couple of percent since we don't really have a pretty good picture here.

208
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:13,120
We this is the important the most. We talk about the development.

209
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:17,020
We talk about an implementation aspect of the question.

210
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:22,930
And this expanded the program for the U.S. I was founded in 1974.

211
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:31,710
This is very important because it's not that until 60 that's many national started.

212
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:36,430
They are started their national immunization program.

213
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:42,780
But this was the end of lunch. The WTO really provides a lot of a resource.

214
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:46,030
Every country required all the LEAPAI vaccine.

215
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:57,280
Basically, we're not. Profits are driving the vaccine and it's part of the expanded immunization program, no profit for vaccine.

216
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:03,400
So these really, really, you know, improve the.

217
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:09,480
Prevention of vaccine vaccine preventable diseases.

218
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:26,570
His EPA Do you think any calls to WhatsApp, the UPI vaccines, what's the how UPI vaccine chosen or is that the same for every country?

219
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:31,670
Is who decides what facts and be involved in UPI?

220
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,610
But this is. I'm not really sure.

221
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:49,920
Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you.

222
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:55,000
It's good. And, Nancy, you have something to say? I was going to say it's probably.

223
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:05,810
That kind of specific border. Yeah.

224
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:13,040
I think you two have all covered the, uh, the basic principle point.

225
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:24,169
Basically, basically, you make the recommendation by the country health authorities and Minister for Health and the CDC

226
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:33,620
here that you could determine what they were taken from that would come in is based on the resource,

227
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:39,110
based on the disease surveillance. So this is another important milestone.

228
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,980
And if you were to produce the presentation,

229
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:56,260
it's very interesting session I'd longer present as a country and the EPI program in that country would be reviewed too.

230
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:03,410
It's one of the components. Then the first a recombinant vaccine is the H.

231
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,110
Hepatitis B virus. Yeah.

232
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,460
So it was not that he claims that you had paid the UN.

233
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:30,210
I'm trying to highlight the similar. Oh, this is also important, especially in today's, you know, only phase one or the pandemic.

234
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:40,740
And for vaccine development, we have to be trying to get the records of specifically immunity.

235
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:51,600
But this is cover is also very important, is the, you know, the idea of long spread effect of Brexit and the.

236
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:56,980
There's a saying that believes people get a vaccination.

237
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:03,550
Besides the specific protection against the disease,

238
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:12,730
there may also be possibility that the enhancer induced immune or immune system in some

239
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:24,550
way that could also provide the produce some protection to other infectious diseases.

240
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:34,940
If you think this is very important, there have been studies on BCG vaccination for protection,

241
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,990
not largest study explored and COVID 19 protection since.

242
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,939
Some similar work has also been studied for other diseases.

243
00:42:45,940 --> 00:43:02,010
But the most recent interesting ones. The because of potential protection against COVID 19 then HIV vaccine still at the major challenge.

244
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:15,060
But this was shortly after the HIV virus that is covered by a vaccine to prevent HPV related cancers.

245
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:23,850
It's important to add to this how you can think about developing a vaccine against cancer.

246
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,240
What do you need to study to understand?

247
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:31,980
This is important. Yeah.

248
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:38,980
No different vaccine for preventing meningitis interest on top of the flu that has talked about that.

249
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:47,640
So another important system to highlight is the establishment of the Global Alliance for Vaccine and the Immunization Lunch.

250
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,990
When you do your project, you work. How did you run into this?

251
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:57,000
Because we always ask. Yeah, we talk about important things.

252
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:13,970
We have to realize today there are still tens of thousands of children in poor countries where they do not get the well-proven childhood vaccine.

253
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:17,010
So GAVI,

254
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:33,020
the established form that really provides a lot of opportunities for those resources in this country to implement to introduce effective vaccines.

255
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:39,810
But there's always a challenge. What happens after that, after the seed money?

256
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:47,200
So this is something really to pay attention to if you are.

257
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:55,770
But this could also be some potentially interesting area for us to work on.

258
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:06,420
Then vaccinology in reverse. This is really revolutionized the way for vaccine development.

259
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:22,560
And this also made it possible to develop flu vaccine against some parts which even down have for good the best way to grow them, to cultivate them.

260
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,120
You know, this is really in the old time.

261
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,650
And when you think about to develop a parasite vaccine,

262
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:38,460
that would be really difficult to grow a lot of parasites or would be it's a different component

263
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:47,040
like a mother and a mother or a parasite has been fully sequenced and it's always human.

264
00:45:49,960 --> 00:46:03,820
Complete the human genome sequence and the mother parasite's sequence made the development to use in reverse vaccinology very very useful.

265
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:19,930
Then also to realize once and I'm going to ask a question but I the we may not to do the answer today, you know,

266
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:29,050
when we talk about the vaccine but you mentioned supporting sex life, which is not for you and to reverse facts.

267
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:38,070
So reverse the vaccine is based on genes, what the genes make up.

268
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:52,770
So in other words, then the question is the reverse vaccine symbology of the reverse vaccinology approach can be used the

269
00:46:53,140 --> 00:47:02,590
to develop a vaccine for all kinds of both the protein and the polysaccharides or there is the mutation.

270
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:05,900
Think about this. We will have more discussion.

271
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:12,190
Yeah, this is a big undertaking of the current time.

272
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:16,749
We have a section dendritic cell cancer vaccine.

273
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:28,690
As you can see, we extended the vaccine development to traditionally target the infectious disease, but now we also get into cancer.

274
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:43,420
And so the cancer vaccine happened to difference a major approach once the prevention of vaccine by some pathogen, you know, causing, uh, cancer.

275
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:51,880
Another is the therapeutic Max. It's for people who already have the disease, a system vaccine response.

276
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:58,570
This is also very important. There are so many different ways to them besides.

277
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:04,180
Clinical trials is always an important part of the clinical trials.

278
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:10,540
It serves the innovative clinical trials versus the traditional trials.

279
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:18,320
I will hopefully discuss those come in next.

280
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:25,630
The two lectures that I would be the next three clinical trial HIV continue.

281
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:42,320
Yeah. Different. As you can see, some of the importance is covered relate to that understanding of the pathogenesis of cancer.

282
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:52,910
So that's also important. Another thing is we have to face the the anti-vaccination movements for so long.

283
00:48:53,430 --> 00:49:02,630
And this is the earliest the anti trust vaccine, the oral response.

284
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,860
Does anyone know what this picture is about?

285
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:22,290
No. Okay. I have let me tell you a little bit and I were into this, too.

286
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:36,730
This is a cartoon that shows the people fail after the, uh, you know, the smallpox vaccine and the cow pox.

287
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:43,990
Then you were become like a cow and the gets the order, the, you know,

288
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:54,930
the transformed human into some way of the animals after you receive those vaccine.

289
00:49:56,310 --> 00:50:03,970
And then that has declined to eradicate the this is another important concept.

290
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:09,280
And so this milestone I want to introduce is the one health,

291
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:22,420
this concept and the human animal interaction today with lot little urban development of the distances space between human and the white animal.

292
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:27,040
Not to speak of domestic have become smaller and smaller.

293
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:32,680
So then the health of animal and the human health.

294
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:38,390
I'm more related to each other than ever.

295
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:43,340
So this is why we have this concept to one health today.

296
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,890
Synthetic biology is a of vaccine development.

297
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:56,930
I can see how that could impact the field where it's ours, because there are different ways bioinformatics could cover many different aspects.

298
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:01,040
Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.

299
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:07,100
Lunch. This is very important, but when you're designing clinical trials,

300
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:17,540
assessing immunization program impact, you have to have a good, logical study to base on.

301
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:29,690
No matter you are doing pre licensure, vaccine, clinical evaluation or post the vaccine monitoring response monitoring adverse events.

302
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:34,750
Yes. Individualized vaccine.

303
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:38,720
That's the what we today talking about, precision vaccinology.

304
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:45,890
Dr. Frieden mentioned the, you know, dose for aging for different age.

305
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:56,540
Besides that, you could also think about to develop a vaccine that incorporates the genetic diversity of cancer.

306
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:08,480
We know the new the latest, the COVID vaccine, five variants that were conceived in the early earliest and you know the most current.

307
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:18,470
Most occurrence, a very lethal nature.

308
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:23,190
The milestone was made to just help us.

309
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:27,200
So this COVID 19, you definitely know.

310
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:36,070
And that's a major, major. And this is the extent where we have a COVID 19 vaccine.

311
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:46,700
This is the first vaccine, and also it's an emergency use authorization.

312
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,720
That's a major milestone to add to this.

313
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:55,340
So you can add to this list of these.

314
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:59,510
So we will have some discussion. Now we have some 20 minutes.

315
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:02,900
I'm going to do a little bit of discussion.

316
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:07,610
And from what we have, you know, discuss,

317
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:17,510
you can see every step probably require other of the knowledge from different theory

318
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:23,810
and to know don't worry about getting the right answer or wasn't a positive answer,

319
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:31,790
it's just the time to what counts is to get each and to share.

320
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:34,910
You saw that we are learning while we are discussing. Right.

321
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:44,390
So now I'm going to, um. Maybe I will make that small group so that you can talk them.

322
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:49,120
Each group like we do the last time have someone to, to report.

323
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,760
Um, I, we have some 20 minutes.

324
00:53:54,170 --> 00:54:00,380
We were to 10 minutes discussing and then 9 minutes of reporting.

325
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:12,050
So basically you see from what we see all these advanced evolution, what's the difference that these disciplines need to be involved to make,

326
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:18,500
for example, early discover antigen, discover vaccine and to, to all the technology.

327
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:26,240
Just think about it. It's just a way to get what we have discussed today together.

328
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:32,900
We're having some practice, some more time. Okay. Um, definitely.

329
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:51,890
Or you would be up to and then I'm going to two or five, then you go five you and any you could join this group.

330
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,719
Okay. We will have a small group here. Yeah.

331
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:11,440
Any if you join this for like I'm sorry you have this report talking about just to come up with this, to discuss this difference of knowledge.

332
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:16,650
It certainly is this question clear. I'm sorry.

333
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:24,480
I know for those of you who feel clear, you. Because stop basically based on what we discussing.

334
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:32,330
What do you see? What's the difference? Are you for some people?

335
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:38,650
Do I have to, you know, to.

336
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:53,280
The thing for. One person would think about those reports.

337
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,130
Yeah. So it's like. Yeah.

338
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:22,760
Yeah, I guess I'm tired of the subject question.

339
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:29,440
Yeah. I never had.

340
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:42,470
Are. So it was like when to go in to.

341
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:52,300
The production. I feel like.

342
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:10,080
You know, it's like you really can't see anything.

343
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:24,910
So I think that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

344
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:39,120
I think just you get healthcare providers, you know, it's only medicine because you have to be doing that.

345
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:47,240
I was thinking more of. Yeah. Yeah.

346
00:57:52,370 --> 00:58:04,600
Yeah. I mean, like, I'm trying to do that.

347
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:10,080
Yeah, I guess maybe.

348
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:18,990
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, so you're saying it's like something you said before?

349
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:26,490
Not necessarily. Someone is of the way to sort things out.

350
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:39,710
I'm sorry. I'm going to try to make it better.

351
00:58:41,880 --> 00:59:02,960
But think that that confidence was a very, very high first person that I saw a year olds.

352
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:18,070
Very. And I was like, Oh, boy.

353
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:24,840
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

354
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:35,360
Yeah. I think.

355
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:50,770
Screenshot of a speech I have heard such as we have been.

356
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:59,990
Oh, yeah. Yeah, but, you know, like, even.

357
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:09,360
So she went to the right place.

358
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,260
And I realized that. Yeah, really?

359
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:22,000
You know what else to look at that moment?

360
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:36,350
I had my first reaction and I was like, Oh my God.

361
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,660
I was like that because of my dad is not.

362
01:00:53,300 --> 01:01:06,290
Yeah, I. Yeah, yeah, I guess I'm not.

363
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:56,500
And I was just like, Oh, yeah. It's here.

364
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:02,070
It was like behavior. I know it was.

365
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:20,710
Okay. Good. Okay.

366
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:25,090
Thank you. I can tell everyone is talking.

367
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:35,960
Good. Now I'm going to invite each group to give 2 minutes to share your discussion.

368
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,900
That's a start from this group this time.

369
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:50,870
To report. Blake got a little bit off the topic.

370
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:58,240
It's okay. But I guess related to that question, like.

371
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:15,160
You. We're seeing like more disciplines being involved in, especially things like fight island technology, like nanotechnology more.

372
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:22,800
Personalized vaccine. So was like one thing you talked about.

373
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:27,190
And then we eventually just started talking about like. You've got to.

374
01:03:30,490 --> 01:03:36,950
Try to understand, like the microbes themselves or like, how does that happen to me?

375
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:46,129
So like. Good to all relevant.

376
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:49,490
So thank you. Anyone want to answer?

377
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:54,140
Oh, good. Okay. Thank you.

378
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:57,690
Relevance is good with.

379
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:04,420
So you've had a lot of discipline, said the phrase prevention.

380
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:09,310
Just to add on this, many different disciplines of public health, such as epidemiology,

381
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:18,340
and then we talk about have public policies influencing who, how the vaccine is distributed and who gets coverage.

382
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:27,550
And I mentioned many different disciplines have been listed so well, medicine, physics and mathematics that cover more structural biology.

383
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:35,440
For example, you mentioned medicine, which includes the health care providers and then have a really interesting diagram.

384
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:45,030
But it was like secondary science, for example, that can bring more insight into it, for example, for viruses.

385
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,770
Thank you. Good addition or relevance?

386
01:04:55,260 --> 01:05:02,960
The school, principal prison. Who is going.

387
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:08,770
If everything was already.

388
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:15,140
Jason. We really have to just let her national consider.

389
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:21,290
The discussions, it's kind of similar. Figuring out how to find vaccine.

390
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:32,060
Wonderful. Thank you. Yeah, very, very.

391
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:40,140
I think it looks like a really good food, very good to live to the office.

392
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:48,970
Or is it just a single. It's like what we have for everyone is.

393
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:56,940
So we talked like a lot of stuff that people already mentioned.

394
01:05:56,950 --> 01:06:03,310
We also discussed the role of like social workers and teachers and just like the community in general.

395
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:08,800
That seems to be more widespread.

396
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:14,440
Also the need for like global health, just like making sure vaccines are getting to everyone,

397
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:19,450
because that's how you're going to prevent the spread of disease by getting everyone vaccinated.

398
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:24,000
Just, like, specific locations. Yeah. Good, good.

399
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:28,090
Thank you. That's also a good consideration.

400
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:34,630
Yes, I think I do have to say, you have done a very good job.

401
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:43,660
Really? I have to cover from basic biomedical research to population of society.

402
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:52,780
All have to work together how each of these fields can contribute to the overall vaccine development.

403
01:06:53,080 --> 01:07:03,330
From very beginning policy, of course, we always face the decision making and the next to cross.

404
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:08,940
I will talk about the development of vaccine. I worked in vaccine industry for.

405
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:15,410
Yes. So the vaccine development process.

406
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:24,350
I will try to incorporate all the different disciplines you mention into that framework.

407
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:28,180
So we work together and I think it's great.

408
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:40,860
It's a very thoughtful discussion, I think, and I'm really impressed by all the different disciplines you have touched.

409
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:51,049
That's, you know, the vaccinology is not just about facts and also how we can make the vaccine be distributed,

410
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:58,040
accepted and distributed to and accessed by the population.

411
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:03,190
And that there's a lot of challenges that we were discussed that were discussed more.

412
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:13,280
But hopefully when I discuss the developments of vaccine, I will try to incorporate all these differences.

413
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,909
This is your invention. In that process,

414
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:25,430
you can really see it's really an interdisciplinary field and requires the integration

415
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:33,440
multidisciplinary in order to have vaccine development and the development vaccine and,

416
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:43,850
you know, giving to the people for needs and to also eventually make impact to vaccine preventable disease.

417
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:53,569
Yes. That's a really nice ah despite the the that the issues surrounding them constantly

418
01:08:53,570 --> 01:09:01,250
thinking of course I hope for this today's some very interesting useful because I think

419
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:09,229
after today I hope you you really it's a good the overview how this you know from

420
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:17,600
classical to today from the early vaccine to today go to read the PDF file that's I

421
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:25,309
you're basically it's all the page in that virus very interesting and quite a lot of

422
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:36,920
historians are developing this that's article so different thing and I thank you for

423
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:44,989
your attention and the Friday afternoon reading you see if I can also engage that I said

424
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:55,350
