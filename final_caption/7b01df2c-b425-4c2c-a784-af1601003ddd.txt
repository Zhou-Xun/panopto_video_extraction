1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,650
I have leftover chocolate from last time, so I brought the bag by hand.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:10,040
I think I started on that sides, on the side and still has the affirming chocolate bars in there.

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:16,240
So if you're feeling kind of down, if you didn't get a big name tag, I know those are here.

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:26,250
Any announcements today from anyone, any board and group activities, rallies, protests, overthrowing the government?

5
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:34,050
All right. Because I like the ring. I'm sorry you're hiding something.

6
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,850
I worked for the sustainability program and we're partnering with the Cancer Bar and have an event this Sunday.

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,139
It's called Harvest First, and there's transportation provided because I know a lot of people can't get to the farm pretty easily,

8
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:56,400
but it's going to be like food games. We're going to have our farms and their music activities, crowds, a bunch of stuff,

9
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:03,210
and it's from 1 to 1 Sunday away from the university farm and our family farm.

10
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,820
Yeah, the campus farm is like a little bit north campus.

11
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,860
It's our 10th annual. So the campus farm started ten years ago and it's all run by student school.

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,719
And we sell like the produce to students for the campus farm outside that come on Thursdays.

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:31,830
So check us out on Thursday to get other cool recent information so that you can go out to anyone else.

14
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:41,969
All right. And so I was listening for the slides, so I heard that.

15
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,200
And he really did a phenomenal job last time. Is that right? Okay.

16
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,900
Good. Yeah. Wow. There are a lot of hands behind me really bad. So he's going to take over the rest of the semester.

17
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,660
I'm going to go back to my office now.

18
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:11,550
Think you did say that something came up about a question about the assignment with the vet to the vet being president, whatever with that.

19
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:24,330
That's a really if there's anything else that you saw in the article that you want to critique, analyze, kind of pick apart, that's where you put it.

20
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,280
So some people in your earlier sections, you did a really great job and you know,

21
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:38,970
you kind of critiqued it backwards words, an upside down and there's nothing left then you to say I have nothing left,

22
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:52,050
but is really just kind of a catch all category because sometimes there's things that when you're reading an article that you are being critical of,

23
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,380
but it doesn't really nicely fit into one of the other areas.

24
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:02,580
So anything that doesn't fit there or any just general observations, you know, those could be positive or negative.

25
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,480
So you can be it can be like, oh wow, this was a really cool program.

26
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,970
Know, I didn't realize that they did this or, you know, this is a shameful program.

27
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,709
I can't believe they actually did this to people, you know, anything like that.

28
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,490
So really, it's just a catch all category. Does that make sense?

29
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:26,640
I know. And that's do the 29th. So you got a little bit of time, let's say 20th.

30
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,440
So neither is that, right? I saw a bunch of blank stares.

31
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,300
I'm almost positive it's already on. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, are you're just confirming that?

32
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:45,720
All right, so before we jump into some of the slides, I know Thursday it was a long ways away,

33
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:55,050
but what what stood out in your mind from the two videos and your critical reflection circle afterwards?

34
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,269
What's something that stood out that some of you maybe hadn't thought about before or

35
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:06,090
that you had a heightened awareness because of the the videos or the conversation?

36
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:15,280
Bob Powell. Prior credit goes to their breasts except for going into this supercut.

37
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,090
I'm not one of those people thinks it like this class is all you do in life.

38
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,600
Yeah, I think our group talks a lot about how, like in chapter one,

39
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,180
he talks how the oppressed have to be the ones to, like, initiate that like liberation.

40
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:40,540
And I think my group talks a lot about how that kind of puts the responsibility on the class and how, like,

41
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,160
I don't know, like that feels like a big responsibility, but also kind of understanding what he's saying.

42
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,690
Mm hmm. But, like, practically, like, what does that look like? Right.

43
00:04:52,180 --> 00:05:00,790
We talk a lot about how, like, the sole responsibility necessarily need to be on that one group or one person and so on.

44
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:06,210
Yeah. Okay. And actually, that was one that's one of the discussion points I want to bring up today.

45
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:13,299
So I'm gonna hold on to that and get some other people that to come back because that is a really critical point.

46
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,920
And one thing that not everyone agrees with.

47
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,600
And it's also about how to operationalize that, like how to actually do it.

48
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,530
I mean, it sounds nice, theoretically, but then how do you put that into operation?

49
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,940
What else? You were all here on Thursday, right?

50
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,370
Are you all right? Is there a hand? How about losing hands? Oh, my God.

51
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,930
Okay. I've been up since 4:00 this morning and I flew in.

52
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,280
I think my parents are being a little crazy. All right.

53
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:53,570
So during our political, let's brought up the point of how you want to line up for lunch in this class.

54
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,310
But this whole piece from a place in.

55
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:10,250
Like you. Yes. Yeah. Like, how could anyone that doesn't have, like, six years of work can't understand, like, videos?

56
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:16,070
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's one of the, you know, critiques of Fred's writing.

57
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:24,080
Not his philosophy necessarily, but his writings, is that it is exactly what he tells you not to do.

58
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:32,270
It is very inaccessible in a lot of ways. And I think, too, you have to think about, you know, during the time that it was written,

59
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,190
you know, academic education systems were still very hierarchical.

60
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,720
And so I think it's part of the context of when it was written.

61
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:48,820
But I agree with you 100%. I mean, because, you know, I when I first started working in those areas,

62
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:53,450
when I was back at DePaul sitting there and I had to read that psychoanalyzed,

63
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:59,870
you know, 20 times and then talk to people about it and like all of this and, you know, all this other stuff.

64
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,690
So I agree with you. And I was like, All right, what else?

65
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,430
And I'll keep my eyes open for Camille by myself.

66
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:12,380
And I think you just wave your hand and the other observations.

67
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:14,809
Yes.

68
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:25,070
So we were kind of talking about the idea of generosity versus to generosity that kind of applies to public health advocates and how, like, you know,

69
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:33,320
the motivation behind it really does make a big difference in triangulating and things like health equity and stuff like that,

70
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,130
like do we have internal nodes? Are we getting further in our education further?

71
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,310
Like the more experience we have, the opportunities we might have.

72
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:50,510
And is it other people? Yeah. And one thing, as you were talking, I was thinking about this one, one phrase term, whatever,

73
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:59,719
that some people in public health that other field uses coming up with solutions are we're going to solve the problem of like even on campus,

74
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,930
there's like an office called Poverty Solutions.

75
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:10,730
Yeah. Even that terminology is very hierarchical because we're coming in and we're going to solve it, you know?

76
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:19,280
And in some ways that can be seen as oppressive in and of itself by saying that we're going to solve it as opposed to we're going to work together.

77
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,940
And then like, you know, you were saying, Abigail, at the end of the day, the oppressed are the ones that need to come up with the solution.

78
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:30,020
You know, that's going to work for them. But we'll talk about those jobs in a minute.

79
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,980
Yeah, good observation. And what else? Thank you.

80
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,130
All right. Sorry. I didn't mean to call you out. Anyone else? Yeah.

81
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:52,860
There is a class you talk about from the classroom setting where the teachers basically are expected to start.

82
00:08:52,900 --> 00:09:00,820
Memorize everything they're saying. Yeah. There's always the guy that really gets that.

83
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,770
Yeah, that's. Yeah, that's what I have, like,

84
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:12,250
major critiques of the whole university system because it's a lot of that thinking system that he talks about where we're just like,

85
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,390
where are the world? Where are the on going?

86
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:21,360
But kind of stupid people who are just dropping all this.

87
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:29,659
And like you said, if you're just trying to memorize everything someone tells you, you can't really digest that or think about it.

88
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,570
And I get to once I can have like and I think about like my education as I went to school and.

89
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,780
81. And for undergrads in your eyes, it's like, I wanna hear that all.

90
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,510
Well, when I was in undergrad, we were not taught to think at all.

91
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:53,220
I mean, we were taught to memorize. I was a bio major and a psych major and all my Bible classes, of course.

92
00:09:53,580 --> 00:10:00,629
We're just memorization, right? And we weren't even taught to taught to think critically about things because things are not always black and white.

93
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,560
Biology is not there's one cause or, you know, other things.

94
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,620
And then even in psychology, which you would think would allow more.

95
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:15,510
We had to memorize every theory under the sign and dates of when so-and-so created or invented is like, Who gives a [INAUDIBLE]?

96
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:21,480
I mean, you know, if it was like 1920 or 1923, is that really going to like solve the world's problems?

97
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,940
I just that's all I was. So, yeah, so I so I agree.

98
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:36,419
And hopefully we'll ask all of you in your other classes, do you feel like you get an opportunity to critique, digest and really think about it?

99
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:42,630
Or do you feel like you're just being bombarded with things and you have to keep memorizing them and spit them back out?

100
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,930
Yeah, it's funny because like a lot of like the some classes now will be like, oh, it's application based.

101
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,240
Yeah, everything we're doing, it's not just memorization,

102
00:10:51,360 --> 00:11:01,530
but then the lectures literally taught in that memorization way to just take an exam and apply rote like I was given the tools to do that.

103
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,740
Exactly. Yeah. Now that's I think that's a great point. I remember that too,

104
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:12,810
especially different forms of like math and even in my like advanced physics and stuff like that as they would teach the concepts,

105
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,670
but they wouldn't help us figure out how to apply them. And then on the exam, you were just supposed to miraculously know how to do that, you know,

106
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:29,670
and I had classes were like the mean score on exams was like 35% and they thought that was good and that we were suffering.

107
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,200
So yeah, I mean, that's definitely Adler. I just have a quick question.

108
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:41,430
Oh, yes. No, I mean, you probably could talk about it for a while, but I just want to quick.

109
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,909
Okay. But so I understood, like the banking system.

110
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:49,130
But Fairey brought up that he wanted to replace it with. I think it was the problem posing.

111
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,150
Yeah, I didn't really understand that system. Can you just, like, clarify?

112
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,250
Yeah. So. And problem was, it's funny you brought that up.

113
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:03,030
I was just like, we're going to do a crumbling activity then, and next steps are going to be more.

114
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:11,219
So it's really presenting people with a problem and having people ask questions and

115
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,170
inquire and critique and figure out what are different solutions to that problem.

116
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:21,480
So, you know, again, with that, you have to think you can't just be like, okay, where's the chart?

117
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,710
Okay, if this happens, then we go to your, you know, diagram.

118
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,900
So it's really about I mean, kind of like the name says.

119
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:37,470
I mean, there's a problem posing and then it's much more about kind of interactive educational processes where you're actually engaged in dialog,

120
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,920
you're, you know, working together in teams, all that kind of stuff.

121
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,540
Is it? Oh, yes. Yes, I did.

122
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,240
I was going to say, like before we had that question, like about the STEM classes.

123
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:55,710
Yeah, just regurgitation of information. I have a friend who's on engineering and like they do no writing.

124
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,890
And like, I don't know personally, that's something that I've just been thinking about a lot,

125
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,210
just because I feel like writing is so important to know how to do it well and like effectively communicate.

126
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,280
And just like the fact that like all they do is kind of like math science stuff and not like focusing on the other side of it.

127
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:14,280
Just, I don't know, has been weighing on me recently. My husband teaches in civil and environmental engineering.

128
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,209
And, you know, they don't have these here.

129
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:24,510
They don't have any calls on engineering. There aren't the same kind of requirements that you have and like LSA or public health or others.

130
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,139
And you have to write they can like write a full sentence.

131
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:35,910
So. Yeah, I should say some of them, but like I look at the stuff he, you know, and he is grading for homework on money.

132
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:40,260
Oh my God, I have to, like, gouge my eyes out of hand.

133
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:45,920
And we do that crap because, you know, it's all like numbers and letters and all kinds of different things.

134
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:55,080
But the one thing that needs to be, you know, I challenge him all the time on the stuff is that with he he does do a lot of problem posing.

135
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,850
So he does a lot of like so here's a situation.

136
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:07,200
There's a room that's this big and there's a ventilation system that's pumping out, pumping in this much air at this temperature.

137
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,120
How long will it take to get the whole room at a particular temperature? So he does do a lot of that.

138
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,080
I like I think it's because of me. But, um, but yeah, but you're right.

139
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,200
In general, there's just not that focus on critical analysis.

140
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,930
Yeah. Yes, I was thinking of how in the model it's supposed to be, the student is contributing knowledge as well as the teacher.

141
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:30,790
Yes, but in certain classes I couldn't think of a way to apply that. Like in my Spanish class where I do not speak the majority in Spanish.

142
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,710
Right, right. How would I contribute to a problem being solved?

143
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:40,309
That's a great question. What are people saying? I have some ideas, but that's a great problem.

144
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,340
Posing questions. Yeah.

145
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:49,280
How could you? How could you as a learner contribute in that kind of situation?

146
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:59,530
It's called the class marathon. And again, maybe you could, as a student,

147
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:05,769
share what is difficult about this school so that the teacher is able to learn what students

148
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:10,450
are struggling with and then maybe better understand how to address those struggles.

149
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,470
Yeah. Yeah. So it'd be more about the process rather than the content, right?

150
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:22,329
And I think we often just think about content, but that's why, you know, although he doesn't say directly, I mean, that's part of what you're doing.

151
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,590
And critical pedagogy is you're usually because pedagogy is the way you teach and learn.

152
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:33,880
And so it's really it may be you're absolutely right. Like, if you don't know like a Spanish, you're not going to be able to, you know, teach them.

153
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:42,010
But you can have that dialog about, you know, what you're learning and what you're not learning, how you learn better, things like that.

154
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,260
Yeah. I remember when I was getting back the ball years ago, I took we had a language immersion program that families do go to.

155
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:56,860
So I did that and I'm not very good with languages, so I didn't like try to learn one.

156
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:03,040
So I was like almost 50. That's not a good idea because your brain's already done with that one.

157
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,729
So and then that they had to make right.

158
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:12,100
Right. Because I was in the beginner class so there were like three of us and the teacher and they didn't,

159
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,370
the teacher didn't speak any English and we didn't speak any Spanish.

160
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,110
And so both time we just kind of started each other, stared at each other like, okay.

161
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:26,020
And you know, it's harder when you've got like a to have never learn a language.

162
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:31,900
And, you know, again, our brains are already developed, but they didn't.

163
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:38,740
What was frustrated about is like we were not allowed to talk about the process. You know, we were just told you can't use any English.

164
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:47,990
And so you're kind of forced to learn in some ways, but a lot of us recover and we kind of walked out with like a couple of skills finally.

165
00:16:48,310 --> 00:17:00,130
But I did find that when it's like 3:00 in the morning and I'm really tired, I could speak Spanish really well, so there was no alcohol involved.

166
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:08,000
I know how it was. I actually, after dancing all night with like different people in our group is like bar.

167
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:15,370
We walked into a store and I was thirsty and I was able to ask for beverages and pay and have a conversation and then leave.

168
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:19,479
And I didn't even realize. And so someone's like, did you just like talk to the Spanish?

169
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,330
It's like, Oh, okay, stimulus or any other point through.

170
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:28,060
Remember, these are all good, good, good questions. Are observations.

171
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:34,030
Does that make sense. What Meredith What we about the process part?

172
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,060
Okay. Yeah, and I think that's a great observation. Abigail.

173
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:47,770
So I do want to go back to Abigail's question. I was kind of throwing those lines out the door today because Fair does talk a lot about that.

174
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:52,030
So about for liberation to occur,

175
00:17:53,800 --> 00:18:06,100
the the oppressors need to really the oppressed need to lead a liberation to be now one of the first are what are the challenges

176
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:18,900
with that what's the challenge with that that thought process that the oppressed need to lead to liberation and creative?

177
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:25,650
Yes. And so I think you first have to know that you're being oppressed, too, like Christians.

178
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:33,770
Right? Exactly. So and again, that's part of the critical consciousness processes is recognizing that yeah that was of yeah.

179
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:39,930
And then Celeste and my group, I can't remember if it was the first time or the second time we did the little groups but we

180
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,469
were talking about how we there are certain things and different people's cultures where like,

181
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,800
you know, you're oppressed and you know that you're following a certain cultural norm,

182
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:52,150
but the people in your own group will be the one forcing that on you instead of like.

183
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:56,530
So the example that we were using is like professionalism and like we know that a lot of

184
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,889
things in professionalism are like white people imposing new standards on people of color.

185
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,980
And like, you need to straighten your hair and you need to do this and you can't talk a certain way.

186
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:10,569
But most of the people in my life who have told me that have been people who look like me and my family because they don't want me to be oppressed.

187
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:17,170
And, you know, and you need to unlearn all of that before you can start to fight for that to not exist.

188
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:21,549
Yeah. Yeah. And some of that was, you know, fair and others are calling the internalized oppression.

189
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:26,890
Right. So you you've adopted that, that tape in your head and, you know,

190
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:34,570
in the sense that they and I'm glad you brought up the professionalism is that there you there's

191
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:40,150
still a lot of people that are going to want to see that kind of white Midwestern standard,

192
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:49,120
you know. And so it's it's it's hard to know because there may be some times where you don't follow that standard and people celebrate it.

193
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,810
And then other times when you don't follow that standard and you get punished for it.

194
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,030
So it is it's a it's a tricky one. And it needs we need cultural shifts.

195
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:08,740
You know, we need more people from diverse backgrounds up here so that a broader range of presentations can be accepted.

196
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,480
So while all of you should be eating one,

197
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:23,229
it should be considered that it doesn't mean that they should be doing all of the work that's involved, both physical and emotional.

198
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:32,990
And that's like oftentimes especially in like organizing the cause for like why so many, especially like organizers like it so quickly.

199
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:36,250
Because the amount of like bird in different ways. Yeah.

200
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:44,260
So I think that while the oppressed should be leading and centering, be like the center of the conversation and whatnot,

201
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:53,010
it should also be up to the oppressors to like all likes of you saying like unravel their own biases,

202
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:59,520
understand like and like I'm in the reading for this today, like just talk how it talked about how like,

203
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:05,440
like learning and like kind of understanding like kind of like humanize, like yourself and others.

204
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,159
It's like it involves a lot of, like, learning and like making mistakes and stuff like that.

205
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,460
And it's like it can be hard, but it's you have to be fine with that discomfort first.

206
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,110
Yeah, those are great points. One, I'm sick of one thing that I'm doing back to you.

207
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:30,960
So you raise a really good point that it doesn't just because the oppressed lead, it doesn't mean they do all the work right.

208
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:38,230
And at the end of the day, if people who are in positions of power and privilege don't give up some of that power,

209
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,860
then there will never will be liberation.

210
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:47,080
So people who hold power have to be willing to let it go.

211
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:52,660
They have to be willing to change policies and practices and procedures.

212
00:21:52,960 --> 00:22:00,160
And that is so important in public health, because if you're trying to make structural change to improve health,

213
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:06,460
but people who are at the ultimate position of power are resistant, it's not going to work.

214
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,190
So I think the Flint water crisis is a classic example of that.

215
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:18,100
You know, there were people in positions of power and some of them are in jail now and some of them,

216
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,029
you know, have been arrested and and charged other things like that.

217
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:26,349
But, you know, again, at the end of the day, come back to money and power of the person at the very top.

218
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:30,370
Are the people at the top resist change.

219
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,780
Then it isn't going to happen.

220
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:39,060
And it's hard to get those people to change because when you have the privilege and you have power, it's comfortable, right?

221
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,530
It feels good. You don't have to worry about it.

222
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:49,720
So getting those people aware, one, that they're an oppressor and then two, that they're going to change, that can be really hard.

223
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,720
Yeah. I thought that was a private plane.

224
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,990
I really think something has changed.

225
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:09,640
Like everything's predetermined. Like, you know, I'm going to work for my family and that's my life for the rest of my life until I die.

226
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,840
Like, there's no enthusiasm for hope or encouragement do that.

227
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:22,710
People are trying to do something because it's like, Oh, we don't think this group of people can do it.

228
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,580
It's how I'm so much like it's so hard to tackle.

229
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,360
Like when you feel like you're alone, especially with you.

230
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:37,420
Right? Yeah. No, that's a great point. And and I think, you know, when you're, you know, like other people said, if you're, you know,

231
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:45,309
part of that liberation process occurring as people have to, you know, again, once realize that they're oppressed, people have to lead that fight.

232
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:45,969
But, you know,

233
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:55,000
like you brought up and people are so fatalistic because they've seen centuries and centuries of domination and centuries and centuries of oppression.

234
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,280
It's hard to get that collective group because not one, one person can do it.

235
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:08,470
It has to be a collective group of like minded people, both on the side of the oppressor and at the side of the oppressed.

236
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,980
And that can be really hard because again, that goes back to the internalized Soviet of your time and that internalized oppression,

237
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,000
and that can get passed on from generation to generation like you were talking about.

238
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:23,560
And again, that's how oppression works really well, is that, you know,

239
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,750
white folks have kind of created this, instituted it, and then they just let it run.

240
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,280
And like you said, it's not even white people anymore that are, you know, in some spaces that are doing that.

241
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,940
It's the family message because that's what they've always learned.

242
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,780
And it's like you said, you have to unlearn a lot of that.

243
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:49,870
Yeah, I feel like oftentimes also like the oppressors kind of make the oppressed feel like they have to talk or teach in a certain way,

244
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:56,270
like making the oppressor uncomfortable and just showing more privilege.

245
00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:01,180
Yeah, because why should the oppressed person have to switch how they want to speak?

246
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:12,339
Right. Yeah. And that's and that is that also in alignment somewhat with some of the white fragility work, right.

247
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:17,020
That when people are in positions of power and privilege, especially, you know, white folks,

248
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:21,490
then when they are challenged, then they get, you know, uncomfortable and emotional.

249
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:26,740
And then the people of color, people from other oppressed groups, feel like they have to, you know,

250
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:34,390
kind of meet their emotional needs and then perform in a way that is in alignment with what they can understand.

251
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,180
Yeah, the jokes almost that can I just think in that way, that kind of like.

252
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,880
And the oppressed is protecting the oppressor. Yeah, exactly.

253
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:49,480
Yeah. And at some point, I mean, you know, to my to my fellow white people out there, you know,

254
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:54,550
at some point, you know, tough [INAUDIBLE], I hate to say it, but like, you know, wow, wow.

255
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,480
You know, if and again, not that, like, you know.

256
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:03,259
And that's one thing that I always hear when I talk to other white folks.

257
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:08,540
And I just got back from being in Saint Louis around some of my relatives who are like kind of backwoods.

258
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:15,170
And I try not to have too many deep conversations with some of them because then I can blow up.

259
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,310
But I didn't I didn't blow up in the hospital anyway.

260
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:29,450
But yeah, realizing that the history of what white people have done doesn't mean that I myself am a bad person.

261
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:37,130
I mean, that's like this whole argument about teaching critical race theory is like, oh, poor white kids are growing up feeling bad about themselves.

262
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:44,330
Well, maybe you should feel a little bit bad about the history, but that doesn't mean that I'm a bad human.

263
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:49,160
But people like me have done really [INAUDIBLE] things.

264
00:26:49,580 --> 00:27:01,160
And because I've done really [INAUDIBLE] things, my life is easier, you know, even if I have other intersectional identities that bring oppression.

265
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,270
So for myself, being a gay man, that's not always the easiest thing in the world.

266
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:13,010
But I'm still a white man. So I walk in and there's like nothing on my forehead that says, Hey, he's gay.

267
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:18,709
Well, maybe, I'm sure, but I'm just thinking about the feminization.

268
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,120
I've been doing my degree too much. But, you know.

269
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:29,330
But I still have a lot of privilege. It's like today when I flew back this morning and I thought about so I.

270
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:36,499
I got bumped up to business class for free because I fly a lot, but it's a little tiny plane.

271
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,820
It's an hour. So, you know, it's not like I'm having cocktails and I wouldn't drink anyway, but.

272
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:46,710
But it's all white men sitting in that. In that section with me, there is one black man.

273
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:56,750
The rest are white men. The guy sitting next to me was watching an alt right video, and I was like, horrified.

274
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,340
But I was just kind of like looking around and thinking like, no one is kind of clocking me as, you know,

275
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:09,949
the radical gay dude because I'm sitting in business class with all the other old white dudes.

276
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:17,390
And so, you know, so if I wanted to just sit there and, you know,

277
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:24,860
perform the way that my people perform, you know, I could make it to the trip without a problem.

278
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,450
And people need to realize that that's a problem.

279
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:36,980
You know, so, you know, I was uncomfortable there and I kind of started a discussion with the guy next to me,

280
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:41,930
but it was like six in the morning and I'm like, Man, I got to go teach there.

281
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,910
I don't want to, like, come with a black guy or anything.

282
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,440
But, you know, people need to realize that certain groups of people have done a lot of [INAUDIBLE] things.

283
00:28:51,800 --> 00:29:01,160
And I think you can realize that and not hate yourself. You know, I don't hate myself, but I do realize that with privilege comes responsibility.

284
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,220
Because I have this privilege, I need to do something with it.

285
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:11,180
And if I don't, then I'm part of the problem, which is exactly the problem for quote here.

286
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,040
Why do want hands of conflict between the powerful and the powerless means to

287
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:20,629
side with the power powerful in the powers means to side with the powerful,

288
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:26,570
not to be neutral. So if you just pretend that, oh, I'm not going to get involved, you are part of the problem.

289
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,150
And the interesting thing I was thinking about this before class is, you know,

290
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:38,930
some of the some of Kennedy's work around how to be an anti-racist, he says, is basically the same thing.

291
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,310
If you're not fighting racism, then you're siding with the racist.

292
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,820
And so it's interesting how some of these concepts have come up from different theorists and different people over time.

293
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:58,910
So let's go back to the the power of the people who were oppressed, leading the liberation, and what other challenges are there with that?

294
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:08,300
Yes, Greta, I think it's really difficult for oppressed people to imagine what true liberation looks like.

295
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:14,110
Mm hmm. Just like looking at, like, the feminist perspectives of power, it's, like,

296
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:19,519
really easy to use, like, the patriarchal definition of power to try and empower yourself.

297
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,540
But that doesn't work, right? Yeah.

298
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,170
Ever something that,

299
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:34,150
for emotion that I think plays into that is like the idea that the oppressed should not become the oppressors once they're liberated.

300
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:41,750
Which, I mean, sounds pretty self-explanatory, but I feel like could get a little more complex, a little more confusing.

301
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:47,060
So I think, yeah, it's really important to recognize and as someone who is oppressed,

302
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:54,590
you don't really have any perspective of what it's like to be liberated while not oppressing others.

303
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:55,070
Right.

304
00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:04,020
So I think it is like that could be a challenge, finding that balance or finding how to really become liberated without affecting other individuals.

305
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:09,019
And that power could be intoxicating, especially if you've been oppressed in all your life.

306
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,170
And then all of a sudden, you know, you have all these things.

307
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:19,640
And I think women, you know, one example that folks have talked about is that and this isn't really the oppressive part,

308
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:24,500
but just about how destabilizing power can be is that, you know,

309
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:33,110
people who have been athletes that maybe came from a small town and, you know, have have worked really hard,

310
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:39,920
and then all of a sudden they get this million dollar contract and there aren't always people to support them in that process.

311
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:46,429
I used to work with a psychologist in L.A. who was like, he he was a sports psychologist,

312
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:51,680
and he would specifically work with primarily black athletes.

313
00:31:51,680 --> 00:32:00,409
He was a black man, a former athlete, and he would work with them to help them manage the kind of the stress.

314
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:06,860
And I know that sounds weird, but like the stress of moving from being just an athlete to being a star,

315
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,600
because we've seen so many cases where that happens and then something happens and then all this negativity is put on them.

316
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:19,940
It's like, Well, you've taken someone and you put them in really unusual circumstances.

317
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,719
You haven't provided them with support, you haven't provided them with guidance.

318
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,860
And I think that's on like the NFL and all these other organizations,

319
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:33,140
because he actually worked with the NFL to make sure that people know that process.

320
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:40,549
The other thing about the oppressor, the oppressed becoming oppressors, this is very common.

321
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:44,120
And unfortunately, in countries where colonization occurs.

322
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:53,900
So especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where many places after colonization,

323
00:32:54,020 --> 00:33:02,630
after independence was gain, a lot of leaders took on the persona of the white colonizers.

324
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:10,910
And so what you'll find in some places is that they then became, like you said earlier, they became the oppressor.

325
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:20,480
And, you know, in some places there may be corruption or further discrimination based on other factors like tribalism.

326
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:26,420
So, you know, under colonization, a lot of times it was really just a black.

327
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:36,760
Weight issue. And then in some countries, like in Kenya, there's certain ethnic tribes that have more power,

328
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:42,860
and then they've created this hierarchy and become oppressors of other tribes.

329
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:50,090
So it does get really challenging because when people finally get to that point of not being oppressed anymore,

330
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:55,190
not everyone is social justice oriented. Right? So some people are like, I got mine, screw you.

331
00:33:55,550 --> 00:34:03,110
You know, I'm going to I worked hard or I did this or I did that and are not thinking about how they're doing to others.

332
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:07,219
What other did to them? Oh, yeah. That's what I'm trying to think.

333
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,180
Is there like an example where that's it's been a successful thing?

334
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:18,130
Yeah, that's a really good question. I don't know as much.

335
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:28,450
I know that the person who and probably the thing that they did the video he does some really cool work around like postcolonial work in India.

336
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:34,269
And so I think there are some spaces and I don't know as much about that the work,

337
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:39,399
but I know with what I do know of some of the work and some of what's happening in different parts of India,

338
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:46,630
that there has been some I guess good even I like it but good you know post colonial transitions.

339
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:54,140
And I think to an. I'll leave it at that because I'm not an expert yet.

340
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:58,840
I might have wanted to touch on a point that you had made about sort of this idea.

341
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,300
I guess a lot of times I think about especially like within my own personal identity,

342
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:13,840
like the stereotypes of certain people or certain other minorities that are within the group that I am a part of.

343
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:16,579
So like for example, racism is a thing.

344
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:28,200
And I think that one thing that like is a sort of barrier to kind of increasing this idea of know destigmatizing or trying to change, you know,

345
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:36,140
that this idea of minorities between minorities essentially is that we often times don't talk about the

346
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:45,980
sort of stereotypes and racism that we are like in engaging in and thinking of within our own group.

347
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:50,510
Right. So I think that's kind of like a hush thing and people don't really like to talk about it.

348
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:58,040
And so I kind of find that to be a little frustrating, especially when you, you know, associate with a group that is being oppressed.

349
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:02,030
Right. But then you think it's okay to go and oppress another within that?

350
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:06,950
Mm hmm. Yeah. No, that's a great point. You know, I think one classic example is colourism.

351
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:15,649
I mean, Colourism happens in a lot of ethnic, racial groups, and sometimes it's based on education or other things that got off,

352
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:21,110
which is when I actually had a very similar conversation yesterday with my friend.

353
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:26,389
But I think like kind of in the idea of like the oppressed are have to be the ones like

354
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:31,810
meaning that I was saying like homophobia is like a really big issue in the black community.

355
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,969
Like, I don't want to hear about white people's opinions on that.

356
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:38,990
And like, that's not their place to say like, oh, the black community has a problem with this.

357
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:46,880
That's like, that's all that all should be like internal and like within our own community, recognizing the things like the problems that we have.

358
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:53,610
But I feel like too often people, like, overstep their boundaries and like, Oh, why aren't you doing this or this?

359
00:36:53,930 --> 00:37:00,410
And I think that's like part of, like the challenge of, like, having a marginalized ideology.

360
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:09,139
But within that, like having kind of conflicting, like, ideas or something like conflicting like opinions or things like that.

361
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:16,459
And like, I think part of that framework is due to like people wanting kind of having that drive, oppressing others,

362
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:24,480
because that's all that they know, not necessarily like intentional, but that's the framework that's been set, like, for throughout our whole lives.

363
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:30,380
Yeah. Mm hmm. Yeah. I think, you know, the good thing and always, like in intersectionality, I mean, that's a good point is,

364
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,490
you know, with within one particular identity group, there are different groups.

365
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,090
And I think there's a big difference, too, between people coming in and saying,

366
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,160
I want to help you or you should do this versus people seeking consultation,

367
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:47,810
you know, so people that are like, hey, let's look at different ways to problem solve.

368
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:57,379
And that's why it's so important in public health that we really take the community as the expert and center the community and ask them,

369
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,710
what do you need? As opposed to, Oh, this is what you should do doing?

370
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:09,110
Yeah. Yes. You're talking about a person who's become an oppressed country.

371
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:12,589
Is that postcolonial? I think I kind of have like an example of.

372
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,120
Yeah, sure. Like the.

373
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:21,050
So basically the Philippines is like, oh, we've seen like I'm not really just colonizing the Spanish, but Japan and the United States.

374
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,480
And with all of us combined, we see central imperialist structure.

375
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:34,670
I think that like imperialism overall has a huge play in those like systems and such perpetuating within like different subgroups and intersections.

376
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:41,899
So in the Philippines we see like, oh, especially like a rise in like the government and like a lot of classism,

377
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,600
especially like among specific groups.

378
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:54,360
And we see the enforcement of like labor migration and labor migration laws where majority of Filipinos work in diaspora or are OFW

379
00:38:55,430 --> 00:39:03,710
because of how poorly Labor is treated in the Philippines and also like the working class and like all people who are of low income.

380
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:11,329
Now like alongside that too, we also see people who once were at the front lines of liberation and who try to pose,

381
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:18,680
especially in the government, but therefore the people in there for this and not enforcing the same systems of oppression and discrimination.

382
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:25,969
And the specifically and this is like kind of can be widely contested and like the Filipino community of the Marcos

383
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:32,030
regime and also the dictatorship regime and how they play a role in especially the killing of indigenous people,

384
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,700
especially like the ego role and like the WOMAD,

385
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:41,300
which are like indigenous tribes and like suppressing large journalists and like news networks and such like.

386
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:51,320
Um, and like even like the extrajudicial killings of those who were suspected of being kind of like the war on drugs,

387
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,040
when in reality, like there's corruption within the system itself.

388
00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:03,549
Yeah, I think so. It's a really great example. Multiple and diverse colonizers.

389
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:11,080
And like I said, I mean, and the effect that that has had, like being oppressed by people from,

390
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:15,419
you know, European, European countries and then Japan and the US.

391
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,790
So I mean, that the. Yeah.

392
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:25,990
I mean when I've been there and I've had like several students and friends from there that

393
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:33,400
just like sitting and listening to the history and the impact that that has even today,

394
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:41,709
you know, it is really, really interesting and I think a sad case of, you know, like you said,

395
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:46,870
it's like certain people are really taking on not just one oppressors views but the other oppressors.

396
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:55,330
So you have multiple oppressors. And so there's unfortunately kind of a multiplicity of ways in which they may be taking all that view.

397
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:04,250
All right, Hannah. And then I'm going to jump out of this one little question regarding one time it's back to public.

398
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:11,770
Yes. I was just going to say. Okay. Um, so you mentioned that like as public health practitioners,

399
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:17,400
we need to make the community the experts, and they need to be the ones like telling us what they need.

400
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:25,690
Yeah. How do we as public health practitioners, how do we help communities when they may not know what they need?

401
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:33,399
For example, there's a podcast we have to listen to for 381 last week where this woman was like really sick.

402
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,780
And I ended up being like because there was more than her house that she had no idea about.

403
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:49,210
So like, I guess, how do we in public health, how do we help communities with problems they don't really know about without being like, mm hmm.

404
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:56,970
Yeah. No, that's a really great question. I think the I mean, part of it depends on what the issue is, right?

405
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:04,240
So sometimes they're like there's environmental factors that they may that, you know, different folks may not be aware of,

406
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:13,360
like, you know, chemicals being pumped in the community or, you know, materials being used that have toxins.

407
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:20,350
So with things like that, you know, a lot of that is, is kind of back to the alerting people of ah,

408
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:22,470
helping people to become aware that they're being oppressed.

409
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:30,639
So initially a lot of like educational campaigns, things like that, but that needs to be done with people from the community.

410
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:38,200
So you know, it's about creating community action boards to be advisory boards,

411
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:44,710
different groups of people from the community sharing information and then saying, so what do you think we should do about this?

412
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:51,850
So like an example is, you know, there's been a lot of cases in this country,

413
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:58,270
especially in poor communities, where chemicals are being dumped in different places.

414
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:04,750
So actually, where where I grew up, there's a movie about it called The Atomic Homeland or something like that.

415
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:10,180
The area where I grew up in Saint Louis, they were dumping uranium and all kinds of like, crazy [INAUDIBLE].

416
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:15,309
Um, but it was a poor community, so no one really cared. And what happened?

417
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:24,520
It was actually a group of mothers that got together because the rates of cancer were so incredibly high and they were the ones that got together.

418
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:31,780
And then they brought in public health folks. And the interesting thing is, like the public health folks are like, no, no, no, this is not a problem.

419
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:37,870
These are the allowable levels, you know, of of uranium in your water.

420
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:48,820
So sometimes there we can work to see what community organizing efforts are going on and then assist with those, not take them over.

421
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:55,030
But as that's and I think people are totally unaware that again,

422
00:43:55,210 --> 00:44:04,030
holding community meetings and forums where you're showing people the data and then asking them, you know, what should we do about this?

423
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:07,530
And even sometimes people are going to be suspicious of the data, right?

424
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:11,380
Because public health has a long legacy of really screwing people over.

425
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:19,870
So, you know, you can do things like invite people in to work with you to actually see how the data reflected, things like that.

426
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:25,290
So there's a lot we have to undo. It's kind of like the unlearning you're talking about in public health.

427
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:26,950
We have to undo a lot of [INAUDIBLE].

428
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:38,950
And so it may take longer, you know, because we have to make sure that we're collecting data with people from the community about the community,

429
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:42,069
you know, different people who've done projects,

430
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:50,470
especially in different countries where there's not much access to like health and medical facilities, things like that,

431
00:44:50,740 --> 00:45:00,460
where they'll work with like local leaders to create coalitions, to work with them on on figuring things out.

432
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:10,000
So it's really about taking our expertize in the detection, surveillance program, development, stuff like that.

433
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:16,330
But, but marrying that with that and it's not always easy because sometimes people don't want to talk to you,

434
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:21,280
you know, and sometimes you have to say, okay, well, you know, this is your community.

435
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,209
I'm not going to force you into that. So we have to be really cautious.

436
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:31,180
It's just like it's kind of like what your parents may have told you is what I was taught.

437
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:36,850
When you're in someone else's home, their rules go right.

438
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:41,440
So whatever they do, you do that because you're a visitor and that sort of thing.

439
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,180
As public health practitioners, we always keep in mind we are always a visitor in a community.

440
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,230
Even if we have a shared identity, we're still a visitor in that community.

441
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:55,960
Even if it's our community, we become a visitor in the community because we have power as.

442
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:02,200
A professional. And so we can't just waltz in and say, hey, I'm, you know, from this community,

443
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:08,200
I'm going to solve all the problems because you can become kind of an outsider person pretty quickly.

444
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:17,430
Yeah. Yeah. I wanted to also add to that, too, because I had that same question of like, what is this look like practically like in public health?

445
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:23,709
And one class that I took, we were talking about community based participatory research.

446
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:31,660
And like one of the guest lecturers who came in talked about a project that she worked on alongside a community.

447
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:39,970
And she said part of that was like, um, like they were invited in to the community to help on this particular health issue.

448
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,080
And they love like an activity called power mapping, which, like,

449
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:52,450
is it like a great way of like empowering like the community to like realize like their own power or like their resources that they already have?

450
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:58,000
Because sometimes it and it was pretty cool. It's like this is like a visual activity and you kind of work as a group.

451
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:05,770
And so sometimes it's, it's kind of like bringing that kind of thing to a community so that they can, like, work on it themselves.

452
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:09,070
And like, yeah, you're kind of bringing this idea, you're bringing this structure,

453
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:15,180
but they're the ones doing the work and like really leading that to be able to realize like their own power,

454
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:22,450
being able to realize what resources they already have in their community because sometimes that seeing it that like makes a difference too.

455
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:26,860
So yeah, that's a really good point. Some people call it like asset mapping.

456
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:34,330
I used to do that a lot in Chicago, where there's a rapid ethnographic technique called community mapping,

457
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:43,480
where you bring people from the community together and you have them draw a map of their community and look at where the sources of strength,

458
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:49,450
where do you go for this? And even then, where, you know, where do people go if they want to use drugs,

459
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:55,210
if that's what you're trying to address or if you're doing sexual health, where do people find sexual partners, things like that.

460
00:47:55,470 --> 00:48:02,470
And you map out the community and you map up both those things that may harm health and those things that may help health.

461
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:04,720
And like you said, Akeelah, that's her.

462
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:11,080
When when you see it visually, it's like, oh, [INAUDIBLE], you know, I didn't realize there were so many, you know, X, Y or Z.

463
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:17,560
Another thing is, like with gears, does anyone know ever use this as geographic?

464
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:24,550
What does this have for you guys? Geographic. Something less geographic information systems that allows you to do that.

465
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:29,880
Yeah, it's a mapping grant, so you can map different things out.

466
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:37,089
And so I worked on a project years ago where we were working in 14 different communities across the U.S. And what we did

467
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:45,610
at the beginning of the project is we did community mapping where we we got data on and this was all for young people.

468
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:53,529
We got data on sexual well, it was supposed to be focused on HIV and sexual.

469
00:48:53,530 --> 00:49:02,980
So we got data on STI rates, HIV rates, violence, a bunch of different indicators, as I can't remember.

470
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,690
And then what we did is that we imposed on top of those maps of resources.

471
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:13,329
So we were able to look at where like teen health clinics and other types of services.

472
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:22,510
And so then we were able to find the hotspots where there was the highest number of sexual health challenges and the lowest number of resources.

473
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:27,340
And so then we went to the communities and we said, okay, these are the maps we came up with.

474
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:35,080
What do you want to do? And it was interesting because not all of them were like, okay, this is the best, but we're going to do that.

475
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:40,960
So for instance, in in the area of Chicago we were working in, there were five different kind of hotspots.

476
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:49,060
And the community decided that they wanted one that didn't have some of the highest rates of negative health outcomes.

477
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:55,300
But they felt that politically that that was the place where there was a greatest chance of success.

478
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:02,140
And so if we would have just come in looking at the data, we would have said, Oh, no, go to this community, but it's their community.

479
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:04,480
And so they're like, No, this is where we can make an impact.

480
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:09,400
Because if you're trying to work over here, there's an older person there who's going to be resistant,

481
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:12,250
and no matter what you do, they're not going to change.

482
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:20,140
And so that's again, another benefit of the community because just based on, you know, pure data, we would have gone a whole other realm.

483
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:24,250
All right. Let's jump to some.

484
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:36,610
So this is just a afraid and the phrase really for that phrase, a couple of sentences from from prayer.

485
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:41,780
We've been talking a lot about this, but this also brings up the part of what you brought up about,

486
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:48,910
you know, the oppressor, about how liberation is wielded by those that are oppressed.

487
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:55,870
Also brings up the issue of humanity that someone brought up. I can't remember who, but I think the reason I show actually, because I.

488
00:50:56,210 --> 00:51:02,560
These kind of these thoughts really encapsulate a lot of of what I was talking about.

489
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:12,340
And I think the dehumanization is really important. And I think that public health often contributes to the dehumanization.

490
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:18,370
Why is that? And you can disagree with me, do you? No, we don't.

491
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:21,940
We divide people time. But public health can dehumanize.

492
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:26,200
How can we dehumanize them? I think a lot of them can be very data focused.

493
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:31,630
So, like, people turn to just like numbers and statistics instead of focusing on their stories of life.

494
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:37,870
Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. I think also because public health is the population and community.

495
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,730
Instead of like the individual like this.

496
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:50,380
I think there's a lot of strengths, but then also like it could be to the tendency of demonization just in the end.

497
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:55,820
Right. Yeah. And I think a lot of what I have seen,

498
00:51:56,030 --> 00:52:01,700
like prior in the nonprofit sector is that like like like health can sort of become a

499
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:06,380
business and you become kind of like the different types of crises that you kind of see.

500
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:12,530
And so to point it just like dehumanizes you essentially, and that causes you to reciprocate that.

501
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:13,860
Yeah. Yeah.

502
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:29,090
I think especially with certain health issues then become, you know, really eco become kind of trendy or if there's money poured into something.

503
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:34,459
So one is obesity. I hear any more about obesity.

504
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:43,220
I know it's a health issue, but there are also different bodies and body shapes and sizes and different cultural, you know, things.

505
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:50,990
But anyway, but I think that there there is an obesity industry that has been created.

506
00:52:51,080 --> 00:53:00,290
Right. And also, I would say in the field of HIV and AIDS, and especially for those of us who've been working in this since the eighties,

507
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:10,600
there really has been an AIDS industry developed, you know, non-profits that are form companies, drug companies are part of it, too.

508
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:18,320
And so when public health issues become industrialized, that's very dehumanizing.

509
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:24,530
Right. And then then you realize we're talking about the the numbers.

510
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:32,240
And that is another way that the public health dehumanizes, you know, and it's one of those catering to because we need it to get grants.

511
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:37,399
Right. So and I'm guilty of it, too. Like, if I want to get a grant to address mental health,

512
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:43,460
I have to show how what percent of people have certain public or certain mental health concerns.

513
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:51,560
Right. So at some point I have to take all these folks and put them into like 57% or 20%.

514
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:58,790
So we have to be careful when we're doing that, that we don't lose the face, you know?

515
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:02,780
And I think that's why I like qualitative methods and research can be so powerful.

516
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:08,630
And, you know, I think as especially when we're working with groups that are oppressed and marginalized.

517
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:16,930
Qualitative strategies can can be a lot more powerful because they give voice to people don't have a voice, you know,

518
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:23,690
because most of the measures that we use to assess health related issues were really developed from a white,

519
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:27,950
Eurocentric, heterosexual, cisgender framework.

520
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:35,990
And I would even challenge as a psychologist, a lot of the mental health measures that we use were not have not been properly informed

521
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:41,780
and validated on a lot of people of color or people with disabilities or other things,

522
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:48,420
you know. So anyway, so that's that's a challenge. I think I'll stop right there.

523
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:52,350
We're going to do okay. So we're going to do an exercise.

524
00:54:53,040 --> 00:55:01,890
So I want you to, like, turn your brains off. So don't be intellectual, and yet just be like a human, right?

525
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:08,340
Can you do that? I know with writing glasses, you're not, like, told to not be in the lead role.

526
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:15,480
But I want you to just be a human being responding to a visual stimulus.

527
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:22,950
All right, so when I get off of stimulus, I want you to just yell out what you see.

528
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:28,850
No censor. You're all saying. I like to say it, but right now, I'm just an American.

529
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:33,720
So here's the thing. Like the first time, no one's going to yell.

530
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:39,510
Right? And so I was to be like, no. And then I had to be the one person that does is going to feel embarrassed.

531
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:45,000
So don't embarrass anyone today. Whatever you say.

532
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,180
Just like blurted out. Any questions?

533
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:56,640
Really? Basic. Basic. But, I mean, I feel embarrassed.

534
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:00,240
Open your mouth. Let it out. All right, here's the next one.

535
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:07,230
I know we might have to talk later.

536
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:14,170
She's a real cookie.

537
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:25,350
Chocolate city. That's for a long time.

538
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:44,100
Right. It's like, all right, so when I asked you to just blurred them out.

539
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:49,570
Did you have to think about it? No.

540
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:58,350
Why not? They're really tough questions, right?

541
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:05,930
Yeah, well, I think we all kind of assume that everyone, or at least most of the people, would say the same things as us.

542
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:09,560
Okay, but why is that? Why is that?

543
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:21,610
Yeah. I think a lot of what you showed us, which is like it's a dog, it can't be any other dog, like a treat.

544
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:27,500
But how do you know it's a dog? Okay.

545
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:31,400
A little experience. What else? How do you know that that person was a dog?

546
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:37,240
I didn't know it wasn't a raptor. I'm from Oslo.

547
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:47,690
Yeah, Serena and Kizzire. I think we've all, like, identified these things in a positive and taught word from a young age.

548
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:51,860
Right. So you were taught. You observe. Yeah. Into the same thing.

549
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:57,960
Where? These associated these images like.

550
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:01,820
Name? Right, exactly. So that's why you did that thing, right?

551
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:10,840
Because there's that association built in your brain so that when you see it, you didn't have to go through a whole, like, deep cognitive process or.

552
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:15,060
You just blurted it out because it was there. Is that right?

553
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:22,140
Did that process happen? No. They want to have to really think Carlisle, and they won't have to rely just massively.

554
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:26,980
And then they don't have to really think about the first couple of ones.

555
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:40,360
No. All right. Now we got you got a little bit very interesting because with this class, this one sometimes gets different answers.

556
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:48,220
But you all did pretty much base. That was one that I usually get more diversity in.

557
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:56,890
Now, this one, if we were not in the U.S., what might this be called?

558
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:06,480
American. Right. So former British colonies, the U.K., other places, you know, it could be a biscuit.

559
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:10,780
So again, we all know that out, but somewhere else it might not be.

560
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:16,710
This one was a little well, it wasn't chocolate, but it's it's a virus.

561
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:22,390
And it's interesting because I created this before the coronavirus.

562
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:26,740
And so now people are like, Oh, it's COVID. And actually I don't know which virus it is.

563
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:32,690
So I just liked it because it was purple. So I put it on a to be real.

564
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:38,050
I did. How many people knew was a virus right away and automatically.

565
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:42,550
Okay. It's so funny. People like, very sheepishly putting their hands up.

566
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,800
And why did you know that? Yeah.

567
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:53,010
Seen that stuff in like other classes. I've taken too many STEM classes, right?

568
00:59:53,790 --> 01:00:01,380
Right. Because you memorized it. Right. It's like we were talking about earlier, you know, I because it was shoved in your brain and you memorized it.

569
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:06,090
And so when this came up, it's it's it's it's that association again.

570
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:09,300
Right. So you see it, bam, it's a virus.

571
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:16,730
Anyone else have a different reaction to this? They want to say like a dog toy or chew toy.

572
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:21,830
I know this one. Everyone got it wrong.

573
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:27,490
You all screwed up, so why couldn't you? So this is actually Google.

574
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:36,050
It's a stable food in Kenya. A lot of places in East Africa have a stable like this.

575
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:42,770
It's kind of like stiff grits.

576
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:48,380
So can you eat it with your your hands and you eat your food with it?

577
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:54,230
Now, why didn't you all know that? Why didn't you know the acronym?

578
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:58,730
I think somebody said the most comparable thing that we have to that.

579
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:02,490
Okay. Because like in our society or like our communities.

580
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:04,100
That's not something that's present.

581
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:09,360
But if maybe we're aware someone who lives in a community where that is present, we might have had that knowledge.

582
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:13,520
Right. That isn't like in our society then we're not as familiar with.

583
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:22,550
Right. Good. Yeah. So. So I've never seen Ugali on a menu in the States, but, like, if I was doing this in Kenya, everyone knows this.

584
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:27,020
I mean, you you learn as a child how to make ugali.

585
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:31,009
You know where the best guy is who has sticky ugali.

586
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:35,000
You know all these things because it's so much a part of everyday life.

587
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:42,640
It's kind of like the cookie for folks here, you know, chocolate chip cookies, probably everyone in the U.S. knows what a cookie is.

588
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:50,660
You probably eat them unless you're allergic. But because we're in a different culture, this is something that people you had to think, right?

589
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:59,010
So you couldn't automatically. Like your brain didn't jump to Google and jump to like, one man.

590
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:03,600
You know, you weren't really sure. Like you said, you were, like, attaching it to the first thing.

591
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:08,060
Yeah. And I think that interesting because, like, I know, I think I said, like, doe or something.

592
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:11,210
I know that like, we all recognize it as food because of the context.

593
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:16,730
But honestly, I think it's more sustainable. So it's like that's all this thing of like, you know, the exact word.

594
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:21,920
I think a lot of somebody said some sort of like grain carbohydrate exactly thing that you eat.

595
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:26,899
And so yeah, because you know, when we don't know exactly what it is, we look at context, right.

596
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:30,200
And so like you said, it's on a plate, therefore most likely is food.

597
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:35,870
Now, with this one, some people said pink, some people said square.

598
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:41,140
Why didn't you all say the same thing? Yeah.

599
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,909
And I think it was because it's just whichever one we notice first because there was like

600
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:53,680
immediately like two identifiable like traits about the image of pink or like a square rectangle,

601
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:58,360
whatever you want to call it. Okay. Whichever one we have in our head first.

602
01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:03,310
Okay. So that might be one explanation. So whatever popped in your head first, another explanation for that.

603
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:12,340
I'm glad you brought up that argument, that suggestion.

604
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:20,360
Why didn't you say yellow on this? Right.

605
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:23,770
I mean, it's. Yellow? Yeah.

606
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:28,690
An umbrella is very distinguishable, like when they're looking at it.

607
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:32,350
Okay. You're the first thing you're clocking is that it is an umbrella.

608
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:38,710
But because, for example, when you're presented with colors a lot of the times with your kids or even as you're growing up,

609
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:44,200
your colors are given to you in like circles or squares or whatever.

610
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:52,960
So for a lot of people, it could be that you're automatically associating with the color instead of the square, because that's what we were taught.

611
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:56,780
That's how we use so as part of our educational system.

612
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:00,670
Like you said, it's either triangle, a circular square where we learn colors.

613
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:04,480
Right. So some people for the other want attached to that shape.

614
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:08,830
But this also this is an object has functionality.

615
01:04:09,490 --> 01:04:18,310
Okay. So it's something that you would utilize or something you would interact with, whereas, you know, a pink square.

616
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:25,990
Yeah. I don't know if there's much functionality to that unless it's a paint swatch and you're going to look in a room,

617
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:29,830
which is my circle, really pretty close.

618
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:36,940
So why is all this stuff important to critical thinking and public health and all that other kind of good stuff?

619
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:41,050
I want you to think the you can think shallow if you want,

620
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:53,319
but respond to me and how it makes me think of like salient identities and like things that are more noticeable or more meaningful to like a person.

621
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:56,530
So I don't know if was this class or not, so you might tell me you're the one who told me.

622
01:04:57,130 --> 01:05:05,470
But like the activity of like a teacher asking everyone to write down different identities that they have and people with privileged identities.

623
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:10,060
I mean, everyone has projects, but those privilege identities are not normally written down.

624
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:13,570
But like for people of color, they might write down their race, right?

625
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:21,330
We're like, those are identities that's more salient to them. So but also intersectionality because of the pink and the square and pink square.

626
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:28,870
Right. That's what that makes me think of. Yeah. I didn't come up with that other brilliant thing, so I want to look at it from anyone.

627
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:32,200
I was the first to Google.

628
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:40,299
Yeah, someone mentioned that over here that we kind of saw it and tried to understand it in our own way.

629
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:47,110
So some people said like mashed potatoes, you know, kind of made us into something that we knew even though it wasn't accurate.

630
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:51,310
So I think like in a critical thinking or public health perspective,

631
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:58,870
there might be things that we don't understand and then we kind of incorrectly turn it into something that we can't understand without actually, like.

632
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:03,140
Understanding fully the extent of what we're seeing.

633
01:06:03,650 --> 01:06:11,750
Exactly. And that as a power. Right. Because of public health practitioners or researchers, we are in positions of power.

634
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:18,680
And when we don't understand another cultural conceptualization or idea or object or phenomenon.

635
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:24,670
We tend to fill in the blanks ourselves because we're like, oh, well, again, contact, right?

636
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,920
So it's on a plate and I don't know what it is. It's mashed potatoes.

637
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:33,160
And so when we're coming in and we're working with communities,

638
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:42,050
we have to be really cautious because we have a lot of automatic thoughts and ideas that just pop into our head.

639
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:52,520
And when we're not critically thinking about it, we could end up being extremely oppressive without even realizing how oppressive we are.

640
01:06:53,630 --> 01:07:04,610
And again, that's why we need to work with and on behalf of communities, not necessarily solving their problems, but engaging in dialog.

641
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:12,080
And, you know, sometimes you may find out that what the community wants and needs is something totally different.

642
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:17,990
And when you're developing your interventions and so right now you're critiquing interventions that you'll be developing them.

643
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:25,969
It's so, so critical to make sure that whatever recommendations you have are actually culturally

644
01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:31,340
appropriate because you can recommend something that you think is going to be amazing,

645
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:33,650
but it is not culturally appropriate.

646
01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:44,660
And the thing is, when you're in a position of power, people who don't have power are not going to challenge you or are being polite and respectful.

647
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:49,190
They are not going to say, Oh, that's not going to work because you're the expert.

648
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:54,620
As soon as you become the expert, you you you gain more power.

649
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:57,920
And especially in doing like mobile work,

650
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:06,290
we often have even more because we're often working in low and middle income countries where you're bringing in resources that they need.

651
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:10,440
And so they want you to be happy because they want to keep bring it.

652
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:14,930
They want you to keep bringing in the resources. And so they're not going to say, Oh, no, that idea sucks.

653
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:24,710
So we have to find ways to listen to the community so that they can give us that feedback.

654
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:28,760
And instead of saying, here's the solution or here's what we're going to do,

655
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:32,960
come up with different solutions and look at what are the pros and the cons?

656
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:37,240
How would we actually do this if we did this? What?

657
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:40,760
Who may be harmed? Who may not be harmed? Who may benefit?

658
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:41,780
Who may not benefit?

659
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:52,940
But we have to do that internal work ourselves first to be hypercritical of our automatic thought processes, because there are so many people who are,

660
01:08:53,180 --> 01:09:01,190
I think, good willed and good intentions, but I've seen, especially in my global work, have done horrific, horrific things.

661
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:06,900
You know, I can just you know, I'm going to just use a bunch of Kenya examples.

662
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:12,770
No, also from Zambia. So and some of our work in Zambia, it's not a huge surprise.

663
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:15,480
It's more subtle there. But, you know,

664
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:28,850
I do a lot of work in Zambia with LGBT folks around mental health issues and other researchers and practitioners have come in and tried to help.

665
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:29,989
You know, again,

666
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:44,090
that and actually it's led to increased danger because they weren't aware of how dangerous it is to be out about being a sexual and gender minority.

667
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:50,600
And so they've had meetings and actually advertised on social media,

668
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:57,710
and people have come and raided the meetings and people have been beaten and imprisoned and all kinds of horrible things.

669
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,850
There was a situation in Kenya like ten years ago,

670
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:11,720
where this British organization came over to empower LGBT youth and it ended up being a national disaster.

671
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:20,059
I mean, all these kids got kicked out of their family and people got arrested and all this stuff because they were coming over with this,

672
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:23,750
like, you know, be proud of who you are and all this other kind of stuff.

673
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:27,410
Well, you can't necessarily do that in different countries.

674
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:31,700
You have to think about what people are going to be dealing with.

675
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:39,710
So we have to be really, really, really super duper duper careful and critical when we're doing this kind of work.

676
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:48,200
Does that all make sense? All right. I know I'm like saying this a lot, but I'm just seen so much [INAUDIBLE] out there and even here again in flare,

677
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:55,220
like some people I know who have done what they thought was well-meaning work, but they didn't bring the community in.

678
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:58,910
And and so they ended up doing things that the community didn't want.

679
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:05,700
No, this isn't really helping us. And sometimes our interventions cause them more work, you know?

680
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:18,219
So we have to think about all those factors and also thinking about and people are doing work to contribute to your public health intervention.

681
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:24,790
They need to be paid. You know, there's again, there's another thing that's huge in low and middle income countries is they'll have

682
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:29,620
people from the community workers like community health workers or community educators,

683
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:34,540
and they're paid minimal, minimal amount of money.

684
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:43,780
So what we do in all our projects is that we make sure that to the extent we can, everyone's on a salary and we don't do stipends.

685
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:49,360
If someone's not on salary, they're working hourly, because what they'll do a lot of times is they'll be like, Oh,

686
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:57,640
will you get a $50 stipend a month if you do all this work or we'll feed you and then we're going to give you all this labor.

687
01:11:58,030 --> 01:12:04,780
So we have to be really careful. I just want to end on thinking about critical thinking.

688
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:12,130
We've talked about this in a lot of different ways, but I would just want to highlight the second point that,

689
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:16,540
you know, our thought is often clouded by emotion, stereotypes, covert messages.

690
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:20,620
And so as a result, it tends to be biased, partial, uninformed and prejudiced.

691
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:27,010
And all of the objects you looked at that was influenced by all types of things.

692
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:34,780
And so, again, when we're thinking about communities and we're thinking about public health approaches,

693
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:39,790
we have to be think about how we may be doing that,

694
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:49,780
how we may be reacting to something because of our own emotional connection or lack of connection or our past experiences.

695
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:58,240
You know, if you're working with a particular in a room, let's say you're working with police officers to make them more sensitive to certain issues.

696
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:02,840
If you've been harassed by the police, you're going to come in with a heightened arousal.

697
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:11,890
And so just being aware of that, yeah, that reaches beyond schooling and you know, kind of what we're taught.

698
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:18,129
Like we talk to what we talking about before and you have to really think in critical

699
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:25,090
thinking about who creates knowledge and who benefits from the creation of that knowledge.

700
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:39,610
So for instance, a lot of the books that we read in academic institutions, they're not always written by a wide, diverse range of people.

701
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:46,810
You know, a lot of times it's people in power, white, those people with a lot of privilege.

702
01:13:48,010 --> 01:13:52,750
And too, in academic institutions, we privilege peer reviewed publications,

703
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:59,770
especially in public health and other related fields are books published by high end publishers.

704
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:08,290
But we don't prevent things like blogs or zines or Instagram posts or other things like that.

705
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:16,450
And for some people, they don't have access to getting their word out there through these other means.

706
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:21,610
So what becomes knowledge is the word of the people in power.

707
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:26,680
Because if you are a single mother with three kids working two jobs,

708
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:33,400
you don't have time to write a peer reviewed article and you know, or you don't have access.

709
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:37,990
But your narrative may be extremely, extremely important.

710
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:46,960
And it is. And so we have to think about, you know, what is knowledge and who determines what knowledge is.

711
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:50,380
And just think about like in your other classes, what are you reading?

712
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:57,460
Are you only reading journal articles or you're only reading books?

713
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:03,590
Yeah. So. And I think that the again,

714
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:13,130
the way that we perpetuate the people in power staying in power is that if all of our knowledge is created by those people,

715
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:22,460
then they can keep those subliminal messages about who's smart, who's not, who's, you know, who have who holds the power and who doesn't.

716
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:26,960
So, you know, start to challenge what you read.

717
01:15:27,170 --> 01:15:34,250
And just because Oliver said it doesn't mean it was right. Or if I said it doesn't mean it's right, you know, we're all fallible human beings.

718
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:39,230
But also look and look outside of just public health, you know, look at other sources.

719
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:45,049
I mean, I look at a lot of like feminist websites because there's some really cool [INAUDIBLE] in there

720
01:15:45,050 --> 01:15:50,120
and it doesn't always make it to the publication because it's hard to get things published,

721
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:57,829
especially in certain fields. And so sometimes looking at the things now you're in a catch 22 though, because in academic spaces,

722
01:15:57,830 --> 01:16:03,590
if you've cited an Instagram post, you know, your professor is probably gonna mark you down.

723
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:12,860
So you have to learn how to balance being able to get through the oppressive academic institution,

724
01:16:13,190 --> 01:16:16,850
but still not limit your knowledge only to those sources.

725
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:19,670
So it's kind of like you got to learn to play the game,

726
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:28,070
but then you still have to learn how to have a way to access knowledge outside of those restrictive boundaries.

727
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:32,509
I'm getting more chocolate here. There's a couple of milk dogs.

728
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:36,840
I guess the numbers were a dud. That was really bad joke.

729
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:41,930
I appreciate the sincerity. So we will see you next week.

730
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:45,890
And we're going to do. And Syracuse. We're going to do some problems, though.

731
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:51,530
Do you understand?

732
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:52,740
Yes.
