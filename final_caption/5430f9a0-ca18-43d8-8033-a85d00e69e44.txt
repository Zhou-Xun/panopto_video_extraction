The greatest increases in human health
in all of history have occurred

3
00:00:19,697 --> 00:00:22,350
over the past 150 years.

4
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,668
Even though human beings have been
in existence for thousands of years,

5
00:00:26,668 --> 00:00:31,362
life expectancy remained the same until
the beginning of the 20th century.

6
00:00:31,362 --> 00:00:34,974
Public health has played a key
role in improving the health and

7
00:00:34,974 --> 00:00:38,140
well being of people around the world.

8
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:45,120
Let's take a look at some of the important
historical moments in public heath.

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,434
Public health is not a new idea.

10
00:00:47,434 --> 00:00:51,970
Pre-historic humans learned how to
avoid disease even before there was

11
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,800
a concern for the public health.

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,183
In some of the earliest human history,

13
00:00:57,183 --> 00:01:02,385
there's evidence that people learned to
defecate downstream from communal areas,

14
00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:06,740
and similarly buried the deceased
away from where people were living.

15
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,539
For many centuries the notion
of personal responsibility for

16
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:13,590
ill health was a pervasive concept.

17
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,085
Disease was often considered something
that a person contracted because they were

18
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:19,248
somehow deserving.

19
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:23,141
But during the Renaissance
in the Age of Enlightenment,

20
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:27,450
a new theory of understanding
disease was evolving.

21
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,950
This was the first time in history
when there was an emphasis

22
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,080
on scientific explanations and
not just mystical beliefs.

24
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:43,767
Malaria or bad air in Italian was one of
the first diseases whose cause was viewed

25
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:50,620
to be something related to the environment
as opposed to a punishment for sin.

26
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,167
Lepers were considered unclean,

27
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:57,923
and therefore were excluded from
society in leprosy colonies.

28
00:01:57,923 --> 00:02:01,828
But while there was an understanding
the disease was communicable,

29
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:05,000
there was still no explanation for
how disease spread.

31
00:02:08,386 --> 00:02:13,106
The 14th century plague known as
the black death brought humanity to

32
00:02:13,106 --> 00:02:19,110
the brink of distinction, reducing
the world's population by a fifth.

33
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,722
Spreading through trade routes
the plague killed nearly one-half of

34
00:02:23,722 --> 00:02:27,952
Europe's population and
it took over 100 years to recover.

36
00:02:33,316 --> 00:02:38,146
The spread of disease was not just limited
to the European continent travellers

37
00:02:38,146 --> 00:02:43,740
along inter-continental trade routes
carried disease across the ocean.

38
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:49,720
Early European explorers coming to
North America brought small pox with them.

39
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,063
Little known is the fact
that small pox killed many

40
00:02:53,063 --> 00:02:57,694
more Native Americans than in
conflict with the European settlers.
