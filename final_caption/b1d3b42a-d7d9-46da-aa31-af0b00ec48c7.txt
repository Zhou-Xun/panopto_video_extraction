1
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,690
Born in British India.

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:19,190
And the reason I want to mention the fact that they were born in British India is because you are looking at the aspect of colonialism on health.

3
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:26,150
Colonialism on mindset. And and even thinking about it from the point of view of the refugee.

4
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:35,300
And I know many of us may have refugees, have histories of refugees in our family or displaced persons.

5
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,060
And my history is not so far off. So my parents were both displaced.

6
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,710
My and in today's day and age, my mom would be called a refugee.

7
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:54,709
She was on what became the wrong side of the border which which you know, the British created a border.

8
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:03,200
She was on the wrong side as a child. And my father in today's time would be called an internally displaced person.

9
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,360
But back then everyone was just called a refugee. There were no categorizations.

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:18,709
And so I think I think I took a lot from the stories of my family and that and that particular focus on global health and colonialism.

11
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:23,420
And so thinking about why country, why we're referring to countries in certain ways,

12
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:34,100
also our information sources are very significant from thinking about where we're getting our information, how we're actually utilizing it.

13
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,080
I'm thinking about the data we have, even thinking about the actual metrics.

14
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,610
What are we measuring and why are we measuring? It really does matter.

15
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:51,120
So I'm looking forward to talking to you about that. I think most of you have the screen shot.

16
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:57,450
This is a link for the slides and I put it in the chat and Jonathan, if you don't mind just making sure,

17
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,110
just, you know, adding it again if anyone else joins us, I'd appreciate that.

18
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:11,170
So what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be sharing a set of instructor slides or more reference type of slides with you after class.

19
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:22,060
But because we're going to be doing some online quizzes and I often tell my my students that I don't like to teach, I like to have conversations.

20
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:31,510
So regardless of if we get our get through our materials, I would really appreciate just having an opportunity to have a conversation with you,

21
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:37,150
because I want to make yes, I want to make sure we get to some of the information we're getting through.

22
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:42,730
This is going to help you in your course, in your assignment, and in your public health career.

23
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,649
So thinking about public health, school of public health, career and beyond.

24
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:52,330
But even beyond that, it's also about having a good, good conversation.

25
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:57,459
So if you if you prefer to just put something in the chat, if you have a question or just speak up, let me know.

26
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,150
We're just a small group of people, so.

27
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,130
I'm going to be working on two screens so I may look away from you.

28
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:13,590
I'm not being rude, but I'm trying to figure out what we're doing on two screens because I will be going live as much as possible.

29
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:22,170
So today's takeaways, what we're going to be doing is and we're going to start with an introduction to information and data sources.

30
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,870
This is not going to be the end all, be all. And it's it's definitely more content.

31
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:34,110
I range more content that we can cover, but it'll be a good start for independent study as well.

32
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,970
We're going to review types of global health information sources.

33
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:47,280
We are also going to go over the libraries, global health research guides and the ones that I've integrated into your campus site.

34
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:59,790
And we're just going to get started from there. I do have some quizzes, kind of a focus in on some of your areas that we're going to investigate.

35
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,690
Time permitting, they're going to be in class, but whatever we do, get through.

36
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,440
These are Google quizzes and they can be practiced as well.

37
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,810
You can go back to quizzes, by the way. These are not being graded.

38
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:18,660
This is just for practice and to to get familiar with information sources and maybe the take home message.

39
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:24,780
And one of the most important ones is that this is sandbox time and I'm going to encourage you to use it as such.

40
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,290
And this is really important. You are not alone.

41
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:37,980
I'm really happy to be able to connect with you again to for you if you want to book a consultation, if you have questions.

42
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,440
I am your course information. And so we'll go over a little bit of what that means as well.

43
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,150
So let's let's go ahead and get started here.

44
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,220
So when we think about global health and is these are conversations you've had

45
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,860
already is one worth and we're thinking about establishing our research foundation,

46
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:04,620
especially with the two papers you have and the and the many assignments leading up to them

47
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:11,850
is we're really thinking about global health research from that interdisciplinary approach.

48
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,530
And first of all, maybe global health is not the right term.

49
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,099
Right? We've had that conversation. Global health, is it health equity?

50
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,709
You know, what should the term be? So for for today, today's purposes, we're going to use health for global health.

51
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:32,100
But it is an umbrella term and we're really referring to an array of subject issues.

52
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:39,000
So, for example, by investigating agricultural policies, we we get to know more about food security.

53
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,310
How are we going to find out that by investigating national health systems,

54
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:50,340
we understand more about health care around the world by investigating current events.

55
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,900
We get to think more about the intersection of health and human rights in a region.

56
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:04,380
Looking at scholarly sources on gender based violence can also help us understand the social aspects of global health.

57
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,120
So there's a lot for us to look at. And this is just a word.

58
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,250
All I created. Yes, you can clap, please.

59
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:19,020
Thank you. I created this word for you. And you can see all the different aspects of what we're really talking about here.

60
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,120
Right. Some people take this the literally the idea of global health.

61
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,860
I must now use a medical or a health database to do my global health research.

62
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,490
That's not the case and that's not what we're going to be focusing on,

63
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:39,690
but thinking about all of the resources of the University of Michigan library system and beyond,

64
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,570
and thinking about all of those as part of some of our learning and information tools.

65
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:54,250
So the other thing is then we next need to think about keeping apprized of diverse information sources.

66
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,690
And so there's so many facets to the scholarship of what we call good.

67
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,999
Well, now sometimes we what we might happen is, hey, we find a great source.

68
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,770
This is giving us what we need.

69
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:14,919
But really it's easy to get lost because this is really what our global health information and data landscape can look like.

70
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:22,240
It can. It's not surprising that we can find ourselves in the middle of an information overload or another.

71
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,580
Maybe a better way to look at it is more of that information chaos, not overload,

72
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:32,800
just the fact that we need to organize even the information that that we're working with.

73
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,790
And so these are some sources that I that I personally do use.

74
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:42,520
I use them very frequently and thinking about them for from different points of view.

75
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:50,840
So something I did last week before our class, I also pulled up some headlines.

76
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,280
These are last week. I didn't want to do anything during my long weekend.

77
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:02,660
So you're not looking at any of the news sources from today. These are all from I think Friday was the latest poll days.

78
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,440
So keeping up with news around the world.

79
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:13,190
So seeing the connections between global public health and we're going to be investigating new sources as well.

80
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:22,100
But really understanding the the broad nature of our subject area and when you look at this, we have everything.

81
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:28,999
And I just did a Google News search, literally everything from monkeypox to, of course,

82
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,370
the tragedy in Pakistan right now, the abortion ban in the U.S. We're looking at climate change.

83
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:43,790
We're looking at polio staging a comeback. And these are just just some of the.

84
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,980
The idea of refugees with digital ideas and how that may change their lives.

85
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,550
So thinking about a lot of these sources can be really helpful.

86
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,780
So next, it's really important for us to think about our research question.

87
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:06,390
And Jonathan, I want to ask, have the students been talking or looking at SDGs yet?

88
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:13,530
The Sustainable Development Goals? So we went over those last class to get excellent right timing.

89
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,129
So that's what you see behind the screen, of course.

90
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:23,440
Right. The 17 goals and what we're going to be looking at is what is your research question?

91
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,320
So one of the most important thing when you're defining your paper is, okay,

92
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:33,660
you have a do you have a background question you want to identify or do you have

93
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:39,750
a primary literature question or a or a more primary source type of question?

94
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,670
And as we're working on our papers, we're going to have a lot of these many questions.

95
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,360
We're going to have some of our research questions are going to be background.

96
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,850
Some of our research questions are going to be primary.

97
00:09:51,540 --> 00:10:00,209
But when we're dealing with doing a large project like a paper, when we're dealing with doing research, we really don't have one big question.

98
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:08,850
We have small ones. And the reason we want to we want to put them into smaller chunks is as we're identifying our information needs,

99
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,600
we are then matching them to specific information sources.

100
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:19,620
So in some cases, let's say I'm looking at gender based violence, I'm going to look at a database of scholarly literature,

101
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:26,129
but I'm also going to look at the age of the W.H.O. data on violence against women potentially.

102
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,900
And so looking at that, that's a that's a new data source that's now available.

103
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:38,490
It's actually data visualization source. And then thinking about that from various perspectives can be really helpful.

104
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,160
I'm going to go live for a second and do let me know if my screen is showing up.

105
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,760
Can you see my screen? Yes. Okay.

106
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,380
So, of course, I hope you know what this is.

107
00:10:53,400 --> 00:11:00,060
This is your Canada site. And if you click on the navigation bar, some of you may have already done this.

108
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:05,670
You can go to the section called Library Tools. And that is where you're going to find.

109
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:11,170
I guess not. Nothing's going to happen when you click on library tools.

110
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:18,870
Excellent. This is what happens when your teaching lives.

111
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,240
Okay. Here we go. So you might have seen this before.

112
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:30,260
This, of course, is me. This is my email address. So you always have that.

113
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:40,550
And what I've also put in here is a widget which allows you to search the university library catalog without leaving the campus site.

114
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:45,290
So if you have a quick thing that you want to search for, can go ahead and search for that.

115
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:53,630
Some of you may be new to using some of our sources like AM, get it when we're looking for full text articles.

116
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:58,490
So I put a video in there that allows you to kind of figure that to learn about that.

117
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:05,820
On the bottom of the screen. On the right side, we have some recommended resources.

118
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,020
And one of the things I did add there. These are all streaming video.

119
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:22,740
And very often our user, our students don't realize we have streaming documentaries, we have streaming films and episodes of materials.

120
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:28,050
And most of these are for documentaries. And a lot of them deal with issues of global health.

121
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,550
So I would encourage you to take a look at some of these streaming sources.

122
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:40,530
What we're really the the the meat or the plant based protein.

123
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:45,900
If you're not a meat eater, what we're going to be talking about today is our research guides.

124
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:54,510
We're going to be focusing on the global health research guide. And and because the link is right in your site, don't worry about finding it.

125
00:12:54,510 --> 00:13:05,760
But if you we're going to go there. Also, there's an SD guide which I administer, a global sexual reproductive health guide that's all open content.

126
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,080
So you can share that around the world. We're going to hopefully talk about that in a minute.

127
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,970
The difference between view and subscribe content and open content.

128
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,040
Refugees and displaced persons and the ever popular citation management.

129
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:30,860
We need that one just because you never know if you're going to be using Otero or and note or another citation management tool.

130
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:39,380
How to make sure that you are that you do have the right directions to kind of get those citations for your papers as well.

131
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:48,459
Let's go ahead and take a tour of the global health guide. And so this guide is something I've administered for some time,

132
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:54,310
and we're going to go through some of these sections, not all of them, but several of them.

133
00:13:55,150 --> 00:14:02,470
And right now, you can see I have a resource spotlight on a new source called Gideon, which is an epidemiologist,

134
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:11,769
infectious and epidemiology information source that we have right now for until May 15 as a trial.

135
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:17,020
And we're really excited about it. There's a lot you can do with this in regards to infectious disease.

136
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,660
What do we have on this page? So I have a small section on monkeypox.

137
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,470
It's not huge, but I just want to help people get started.

138
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:36,140
On the on the right side. We also see under new and noteworthy some new tools that I'm sharing with my user population.

139
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:43,340
And then on the left hand side, this is a really important area is our navigation bar.

140
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,660
So we navigate to global health and news and awareness.

141
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:53,450
An area we're going to be focusing a good deal on today is global data statistics.

142
00:14:54,020 --> 00:15:00,680
My point is not to go through this entire guide, but to show you where a lot of what you may need is going to be.

143
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,680
So I'm not going to literally share everything on this page, but just so you know,

144
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:15,500
where you can get some good statistical sources and I have gone through and mold the majority of the statistical information is free.

145
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,180
If not, it does the one user only beside it.

146
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:27,470
So you know that you will have to log in to use. And we'll go through some of the other pieces of this in a minute.

147
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,270
Let's go back to getting started.

148
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:40,270
And I do have screenshots of this, but I do want to show you as we get started, we're going to look at some of the scholarly sources.

149
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:46,790
To begin with then we're going to look at data and statistics, grade literature.

150
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:54,670
We're going to come to that in a minute, which is more reports, international public policy to look at briefs, that kind of thing.

151
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:02,620
And then we're also looking at the SDG side and the Sexual Reproductive Health Guide,

152
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:06,820
Refugee Guide, and then some e-learning resources and case studies.

153
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:13,990
Any questions so far? I know I'm going I'm pretty quickly with some of our some of the content here.

154
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:28,490
I'm going back into my screenshots just because it's it's quick for me to get through some of the content.

155
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:41,270
And one thing I do want to highlight here is, as we were just talking about the the Sustainable Development Goals part of the guide.

156
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:50,390
If you click on that or if you click on the link from library tools in your canvas site,

157
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:59,119
you'll get to this SDG page and from this page, this, by the way, I'm in the process of updating it.

158
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,940
So I hope that the content you see here is going to be some of the things are have been updated.

159
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,420
I'm still going through every single of the goals and getting through that.

160
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,420
So as you can imagine, it is a process.

161
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:18,560
And if you do go ahead and click on any section of this, you'll see the same.

162
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,870
The page template will be the same.

163
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:32,270
So this is going to for Zero Hunger, you'll see a section for our featured resources databases a little more about the targets themselves.

164
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:37,040
The and then a section on data and a section on organizations.

165
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:43,700
So you can you can get your your hand around some of your your head around some of that information as well.

166
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,250
Again, that's just a brief navigation of our of our site.

167
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,560
And of course, then there is the library sites themselves.

168
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,190
We have such a richness of resources for you.

169
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:05,450
And we were you know, we were talking a lot about things that are accessible to all and looking at open access articles.

170
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:11,710
And but something we must remember is also information is a commodity.

171
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:23,200
The I how much do you think I'm just going to ask you guys how much do you think we the university library system pays for our our materials budget,

172
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,940
our resource content budget? What do you think it might be?

173
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,920
Per year. Chat me.

174
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,810
Chat something. 1 million.

175
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:46,060
Well, I'll tell you what, million covers maybe a portion of only the problem libraries, cereals, budget.

176
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:53,690
What else do you got? Oh, wow.

177
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:58,090
They're coming in fast. Not 50 million, but it's coming close.

178
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,450
This is not including wages and salaries.

179
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,930
We have one of we are the largest academic unit on campus.

180
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:09,040
So putting those aside, our materials budget is 24 million.

181
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:23,520
Per year. So and so think about that. As we're using databases, one of our databases for an entire campus may be 200,000, 300,000 more.

182
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:29,100
And the reason I want you to think about that is, first of all, you guys are paying for it, which is important.

183
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:38,120
But secondly, I want you to think about the issue of access and access to information, the digital divide.

184
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,690
This is a conversation I don't want to focus on today, but I want to come back.

185
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:50,820
I want you guys to think about access to information. It is considered to be a human right, a global right to thinking about Internet access.

186
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,670
Now, if the if the United Nations declares that Internet access is a human right.

187
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,310
So what? Right. What does that mean both in the United States in regards to broadband access or beyond?

188
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:11,870
Now we know that our instructor, Dr. Rigo, is not here today because he's in an area of spotty Internet connection.

189
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:22,399
So just saying, right. So thinking about when we think about these issues of colonialism and we think about the issue, these issues of resourcing,

190
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:33,020
we also have to think about access to information as an aspect of health equity so that I'm going to get off my little band, my little soapbox.

191
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:38,479
But I needed to see that. I'm sorry, guys. Let's go ahead and get started.

192
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,040
We're going to look at information from our sources from three categories today.

193
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,240
And Jonathan, would you mind keeping track of the chart for me?

194
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:53,660
Absolutely. Just because I can't see it on my working with two screens.

195
00:20:54,830 --> 00:21:01,510
And so looking at this, we're going to start with looking at scholarly sources and getting started there.

196
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,860
Then we're going to start looking at data and data visualization.

197
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,290
And time permitting will then go into global news sources.

198
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:14,299
So this is the way I want to categorize things. Going to the source.

199
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:21,130
Let's go ahead and get started with that information. I like to think of this about going to the source.

200
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:29,690
Well, water you when we think about you know really cool crisp wild water it's it's and that's usually primary literature.

201
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,780
Sometimes we might look at evidence syntheses. Then we'll also look at the next piece.

202
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:39,530
So let's go ahead and get started with scholarly sources.

203
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,550
And we're not going to look at every single scholarly source in this list.

204
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:51,110
I just wanted to give you an idea of where some of those getting started sources would be for for global health.

205
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:58,670
Of course, I imagine that all of you have had some experience with Medline, otherwise known as PubMed.

206
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:06,010
You may not be aware, but we want you to link to PubMed using one of our links.

207
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,990
By the way, this is the screen the screen shots that I've given you, the slides I've given you.

208
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,850
Do you have the hyperlinks on them? But so does the guide.

209
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,450
I'm going to encourage you to keep going back to the guide on the cannabis site for global health,

210
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:28,630
because that allows us to get into the, um, journal links, which by the way provides you with access to your library content.

211
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,760
And that's true about these other databases is a nursing database.

212
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,980
It's really great for maternal health issues, issues of care issues, thinking about social issues as well.

213
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:50,650
Psych info, I think that's self-explanatory. Looking at about trauma, looking at mental health is going to be a significant part of that.

214
00:22:51,160 --> 00:23:00,400
Scopus is one of my favorite databases. It's an interdisciplinary database health, physical sciences, social sciences.

215
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:05,979
And so it covers a large expanse of information. Then again,

216
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,090
if we want to get into searching some of the databases that we have that are

217
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:14,830
focused and a lot more focused in on what we call those global health topics.

218
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:19,640
So global health which. You know, three guesses of what that's about.

219
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:30,890
So that's a database that more focused on infectious disease, on washed water, sanitation and hygiene issues such as that.

220
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,480
Then we have health policy reference center. Again, another source to look at.

221
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:41,120
P.E.I., P.E.I. asks index is not a health database.

222
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:49,189
It's a public international public affairs database that for you I'm users and I'm encouraging you to use it

223
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:57,490
because it's a great place to find articles about human rights or about community health or different aspects,

224
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,130
governance, for instance, even labor rights, that kind of thing.

225
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:06,830
And one database I really appreciate when we look at aspects of women's health,

226
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:14,650
is that social perspective on women's health or reproductive health, and that's Women's Studies International.

227
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:23,000
It's a small gender studies database, but I often have gotten gem gems just out of it in regards to finding articles.

228
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:28,490
Let's go ahead and just take a look at where where you might find this information.

229
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:38,990
So back to the libraries guides on the main page of the Library Guide page and you can see the getting started Pub Med Global Health,

230
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,630
you can see those. And then the next step of going into the more scholarly global health sources.

231
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:49,820
And the next step after that would be looking at general inter-disciplinary databases.

232
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:58,900
So I'm not going to go through these and I'm going to encourage you to use use your own topics of interest.

233
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,220
But if you want to spend some independent study exploration time,

234
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:10,780
these are some topic areas that give you an idea of what you might be able to find using the databases that I've suggested.

235
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:19,450
Not to say that they're the only or the best source to find to answer the research question I posed in each of these cases.

236
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,590
But they're good places to go to to find this type of information.

237
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:35,620
So any questions so far? So here, for example, for Scopus, because it's an interdisciplinary database looking at climate change and food security,

238
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:43,420
that's going to give me environmental health content, but it's also going to give me health content as well, health sciences content.

239
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,470
So I get to look at things from the agricultural point of view,

240
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:53,560
but then I also get to look at things from more of more of a health sciences point of view, let's say.

241
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:01,690
Issues in regards to health care among refugees. Health policy, of course, is going to be a big piece of that.

242
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:05,200
And and again, just another way to see information,

243
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:15,850
because public affairs international index is going to be a good place to find information about aspects of government governance,

244
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:19,990
human rights, looking at the digital divide, which is a human rights issue.

245
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,440
In regards to COVID 19 could be a good place to find that.

246
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:29,620
And then looking at Women's Studies International, looking at that social approach to women's health,

247
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:34,210
for example, the aspect of menstruation and stigma or shame.

248
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,670
And if you want to find more scholarly articles about that, for instance.

249
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:52,100
Let's take a look at gray literature. And I'm going to ask anyone, has anyone investigated great literature before or heard the term before?

250
00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:01,150
Jonathan. Anyone else, you have to speak up or chat because I don't know if I can see all of you.

251
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:12,970
Yes. No. Jonathan, can you tell the class some experiences you've had with great literature?

252
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:19,870
Oh, I mean, it's new for me too, from this semester, but from my understanding, it's more of like published report.

253
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,100
So it's not scholarly journals and it's not news articles,

254
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:32,490
but this would be like reports published by like an NGO or like potentially from a government agency as well.

255
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:39,880
So something like CMS might publish a report on on health care spending and that would be great literature.

256
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:44,410
You sound like you. God, Judy Smith. Yes.

257
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:50,740
The information is the lecture recently. And that's exactly what you just said, like last week.

258
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:56,450
Okay. So she's a friend of mine and of course, our person on health policy.

259
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:00,640
And I guess, Jonathan, you said you're you're an HMV student.

260
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:08,439
Correct? Yeah, I am. Okay. So looking at this, I what I'm again, want to focus on that aspect of it.

261
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:15,400
So I did create another hurdle for you, except I did it in shades of gray because that makes this makes sense to me.

262
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:22,830
So during the time of COVID 19, preprints huge write, so many preprints were coming, coming out.

263
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:32,739
That's considered to be gray literature conference proceedings, white papers, blogs, social, social media within reason.

264
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:39,400
So let's see a tweet from on a report, for instance, webinars, webinars are greenlit.

265
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,250
I mean, you have a recording of them and you can use them in your research as long as you cite them correctly.

266
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:52,850
And so thinking about all of that and one place that I've collected some of this is on the Global Health Guide.

267
00:28:53,870 --> 00:29:02,050
I've collected some reports that are relevant to global health and global development, and of course, not the end all, be all.

268
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:07,970
But these are just some that I've found to be engaging and of course, relevant.

269
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,820
So the state of food security nutrition for 2022, that's been released.

270
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:25,350
You can see the goalkeepers report on SDG goals and data and that the new goalkeepers report should be coming out this week.

271
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,920
So we'll keep our eyes posted for that one. Then we have other guides.

272
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:39,870
This one is really relevant right now. So the United Nations Population Fund has the state of the World's Population Report.

273
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:48,150
2022 just came out and it's called The Case for Action and Neglected Crisis of Unintended Pregnancy.

274
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,820
I'm not going to go through every single one of these,

275
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,160
but what I do want to encourage you to to realize is I encourage you to realize what does that mean?

276
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:01,410
I encourage you to see is that these are interactive, the majority of these.

277
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:10,200
I've tried to put an interactive report where a good example of what I mean by that is the UNFPA report.

278
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:20,190
And so when you enter and it starts to go through, if I scroll down into this report, I can download the PDF of this, right?

279
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:28,050
No problem. But the way that the online version is set up, it's actually a learning resource in itself.

280
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,870
So I can choose something here. So let's say I go ahead and choose every woman.

281
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,460
Every woman is at risk. And then when I scroll through this.

282
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:45,219
And look at that topic area. We can see a little more about what that means.

283
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:57,550
It's taking me through as I'm scrolling. You can see it's it's actually taking me through contact and then it might take me to a YouTube video or.

284
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:05,889
Going through this. It's actually focusing on different aspects of the of the report itself.

285
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:09,370
So, again, thinking about this in a different way.

286
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:14,590
So here it's taking me to the social media site for UNFPA and thinking.

287
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,270
So the content here is is downloadable as a PDF report,

288
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:29,080
but sometimes looking at these reports can be quite engaging and it can even add to how you work when you look at them in an interactive way.

289
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:35,440
So I've tried to add specifically reports that are interactive in nature.

290
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:44,190
So that's what I have under the Global Health Guide. Let's go ahead and take a look at some of these others now.

291
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:49,800
Jonathan, I know you've seen over ten because it is something Judy's very excited about.

292
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:55,380
My friend and fellow information is. Let's go ahead and take a look at that.

293
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:02,580
And I want to take you through that policy comment is another source that I think is really relevant to the work you're doing.

294
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:10,520
Chow not saying goodbye. Chow is Columbia International Affairs Online.

295
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,690
And one we're not going to look at today, but the link is here.

296
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,860
I'm just trying to save time. It is the World Bank e-library again.

297
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,460
You'll find this on the guide. You'll find this through the library catalog.

298
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:29,050
And you'll find this on on the slide. So those are reports that I'm going to recommend looking at.

299
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:37,870
So again, in addition to those interactive reports, there's a section on the global health guide called the International Public Policy Section.

300
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,160
And that's where we're going to go to go through and look at next.

301
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,850
Again, just another review of types of great literature.

302
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:54,299
So let's go ahead and take a look at over ten and I'm going to click here and take you live in over ten.

303
00:32:54,300 --> 00:33:02,880
So we get an idea of what it is. What we mean by this is let's say I want to you know, there's all these reports on great sites,

304
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:10,500
the World Health Organization, UNFPA, Gates Foundation, the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation.

305
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:17,010
The point of the matter is you have to go to every single think tank website and pull that content.

306
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,620
That's not that isn't it's not very helpful.

307
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:28,650
So what I can do here is, let's say browse content and I'm going to do a search specifically looking at Cox's Bazar.

308
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:36,750
So I'm doing a lot of focus on Bengal, Bangladesh and Cox's Bazar today, particularly because that's where Dr. Rigo is right now.

309
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:43,050
And we have such a slow connection. It seems that everyone is back on campus.

310
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:47,100
Okay, so here I'm going to do a search on Cox's Bazar.

311
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:56,850
And maternal health. Because I want to see if I can find some of those reports on.

312
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:04,680
Information that's relevant to that. So here's something from the Institute of Development Studies.

313
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:08,910
So everything you're getting an Overton or quite a lot of it is free content.

314
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:19,800
The only issue is getting to it, right? So here's an article about access to female contraceptive by Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.

315
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:27,930
And of course, the majority of Cox's Bazar is made up of people who are Rohingya refugees, or many of them.

316
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:34,940
So if I go to any one of these sources, I can then see a little more about this paper.

317
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:40,829
I can, of course, download the report, take a look at it and say, okay, now, yes,

318
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:45,660
I can certainly use this for my research and the reasons why it would be helpful to me.

319
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:51,570
So this is actually a report and data on it and there's also data collection.

320
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:56,310
Thinking about your research from that point of view is really, really relevant.

321
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,300
And another thing you can do with this site, I want to go back.

322
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:09,450
Is a really cool thing because you just it is of course, there's different ways to filter.

323
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:18,210
So I can filter by organizations. I only want to look at inter international governmental organizations or think tanks.

324
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:24,000
So you can see different types of organizations. They're different publication types.

325
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:37,890
So I can look at that. Another thing I can look at in addition to years and all of that is they have a beta version and I can limit to specific SDGs.

326
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:42,840
So I want to see everything on Cox's Bazar and maternal health.

327
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:48,570
And let's say that I want very specifically to have something to do with issues of gender equality.

328
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:55,650
So by clicking on that filter, I'm now pulling those seven that's got the database over ten.

329
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:04,260
How I'm talks about that particular point as the filter being SDG five for gender equality.

330
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:11,690
So I thought that was really kind of a cool beta feature they have and I wanted to make sure that I share that with you.

331
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:17,960
And then of course, I just have that on your on a screenshot that that you can access.

332
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,730
Policy comment is another source and I'm just going to go use the screenshot for this if you guys don't mind, just to save time.

333
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:31,920
But the link is right here and it's on this on your slide so you can see that.

334
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:37,470
So here I did something bad. I know that Dr. Rigo is investigating in Cox's Bazar.

335
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:41,160
Is a vaccine. Has hesitancy among refugee populations.

336
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:47,910
So what I've done here is I have the phrase vaccine hesitancy in quotations and refugee.

337
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:53,160
Now, I could do an advanced search of this, but I'm just going to do a general search.

338
00:36:54,270 --> 00:37:02,640
And when I pull up and there's also a link here, if you want to go right into the content, it is a really interesting paper.

339
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:13,390
I believe it is a report on from IP on countering COVID 19 vaccine hesitancy.

340
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:22,800
So it's and it's in. It's in partnership or in collaboration with a webinar that that this organization did.

341
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:33,660
I can also take a look at Mercy Corps, another organization that we have here on overcoming trust deficit when it comes to vaccination issues.

342
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:43,160
And when I clicked on that record and then clicked on the material, I'm now looking at the actual report that got there.

343
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:49,980
This is a policy brief on community engagement for effective COVID 19 vaccination.

344
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:57,149
So the point here is that we get to look at different sources that are beyond the scholarly

345
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:02,610
literature but are still valuable to public health and valuable to global health.

346
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:09,569
And then also for policy comments, if I went to the advanced search feature, this is what I would see.

347
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:18,120
I could see I can win by different publication types and particularly you might want to you want to contact.

348
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,670
And you can see that down here published in specific countries A to Z.

349
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:29,880
So not published about if you want published about, don't use any of those.

350
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:35,490
But if you want content that was published in the Cameroon, so let's say maybe the government of Cameroon.

351
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,540
You can go ahead and limit to that content if there's not going to be too much from the Cameroon.

352
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,650
But you can see the different articles by by filtering that.

353
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,710
I'm not going to go too much through.

354
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:59,190
I'm child can be international affairs online just giving you a screenshot of what you would see here you can see featured content.

355
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:07,769
So EU toolbox for migrant workers or the LGBT community some COVID 19 resources.

356
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:14,460
That looks like a really interesting research paper. What we can see is the composite content type.

357
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:18,450
So you can limit by political geography, by topic.

358
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,040
You can do a search. But I do encourage you to take a look at this.

359
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:27,839
Now, of course, there's no reason why you can't Google any of any of the reports out there,

360
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:35,610
but it's going to be really extensive and challenging to even do a Google Scholar search for all that great literature.

361
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:40,380
So using some of these tools could be very impactful and useful.

362
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:50,010
And also, by the way, Chao has an Atlas feature within it from The Economist, which I think most many of you know,

363
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:59,520
to be a major journal or serial on issues of on on political issues as well internationally.

364
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:08,650
Any questions about great literature. We're good.

365
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:17,180
Okay. Thank you. So if you do have questions, don't hesitate to put them in the chat or just let me know.

366
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:26,030
Let's go ahead and go on to the next section here, which we're going to do will bring a lot of our focus today on is data sources.

367
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:39,430
And we're going to be looking at an exploration of statistics and just the statistical sources, but then also data visualization and mapping tools.

368
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:51,420
And more and more, there's less differentiation between just a general global data source and and a data visualization tool,

369
00:40:51,430 --> 00:41:00,339
because more and more data sources have some aspect of data visualization integrated within them,

370
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:07,420
like a map, interactive data, infographics, something to that effect.

371
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:16,320
But we're going to look at some of those. And by the way, this is one of my favorite quotes is data will talk if you're willing to listen to it.

372
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:24,130
So I thought that was a really cool one. I selected the four that I thought we would go through.

373
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:31,600
And before actually going through the content, this is where our screens, our slides actually start to differ.

374
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:38,440
I have this for you. So you just thought you could get to sit there right now?

375
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:45,730
Okay. What I'd like to do is throw you in without teaching you how to swim and use World Bank open data.

376
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,569
And please don't Google this. Just please don't. Google says.

377
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:56,770
But what is the estimated 2020 infant mortality rate for Haiti using World Bank open data.

378
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:03,310
So you can click here. You can use that link. If you click on quiz, that's going to take you to the Google Quiz.

379
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:10,110
And so I don't know the answer there, but I'm going to ask you to take a quick, quick look,

380
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:15,310
and I'm going to give you a couple of 3 minutes, which is like totally so unfair.

381
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:20,290
But that's all the time I'm going to give you because because I want to make sure we can move on.

382
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,420
You don't get it done. Don't worry. It's just a it's just about kind of throwing yourself into the tool.

383
00:42:46,960 --> 00:43:03,990
We have one response. Yeah.

384
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:49,160
I also can't tell who you are, so don't worry. Oh it seems like there was some trouble Jonathan, with getting to the, the slides with the link.

385
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:01,510
Did I lock it down. I think people are able to access that thing now where you just re sharing it in case anyone missed it earlier.

386
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:35,970
Yeah. Thank you. Give you just a minute more and then we'll move on.

387
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:48,780
I like using Google quizzes because if using if you zoom close, once you close do you don't have it anymore.

388
00:44:49,040 --> 00:45:05,029
You can't practice or do anything with that. Yeah.

389
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:08,840
I think we're getting close to having almost everyone.

390
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:17,820
What's going on with. Let's go ahead and see how we're doing.

391
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:24,460
We have many of us have gotten it right.

392
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:28,030
Most of us have. And those of us who have it, don't even worry about it.

393
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:33,509
That's. Okay.

394
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:40,260
So let's go ahead and take a look at these slides. I'm going to go ahead and go to World Bank, open data.

395
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:50,130
I would do a live look at this. So World Bank Open Theater is one of my absolute favorite sources because very often it's like, where do I start?

396
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:54,330
This is one of those good sources to start with.

397
00:45:55,560 --> 00:46:03,000
It includes it includes several different databases and in and within it,

398
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:09,330
including the world development indicators, which makes up a large portion of the thousands of indicators in here.

399
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:14,850
And it's exactly what it says to that is free and open access to global development data.

400
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:22,770
So I can search by indicators and I want to click here before I go any further so you can see all of the indicators here.

401
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:28,020
If I click on all indicators, you're going to see a lot of information here.

402
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,910
It's nice to see the information organized.

403
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:41,310
You can see that on the right side of the screen. So environment, external debt, gender, health, poverty, social development.

404
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:47,180
So many parts of the SDGs. They all sort of featured an indicator.

405
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:59,040
It's nice that you can be that you're able to search them. Something else that you can do with World Bank open data is you can look at micro data.

406
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:03,360
This means surveys conducted within the country itself.

407
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:09,420
And I'm not going to focus on that. I just want to make sure that you see where some of the sources are.

408
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:16,560
There's also a data catalog that allows you to look at the actual databases that make up the information here.

409
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:24,160
So that being said, when I want to find something here, I'm going to start typing in infant mortality.

410
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:31,810
And as I start typing, some of you may have come across, you can actually click on what you want.

411
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:38,230
So if you slowly type out, it is possible that the indicator you want pops up.

412
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:45,310
And yeah, it's actually going to be the information I need, but it's also going to create a data visualization.

413
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,820
So this is a line graph over time for the world.

414
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:52,270
I don't want to see the world right now. I want to see Haiti.

415
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:57,260
So I'm slowly going to type Haiti. And it comes up.

416
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:06,330
So I'm going to choose Haiti. And then the next part of the question was, okay, well, first of all, what is what is the and the answer?

417
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:11,750
And I can see here that it's for 2020, it's 47.

418
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,620
So the infant mortality rate is 47. What does that mean?

419
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:21,379
It's really important when you're using a source nom to be able to get to the

420
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:27,590
methodology of the data collection and to understand what the what it actually means.

421
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:35,290
So the definition of this is right here. So infant mortality rate is infant mortality rate.

422
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:44,960
The infant mortality rate is the number of infants dying before reaching the age of one per 1000 live births in a given year.

423
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:53,329
Now, if I want to see how this data was collected, I can go to the original source of the data, which is child mortality,

424
00:48:53,330 --> 00:49:02,630
dawg, which is and I can see that it's a good source because of the organizations that that is coming from.

425
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:10,340
Now, what I can now do is I want to compare it right and when I first want to look at other countries.

426
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:14,820
But before I do that, I'm going to kind of change this here.

427
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:23,150
I want to change the change the scale to, let's say, 1990 to 2020.

428
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:32,809
Let's do it. Okay. So something strange here, right?

429
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:36,050
There's a there's a there's an outlier, right?

430
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:41,570
And we see that immediately. What what do you think happened in 2010?

431
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:46,530
Do you recall? Do we have an answer?

432
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,330
Earthquake. Yes, Christopher, you were absolutely right there.

433
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:57,660
Was that a major earthquake in Haiti in 2010?

434
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:02,290
And unfortunately, we can see some of the results of that.

435
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,650
So when you have outliers like that,

436
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:14,200
you want to start to investigate the primary literature or you want to investigate further data sources and find out what the why of it,

437
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,770
because that is something intriguing and something to follow up on.

438
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,430
If I scroll further down, what I see is not only Haiti, but I see other countries.

439
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:36,250
Right. And what I see right beside them on the right side are some of these some of the the curves for infant mortality.

440
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:40,510
And the ones that are a little strange are the ones I like to investigate.

441
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:45,010
Botswana You see how that curve is a little bit go up and down.

442
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,820
I want to investigate why you can see that.

443
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:56,620
And for the most part, I'm happy to report that infant mortality mortality rate is going down in those countries.

444
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:04,150
So that's good. But this this indicator doesn't mean anything unless we put it into some kind of context.

445
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:09,400
I understand that, you know, we're looking at, you know, what really matters is the geography.

446
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:18,850
Is it income? I understand. Or this great conversation about what it means to organize and then how words matter.

447
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:24,550
But let's take a look at at least regionally. Let's look at Latin America and the Caribbean.

448
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,590
So very slowly typed in Latin, and I picked up Latin America and the Caribbean.

449
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:35,770
And so I see in comparison to the entire region.

450
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,430
Where does the country of Haiti stand?

451
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:52,440
Then if I want to take a look at the world globally, I can see where the world is, where Latin America is, and where Haiti is.

452
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:57,230
Then I want to see regionally. I want to see countries within region.

453
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:02,630
So here I can choose. Also show and I can choose same region.

454
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:07,380
Do you see where it has these little do you see the gray lines?

455
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:17,380
So if you highlight over them zero, I can see Guatemala, I can see the Bahamas, and I can see the numbers for various countries now.

456
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:28,770
And those are all black countries. And what I do see, unfortunately, is that Haiti, the the infant mortality rate is higher than all of them.

457
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:32,410
But at least it gives me that information.

458
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:45,550
The night beside it, it says, Hey, if that's a metric you're interested in, maybe you're interested in survival of age to age 65 for females or males.

459
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:51,010
Contraceptive prevalence, birth rate. So it's giving me others I might want to investigate.

460
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:59,850
There's a lot to this particular source. I just want you to be aware of it and make use of it effectively.

461
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:05,760
So going into the various sections there can be very effective when you look at that.

462
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:10,440
Also, the fact that I can I can go right into the story of the original source material.

463
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:17,610
Any questions about that? And these are just screenshots.

464
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:22,260
Again, you will get these after class. I know. I know you do want to make notes,

465
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:32,030
but I just want to get I want to make sure that you do know that I'm going to start to do some demoing as we go through just to save time.

466
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:37,650
Guys, I still encourage you to take a look and look at all of these particular sources.

467
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,110
Is that okay with you? Thank you.

468
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:50,830
So here, what I'm going to do is let's look at, for instance, the W.H.O. Global Health Observatory data.

469
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:58,940
This is a major source. We all know the W.H.O. data is going to be major, but how do we access it?

470
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:05,020
How do we get to it? And in this case, I'm asking about the TB profile for tuberculosis.

471
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:10,570
Tuberculosis to a TB profile for Bangladesh in 2020.

472
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,890
Let's go ahead and take a look about looking for that information.

473
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:24,370
And I actually am going to use the screenshots just again to save time, because there's so much that I really want to share with you.

474
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:30,969
So in this case, I'm going to this is what it looks like, and it's exactly what it is.

475
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:40,320
Explore a world of health data. As I scroll down, I can see all the various areas that I might want to investigate.

476
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:45,810
So, yes, of course I can do a data search, I can do a country search.

477
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:49,560
Look at the thousands of indicators that are in here.

478
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:57,510
I can look at universal health care or health emergencies, or I might want to look at one of these particular areas.

479
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:02,459
And in this case, that is exactly true. So but I couldn't find it.

480
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:10,620
So I just typed it up here. I started typing to Bird and as I was doing that, the little tile for tuberculosis came up.

481
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:16,330
And then it also said, hey, you know, here are some featured for portals, the mortality database.

482
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:26,280
That's going to be a major one. I can't stop saying how many things that are you're going to find on the W.H.O. site for data and data visualization.

483
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,850
So we do click on the link for tuberculosis.

484
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:39,840
There are different ways for us to access this data. We can download all of the TB data and then go and then look specifically at Bangladesh.

485
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:44,760
We can look at the country profiles. So that's what I did here.

486
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,390
Or I could have looked at one of these tiles here as well.

487
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:58,590
I went into the country profiles just because I wanted to just show you these infographics that you can use in presentations and papers as well.

488
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:05,760
So you see there's interactive visualizations, but I'm going to look at this infographic here that I've circled.

489
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,900
And it gives me exactly what I wanted to find.

490
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:20,140
So at the very top it says estimation of TB burden for 2020 and the rate is 218 per 100,000.

491
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:28,240
I can scroll further down and see more of this summary of this data and information to use in the future.

492
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:33,640
I'm sorry. This is not very interactive, but I think I miss.

493
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:39,730
I spent a lot of time going through content and I guess, as I said, I'm getting excited about sharing with you.

494
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:45,340
So I think I'm going to have to do some screenshots, but I have prepared for that.

495
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:49,630
So no worries. But I do want you to go through and try this yourself.

496
00:56:51,580 --> 00:57:00,070
So I'm also going to talk to you about I know that you're going to be doing a lot of work and you're doing you have a lecture on refugee issues.

497
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:12,090
So I wanted you to see one of the more specialty data sources, and this is one that I investigate quite a lot for for the data that's available here,

498
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,710
and one that's really close to me as well because of my,

499
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:25,090
my family history of of of having refugee status in my family and, and the experiences that my family has had.

500
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:35,320
So I'm looking at this and thinking about my father's experience as someone who was internally displaced in Kashmir, in northern India.

501
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:46,090
So many years ago, I wanted to know about the number of people who were internally displaced in the Democratic Republic of Congo at the end of 2021.

502
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:51,520
So this is brand new data from 2021. It just it just recently came out.

503
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:58,660
So if I look at this, the first thing I come to is the key indicators page.

504
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:11,110
And yes, it's true. At the end of 2021, there was 89.3 million forcibly displaced people worldwide.

505
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:16,240
That number changed around June to become around 100 million.

506
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:25,630
It's a it's a really challenging number to even take in the idea that there were 100 million forcibly displaced people.

507
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:31,510
So I thought by the end by the middle of 2022.

508
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:39,190
But again, to see that there is different types of internal displacement.

509
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:45,430
So there's asylum seekers, refugees, IDPs, the let's go ahead to the data finder.

510
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:49,510
And from here we can see there's a data visualization tool.

511
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:53,320
There's a way for us to investigate different populations.

512
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:59,320
We can see all of them right here or we can look at asylum applicants.

513
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:04,180
This is basically decision solutions IDPs.

514
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:11,340
So what I did is I'm just going to choose go ahead and choose the IDPs, internally displaced.

515
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:16,500
Click next. And then I choose a year range.

516
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:25,120
A custom selection for 2021, and I chose the country of origin, not the country of asylum,

517
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,870
but the country of origin to be the Democratic Republic of Congo.

518
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:35,170
I found the number to be 5.33 or 5.34 million.

519
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:45,400
So those are the dots. At the end of 2021, there were 5.34 million internally displaced people in the DRC.

520
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:52,270
So we can look at that in a bar chart. We can copy this data and we can share it in many different ways.

521
00:59:55,030 --> 01:00:00,790
So you have something about Imperium, about doing some independent exploration, and I'm going to encourage you to do this.

522
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:04,690
So a lot of my homework is coming after class, not before.

523
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:13,570
But I also hope that you continuously use these sources as you go through your assignments and as you prepare and do your readings as well.

524
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:17,380
Every class. So the DHS.

525
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:24,390
Now, you were you may all have been exposed to demographic health survey in other classes.

526
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,720
Is that true? Show me. Show of hands or anyone who's used it before.

527
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:37,340
Christian. You've used it before, right? So can you tell us a little bit about how you used it?

528
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:45,650
Well, I've been I've actually used it, but I've been exposed to ship of war and Liberia.

529
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:49,430
So. Oh, you've you've been to Liberia, you said.

530
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:56,450
Yes, I've been I've been a sponsor before and it's been a while since I've actually use it word but.

531
01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:01,750
Yeah. So I've been exposed to it more so than actually used it myself.

532
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:05,470
Okay. But you are aware of. Aware of it.

533
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:11,110
So in this case, I decided to look at unmet need for family planning.

534
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:14,800
And this was going to be a question for you to independently explore anyway.

535
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:19,900
So I'm not actually going to go into this. I do want you to explore the information.

536
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:26,920
I do have the screenshots for you, and I will share those in this lecture when I do post that.

537
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:32,410
But I would encourage you to take a look at that and just get some practice in on that.

538
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:40,600
So I'm not going to follow up on it. I am going to just give you a quick look at the demographic health survey so you get an idea of what it is.

539
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:48,670
It is part of USAID, and these are surveys or micro data that is that is collected within countries,

540
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:51,969
and they're collected at different time, different year.

541
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:59,799
So it's not really you can't really compare Liberia to Ghana unless they're DHS was done in the same year.

542
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:07,240
And very often that's not the case because the governments of the ministries of health in those countries conduct the surveys.

543
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:19,450
So you can see this is about data on population health, HIV and nutrition from various countries, various subject counts, character characterizations.

544
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:24,790
And I will share a screenshot of that information of get information with you.

545
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:37,740
So this is a piece that I find very, very interesting and and that I do a great deal of work on is the data visualization piece.

546
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:45,070
And I'm going to start with this quote. The only unfortunate thing about this quote is, is that it came from stats textbook.

547
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,620
Which never was my favorite.

548
01:02:48,650 --> 01:02:57,350
But other than that, the food itself is the greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.

549
01:02:58,010 --> 01:03:08,110
And so thinking about a data visualization and what we can create ourselves to use in our papers, in our presentations, can be such a marvelous tool.

550
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:12,170
So we just did that right now with World Bank open data,

551
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:20,990
because that's the only way that the data source actually presents the information in that case is through a data visualization.

552
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:25,100
I'm going to do a demo of GBD compared.

553
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:28,400
I want to tell you a bit about that as I start working on it as well.

554
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:39,860
And we may not be able to get to the World Health Organization's maternal child, adolescent health and Aging data portal.

555
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:47,330
But I did want to point it out among the several sources that we do have on the global health going.

556
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:55,570
So let's get started with the DVD. And DVD stands for A Global Burden of Disease,

557
01:03:56,380 --> 01:04:07,150
and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation has a study on the global burden of disease from 1990 to the present.

558
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:10,840
So there's been an annual JGB since that time.

559
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:16,420
And what it measures is DALYs disability adjusted life years.

560
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:24,310
So it also looks at other measures, but basically it's looking at how long people live.

561
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:34,570
It's looking at what causes disease, what are risk factors and exactly what are some chronic issues,

562
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:41,000
and how do people either live with that or how do they then what is the burden in in

563
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:47,910
a region or an area to look at this for loss of life or for living with disease?

564
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:55,629
So in this case, I'm not sure if you've actually started to look at disability adjusted life years yet.

565
01:04:55,630 --> 01:05:02,530
I know that you just started this is this is a metric that you will be looking at quite a lot.

566
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:13,840
And I'm going to do what I've done here is I'm going to do a comparison of DALYs among men aged 50 to 49 in Brazil and the United States.

567
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:18,250
The first thing I'm going to do is go to the Global Burden of Disease Project.

568
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:26,770
So here it allows me to see different interactive data visuals and different data sources.

569
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:32,560
In this case, I'm going to the flagship Global Burden of Disease database.

570
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:39,630
Data visualization on. Called LGBT compare.

571
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:45,620
And the data came out in October 2020, but it's the most recent data.

572
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:49,610
And before I do go on with that, I do want to show you this.

573
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,640
This is very significant. This is the GDP main page.

574
01:05:54,650 --> 01:06:01,700
And what it says here, the majority of the research that's done on the GDP does get published in The Lancet.

575
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:15,280
And here it says latest global disease estimates reveal perfect storm of rising chronic disease and public health failures fueling COVID 19 pandemic.

576
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:26,890
This is with the realization that this data that came out in October 2020, it was collected until the end of 2019.

577
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:34,179
So basically, it is literally a snapshot just before the COVID 19 pandemic.

578
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:43,750
And what it shows us is the significance for how chronic disease is increasing in the world and also shows us the social inequalities of regions.

579
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:48,970
And let's actually go take a look at that and what we mean by that.

580
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:57,580
So I'm going to go back into the GB, the compare. I'm going to enter the in the data visualization.

581
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:06,909
So we could be doing an entire week's worth of classes on the global burden of disease data and the data visualizations.

582
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:10,170
We're not doing that, of course, here.

583
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:15,970
What we do see is this is the world. And this is called a tree map.

584
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:23,920
Everything that is in blue, in the blue square is chronic illness, chronic disease, non communicable disease.

585
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:31,600
Everything that it's a hot color is so it's orange or pink or red.

586
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:35,650
This is maternal, neonatal or nutritional disorders.

587
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:44,460
Everything in green is injury, violence, conflict, road, injury, falls, burns, all of that.

588
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:55,190
So this is the world's global burden of disease for both sexes for 2019, the disability adjusted life years.

589
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:01,070
So anything that has a larger box means that.

590
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:05,020
It's a larger proportion of the population of the world.

591
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:17,350
It's a risky midcard disease. If I hover over it, it says that 7.19% of the total dailies, it's a little darker.

592
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:24,340
That means that it has had the annual percent change increase.

593
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:28,900
There's been an annual percent increase. That is that's significant.

594
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:36,250
So if it's lighter in color, you see that it's paper. It's actually the burden has alleviated somewhat.

595
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:44,410
But if it's darker, such as diabetes, you can see that there has been a 1.86% increase since the past year.

596
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:47,760
The past year that data is available for.

597
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,250
So this is global. But you can see I can do.

598
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:57,380
I can look at a lot of different countries and in some cases look at subnational data.

599
01:08:58,190 --> 01:09:04,400
So in this case, I'm going to change this to Brazil. I can look at Brazil or regions of Brazil.

600
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:09,350
Let's just go ahead and look at the country and notice how this block is going to change.

601
01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:18,870
So yes, the majority of it for this all ages, all the both sexes,

602
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:25,890
it's still chronic disease is the hottest is the most largest proportion of the burden of disease.

603
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:30,990
If I was to change this to age 50 to 49, what a change.

604
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:35,410
So now we have injury and crime increasing.

605
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:39,550
If I change it to male or female, let's change it to male.

606
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:46,190
We see injury, violence, road injury increasing a bit more.

607
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:51,490
I can compare this to other countries or globally.

608
01:09:52,150 --> 01:10:00,480
So I can do that by clicking on compare choosing a location or year or age or cause.

609
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:07,170
Let's go ahead and go by location. So now it's Brazil on top and bottom.

610
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:11,990
While we're going to change one of those, the bottom one, we're going to change to the United States.

611
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:20,620
I could look at different states, but I'm just going to do that. We can compare these because these are rates a ideally is a rate.

612
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:29,980
We're not comparing apples and oranges. We're comparing per 100,000 compared with another metric that's per 100,000.

613
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:33,270
So we're comparing rates, not numbers of deaths.

614
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:37,690
So or number of people with disabilities, for example.

615
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:43,750
So something significant we can see here is the United States.

616
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:55,060
Moore is chronic disease. Then in Brazil, there's more road injury and violence for males, 15 to 49 of that population.

617
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:59,350
What is going on here? What do you think?

618
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:07,360
Conjecture that might be? It's dark and it's big and it's drugs in the US.

619
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:18,730
Any ideas? Are we getting anything in the chat? Yeah, we had a couple of people say what I believe is the correct answer and the correct answer.

620
01:11:18,730 --> 01:11:25,990
Right. But again, when you get something like this, you need to go into the research, you need to go into the gray with the data,

621
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:35,320
and you need to go into the scholarly literature and say, okay, where is the information that allows me to see that it is the opioid epidemic?

622
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:39,550
So that's allowing me to conjecture. Christian, you have a cool question.

623
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:52,780
So it took me a second to unmute. Yeah, I think I put it in the chat a while back.

624
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:58,180
I was just wondering reviewing it is the GBD data.

625
01:11:59,050 --> 01:12:04,480
You said it was published in The Lancet. Well, actually, it's published right here.

626
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:15,880
But every year The Lancet makes it available in a forum like this with tables, and that is that no one wants like this.

627
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:20,260
This is like I could use this to, like, hold things down.

628
01:12:21,190 --> 01:12:28,720
So it is the articles that are published using the data are in The Lancet.

629
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:33,910
Yeah. And I was like, that was actually my misquote.

630
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:41,050
My question was actually just was it to increase is sort of increases to the mainstream,

631
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:47,890
sort of make it more appealing to people kind of because the science is a more prestigious journal.

632
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:55,680
So I guess more people would look at the data from the GBD and be like, Oh, you know, this isn't the GBD data.

633
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,270
This is actually the Lancet, you know, kind of thing.

634
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:04,210
Well, first of all, anything that comes from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation is is good stuff.

635
01:13:04,270 --> 01:13:07,900
Let's just put it way. It's from the University of Washington.

636
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:12,290
It's also affiliated with Gates Foundation and the Lab.

637
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:21,880
I'm not quite sure how the partnership with The Lancet happens, but if you do look at this, if you do look at the global burden of disease itself,

638
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:27,580
the main page here, if you want to look at publications, it takes you to that information.

639
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:34,570
If you want to look at the GB data as it's presented in The Lancet, this is what you'll see.

640
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:38,340
You'll see recent articles about it.

641
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:43,470
So here's an example article and thanks so much for these great questions.

642
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:55,660
Great questions, Christian. So this is an article based on that data from August of this year and the burden of cancer attributable to risk factors.

643
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:59,380
And this is the sister's systematic analysis of the GBD.

644
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:04,960
So looking at this, this is where we're getting that primary literature based on the data.

645
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:08,690
So these are data analysis. Does that help?

646
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:11,840
Looking at it from that perspective, yeah, absolutely.

647
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:20,719
Yeah. I think it helps a lot and understanding the relationship between the G, d, the ones that I'm not sure I would think that Lancet.

648
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:25,670
Yes. Is a source that we all know tend to be a good source.

649
01:14:25,970 --> 01:14:34,310
But the longer you're in the the global health environment, if you hear, i.e., Jamie and GB study,

650
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:38,870
you're all going to think the same thing about what's coming out of that organization.

651
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:47,210
Who we have on the guide, we do have a section on global burden of disease and you'll notice that I have the report.

652
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:55,400
There is a YouTube channel for the economy as well, and so I have a little bit of information on that.

653
01:14:55,700 --> 01:15:00,080
And then the various data visualizations that are available.

654
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:02,300
I'm not going to go through all of this,

655
01:15:02,690 --> 01:15:10,580
but you can see the different ways that you can calculate information as it relates to burden of disease around the world.

656
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:18,230
And there's also the YouTube playlist as well. So thank you so much for that.

657
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:21,500
It's a really good question. And.

658
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:28,010
Let's see. Let me go back here. And there's different ways we can present information.

659
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:38,720
So what if we wanted to look at the top, the top ten or ten, 13, top 13 ranks here, so we can see that as well.

660
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:44,629
We can also see these see it by different countries.

661
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:51,110
And let's just look at one country excuse me, one one of these, because there are the exact same ones.

662
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:58,370
But we can see we can add other countries, we can switch locations and we can see this is over time.

663
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:03,230
So data visualizations allow us to look at information in different ways.

664
01:16:03,590 --> 01:16:08,690
So again, I might not have looked at this information from Brazil or COP,

665
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:15,020
that huge drug piece from the United States, unless it was in a way for us to see it.

666
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:24,470
I can click share and I can copy this link and share it with you, which I have done on the slides I'm going to be sharing with you.

667
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:32,480
Another thing you can do is you can do a screenshot download and that will show you how that actually downloads.

668
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:40,290
Any second now, or another option is for me to go to the actual data.

669
01:16:40,290 --> 01:16:45,840
So instead of looking at these in this form, I can see the actual data itself.

670
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:49,740
And on the top right corner of GB results tool.

671
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:59,610
If I choose that, it's going to take me to the global burden of disease data, asking me if I want to sign in and get more information.

672
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:07,320
But this is actually going into the different the different pieces of information.

673
01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:16,350
So I could just remove a lot of this. What if I not only want the rate, I don't want all causes, I want a specific cause.

674
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:22,390
And this is not a data visualization. This is the actual data itself.

675
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:29,650
So what I was showing you, these tables that are published by The Lancet that are really small print and no one can read.

676
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:33,550
You can see those here if you don't want to do a data visualization.

677
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:40,010
There's a lot to unpack with the global burden of disease data,

678
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:49,040
but that's just getting you started like literally and again, just giving you an idea of what what we have here.

679
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:55,670
And again, I'm going to share these screenshots with you with the links as well, so you can see what we just went through.

680
01:17:58,930 --> 01:18:07,390
So something I know that's going to be interesting as we move forward more and more is food security.

681
01:18:07,870 --> 01:18:15,190
And it may be something that you're already investigating in this class or others sustainable food systems.

682
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:26,210
So when we think about that, we also have to think about a really great source the World Food Programs, Vulnerability Analysis and mapping source.

683
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:31,150
This was recently upgraded its new one. It's a new data visualization tool.

684
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:40,549
And what I can do is I can look at reports, hunger of COVID snapshots, government data visualization.

685
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:45,920
So these are all visualizations about, let's say, agriculture.

686
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:51,019
Something else I can do is I can go to something called hunger hub and see

687
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:56,330
where we are in food security issues around the world for different regions.

688
01:18:58,010 --> 01:19:03,350
And I can look at hazards or conflicts, rainfall, vegetation.

689
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:05,780
And we were just looking at Yemen.

690
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:22,010
And if I hover over it, it tells me that as of September 5th, that was yesterday, 56.76% of the population has insufficient food consumption.

691
01:19:23,710 --> 01:19:31,710
Now, if I want to look at the hunger map live, which I think is a great tool to look at, you go to the sections.

692
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:37,050
And then you click on Hunger Map Line. I've also given the link to you and your slides.

693
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:51,680
What I see here coming up are major areas of concern where there are issues of hunger or and you can highlight over them.

694
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:54,870
You can see some of them are because of hazards, flooding.

695
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:59,010
Great example of that, unfortunately, is Pakistan right now.

696
01:20:00,330 --> 01:20:04,380
Conflict, undernourishment, vegetation, rainfall.

697
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:07,950
I'm going to go and click on the link for Yemen.

698
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:17,580
When I do that, what happens is all of a sudden now I have this active data visualization that gives me regional information.

699
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:29,610
So if I want to look at the modern area of Yemen, I can highlight over that and see exactly where the insufficient food consumption is.

700
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:35,070
I can look at food security. These are infographics here that I can kind of play with.

701
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:41,130
What's really interesting about using data visualizations this way.

702
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:51,180
If you're making a presentation or teaching a group, you can literally just put this into your presentation and talk your way through it.

703
01:20:51,630 --> 01:21:01,020
So if I wanted to look at hazards, I can then look at hazards or rainfall or how how does how are things changing in that region?

704
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:09,150
Now, most specifically, we have a conflict, but right now I think they're updating the conflict information and therefore it's not on right now.

705
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:15,750
But we can see different issues. We can also look at macroeconomics.

706
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:25,830
And so 94% of the of the of Yemen is dependent on imports.

707
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:32,230
We can also look at a data analysis. So if I click on download today's report.

708
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:39,200
I got an infographic that then. Let me just let it go down.

709
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:48,080
So what this then shows me more insights into that data that we were just looking at.

710
01:21:50,590 --> 01:21:55,329
So then it goes into a little bit of an analysis of the actual data.

711
01:21:55,330 --> 01:22:04,270
And this is not a visualization that I can highlight and use, but it does allow me to do some level of analysis at the subnational level.

712
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:13,270
I was earlier today, I was looking at the not the Chittagong area of Bangladesh where Cox's Bazar is located.

713
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:17,020
Just because I was interested since Dr. me goes there.

714
01:22:19,450 --> 01:22:21,370
And again, I'm not going to go through the entire thing,

715
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:31,150
but you then see the trends and then you can use this for your reporting as well as you think about doing presentations,

716
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:36,730
using hunger map live to indicate food security and that connection into health

717
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:41,050
and health determinants can be quite interesting for different regions.

718
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:49,490
Any questions so far? No, I literally I'm throwing so much information at you.

719
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:53,660
That's why I'm saying my homework is coming after class.

720
01:22:53,660 --> 01:23:01,879
Not before, if that's if you understand what I need. So this is just taking us through those same screenshots.

721
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:06,020
Again, I don't want to make this overwhelming.

722
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:13,160
I know it is. I don't want to make it too overwhelming. I really do want to take you through and have you go through the content slowly.

723
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:21,580
So shall we just push through? I think we're almost done. And I just wanted to show you a couple of things.

724
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:25,930
And I don't think we will get around to the global news piece, but I'm okay with that.

725
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:33,220
I did want to show you this really interesting question, and I'm going to not have you do it, but I'm going to have you think about it.

726
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:43,120
Ask the G five is gender equality right? And part of that, one of the measures of that is seats held by women in national parliaments.

727
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:49,740
So that's one of the data points that is measured around the world for countries who are in the US.

728
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:54,160
DG Who did ratify the SDG and the United Nations.

729
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:59,380
And in this case I would actually take us through this piece.

730
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:10,150
But using this, the data portion of the Sustainable Development 2022 report, I went to the link called Data Explorer.

731
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:18,280
Now want to answer this question. So U.S. versus Rwanda, which one is doing better?

732
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:22,490
So I wanted the data explore. And this, of course, is the live link.

733
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:32,270
Right now, it's it's not because it's a screenshot. So what I can tell you and what a lot of people don't.

734
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:37,210
Might not think about is the fact that Rwanda.

735
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:45,740
Is 61 2.25% of the parliament's proportion are women.

736
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:50,270
The United States is below 25%.

737
01:24:50,810 --> 01:24:58,460
And I can also tell you that Rwanda has fulfilled its its target in this area.

738
01:24:58,730 --> 01:25:01,190
The United States has never done so.

739
01:25:01,670 --> 01:25:11,270
And the reason I particularly wanted to show this metric to you is because I want us to make sure we don't assume things about a country.

740
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:22,700
Rwanda has the you know, the fact that 60% of 61% of the population of the parliament is is women.

741
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:33,889
That is quite a feat. And I think a lot of the health outcomes and issues that Rwanda is leading in is I think it has a lot

742
01:25:33,890 --> 01:25:39,830
to do with the fact that it has this proportion of women who are interested in issues of health,

743
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:46,830
child care, disability, so issues that are close to those that women face every day.

744
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:53,270
So I think it's something to think about. It's also something that people don't really often think about,

745
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:59,150
is the fact that could Rwanda actually be excelling in a place for how the United States isn't?

746
01:25:59,450 --> 01:26:04,220
And so when we do think about our world and the way we do view it,

747
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:11,690
we have to we have to kind of make sure that we're looking through a lens that that's equitable

748
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:17,160
when it comes to thinking about different ways and how we can still do better in the U.S.

749
01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:23,260
Always. That's also backed by the truth about maternal mortality, for instance.

750
01:26:23,710 --> 01:26:26,110
I'm not going to go through this. It's 430.

751
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:35,200
But I do want you to be aware of the global health information, the news sources that we are going to investigate.

752
01:26:36,370 --> 01:26:43,029
And one of my favorite sources for that is an awareness piece where you can find

753
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:48,940
different articles about this is the most recent issue of Think Global Health.

754
01:26:50,290 --> 01:27:01,930
And I have included two pieces from Think Global Health that focused on aspects of one that focuses on the aspect of a colonial past.

755
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:06,030
It's an older article, but I do. I wanted to include it.

756
01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:16,120
So there's a link here for you to read it. And there's another one that looks at the idea of tackling the world's most vexing diseases through data.

757
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:22,689
So using beliefs and qualities and disease of burden and that type of data,

758
01:27:22,690 --> 01:27:28,930
those data points to assess, but also to tackle the world's health problems.

759
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:39,130
And because you're and you're most of your own epidemiology, this is something that I think may you may connect very well with.

760
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:46,210
So I'm not going to go through any more of the slides, but I am going to share them with you.

761
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:51,580
And thank you for a little more of your time.

762
01:27:52,630 --> 01:27:57,370
I am going to make sure that we connect and please State.

763
01:27:57,700 --> 01:28:01,000
Make sure that you reach out to me if you need anything.

764
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:11,000
So I'm going to stop there. Anything I can help anyone with, I'll stay on for a little while longer.

765
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:13,480
Thank you so.
