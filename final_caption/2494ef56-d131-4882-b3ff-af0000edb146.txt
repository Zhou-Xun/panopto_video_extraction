1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:33,550
Someone's trying to make something bizarre, especially by challenging the very public that we know, and I guess you know of it.

2
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,760
I don't know. Oh, yeah.

3
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:57,510
I mean, you know, you go online and that is what we try to do.

4
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:14,970
I just feel like this comes up with something really important.

5
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:26,700
I just feel like deflation means something.

6
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,240
I think that's what I'm going to do.

7
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:48,820
And then, you know, I got that one. I think it's because you wanna know something.

8
00:01:51,900 --> 00:02:00,860
And that's why I think just the fact that you want to cover it seems like it was obviously unnecessary to have this.

9
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:12,390
Hey, good morning. So before we get started today, I wanted to remind everybody that the last exam exam, too, is going to be on the 16th.

10
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,060
It will be delivered through campus. It will be proctored through the pharmacy.

11
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:26,920
So expect a Zoom invitation to come up so that I can answer questions and monitor the exam while you're taking a.

12
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:38,910
So that will be on the 16th. And does anybody have any questions about rates or issues with perusal at this point?

13
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:47,210
I know some of you have had some issues where you didn't report your grade, and I've been trying to resolve them on a case by case basis.

14
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,320
If you have an issue with a perusal, great. Just send me an email.

15
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,520
Okay. So today is the final day of class.

16
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:04,660
And we're going to talk about the last thing that was mentioned and the standards of care by the

17
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:13,060
American Diabetes Association for the Treatment and Management of Obesity and Type two diabetes,

18
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,340
which is bariatric surgery.

19
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:28,780
This is the most controversial and unsettling for some people to to tell you how this procedure works and what the outcomes are.

20
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,240
Yes. Just really quick example question, how much time are you going to have?

21
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,219
The same amount of time expect? Okay. Four questions.

22
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,500
The questions will be much less detail than the previous one because you've got a lot more material to cover.

23
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:54,070
So it's going to be the same exam, but there'll be less specific details on some of the things that we've talked about in regard to mechanism.

24
00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:00,310
All right. So so that like hour and a half, hour and a half, 90 minutes and then is it and then assuming just multiple choice.

25
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,520
Short answer. Yes, multiple choice in short answer.

26
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:10,150
Okay. I don't know if I'm going to include the matching questions or not. One for this year's to or not at this point.

27
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:16,139
All right. Thank you. Not sure if the perusal publishing is a certain date.

28
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,580
They are. Are you all caught up? Like I mentioned, I'll be up there. I think I like that.

29
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:28,470
I'll email. You think I had for the last few four that are due later this week, tonight and tomorrow.

30
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:36,780
I have not updated yet, of course. So what are the learning objectives for today?

31
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,630
Well, you're going to need to describe the needs criteria for bariatric surgery.

32
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:46,110
Not everybody can get this procedure. You have to qualify based on a number of things.

33
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:55,470
I want you to be able to describe the three most common. There are more than three, but there's three that have been done, um, more often.

34
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:02,429
Um, identify the mechanisms by which bariatric surgery produces weight loss.

35
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:14,700
And this goes back to the paper that you read the most up to date paper that I could find in terms of how bariatric surgery works was in the reading.

36
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:25,530
Darlene Sandoval's paper talked about exactly what the mechanisms are based on experience from human and animal studies,

37
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:35,340
and they're still trying to figure out how it works. Explain why dietary adjustments are needed after bariatric surgery.

38
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,520
So this is part of the follow up care for people who get biologic surgery.

39
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,849
And I'm going to mention this and all of the things that these individuals have to deal with after they

40
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:51,390
have the surgery and then describe the effects of bariatric surgery on health outcomes and mortality.

41
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:00,890
Okay. Yeah that some of these things that you might. So there's some respiratory infections going around.

42
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,370
I've got a mask on today and I'm happy with the rest of the time that I'm here.

43
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:12,140
So be careful. There's a lot of kids out sick with all kinds of different things that are not COVID related.

44
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,410
Okay. So you can't just if somebody has obesity, they can't just demand bariatric surgery.

45
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,900
There's a number of criteria that they have to meet before they get to surgery.

46
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,810
First they had to have a BMI of 40 and over.

47
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:39,200
I don't have values for you, for other populations in terms of what the criteria is for Asian populations, for example.

48
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:49,370
For some reason, that information is is difficult to find from the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery,

49
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:58,010
where I've gotten a lot of information from before BMI 35 or higher with co-morbidities.

50
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:06,470
So diabetes, cardiovascular disease, this would make this individual with a BMI of 35 and over a candidate for this procedure.

51
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,100
You have to be younger than 60 years of age. However,

52
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:31,280
they will provide that service for people who are over 60 on a case by case basis and probably a very now has become more and more controversial.

53
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,630
They have to demonstrate a lack of success with other weight loss programs,

54
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:47,569
such as lifestyle interventions that has been attempted and tried over a six month period of time or other types of interventions,

55
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:58,580
perhaps with medications that I mentioned the last time, the way that they have to demonstrate that those attempts or those procedures aren't working.

56
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:12,270
And the other thing that they have to demonstrate is that they don't have a certain there is.

57
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,370
They have there's certain, I should say, certain exclusion criteria.

58
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:27,020
So pregnancy, lactation, people who have issues with substance abuse, who have end stage, cardiovascular disease,

59
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,170
kind of psychiatric problems, and this would be under this umbrella would include eating disorders.

60
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:40,010
So people will be screened for eating disorders and will not be a candidate for this particular procedure,

61
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,550
although there are some people who squeak through the system somehow.

62
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:52,550
So these this is the criteria that is used to determine whether or not someone qualifies for this procedure.

63
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:08,570
And these documentation of this is critically important, especially for follow up care and insurance coverage.

64
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,690
So we'll talk about insurance coverage here in a bit.

65
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:17,210
But this these criteria have to be met in order for this this procedure to be covered by medical insurance.

66
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:24,560
Okay. How many of these are done each year and what types of procedures are done?

67
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:32,930
So there are some acronyms listed here in the column here all the way to your left.

68
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,540
And those are explained down here. Okay.

69
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:47,030
So the most common one is the gastric sleeve, the vertical sleeve gastrectomy.

70
00:09:47,840 --> 00:10:00,800
So between 2011 and now or the last bit of data that I can find of this, the 2020 to 2020, 150 to 120000 are done.

71
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,340
The numbers have gone down in 2020 because of COVID.

72
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:12,500
A lot of the procedures that were done for medical serve, in medical services, for surgical, all different kinds of surgeries.

73
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,850
The numbers have gone down dramatically for everything.

74
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,020
And bariatric surgery is one of them.

75
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:31,490
The other thing that I want you to notice is the next most common procedures that ruined why gastric bypass are why.

76
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,580
Okay. This was at one time the most common.

77
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,120
It's gone down because of the number of complications that people have after the surgery.

78
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:50,360
It's continuing to decline because of this. But in terms of producing loss of excess body weight, it is the most effective.

79
00:10:52,760 --> 00:11:04,850
Third on the list is the gastric banding procedure with the band, and it's gone way down in terms of the number of these that are performed each year.

80
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,400
It's not as effective. And I'll go over the details of that in a moment.

81
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,690
And then you have a bunch of other procedures you have.

82
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:23,690
And again, the acronyms are listed down here. You have the ability of pancreatic diversion and duodenal switch, which is not done very often.

83
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,700
You have another thing here that you should note is the number of revisions.

84
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:39,830
22,000. So if there's a complication with the surgery, you've got to go back in and correct the problem.

85
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:50,389
And this could be anything from when they do the gastric sleeve procedure that they don't get complete closure of

86
00:11:50,390 --> 00:12:00,050
their wound or there's associated with that some kind of complication that has to be corrected surgically 22,000,

87
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:07,640
20, 20 corrective surgeries that had to be done to fix whatever was wrong with the original surgery.

88
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:21,379
And that's a huge number. Then you have single and that's the most this duodenum bypass sleeve gastrectomy.

89
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:26,680
So that's kind of instead of having the pouch with the route like gastric bypass,

90
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:31,310
they have a sleeve and I'll show you what the sleeve looks like here in a minute.

91
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,000
And then there are some other procedures that aren't done very often.

92
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:42,200
And you also have this one thing that's mentioned at the very end.

93
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:51,380
So the balloon procedure is essentially putting one in somebody's stomach and expanding it.

94
00:12:52,220 --> 00:13:00,160
So you have a limited area within the stomach now that the food can occupy.

95
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:06,440
And this produces some satiety. It's not used as often.

96
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:14,320
It's it's declining in numbers. And its success rates in terms of producing weight loss are very disappointing.

97
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,590
So this is why you don't see very many of these types of surgeries performed.

98
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,740
Those are the most common. How do you pay for this?

99
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,160
Well, let's consider the cost.

100
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:38,970
The cost of the surgery depends on a lot of things, the length of stay, follow up care.

101
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:44,150
But in general, the cost as a cost estimate is 20 to $25000.

102
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:52,830
And this doesn't include all of the things that can happen after you have the surgery.

103
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,430
So if somebody loses a lot of excess body weight, they will have excess skin.

104
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,410
And this will require another surgical procedure in order to remove the skin.

105
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:12,240
And oftentimes, this is not included in the reimbursement for the patient who has had this surgery.

106
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:26,870
So sometimes the insurance company will cover all of it or only a portion of it, and it has to be recommended by the physician.

107
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,150
And again, in order for the insurance company to cover it,

108
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:38,790
you have to document all of the information required that fulfills the NIH criteria for this surgery.

109
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:45,810
So this is how people pay for this.

110
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:58,050
This is expensive. It is problematic in a way that not everyone can access the service.

111
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:04,200
But you think there are people going to other countries that have these procedures.

112
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,620
So some people are going to Mexico to have these procedures done at a much lower cost.

113
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:28,970
Okay. So one question I wanted to pose to you is why would an insurance company pay for this and not pay for medication?

114
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,480
Talked about medication used for weight loss. Why would they pay for this and not medication?

115
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:44,560
I guess it's going to take medication for a longer period of time to regulate the dosage.

116
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,270
Now, that's at 1200 dollars a month.

117
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:57,729
Over the long haul, it would be more expensive. And as these drugs go off patent, that may no longer be the case.

118
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:09,570
So through time is going to be going off patents and some of the type SEMAGLUTIDE maybe going off package within the next five years or so.

119
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:17,830
So that may change things. So when you talked about you said the tide and its effects,

120
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,970
that seemed to be very impressive when that one particular clinical trial effect can be repeated.

121
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:30,160
You know, you're going to see a lot more of that drug being prescribed rather than this particular procedure,

122
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:36,580
these procedures being done in the future. Yeah.

123
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:42,319
It's also interesting, though, with the amount of people that need like revisions are like, oh, that 2000.

124
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,430
Yeah, that cost, you know, does it always add up? And that has to be paid for.

125
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:54,830
Out of pocket. Of, out of pocket. Yes. That the insurance company will pay for the initial cost, but not always for the revision that.

126
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:05,130
So the one of the first types of procedures that was done to present something that is reversible

127
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:11,070
and has less complications associated with other types of surgery was this lap band procedure?

128
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:19,110
And you are essentially reducing this the size of the stomach by creating a small pouch.

129
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,550
And the pouch is about the size of a golf ball. So that's what's created here.

130
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:34,800
So here you have an adjustable band that's placed at the top of the stomach and you put this in surgically.

131
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:48,330
It's wrapped around the top of the stomach. And fluid is pumped into that cuff that surrounds that band and it restricts the size of the stomach.

132
00:17:50,190 --> 00:18:00,720
And this particular procedure is reversible. It has been shown to produce weight loss, but fewer and fewer places.

133
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:09,070
Surgical. Hospitals will perform this procedure anymore.

134
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,960
They used to perform this procedure at the University of Michigan bariatric clinic, but no longer.

135
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:20,470
And that's because of 50% of the people who had the surgery required for addiction.

136
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,809
And it was something people could manipulate.

137
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:32,860
In other words, they could somehow reduce the restriction, you know, by letting some of the selling out.

138
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:44,110
If you consumed a certain amount of food or water or whatever it is that you can actually expand the band a little bit, that was a problem.

139
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:51,340
But most importantly, the weight loss associated with this procedure was disappointing.

140
00:18:53,050 --> 00:19:00,460
It was attractive in that it's reversible, but it wasn't. It was very successful in terms of its long term effects.

141
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:17,200
So the procedure that is most effective in terms of producing long term weight loss is this ruined wide gastric bypass.

142
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:33,700
And in this particular procedure, they again could use any small pouch of the stomach and they surgically removed most of the stomach.

143
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,689
And you have this gastric remnant. So this can be done.

144
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,980
All of these procedures most of these procedures are done. Nearly all of them are done laparoscopically.

145
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:51,400
And so surgeons have this device that can cut and staple the stomach to produce this pouch.

146
00:19:52,930 --> 00:20:01,209
The next thing that's done is they take a portion of the small intestine that's usually all the way down to the Juno ship,

147
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:12,010
the duodenum, and they attach it to this pouch and create this short segment of the small intestine.

148
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:17,670
But they leave this in for a number of reasons.

149
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:24,669
You've got hormones that are secreted and produced by this portion of the stomach that this is actually reattached,

150
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:30,350
that unanimous reattached, that duodenum is reattached to the gentleman, a lower point.

151
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:38,500
And so you have restriction and a decline or imbalance absorptions here, here.

152
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:44,470
So you have less room in your stomach now to hold the food.

153
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:51,730
So you have to subsequently consume smaller portions afterwards and you don't absorb

154
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:56,500
as much nutrients after the procedure is done due to the removal of the drop.

155
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:08,080
And there are a number of hormonal changes that occur that include things that increase satiety in the paper mentioned.

156
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:17,500
And I'm going to talk about this a little bit more detail on why why hormones that produce satiety after having this procedure,

157
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:26,620
not so that it's most successful in terms of long term weight loss.

158
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:36,190
But most recently in the past several years now the sleeve gastrectomy is the most common procedure that's performed.

159
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:44,320
It's again performed laparoscopically where they go in and they remove about 85% of the

160
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,880
stomach and they staple the stomach and go to this segment of the stomach together.

161
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,620
So you have a tube instead of a pouch for a stomach.

162
00:21:54,990 --> 00:22:04,150
And this provides that restriction, but nothing is done in this particular procedure to the small intestine remains intact.

163
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,759
So with this particular surgery, you have weight loss,

164
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:15,490
but you don't have nearly the amount of complications associated with this particular procedure.

165
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,760
Yeah. Abby, from the previous segment, the gastric remnant,

166
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:28,900
is there a certain amount of time over the course of time that the gastric remnant eventually stop producing or secreting enzymes?

167
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:37,060
Just that I'm aware of and I'm aware there have been studies that have followed our patients for over 25 years, and I have not come across that.

168
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:50,969
So with this particular procedure, there are fewer dietary restrictions after the surgery and there are many more.

169
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,370
And I'll mention these as we go through this talk.

170
00:22:54,090 --> 00:23:01,889
And the weight loss, the excess weight loss in response to this surgery is approach is what you would see in the ruin,

171
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:06,660
like a gastric bypass, but it's not quite as effective in that regard.

172
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:15,780
So for somebody who is undergoing this surgery,

173
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:23,760
this is where they say they start out with a number of dietary adjustments to get ready for the procedure.

174
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:28,830
So this is by no means an easy way out.

175
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,410
This is very challenging for people to do this or to make this decision because

176
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:39,300
these are permanent changes that are made to their gastrointestinal system.

177
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:46,770
The first thing that they have to do and demonstrate that they're a good candidate for the procedure is to go on.

178
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:51,000
This full liquid died for a period of two weeks prior to the surgery.

179
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,590
There's a couple of reasons for that.

180
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:05,090
The first is to shrink the size of the liver, which is often and large because it has these individuals at BMI, 35 and 40 and over.

181
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:12,500
They have enlarged livers that are that are have a really high level of triglycerides during

182
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:19,040
this two week period where they're consuming fewer calories and they're on this liquid diet,

183
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:27,110
the size of the liver shrinks, making that procedure, the surgical procedure, a little bit easier to perform.

184
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:35,120
So after they have the surgery, they stay on this full size.

185
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:43,720
And I think it's about 1000 calories a day. The amount of protein in the diet is about 70 grams.

186
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:52,720
So it's this high level of protein and this liquid diet that produces us a significant level of satiety.

187
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:01,320
So after the first two weeks, they go on a purified diet.

188
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:08,400
The consistency of the food is kind of like the consistency of applesauce.

189
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:16,050
And then 68 weeks after the surgery, they start to reintroduce regular foods into their diet.

190
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:20,040
However, there are a number of restrictions that they have to adhere to,

191
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:27,030
where they're going to experience some sensation, some manifestations that have very negative impacts.

192
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:36,680
So no sweet small portion size, smaller bites and a number of restrictions in terms of the types of things that they can see.

193
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:51,580
So while somebody is going through these procedures, they have mental health services that are available to them.

194
00:25:53,170 --> 00:26:00,190
They will meet in groups or one on one sessions to talk about the procedure, to talk about what to expect afterwards and so on.

195
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:04,660
And having somebody to talk to with these adjustments that will occur,

196
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:12,940
having a group of people who are undergoing the same type of procedure is a really good way to support the mental health of these individuals.

197
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:19,540
There also, as I have said earlier,

198
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:34,150
lifestyle modification with changes in diet and exercise are the foundation for any of these pathways or lifestyle modification,

199
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,960
drug therapy or bariatric surgery that's still in place here.

200
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:45,970
So these individuals are encouraged and provided with services that would promote physical activity.

201
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:56,260
So you have somebody who is an exercise physiologist, perhaps provide them with an assessment,

202
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:05,440
their body composition plan for their fitness program throughout the time that they have had the procedure afterwards.

203
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:14,650
And there's a bariatric conditioning program that's specifically designed for people who were undergoing these procedures and follow up.

204
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:27,720
So in order to prevent micronutrient deficiencies, patients are prescribed vitamin and mineral supplements.

205
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,059
So this prevents deficiency.

206
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:42,430
So they're given a multivitamin and calcium and deficiencies that are particularly an issue with the blue and white gastric bypass are vitamin D,

207
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:49,870
vitamin B12 and iron. So these are provided after the surgery.

208
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:58,329
They're also given particularly with those who are getting the sleeve gastrectomy.

209
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,950
They're all getting this particular drug.

210
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:06,910
But what this does is it reduces the risk of gallstones, which becomes a problem with people after the surgery.

211
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:15,020
So with gastric bypass, you're reducing the size of the stomach.

212
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:19,340
Um, you may have issues with B12.

213
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,420
You have a smaller stomach pouch now.

214
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:32,990
And individuals are, Kiran, who have had the surgery, have given an acid blocker for the next three months after the surgery.

215
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,100
And this reduces the risk of ulcers and they occur after the surgery.

216
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:49,220
So these micronutrient deficiencies can be prevented with these supplements that are provided to these individuals after they've had the surgery.

217
00:28:50,240 --> 00:29:01,510
Is it would they have to be on like a high risk because acid blockers can often the absorption of nutrients potentially.

218
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:11,900
Yeah. So for the first three months or given the acid blockers in higher doses, perhaps, perhaps, I don't know exactly how, but you had a question.

219
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:16,010
I was just thinking, ah, it's like insurance cover is part of it.

220
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:21,920
Like acid blockers, supplementation like things are just starting to add up for me.

221
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:29,959
Yeah, I think I don't know exactly and discovered to my knowledge the supplements are not covered.

222
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,970
So you want to make sure that the patients can actually afford this part because it's for life.

223
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:36,740
Yeah.

224
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:48,230
Would you you know, if if patients have limited resources, would they be offered the surgery because of this follow up care can be very expensive.

225
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:55,700
That's a great question. It's a question I actually asked the 688 bariatric seminar that we had.

226
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,690
So I think it depends on the case.

227
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:09,799
For example, in Indian Health Service, I believe some of that may be covered by the purchase preferred care,

228
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:18,890
but that's a very specific type of agency and part of the population in general, I would assume.

229
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:27,920
So I've seen patients typically have a lot of these deficiencies and it shows like right away.

230
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,260
Right. So you need to fix. Yes.

231
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,210
And you need to. It's going to be a real problem.

232
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:49,550
Absolutely. So a number of dietary modifications are made after some people have this surgery.

233
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,480
So there's the liquid diet that I mentioned for the first two weeks.

234
00:30:54,890 --> 00:31:02,570
That diet has to be pureed for the 4 to 6 weeks after the surgery and then they start to transition to normal.

235
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:15,740
Food doesn't need to be period. So the diet has to be composed of protein rich source 70 grams per day.

236
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:27,740
This is really important in terms of producing some satiety and maintaining lean mass so that

237
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:32,930
mineral and vitamin supplements are continued for the duration for the rest of their lives.

238
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:46,400
And so with these dietary restrictions, there's also restrictions for medications first, which is what do you do when you feel bad?

239
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,910
Well, you take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

240
00:31:50,480 --> 00:32:00,500
Well, you can't take this drug. So you have to rely on something like acetaminophen.

241
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,309
It's still allowed and paracetamol might be allowed.

242
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:10,280
But in terms of Advil, those types of drugs can no longer take this.

243
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:19,010
And that's because of their effect on the ability to offer the acids within your stomach.

244
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:25,530
So there's a greater risk of ulcers and you have a smaller stomach pouch now.

245
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:32,630
Right. So patients that have had the surgery or this is a restriction, they're not going to take it anymore.

246
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:39,210
So did you did you mention the calories there with this compliant?

247
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:49,190
No, I did not. Okay. I was just wondering, because 70 grams per day isn't a particularly high level for which you, like most Americans, get like that.

248
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,900
Yeah. So that's the minimum. Okay. At least 70 grams per day.

249
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,620
Yeah. It's just not like. Right.

250
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:01,520
So it just increases from the minimum like 50 grams generally,

251
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:07,190
but like every so it's been done on a case by case basis in terms of the caloric intake.

252
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:13,160
Yeah. So after the surgery, that may be difficult to reach because of this baby that they reach.

253
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,579
So they need to spread it out. Yeah, right. We'll get to that in a minute here.

254
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,830
In terms of what happens, in terms of how they have to eat now.

255
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,720
So follow up evaluations are done. After they have the surgery.

256
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:35,270
They go in and they're evaluated to two weeks, two months, six months, a year.

257
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:40,010
And then they have annual appointments. And they look at their nutritional status.

258
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:52,130
They look at their weight loss. And so they're carefully monitored for any kind of complications from the surgery of changes to their lifestyle.

259
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,610
And again, mental health services are provided.

260
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:06,740
They are helped with their exercise and physical to what they can they expect in terms of weight loss.

261
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:17,930
Well, people who have gotten a ruined wide gastric bypass can expect a 50 to 70% reduction in excess weight loss.

262
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:27,470
So the excess weight loss refers to the excess weight that they would have based on a typical weight for somebody with their particular frame,

263
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:35,090
screen size with a sleeve gastrectomy would be a little bit less, about 65%.

264
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:44,480
And based on observational studies with people who have gotten the gastric banding procedure, it's about 40 to 60%.

265
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:55,100
So the weight comes off very quickly, 5 to £15 per week for the first 2 to 3 months.

266
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:01,340
And then after six months, it's about one or £2 a week.

267
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:09,050
And then there's a plateau during the first six months and many plateaus may occur throughout the first six months.

268
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:19,310
And then there's a 10 to £20 weight gain that happens before that, they reach their final weight stable.

269
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:34,280
So if someone follows the recommendations after they've had the procedure, they can maintain that weight loss for the rest of their lives.

270
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:39,230
If they don't follow that those recommendations, they can gain all the weight.

271
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:50,200
In terms of how many, how many, what percentage of people experience the weight loss and maintain it.

272
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:55,720
For several years, it's about two thirds or 67%.

273
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:03,160
And with the other third, this is a group that has gained weight back and perhaps more.

274
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:14,049
So they have to adhere to these lifestyle dietary exercise so that everything that was recommended,

275
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:17,650
they have to adhere to this in order to maintain that weight loss.

276
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,960
So there are a number of side effects. A tolerance to foods high in sugar and that.

277
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:37,620
So you have to eliminate these things from your diet because they can result in lots of unpleasant sensations after you've ingested them.

278
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:47,760
So this is not a problem for many people who have had this procedure done because they no longer prefer these types of foods.

279
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:52,980
There's significant changes to food preferences that occur.

280
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:58,470
Perhaps they've had bad experiences with dumping syndrome, which I'll talk about a minute with.

281
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,229
Consuming high sugar, high fat foods after they've had the procedure with their.

282
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:09,840
How high in sugar is that added sugar and sugar issues.

283
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,050
Sweets dessert type foods.

284
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:21,040
Everybody has a different response to things that they tolerate.

285
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:27,310
People will have less tolerance than others, so it's on a case by case basis.

286
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:33,580
But in general, there are a number of challenging foods now that people can no longer have.

287
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:45,910
So these would be would be things like meat, shrimp, hot dogs, sausage, things with gristle, unlike steak.

288
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:52,600
These are poorly tolerated by some individuals of pasta, rice and bread.

289
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:58,780
These are things that can be problematic for people. Fibrous vegetables can be a problem.

290
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:04,900
Here are all of the examples of those fruits dried fruits in particular.

291
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:15,370
So dried fruits are often cured in a high sugar concentration, so that concentrates the sugars.

292
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:19,480
So after they consume these things, that's an awful lot of sugar.

293
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:25,030
And that can cause some issues with GI distress, dumping syndrome and so on.

294
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:29,350
And then fibrous fruits can also be problematic as well.

295
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:41,590
They need to avoid calorie dense foods like sweets, candies, chewing gum jams and jellies,

296
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:48,010
fruit and sweetened fruits, fruit juices and so on and alcohol.

297
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,470
They need to I've got another slide on that.

298
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:55,930
The conditions in which they should no longer consume alcohol this procedure.

299
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:01,690
So there are other types of miscellaneous foods that may be poorly tolerated.

300
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:05,470
But again, this depends. This is on an individual basis.

301
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,820
So no more chewing gum. This can be problematic.

302
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:13,210
The chewing gum, now you swallow, it goes into the small pouch.

303
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:21,340
It can present problems with blocking the stoma that was formed, especially with people who have had the right gastric bypass.

304
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:30,250
So right after the surgery, there's a number of side effects, hair loss being one.

305
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:38,020
It's is a temporary side effect and it's caused by the anesthesia, thus the stress of the surgery,

306
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:46,360
the lack of protein that they might not be getting after the surgery.

307
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:54,519
Vitamin deficiency, but rarely zinc deficiency, can cause alopecia.

308
00:39:54,520 --> 00:40:02,739
And you need two foods that are high in zinc might not be well tolerated in this

309
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:08,560
might be a reason to see this this hair loss of these individuals after the surgery.

310
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:19,960
So nuts would be an example because cashew nuts have lots of zinc, but that's not tolerated as people have had the procedure.

311
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:29,470
So dumpling syndrome is a condition in which you consume something, usually something that's high in fat and sugar.

312
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,709
And there's this a response, an unpleasant response to that diarrhea, bloating,

313
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:41,760
gas or rapid heart rate, headache, shakiness, dizziness in response to this type of food.

314
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:52,360
This actually alerted people, learn what and how much food that they consume to prevent these symptoms from occurring.

315
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,350
But this is a common consequence of the surgery dumping.

316
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:07,060
So it's most often caused by consuming sugary drinks or liquids that are high in sugar.

317
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:14,950
And this is something you want to avoid after you've had the surgery to prevent this from occurring.

318
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:29,469
So individuals who have had the surgery would also want to avoid other types of foods that are high in sugar fried foods, any kind of fatty food.

319
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:33,160
This will be poorly tolerated, less of this type of stuff.

320
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:42,250
So other side effects, if you consume too much, can cost nausea and vomiting.

321
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:47,950
Each meal that somebody consumes shouldn't exceed a couple of ounces.

322
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:53,500
So if they consume more than a couple of ounces, they're going to experience these types of effects.

323
00:41:54,040 --> 00:42:01,840
They you're essentially overwhelming the size of the pouch now and the stomach, and that can produce these symptoms.

324
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:11,530
So you have to slow down after you've had this procedure and chew things to the consistency of applesauce.

325
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:28,130
Slowly. Um. You want to eat food separate from when you're consuming liquids so slowly you consume liquids at a separate time from when you're eating.

326
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:32,750
And we try to limit the size of your meals.

327
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:45,740
So in terms of spacing out your food and the liquids that you're consuming throughout the day, you want to space this out by about a half an hour.

328
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:49,840
So you consume liquid about half an hour before you get it.

329
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:54,350
So you can you can imagine that after somebody has this procedure,

330
00:42:54,350 --> 00:43:01,879
there are a number of dietary restrictions that can dictate the things that would occur the rest of their lives.

331
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:09,200
And this can be problematic. So they slowly chew their food, the consistency of applesauce.

332
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:18,080
Some other side effects might include something like pain in their shoulder, in their upper side of their chest.

333
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:22,610
And this is essentially an indication that they consumed too much.

334
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:29,480
So if you consumed too much, goes down the esophagus, goes into that smaller restricted pouch or tube,

335
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:40,160
and that produces stretching and that's perceived as this type of a came from this particular ingestion of too much food.

336
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,670
If they're not careful, they can become dehydrated.

337
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:55,220
So they're encouraged to consume about 64 ounces of fluid every day that's not caffeinated.

338
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:03,920
And the amounts that they're encouraged to consume or one or two ounce amounts spread out throughout the day, separate from fluid again.

339
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,820
Some other side effects. Diarrhea.

340
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:18,840
Lactose intolerance. So you people might have to eliminate certain dairy products from their diet.

341
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:26,730
So anything with high fat or high sugar can produce this effect.

342
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:34,050
So if you're not consuming influence, you could experience constipation as well as a side effect of the surgery.

343
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:43,139
Heartburn. Heartburn would become would come from consuming too much of a particular food item and getting it

344
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:49,680
here overwhelming the size of the pouch that your stomach has now put your stomach now occupies.

345
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:59,070
So one other recommendation that's given is, okay, after you've had the surgery, you shouldn't consume carbonated beverages anymore.

346
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:03,560
Carbonated beverages are gaseous.

347
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:05,729
They expand the size of your stomach.

348
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:12,540
They produce satiety, but they can be really problematic and producing heartburn in people who have had this surgery.

349
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:19,590
The other thing people are taught is to not use straws anymore.

350
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:29,280
You can swallow an awful lot of gas when you use a straw and this can be problematic if you have a reduced size of your stomach.

351
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:38,610
So bloating is you need to stop eating when you're full.

352
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:44,940
And so people have to be very aware of their satiety cues to limit the size of the meal,

353
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:54,090
but they need to also pay attention to their satiety cues to prevent the sensation of bloating and again

354
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:03,390
limit the liquids to 1 to 2 ounces at a time separate from meals and to drink and eat very slowly.

355
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,590
Okay. So some other side effects.

356
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:13,690
You can overstress the stomach and die and dilation of the stomach.

357
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:22,600
This is when you consume too much or you're consuming your liquids through straws or you're consuming carbonated beverages.

358
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:30,490
The stomach can be blocked. This is the portion of the small intestine coming out of the small pouch.

359
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:35,940
In the case of the ruined white gastric bypass, that can be blocked by a bonus of food.

360
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,880
So foods that should be avoided can do this.

361
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,820
You're not supposed to consume nuts, seeds, or things that have skins on them.

362
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:55,389
And this can be a problem. Avoid swallowing chewing gum.

363
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:58,480
That can be another thing that could potentially stem on as well.

364
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:09,310
Okay. So their weight increase in weight plateaus can occur and individuals are advised to avoid

365
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:17,530
high calorie foods and beverages to keep a food diary and to record their their body weight,

366
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:22,090
to see if they can maintain the weight loss after they've had the surgery,

367
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:29,680
measure their portion sizes and consume enough protein to prevent protein calorie malnutrition.

368
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:35,200
And again, the minimum amount of protein they should be getting a day is 70 grams.

369
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:42,770
And to prevent people from developing a protein category malnutrition.

370
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:50,050
The advice that's given to them is that consuming protein rich foods first before they consume other things,

371
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:56,710
and in this way they can avoid missing the protein in their meals.

372
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,460
So alcohol intolerance is another issue.

373
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,960
So people who have had the surgery are advised to. All right.

374
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:17,650
You're done with alcohol. You can not consume alcohol. So alcohol is one of the few things that's metabolized within your stomach.

375
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:27,700
So people who consume alcohol after they've had the procedure done can feel drunk very,

376
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:35,499
very quickly after consuming a very small amount of alcohol so that the alcohol reaches

377
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:40,510
the bloodstream after it's consumed much faster and a much higher concentration.

378
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:51,580
If people continue to consume alcohol after they've had the procedure, it puts them at a greater risk of fatty liver disease.

379
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:58,000
Then it can and can produce this dumping syndrome as well.

380
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:03,130
Okay. So all those are those are a lot of the side effects that occur after you've had the surgery.

381
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:09,220
Yes. Abby, I'm just curious. Doctors and surgeons are aware of all of these.

382
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:17,709
Absolutely. I just personally, it just doesn't seem worth it for the whole of the U.S. to deal with all of those side effects.

383
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:22,240
I know that not all of them are, but it just it just isn't worth it.

384
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:30,100
So you would have to be and this is the the last resort for people.

385
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:39,310
Okay. So people you're talking about a group of people who have BMI for, you know, for 35 and over and they have lots of co-morbidities.

386
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:46,180
Okay. So how come this procedure there's a lots of complications with it.

387
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:53,380
But as you'll see, there's there's a lot of benefits associated with it, including they live longer.

388
00:49:53,620 --> 00:50:01,180
Okay. So I'll walk you through this in terms of why people do this, because of the health benefits associated with it.

389
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:11,050
So what happens after you've had this surgery in terms of your sensation of satiety?

390
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:19,960
And exactly how does this work in terms of causing this massive weight loss to people who have a high BMI?

391
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:30,580
Okay. Let's start at the top of the diagram. So there's less of this reward so they consume less food.

392
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:40,810
So foods that were once very appealing based on their pleasantness are no longer okay.

393
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:45,610
So people's taste preferences change after they've had the surgery.

394
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:54,610
Perhaps there's an increase in energy expenditure that would occur as a result of having a surgery.

395
00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:04,900
But the main thing that you hear about bariatric surgery is there's restriction and malabsorption.

396
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:10,720
And that for a long time was thought to be the main mechanisms that produced the weight loss.

397
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:14,830
However, we learned subsequently that that's not necessarily true.

398
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:20,230
Now the question of what the taste preference is. Yes, you mentioned that they change.

399
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:30,309
Yes, they do. Do you know specifically how or and I'm wondering if those changes are a result of like adverse outcomes from

400
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:37,030
consuming something that would be high in fat or sugar or they are just that it doesn't taste good to me.

401
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:41,170
It's hard to tell. Um. Both. I would say both.

402
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:45,790
We have had a bad experience with something, so there's taste aversion that might occur,

403
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:52,630
or that's the pedantic system that's been changed as a consequence of having the surgery.

404
00:51:53,910 --> 00:52:03,850
Yes. So you might see a decision that somebody else's surgeries they look like and what you can eat and chicken and fish as well.

405
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:08,800
So they avoid protein rich foods, which also increases the risk of fighting, which can be a real problem.

406
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,880
They tell you that I'm feeling like it has, like, aftertaste or something, huh?

407
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:17,260
Yeah. Interesting. So it's the taste of those foods that they find aversive.

408
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:24,130
Yes. Interesting. So this that that that could be part of it, too.

409
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:32,229
So you've got a smaller stomach pouch, there's restriction, and you get greater gastric emptying that's going to occur.

410
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:35,800
You've got a small pouch, so it has less of a tube to travel through.

411
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:41,800
Now, in the case of the gastrectomy, there's increased gastric emptying, too.

412
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:49,570
All right. So in terms of what's going on in the small intestine now, there's a number of things that change.

413
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:56,230
So the concentration of macronutrients that enters the small intestine is much higher now.

414
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:05,320
And that has an effect on the hormonal release from cells within the small intestine.

415
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:15,340
And one of the things that occurs that has been described in the paper is this increase in effect, where you get an increase in GLP one,

416
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:21,639
you get an increase in other satiety hormones that are mentioned down here as a consequence of

417
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:29,050
having a higher concentration of macronutrients now that reach the ilium in the small intestine.

418
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:35,470
So the pancreas is going to produce more insulin and over time it's going to that

419
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:41,440
response is going to decline depending on the total adiposity of the individual.

420
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:44,800
But in general, you're going to have this increase in effect,

421
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:52,180
producing more of these hormones that are kind of in the case of people who have diabetes and most of them will who have had this procedure,

422
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,130
the diabetes will resolve.

423
00:53:54,700 --> 00:54:03,070
And the majority of them, up to 90% of people have had this procedure who have had type two diabetes, that diabetes will resolve.

424
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:09,220
So higher insulin, there's less glucose output from the liver.

425
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:24,850
There's the altered nutrient sensing in hormonal signaling that occurs that changes the vagal afferents going up to the brainstem.

426
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:31,390
So this could be part of the the desire to consume fewer amounts of calories.

427
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:38,260
There's a change in adipose tissue that the tissue is shrinking.

428
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,710
There's less water in the bathtub.

429
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:50,410
So that tap is draining as a consequence because there's less water going into it and the white adipose tissue is shrinking.

430
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:55,180
And as a consequence of that, there's less adipose tissue inflammation.

431
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:02,140
And not only is the white adipose tissue affected, there's an increase in.

432
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:06,220
Diet induced thermogenesis. There's an increase in brown adipose tissue.

433
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:16,360
If you she's already read the paper, it describes in detail some of the mechanisms that are thought to be responsible

434
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:22,840
for the changes in our modes and the changes in metabolism after surgery.

435
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:26,620
So what else happens? Well,

436
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:46,060
there's a change in or an effect on the the gallbladder in regard to the things that are secreted into the small intestine that affect lipid emulsion.

437
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:55,750
And so you're going to get changes in the file that's produced from the outside of the gallbladder.

438
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:00,850
So bile acids are increased after they've had this particular surgery.

439
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:10,570
So as you can imagine, a higher concentration of macronutrients is reaching the small intestine.

440
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:15,400
And then so there's less time for absorption.

441
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:24,820
And some of these macronutrients now are going to end up in the large intestine where you have a high concentration of microorganisms,

442
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:32,720
which is going to alter the microbiota. Microbiota can change significantly.

443
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:44,170
And people who have had the surgery and the the microbiota has been in terms of the types of organisms that are there,

444
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:47,560
the diversity of organisms that are there, that's going to change dramatically.

445
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:53,740
Some interesting experiments have done have been done with people before and after the surgery.

446
00:56:53,740 --> 00:57:02,860
They've taken a stool sample. They looked at the populations of microbes that are there and they've taken them and put them into mice

447
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:09,399
and see how that microbiota now affects metabolism in the mice after they've had the bariatric surgery.

448
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:15,700
And they noticed there their significant effects on the body weights of mice after

449
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:20,950
they've had this microbiota transplant from people who have had bariatric surgery.

450
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:27,430
So lots of different things going on in the GI tract after the bariatric surgery.

451
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:34,840
So here's the summary of everything I've talked about thus far. Um, so here's study.

452
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:42,220
Here's a reduction in food intake. There's changes in macronutrient absorption.

453
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:50,260
The biggest difference between the three different procedures that are mentioned here is that you'll see a lot of consistency

454
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:58,540
between the runway gastric bypass and the vertical sleeve gastrectomy in terms of the responses here in the middle,

455
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:02,730
have the adjustable gastric band. So, um,

456
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:10,899
with the ruin like gastric bypass you're getting less direction lipid absorption

457
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:15,070
and up in the small intestine it's not effective in the other two procedures.

458
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:23,650
This is the hypothalamic peptide expression levels now change very much vagal signaling has been implicated.

459
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:29,200
Big differences in GLP one and Q levels.

460
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:37,240
Ghrelin levels, they go up or down or stay the same.

461
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:42,730
There's lots of different results that people have gotten in terms of measuring ghrelin after the surgery.

462
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:50,830
Not really clear. A number of reports, I think k levels change or don't change or stay the same.

463
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:57,690
Leptin levels are going to go down in all. And that's because the amount of adipose tissue is shrinking.

464
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:05,169
It's reduced significantly lower circulating like the bile acids that I mentioned earlier

465
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:12,400
from come from the gallbladder are going to go up the gut microbiota energy expenditure,

466
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:21,430
perhaps it goes up after some in some studies in the ruined Y gastric bypass patients and then food preferences change.

467
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:27,970
A lot of these individuals that you mentioned, food reward changes occur as well.

468
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:31,630
And then there are, um, as we talked about,

469
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:37,510
there's this conditioned taste aversion response and this is related to some bad

470
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:43,570
outcomes that occur after people have consumed the sugar rich or fat rich diet.

471
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:55,790
Q You got a question as far as like the gut microbiota because like the byproducts of gut microbiota so beneficial to charging fatty acids.

472
00:59:55,790 --> 01:00:01,180
So tell that to me what the implications.

473
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:10,010
So a lot of the studies have been done in animal models in terms of how that affects everything else.

474
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:19,660
I'm not certain, but there was some mention of that in the in the assigned reading in terms of exactly how it changes,

475
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:22,850
what it changes and what the implications may be.

476
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:33,320
So in terms of what's responsible for the decrease in food intake, the decline in appetite,

477
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:40,970
it's largely thought to be due to the changes in gut hormones that produce a certain level of satiety.

478
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:50,660
So there are some other things that are listed here in terms of mechanisms for improved glucose distances.

479
01:00:51,590 --> 01:01:01,100
So the parameters are listed here, hepatic insulin resistance, there's early reductions that occur before weight loss,

480
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:08,630
and all three procedures are independent of calorie restriction.

481
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:18,589
So this is thought to be due to the increase in the fact there's in terms of peripheral resistance,

482
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:22,790
this changes and it is reduced gradually with the weight loss.

483
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:29,419
And in terms of insulin release, it's first very rapid and exaggerated.

484
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:35,330
And this occurs in response to the increase in effect from GLP one group which increased.

485
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:42,440
And then as somebody loses weight, then insulin levels flying over time.

486
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:54,480
So there are some dramatic improvements and co-morbidities after bariatric surgery.

487
01:01:54,840 --> 01:02:00,450
There are reduced major adverse cardiovascular events and instead of heart failure,

488
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:08,610
there is a dramatically increased insulin sensitivity that occur almost immediately and are

489
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:15,630
thought to occur in response to this increase in the fact there's an improvement in blood lipids,

490
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:19,230
triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol.

491
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:30,040
There's an improvement or a reduction in both systemic and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

492
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:38,170
There's improvements in obstructive sleep apnea and osteoarthritis symptoms.

493
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:42,670
There's less pain in the patient's liver.

494
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:53,050
Triglyceride content declines rapidly, and people with obesity have an increased risk of certain types of cancers.

495
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:57,340
And after people have had this surgery compared to a control group of people who

496
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:03,490
have similar parameters in terms of their body size and their age and so on,

497
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:08,170
they have a reduced risk of cancer. Yeah.

498
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:18,190
And you say that something like resolving type two diabetes by two mechanisms may soon be said to increase incidence,

499
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:21,549
and then due to weight loss, it would lead to increased incidence.

500
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:31,330
And I know that this might lead to an incident in all the patients or it depends on different cells.

501
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:36,700
So the effect that occurs initially is that increase in effect.

502
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:39,760
And yeah, it would be it would be different for everybody.

503
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:46,960
But initially there's this there's a higher concentration of macronutrients reaching in the small intestine.

504
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:58,780
And that's what started to increase that the treatment effect get more gap, more GLP one so that produce pancreas produces more insulin initially.

505
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:03,400
So you're having more insulin in your blood.

506
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:06,220
So that overcomes some of the insulin resistance.

507
01:04:07,330 --> 01:04:19,510
And then as time goes on with weight loss, your insulin resistance forever declines so that insulin levels don't have to be as high.

508
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:31,870
So they decline in response to that. And so these are some changes that occur.

509
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:39,490
So this is bariatric surgery versus intensive medical therapy for patients with with obesity and diabetes.

510
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:46,180
So this is from the New England Journal. So we're looking at intensive medical therapy,

511
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:50,110
which would be similar to the intensive lifestyle modification programs that

512
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:58,179
we've been talking about versus ruin like gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy.

513
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:05,230
So here is the change in Glycated hemoglobin from baseline and then months after they've had the procedure.

514
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:09,310
So with the intensive lifestyle modification, you can improve that.

515
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:18,490
But with the bariatric surgery, you get a much greater improvement in Glycated hemoglobin during this particular time period.

516
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:26,260
This next graph is the fasting blood glucose.

517
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:36,190
This is plasma glucose going down in all groups, but more so in people who have had a bypass surgery.

518
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:43,240
So the room y gastric bypass is most effective in reducing the fasting blood glucose levels.

519
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:51,000
In regard to the average number of diabetes medications that these individuals are taking.

520
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:58,799
In this particular study, we didn't see any change in the control group,

521
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:04,950
the intensive medical therapy group, but we did see a dramatic increase in people who had this surgery.

522
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:13,080
And then this final change in BMI was a change very much with the intensive medical therapy.

523
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:17,760
You see a dramatic reduction in BMI with people who have gotten a bariatric.

524
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:28,370
So as you can imagine, there are some adverse effects that people experience after the surgery.

525
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:36,130
So this is a list of these from a cohort of people that have had either medical therapy,

526
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:42,340
gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy, the same group of people in this previous draft.

527
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:48,340
So there are serious side effects and other adverse effects that are mentioned here.

528
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:55,240
So some serious side effects requiring hospitalization are listed here.

529
01:06:55,900 --> 01:07:02,950
And you can see people who have had the ruined y gastric bypass have a higher number

530
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:07,930
of adverse effects occurring as a consequence of this more complicated surgery.

531
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:14,410
And then out of 50 people, you're seeing that the number of people that have these different complications,

532
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:19,810
operation transfusion, hemoglobin decrease and so on.

533
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:25,000
And then there are some other adverse consequences.

534
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:32,199
Hypoglycemic episode and the paper that was assigned in the perusal reading discuss that at length.

535
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:40,210
You know, some people experience this hypoglycemia after they've had this surgery and this shows it here in this document.

536
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:46,930
So there's other types of other adverse effects that these individuals have experienced.

537
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:53,650
So you often hear people say, well, there's a high risk of death after you've had this surgery.

538
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:03,570
Well, because we're getting away from the gastric bypass surgery and more risky surgeries and going to the sleeve gastrectomy.

539
01:08:04,110 --> 01:08:12,330
The number of deaths within 90 days after the surgery is about 1000 0.1%.

540
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:18,700
And the overall likelihood of major complications is now down to about 4%.

541
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:26,860
So this was data from the American Society of Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery who collects

542
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:35,080
data from all of these bariatric surgery centers and and follows this information.

543
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:43,010
So is the weight loss durable?

544
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:50,349
So one of the problems he mentioned with the intensive lifestyle modification is after four years,

545
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:55,179
about 38% of people, the diabetes prevention program should maintain that weight loss.

546
01:08:55,180 --> 01:09:01,510
And after 15 years, there's a little bit less and the majority people need the weight back to begin with.

547
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:10,959
What about bariatric surgery? Well, here's a control group and here's three different kinds of surgery that you're following,

548
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:15,280
the change in weight in the individuals over a 15 year period of time.

549
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:24,340
And this particular data comes from the the Swedish obese subjects study,

550
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:33,280
where they have accumulated a huge database on what happens to people after they've had various types of bariatric surgery.

551
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:39,220
So here's a comparison group, the control group, the terms of change, the way they pretty much stay the same.

552
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:43,900
Here's what you would expect in people who have received gastric banding.

553
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:51,219
Here's vertical sleeve gastrectomy and then which is the vertical sleeve gastrectomy.

554
01:09:51,220 --> 01:10:00,580
And then here's the gastric bypass, which has the most significant effect of weight change over a 15 year period of time.

555
01:10:01,650 --> 01:10:05,160
So this is at 15 years. Here's some more data.

556
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:10,440
After 20 years of following patients that have had the surgery.

557
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:15,520
I'm showing this because it's more up to date. It's most recently published,

558
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:24,520
and it gives you a true picture of what happens to these people after they've had the surgery and where they are in terms of their body mass index.

559
01:10:25,450 --> 01:10:32,630
So. The the data points, the open squares and the open circles are the mean and blue.

560
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:39,290
Here you have the control group, people who have similar characteristics versus people who have the surgery.

561
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:45,140
And so they're all. The mean BMI here is around 40.

562
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:50,960
The blue dots would be individual people who are in the control group.

563
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:54,830
And the orange dots are the people who have had the surgery.

564
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:59,120
So starting out with a high BMI, they have the surgery.

565
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:07,800
And after one year, people are have lost quite a bit of their body mass, but they're still in the obese category.

566
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:12,140
Most of them on average is here over 30.

567
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:18,980
And here are individuals who are some way below this and some that are above.

568
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:25,610
But this is the average. And then, as I mentioned, there's this plateau and then they gain some of the weight back.

569
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:32,030
And what the majority of patients maintain the weight loss over a 24 year period.

570
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:40,800
Whereas the people who didn't receive the surgery stay about the same, about 40 children.

571
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:48,980
So is the effect on diabetes remission durable?

572
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:56,320
Well. Let's look at the data from a subset of people in this cohort,

573
01:11:56,390 --> 01:12:02,360
the Swedish of these subjects study and they looked at in the comparative group

574
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:09,350
shown here in the yellowish bars versus the surgical group shown here in green.

575
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:19,310
So you're getting in this particular cohort, but almost 80% people without diabetes and this is two years after they've had the surgery,

576
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:28,580
people that didn't have the surgery only are less than 20% of them are without diabetes.

577
01:12:29,390 --> 01:12:32,750
As time goes on, ten years after the surgery,

578
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:40,670
there's a slight decline in the number of or the percentage of people without diabetes that have had the surgery.

579
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:47,480
And you also see there are fewer people without diabetes in the control group as well.

580
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:54,979
And then the 15 year of follow up, it drops off a little bit more in terms of the percentage of people without diabetes.

581
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:59,810
So people can expect to have remission of diabetes early on.

582
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:05,780
But as time goes on, fewer people are able are show.

583
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:17,110
There are more people who are who have returned to having type two diabetes after the surgery 10 to 15 years down the line.

584
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:24,590
So there are a number of cohorts that have been studied long term.

585
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:28,520
One of the more famous ones is the one in Utah.

586
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:33,200
So this is a long term mortality after gastric bypass surgery.

587
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:37,220
Why would you want to do this? Well, you would hope that it would extend your life.

588
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:43,610
So this is people who have had this surgery between 1984 and 2002.

589
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:50,180
These are nearly 8000 people. They underwent various types of gastric bypass surgery.

590
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:53,720
And there's a comparator group, people who have a similar BMI.

591
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:58,580
In this particular cohort, 84% were women.

592
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:07,670
They were matched for age and sex, body mass. And so that we've got a 45 year olds here now that they're following up.

593
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:12,980
And they determined death rates from all cause and for specific causes.

594
01:14:13,610 --> 01:14:16,610
What did they find so that at the seven year follow up was the mean?

595
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:25,370
So adjusted long term mortality from any cause in the surgery group just decreased by 40% compared with the control group.

596
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:38,930
Here's the cause. Specific mortality in the surgery groups decreased by for cardio, coronary artery disease, diabetes and certain types of cancers.

597
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:50,379
But the other thing that they noted in the study is that this particular group of patients were at a high risk of self-harm in the case of this case,

598
01:14:50,380 --> 01:15:02,050
suicide. So there was a higher percentage of patients who had committed suicide after the surgery compared to those in the comparative group.

599
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:13,090
Now, the way this is portrayed in the paper is in this particular statistic looks disproportionate.

600
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:17,110
Let's look at the data in a different way.

601
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:29,800
So here's the surgery group. This is from a different group of patients that are matched for their BMI and other characteristics.

602
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:34,020
So you're you're looking at a group of people.

603
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:38,350
We're looking at all causes of death after they've had the surgery.

604
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:48,940
So we're seeing less cardiovascular disease deaths compared to the control group from coronary artery disease,

605
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:54,730
heart failure, stroke, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

606
01:15:55,780 --> 01:16:08,680
When you look at all disease causes of non disease, causes like accident unrelated to drugs, poisoning, undetermined intent and then suicide,

607
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:15,970
yes, there's more suicide in people who have had the surgery versus those who have not had the surgery.

608
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:23,560
But compared to the overall death rate from other causes, it's is comparatively much lower.

609
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:29,169
You had a question that just like all the all non disease causes,

610
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:33,840
like the reason that those are higher in the surgery group is because those people are living longer.

611
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:40,190
So there's more person years. So like if they're not dying from yeah, that's possible.

612
01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:54,580
That's possible. But in the latest study that came out from the Swedish obesity subject study, the difference over 25 years was three years.

613
01:16:55,180 --> 01:17:01,210
So people had the surgery who are living. They're living three years longer than people who did not have the surgery in that particular group.

614
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:14,020
So here's here's the survival curves for the control group, the surgery group, which is a little bit higher than the control group.

615
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:23,170
And then you have so that you have people with less than a 45 BMI in more than a 45 BMI, people have a more than a 45 BMI or living,

616
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:30,460
not as long as people who have less BMI and people have had the surgery here in Orange are living a bit longer.

617
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:35,349
And after 25 years, follow up with the Swedish these subjects study.

618
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:44,540
It's about three years longer. Here's the study that I mentioned that the Swedish study of a subject study.

619
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:46,040
Here's the control group.

620
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:56,479
This would be the people who have a BMI of 25 versus people who have had the surgery in orange here versus the control group and here,

621
01:17:56,480 --> 01:18:02,540
people who have the similar characteristics, people who've had the surgeries of survival.

622
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:12,200
In this case, it's over a 30 year period and they're extending these lines that are not as dark,

623
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:16,670
indicating what they what they're projecting that the differences to be over time.

624
01:18:17,630 --> 01:18:24,800
So there's an extension of life with people who have had this surgery compared with people who have not had the surgery,

625
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:31,760
but they're still not living as long as people who are have the lowest 25 or lower.

626
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:38,570
Okay. Mostly women I showed you data from, but what about men?

627
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:44,270
So for men, this is bariatric surgery and long term survival.

628
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:48,980
And in bariatric procedures that were done at the VA clinics.

629
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:58,280
So men again heard of the greater risk for cardiometabolic disease in women, and they fared a lot, much better after the surgery.

630
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:05,570
So this year after surgery, 74% of the people got gastric bypass.

631
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:13,760
15% got the sleeve gastrectomy and 10% got the ten, got the adjustable gastric band and 1% got other.

632
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:16,880
And over time, if you follow these individuals,

633
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:26,270
the surgical patients in terms of the percent mortality 12 years out was much better than the people who were matched who didn't receive the surgery.

634
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:37,580
So it appears based on this data that men just looking at men now benefit more in terms of survival after the surgery did perhaps women.

635
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:54,050
Okay. So these were the things that were part of the standards of medical care for people with obesity and people with type two diabetes.

636
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:58,259
And go back to the bathtub analogy where water comes.
