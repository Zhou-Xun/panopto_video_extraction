00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:08,480
Of course. Over you take one. Hello and welcome to 5593.

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,650
My name is Doug Richler, and I'll be serving as your instructor for this course.

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:19,280
This course was originally developed by Dr. Carissa Schmidt, and it was originally taught on Thursdays.

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,510
As you saw in the course overview video, hopefully none of you panicked.

5
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,780
This year I will be teaching the course on Tuesdays.

6
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:34,370
All other aspects of the course, including all of the course policies that Dr. Schmidt covered, apply to this year.

7
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:43,310
So again, my name is Doug, Rather. And a little bit about me. I am an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

8
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:52,550
I work specifically in the Cannabis Strategy Unit, and my previous research experience has included studying motor vehicle crashes,

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,820
global road safety, child injury prevention, and youth substance use prevention.

10
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:10,340
I look forward to learning from all of you and learning how you how we can apply the experiences that you have to health theory.

11
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:18,920
I completed all of my educational training from the University of Michigan in the Department of Health, Behavioral Health,

12
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:26,180
Education, and I did a postdoc at Rush University Medical Center in the Department of Pediatrics in Chicago.

13
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:33,830
Again, I look forward to meeting all of you on Tuesday, and I look forward to a very successful course.

14
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:34,670
Thank you.
