1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:13,080
Like other environments, interaction could happen with environmental factors like running your house.

2
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:32,330
You know what? I don't want to have this other anger. You don't know what I got on next move the whole time because I feel that's okay.

3
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:38,100
Just take a moment to see this land that you see.

4
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:43,800
I mean, the back end. Okay. Next week, probably gonna have to get started this morning.

5
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:58,890
I have just a few announcements, so if you are done looking at your exam, please turn those in back to me because you could feel that.

6
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,170
So I made some people from home and then brought them later.

7
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,810
And if you look at your exam still, that's fine.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,909
Okay, so that's number nine, which will cover diabetes and hypertension.

9
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:38,040
More on Friday, Friday afternoon and a little announcement about exam to date, same time period subsequently delivered to campus.

10
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,940
Okay. You don't have to be here to take the exam,

11
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:50,010
but I will require you to log in to take the exam at the scheduled time and to log in to while you're taking the exam.

12
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:56,110
Okay. If you are 16.

13
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:00,550
Can can I here is December 15 or 1616.

14
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,400
That's what the schedule says right now. And what happens at 7:30 a.m.?

15
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,160
Yeah. Okay. Any questions before we get started today?

16
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:13,809
All right.

17
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:26,140
We're talking about different types or classes of drugs that are used to treat people with type two diabetes, people with type one coming up.

18
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:38,290
Most of these individuals, if they have insurance, they will be able to inject insulin or will have better insurance,

19
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:51,849
will be able to get this indwelling pump that can measure automatically your blood glucose and deliver the appropriate dose of insulin automatically.

20
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,790
And all they have to do is to load that pump.

21
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:06,040
Yeah, it's a lot more about that in that situation here because that's all I have to mention about that type two diabetes.

22
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,130
These are the different types of drugs that are used to treat this condition.

23
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:15,730
Now, the first drug of choice that's usually used is metformin.

24
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,220
And metformin has many different things and it does many different things.

25
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:29,620
So we know in muscle and closest it increases glucose uptake, but it also does other things.

26
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,450
So here here's the muscle and here's metformin increasing glucose uptake.

27
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:43,670
And then you have metformin here reducing gluconeogenesis the decreasing glucose output from the liver.

28
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,990
In other parts. So here we're looking at the gut.

29
00:03:52,980 --> 00:04:04,470
Metformin is also thought to increase GLP one release and it's also thought to decrease glucose absorption in the gut as well.

30
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,920
So these are some characteristics of what metformin does exactly.

31
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,180
The mechanism by which these things are accomplished is not completely understood.

32
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,420
People who have diabetes over the years.

33
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:30,120
The effect of metformin is sufficient not to regulate their blood glucose levels, so they're put on other types of drugs.

34
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:35,160
And another type of drug would be the sulfonylureas.

35
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:40,080
And then sulfonylureas. Shown here, there are two, two different classes.

36
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,910
What they do is they increase insulin release from the pancreas.

37
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:54,060
So this is another common drug that's been used for a very long period of time to regulate blood glucose levels.

38
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:07,680
So up here, you have the thought by own days that it takes these thiazolidinediones fatty acids.

39
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:17,670
They can increase glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue and increase insulin sensitivity and the liver.

40
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:24,959
But remember, there were some side effects associated with this drug that has decreased a lot of the numbers

41
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,700
of prescriptions that people have been given for this particular type of class of drugs.

42
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:40,170
So next are the diet that Dr. Patel had today is for inhibitors.

43
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,410
So this is a class of drugs that metabolize in treatments.

44
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:53,520
And if you have an inhibitor to the enzyme that blocks this process,

45
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:01,910
so you're you're essentially inhibiting these enzymes that JLP one and gastric inhibitory peptide,

46
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:09,570
both of them stay in circulation for a longer period of time and as a consequence, you get a greater increase in effect.

47
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:20,550
So with those types of drugs, you get an increase in insulin secretion, you get a decrease in glucagon secretion,

48
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:30,210
and you also have an increase in the secretion of type one now from the gut.

49
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:48,060
So going through this graph, we have the drugs that inhibit the sodium glucose transporter to work in the kidney.

50
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,700
If you're essentially in this particular class of drugs, you're peeing out more glucose,

51
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:01,530
you're not absorbing the glucose, and that can lower your placement of the supplement for a long period of time.

52
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:13,560
And then finally, you have the GLP one receptor agonist, so it stimulates the GLP one receptor.

53
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:21,100
And these are the types of our classes of drugs that are injected weekly.

54
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,160
There are different preparations for adults and now adolescents.

55
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,919
And these drugs work in different tissues.

56
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:42,090
So they increase of insulin secretion. They inhibit gastric emptying, giving you a greater sensation of satiety.

57
00:07:43,140 --> 00:08:00,420
And they can. So it can induce weight loss as well as improve or activate the increase that the until you one receptor

58
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:12,240
agonists are expensive and there is a period of time in which they will go off patent in very few years.

59
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:23,730
So perhaps they'll be more accessible for people who have less sufficient health insurance programs.

60
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:33,329
So these are the classes of drugs. And if you work in clinical nutrition, if you've become a diabetes educator,

61
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:38,370
you're going to see a lot more about these and how they work and potential complications from them.

62
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:43,660
Yeah, well, in some cases that has lots of side effects. Yes.

63
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:53,219
So the physicians. Oh, yeah, there are side effects with all of them.

64
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:59,160
So metformin, yeah, it's inexpensive and it's effective, but it causes nausea.

65
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:05,160
It's some people can't tolerate that. So maybe put on other classes of drugs to find what works for them.

66
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,330
What? Yeah. A lot of drugs.

67
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:16,320
Is it a drug that's more effective at reducing? But also, they all work in different mechanisms.

68
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,139
They all work through different mechanisms. They're all effective.

69
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:30,180
And what like glucose levels and it's an individualistic type of preference for the different types of drugs and the different combinations.

70
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,060
Different things will work for different people. Yeah.

71
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:42,110
So I'm kind of building off. That is a goal then to bring the glucose levels down, the H1 AC load down under seven.

72
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,610
Yeah. So that's the goal. That's the goal of the therapy.

73
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:54,140
You want to lower hemoglobin H1 C levels and this is why you check this regularly to make sure the therapy is actually working.

74
00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:00,510
Now, managing life in the first level is tricky.

75
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:04,190
Not no, you go on the drug and everything's all taken care of.

76
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:11,120
It's a moving target. It changes as people age, it changes as their lifestyle changes.

77
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,400
And this makes this type of therapy challenging.

78
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:28,050
And then I didn't mention insulin. So on people who are on a number of drugs, that still might not be enough to control their blood glucose levels.

79
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:34,680
So those individuals, on top of all of that, these drugs that they're given for perhaps two or three,

80
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,390
it could be given begetting insulin as well through an injection.

81
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,010
And that's another way to regulate their blood glucose levels.

82
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,650
All right. Any questions about this before I move on to hypertension?

83
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:19,950
So with hypertension, the learning objectives want you to be able to.

84
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:30,020
You should you should know these values that the thresholds for systolic and diastolic blood pressure for hypertension in change changed 2017,

85
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:35,690
you should be able to describe the diagnosis of prevalence,

86
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:43,190
racial disparities and disease burden for hypertension, describe the risk factors for hypertension,

87
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:52,370
and explain some of the underlying mechanisms that increase blood pressure, chronic pressure, long term regulation, low pressure.

88
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,519
Describe the impact of lifestyle modification and bariatric surgery.

89
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,229
It should be separate. I should have said and here. And bariatric surgery, high blood pressure at the very end.

90
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:13,280
I'll show you some data there. And then finally, how hypertension is managed with medication and diet.

91
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:20,540
So these are the categories of blood pressure.

92
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:26,060
Based on a 2017 readjustment for these values.

93
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,250
The American Heart Association.

94
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:40,219
So if you have if you're categorized as having normal blood pressure, so your systolic and diastolic would be less than 120 and less than 80 for that,

95
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:51,410
for the diastolic values you might have on your medical record that you have elevated blood pressure if you exceed these thresholds.

96
00:12:51,410 --> 00:13:00,260
So 120 to 129 for the systolic value here and still less than 80 for the diastolic.

97
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,959
In Orange here you have what would be considered hypertension.

98
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,850
Stage one, high blood pressure.

99
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:23,890
This is when your systolic value exceeds that 130 threshold, but it doesn't go above 139 and then in the diastolic value would be above 80 to 89.

100
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:32,320
Then there are subsequent stage two and state and hyper hypertensive crisis.

101
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:40,300
So if somebody has a systolic value of 140 or higher, they would be stage two hypertension.

102
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:48,950
And if their diastolic was 90 or higher, I would also satisfy this criteria for having the stage two hypertension.

103
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:57,790
If somebody comes in and has fever measurement or at any time, they have a blood pressure higher than 180.

104
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:03,310
And they're not they're not exercising or under lots of acute stress.

105
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,480
This could indicate a hypertensive crisis where you would want to get somebody to a emergency room.

106
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,180
Very quickly, if their blood pressure exceeded these thresholds.

107
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:24,080
180 over one. So you know this, but I'm going to say it anyway.

108
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,790
So it's fiscal pressure occurs when the ventricles contract.

109
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,550
And flood is pushed into the circulatory system, the arterial tree,

110
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:43,460
and then the diastolic pressure is what the pressure is when your ventricles are in the relaxation phase right before contraction.

111
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:51,800
So very simple explanation. Why did the thresholds for hypertension change?

112
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:58,550
So for a long period of time, the threshold for hypertension was 140.

113
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:05,570
Something changed. And 2017, it's 130 over 80.

114
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:15,150
Why did they do that? Well, first of all, they wanted to eliminate this ambiguity associated with the free hypertension category,

115
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:24,930
and they wanted to have a threshold in which they could prevent subsequent

116
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:29,940
disease and catch people who might be in the process of developing hypertension.

117
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:40,050
So with this new threshold, about 14% more people would be diagnosed with having hypertension because the values are a little bit lower.

118
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:52,470
So this also resulted in a small increase in the number of people who required medication to control their chronic blood pressure elevation.

119
00:15:53,820 --> 00:16:04,020
And again, the idea here was by catching this early and lowering people's blood pressure with lifestyle modification perhaps,

120
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:14,340
and with treatment of drugs for people who exceeded this threshold, that they can prevent complications of hypertension that could occur subsequently.

121
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:26,130
So remember, this is this time point in which we have this threshold for hypertension 2017.

122
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:35,820
When you look at the values historically and publications that came out before this time, the threshold was 140.

123
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:46,000
So I don't know about you, but going to the doctor's office and having my blood pressure taken raises my blood pressure acutely.

124
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:54,069
And most of the time, the person who is taking your blood pressure and does all of the free stuff and puts you on a scale,

125
00:16:54,070 --> 00:17:01,180
they take your heart rate and they measure your blood pressure. And all of that stuff is kind of stressful and it raises your blood pressure.

126
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,160
Does that mean that your blood pressure is elevated acutely?

127
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,290
Does that mean you have hypertension? No. It means that you are responding to acute stress.

128
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:18,670
So the diagnosis is based on one particular instance.

129
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:27,220
There's something else that you should realize in terms of having an accurate measurement of blood pressure.

130
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:32,290
So here is the individual. So essential work, essential hypertension.

131
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:37,090
Now here is an individual seizure chair and they're relaxed, okay?

132
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,540
They're not talking. Talking can really raise your blood pressure with blood pressure cuff.

133
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,230
Notice where it is position. It is position even with the heart.

134
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:55,810
Okay, you're sitting up, lots of work support in the chair and the cup is appropriately sized.

135
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:00,310
There are different sizes that are required for people with different parts of their upper arm.

136
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:06,190
So this is this is really important and making this measurement.

137
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:15,280
So now we have automatic electronic blood pressure sensors.

138
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:25,030
In other words, you can hook up this cuff to this electronic device that can measure your blood pressure.

139
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:35,950
And it's thought that these types of devices are more consistent, more accurate than the oscillatory method, where you did the same thing,

140
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:46,090
you inflated the cuff, and you listen for changes and the doing of the heart by putting a stethoscope over the brachial artery.

141
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:53,080
Well, there could be some ambiguity there in terms of where the cutoff was, when pressure,

142
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,100
like the cuff blood pressure gets up and then you wait for the sound to go away.

143
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,260
And you can have some ambiguity there.

144
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:11,380
With different individuals having an electronic device, you get a more of a standardized assessment of this measurement.

145
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,180
So this is the standardized method in which you assess somebody's blood pressure.

146
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,759
Okay, so new.

147
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,790
And in order to have this diagnosis of hypertension,

148
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:31,990
you would want to have somebody visit the doctor's office 2 to 3 times, at least two times before you got this diagnosis.

149
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,569
And this is the time in which the assessment as well is 2 to 4 weeks.

150
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:45,540
So it's an extended period of time. So the diagnosis shouldn't be made by a single visit that occurs.

151
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:57,780
You will also see other types of measurements made outside the doctor's office.

152
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:04,980
So somebody might be given a device that can measure their blood pressure outside the office.

153
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:14,730
So there could be a 24 hour ambulatory monitor that would indicate I can measure blood pressure.

154
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:21,480
And this is a way to measure somebody's blood pressure in their their own environment, perhaps, which is less stressful than in the doctor's office.

155
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:29,220
So you satisfy these conditions. This is when you have this diagnosis of hypertension.

156
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:46,950
So where are the trends in hypertension? So. So this is from this time period, 1999 to 2015, 2016.

157
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:52,110
And so you see here two different lines, a blue line for hypertension.

158
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,650
So this is people who have gotten a diagnosis of hypertension.

159
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:06,150
And that three line represents people who have this diagnosis of hypertension or they're treated with antihypertensive medication,

160
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:14,370
and they would be considered having high blood pressure. And you see that the trend is largely increased during this period of time.

161
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:22,410
But remember, these values correspond to the pre to the 2017 cutoffs for hypertension.

162
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:33,480
Getting subsequent data from the CDC website, they'll show you a trend, but it doesn't look like this.

163
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:40,800
You can get an age adjusted trend, which is really confusing. I just put this one out there because it's easier to understand.

164
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,200
Now this that came out recently and this is really interesting.

165
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:58,030
So this is a county based map looking at the prevalence of hypertension and this particular assessment period between 2018 and 2020.

166
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:06,520
Which areas are the highest in terms of the age adjusted prevalence for hypertension?

167
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:15,480
So you have again the Mid-South where we saw greater prevalence of of of diabetes and and obesity.

168
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:25,180
We're seeing the same areas overlapping care for these values, for that person, for the prevalence of hypertension in this case.

169
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:33,190
Look up here in northern Michigan, you also see a higher prevalence of hypertension as well.

170
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:42,140
So same thing up here in northern Maine. There's very few people living up there because of an accounting basis.

171
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:49,630
There's a higher prevalence of hypertension in those areas. It's.

172
00:22:51,150 --> 00:23:02,250
So let's go through some of the demographics. This particular data came from the latest CDC set that I could find.

173
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,910
So this is the prevalence of hypertension among adults 18 years and older.

174
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,510
This is from the 2017 2018 assessment.

175
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:19,290
I haven't been able to find a more recent one. So 18 and over every has dark blue 18 to 39.

176
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:29,610
And this other shade of blue is shown here showing the lowest prevalence of hypertension for men and women, men at this age.

177
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:34,620
Women at this age have a lower prevalence of hypertension compared to men.

178
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:45,270
And then when we look at the age group of 40 to 59, blood pressure goes way up for that for both men and women.

179
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:50,460
And men again, have a higher prevalence of hypertension than women.

180
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,570
And then when you get to be 60 years and older, the prevalence goes way up to 75%.

181
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:07,390
75% of people who are 60 and over, according to this particular assessment survey, have hypertension.

182
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:11,970
Based on the 2017 values of 130 over 40.

183
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,020
So as you get older, the prevalence increases.

184
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:23,190
And perhaps this is due to due to arterial stiffening that occurs with age, along with a number of other things.

185
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:36,210
Sure. So the first the darkest part is that for everyone, everyone over 18, which is the average of three.

186
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:49,290
Yes. Now when we look at race and ethnicity.

187
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:56,940
So here's 2015, 2016 and here's 2017, 2018 to 2017.

188
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,210
2018 did not include non-Hispanic Asians.

189
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,390
So this is why I'm showing you the older data.

190
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:19,410
So looking at the total in terms of race and ethnicity, non-Hispanic white, the highest prevalence of hypertension is not Hispanic black.

191
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:28,290
And then you have non-Hispanic, Asian in Hispanic shown here for men and women for some reason.

192
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:36,540
So non-Hispanic black having a higher prevalence or high percentage of of hypertension in all.

193
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,090
And I'll talk about that in more detail here just a minute.

194
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:53,160
So for some reason, they left out the Asian population in the 2017 2018 publication are survey data there, but they didn't include it.

195
00:25:53,430 --> 00:26:04,680
Not sure why they did that. But you see that the percentages have gone up a bit in terms of non-Hispanic, white, non-Hispanic, black, Hispanic.

196
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:10,740
Based on the perhaps based on them, the new criteria for hypertension.

197
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:21,360
Okay. And again, then having a greater percent of men have hypertension compared to women.

198
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:29,160
You know, some of these disparities, I mean, no, not not all of it, but a percentage of it being explained by just like stature.

199
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:34,170
Because I know I'm really short and I have this stature.

200
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:40,170
Yeah. So how would that work? Is the logic like if you're.

201
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,590
Love your heart doesn't have to pump quite as far to get up.

202
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:52,130
I see what you're saying. So you would have shorter and there's less gravity.

203
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:59,870
Oh, I had not heard that before. I've not heard that before.

204
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:05,990
All right. All right. So this is in the United States. What about the rest of the world?

205
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,549
What is the rest of the world look like? All right. When you look at hypertension prevalence and this is an older paper, 2005,

206
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:19,370
using the 140 over 94 people who are treated for the thresholds of hypertension.

207
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:28,790
When you look at African European descent populations and these are adults now between the ages of 35 and 64 and age adjusted,

208
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:37,280
you find that the U.S. black population kind of falls in the middle, and you can see some surprises here.

209
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:45,620
So in European countries, Germany has the highest prevalence of of hypertension in this particular survey,

210
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:53,210
followed by Finland, Spain and then U.S. blacks, England, Italy, Sweden, Jamaica and the U.S. whites.

211
00:27:53,450 --> 00:28:00,710
Then in Nigeria having the lowest percent of hypertension in this particular survey that was done this time.

212
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:15,049
So in terms of what's going on now, want to find some information about the prevalence of hypertension in Africa,

213
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:19,180
the continent of Africa from a large population.

214
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:27,650
And I believe that the average was something like around 40 something percent and it's gone up compared to earlier measurements.

215
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:36,680
But the point of this is we have to be careful when making assumptions about hypertension and

216
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:42,620
somebody's genetic background for for reasons that I'm going to explain as we go through this.

217
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,500
Why is hypertension more prevalent in African Americans?

218
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:52,700
Well, in truth, it's not completely understood.

219
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:59,480
There are certainly environmental factors that can modify and modify your risk for hypertension,

220
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:10,310
your exposure to racism, stress can modify your risk for hypertension, dietary behaviors can modify your risk.

221
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:13,070
You have a preference for salty foods.

222
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:25,520
People who, in terms of dietary behaviors, even the absence of hunger, who use food as a way to modify their stress.

223
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,380
This is a risk factor for hypertension, access to medical care.

224
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:39,110
If you don't catch elevated blood pressure early and treat it, it can increase your risk of having hypertension.

225
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:49,070
Physical inactivity is a risk factor for a modifiable risk factor for hypertension, as is socioeconomic status.

226
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:53,720
So all of these things can modify your risk of having hypertension.

227
00:29:54,500 --> 00:30:04,190
Now we can talk about genetics and in some populations from Africa, yes, there's a greater salt sensitivity, however.

228
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:10,460
Racial. Racial categorization is complicated.

229
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:24,160
It's self-identified. And you can't assume that everybody who says that they're African-American has the same genetic background.

230
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,820
It's a social construct.

231
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:41,650
We have different regions of Africa that have different genetic backgrounds and you have many people with mixed and African ancestry.

232
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:50,230
So this is a picture that was taken from the Daily Mirror in the United Kingdom.

233
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:56,150
And it shows you the twins. These girls are twins.

234
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:01,550
The mother was of mixed race and the father was black.

235
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:04,250
And these are twin sisters.

236
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:17,150
So the point of which is what people, people who have black or African American ancestry, they're not all genetically the same.

237
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:25,100
There is there's a mixture of genetics that can predispose, in some cases to salt sensitivity.

238
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:30,080
But other in other cases, not right. That's the point I'm trying to make just fine.

239
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:37,940
Okay. So why is hypertension more prevalent in African-Americans?

240
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:43,550
So this was a paper that was published a while ago, in 2001.

241
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,059
And so you have differences in the prevalence of obesity,

242
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:55,130
cannot fully explain a higher prevalence of hypertension among non-Hispanic black versus white populations.

243
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,590
This is based on the NHANES three database fraction of hypertension.

244
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:07,040
The survey could be attributed to abdominal obesity in men about 24, 25%.

245
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:19,370
In women, about 16%. And however, the risk of her hypertension persisted after you adjusted for abdominal obesity and other potential confounders.

246
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:29,360
Nutrition factors also could not fully explain the higher prevalence of hypertension among African-Americans.

247
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:37,880
So the exact mechanisms that contribute to differences in blood pressure between blacks and whites are still not fully understood.

248
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,980
And this is true even to 20, 21 years later after this paper was published.

249
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:55,910
So I got this information from a talk that was given at the University of Washington

250
00:32:55,910 --> 00:33:00,650
in Seattle on race based therapy as the case for hypertension in African-Americans.

251
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:05,150
And you can click on this link and watch this full length presentation.

252
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:09,800
It's about an hour long, but it's really interesting if you want to get to the subject.

253
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:19,400
Okay. So what are the risk factors for hypertension? Number one, having an elevated blood pressure.

254
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:26,569
So if your blood pressure exceeds that 120 over 80 threshold, it could creep up over time.

255
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:30,050
And this is something that occurs with age.

256
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:35,390
So if it's slightly higher than normal, this is a risk factor.

257
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:40,010
Diabetes is a risk factor for hypertension.

258
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,900
Six out of ten people who have diabetes also have hypertension as well.

259
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:59,000
Exactly why it is it's thought that diabetes affects angiotensin converting enzyme metabolism to account.

260
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:04,220
Could you tell us about that right now of an unhealthy diet?

261
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:13,489
So if you have a diet that is rich in salt, highly processed food, this is a risk factor to diet.

262
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:19,010
It's low in vegetables, low in potassium. This is a risk factor for having hypertension.

263
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:25,490
Physical inactivity is a risk factor for hypertension.

264
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:37,730
SCD is a risk factor. It's all mentioned in terms of the subsequent slide of how much hypertension can be attributed to having obesity.

265
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,599
Too much alcohol is a risk factor.

266
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:46,250
How much is too much alcohol? More than 2 to 3 drinks per day.

267
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:52,370
A risk factor for hypertension in tobacco use.

268
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:59,030
So if you use tobacco or you're exposed to tobacco smoke, this can increase your risk.

269
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:08,570
So what happens here is that the exposure to the smoke itself or this would be true to exposure to any kind of biomass smoke.

270
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,540
You inhale those particulates when you inhale.

271
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:21,530
In regard to tobacco, it's like 5000 different chemicals enter your living when you inhale tobacco, smoke and other types of biomass.

272
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,710
And what this does is it promotes the sclerosis process.

273
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,920
So you get a narrowing of the arteries as a consequence of this exposure.

274
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:44,180
And this contributes to arterial stiffening, which can increase your risk of having hypertension because of chronic exposure.

275
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:54,290
And then finally, genetics and family history. If you have a parent or parents that have hypertension, this is certainly a risk factor.

276
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:01,249
All right. So what's the contribution of obesity to hypertension?

277
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:05,300
This is this is a difficult to determine, as you saw in the reading.

278
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:17,000
And this this type of question can be addressed, but not completely answered with cohort studies.

279
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:26,240
So in the reading, it mentioned the Framingham Heart Study, where they're they're following this cohort over a long period of time.

280
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,710
So in this particular study, they're following it up to 44 years.

281
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:37,820
And they do find that excess body weight, overweight or obese, there's an increase in the prevalence of hypertension.

282
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:43,910
It can be 26% of hypertension cases in men and about 28% in women.

283
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:52,130
Another study that they mentioned with this was this nurses health study in which they had a 16 year follow up.

284
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:58,250
And the fraction of hypertension cases attributed to being overweight or having obesity was about 40%.

285
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:14,960
Yeah, the question of if stress is the reason we've talked about stress early on is stress, these two choices and all that.

286
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:23,180
Now we're just looking at what stress has done and then we start to talk about the eating, which we don't talk about the stress anymore.

287
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:33,140
But if stress is causing people obesity, stress costs, plus you have the stress.

288
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:38,659
Now we're just talking about all the senses as a result of comparison, that relationship.

289
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:43,970
We don't talk about stress anymore, you know, so it's a contributing factor.

290
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:51,830
And it's hard to nail down what percent of hypertension is due to just stress alone because there's so many other things going on.

291
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:57,860
So to answer the question, people have looked at prospective studies looking at that level of stress,

292
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:05,690
and they followed people over time and they find in cross-sectional studies that stress is associated with hypertension.

293
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:10,910
But when you follow people over time, prospectively, there's mixed data in terms of who get.

294
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:15,370
It's hypertension and who doesn't? So it's not an easy question to answer.

295
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:27,620
This is data from the nurses health study and the health professionals, a follow up study.

296
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:33,080
So this is relative risk of type two diabetes.

297
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:39,950
Qualify, assess. This has to do with gallbladder disease, hypertension and coronary artery disease.

298
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:48,320
So in this particular study, the nurses in this study were 30 to 55 years of age.

299
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:56,720
And in terms of demographics, most of the people in this study were nurses and they were white females.

300
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:05,240
So this is the increase in hypertension shown here and the green line with weight change.

301
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:17,450
So this is showing you that with an increase in weight and change in kilograms, we get an increased relative risk of hypertension, what we see in men.

302
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:22,400
So the men's health professionals follow up study.

303
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:32,690
The initial age of these people in this study was 40 to 65 years of age and they were followed up up to ten years.

304
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:41,569
I did a little back background there, so they were followed up to ten years and we see that with this weight gain in kilograms,

305
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:50,600
we're seeing an increased relative risk of hypertension and other types of diseases associated with this weight gain over this period of time.

306
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:59,570
So that's associated data. Let's look at some more data in terms of waist circumference.

307
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,630
Yeah. Yeah. This is.

308
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:18,930
I think that was that's so it's it's a way to account for a break.

309
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:27,320
In other words, that the inflection point here here's an inflection point where the lines can go up and then they go up really high.

310
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:30,410
And after this particular break, I think that's what that does indicate.

311
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:43,390
So let's look at waist circumference better than BMI in terms of risk of hypertension and diabetes and so on.

312
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:54,340
So in this particular study, we're looking at the prevalence of hypertension by waist circumference overall and by race and sex.

313
00:40:54,610 --> 00:41:02,290
So down here is overall and we have that the thresholds are different for men and women.

314
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:09,130
Shown here, if you have what's considered low base circumference, the risk is lower.

315
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:18,370
And as the waist circumference increases to moderate to high, we get an increase in hypertension prevalence.

316
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:26,760
And when we look at different races in the African-American women and black men,

317
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:31,590
we're seeing a similar relationship with an increase in the waist circumference,

318
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:39,960
showing some increases in the prevalence of hypertension and the same type of a relationship with white women in white men.

319
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:49,130
In this particular paper, they're using that threshold of one 4490.

320
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:56,520
So why do we care about hypertension?

321
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,760
Well, that carries a significant disease risk.

322
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:06,630
So if you have hypertension, your risk of coronary artery disease increases considerably.

323
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,670
Your risk of having a stroke increases as well.

324
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:27,330
So whether or not you have atherosclerotic stroke or if you have a need in your brain is caused by an aneurysm,

325
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:38,100
both would increase with increasing blood pressure. Heart failure is a risk occurs in people that have elevated blood pressure.

326
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:47,730
So in this particular case, the ability of the ventricles now to pump blood to the rest of the body for a long period of time,

327
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:55,740
if there's more pressure on the heart, it can fail over time and it can cause heart failure.

328
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:07,170
We'll talk a bit about heart failure, more so of other ways in which hypertension increases disease risk.

329
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:10,950
There's the Arctic and peripheral arterial disease.

330
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:23,010
This is something that I will discuss in great detail on Monday when we talk about cardiovascular disease and then valvular heart disease.

331
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:30,000
So the valves now can be damaged by having this constant or persistent elevated blood pressure.

332
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:35,340
So these are the reasons why you want to monitor people's blood pressure,

333
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:44,940
treat it and prevent subsequent top disease kidney failure, which is one of the last ones.

334
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:51,870
Kidney failure is another consequence of having elevated blood pressure or hypertension.

335
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:59,390
So how is blood pressure regulated over the long term?

336
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,040
So blood pressure is in this diagram.

337
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:09,470
It's equal to cardiac output times, peripheral vascular resistance.

338
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:19,400
And I have here in this in this illustration, different factors that can affect cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance.

339
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:29,900
So let's start up here with blood volume. So higher blood volume will increase cardiac output, which will increase blood pressure.

340
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:35,400
And if you have higher levels of sodium, you retain more water.

341
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:39,140
And this will increase cardiac output, increases blood pressure.

342
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:49,340
Mineralocorticoid So aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid that is responsible for reabsorption of sodium in your renal tubules,

343
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:53,450
in your in your nephrons within your kidneys.

344
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:59,030
And this is going to increase blood volume.

345
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:03,380
And opposing that is the actual nature. Peptide.

346
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:09,650
Peptide is released by the atria in your heart.

347
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:18,980
And that response occurs. And the volume of blood within the atria causes the greater stress of this tissues.

348
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:25,520
And as a consequence, they are going to secrete o h on the peptide.

349
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:33,140
And what this does is it can ultimately reduce cardiac output by circulating your blood,

350
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:42,000
drawing to your kidneys, and reducing sodium reabsorption and affecting blood volume.

351
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:50,030
So it has the opposite effect. It can reduce blood and reduce the output and reduce blood pressure.

352
00:45:53,590 --> 00:46:04,150
So other factors that are affected by the heart itself and the heart rate, higher heart rate, higher cardiac output, greater blood pressure.

353
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:13,870
And then there's the force of contractility, of the ventricles in particular, that will increase cardiac output.

354
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:24,760
So in terms of peripheral vascular resistance, there are a number of factors that are in play here.

355
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:31,150
There are constrictors dilated and the constrictors they're responsible for.

356
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:42,030
Causing an increase in peripheral vascular resistance. Angiotensin to lock it through this pathway and subsequent slide.

357
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:50,030
Then there are the catecholamines that are released during a stress or a fight or flight response.

358
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:56,660
And there are other constrictors ever present in the blood itself.

359
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:02,120
So from boxing is a lipid mediator that's released by platelets.

360
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:09,950
And platelets play a role in peripheral vascular resistance not only by causing clots,

361
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:14,650
but releasing this lipid mediator from boxing that causes constriction.

362
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,520
16 local tribes in particular are constrictors.

363
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:28,670
And then finally at the end, one is produced by endothelial cells in the arteries,

364
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,910
and it can cause veins of constriction and contribute to this increase in peripheral resistance.

365
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:45,270
Opposing the effective. The constrictors are the dilate and prostaglandins process a cyclin prostaglandin E2.

366
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:53,430
These are also lipid mediators that are produced in the blood and in the kidney that are things

367
00:47:53,430 --> 00:48:01,479
that lower peripheral vascular resistance are a nitric oxide opportunity for nitric oxide.

368
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:13,920
This is a dilator. You have local factors that are terms of and hypoxia that can regulate peripheral vascular resistance as well.

369
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:27,730
So, um, in addition to this, you have the neural factors, so your arteries are richly innervated with sympathetic nervous that release or epinephrine.

370
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:32,710
And within the arteries you have receptors.

371
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:40,030
You have alpha receptors and beta receptors under the influence of the catecholamines, um,

372
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:54,100
that the adrenergic receptor would cause constriction of the arteries and the adrenergic receptors will dilate vasculature with that.

373
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:58,390
Yeah. No, just affect the different resistance.

374
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:06,210
How does h h t h. So if you have a condition in which you have, um,

375
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:16,840
let's say within a muscle and you have lots of contraction of that muscle and have metabolic waste products,

376
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:23,890
lactic acid that builds up in the muscle that is going to contribute to the dilation.

377
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:28,450
And that can be a local way to regulate profusion of that tissue.

378
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:34,959
So acidic p h will decrease and just say that it will increase the perfusion of

379
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:40,300
the tissues that can reduce the peripheral resistance in that particular locale.

380
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:54,069
Oh, no. So you're just saying that if people have supersonic range of the nervous system more strongly, they will appear more dominant in that area.

381
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:59,530
Overuse that French flat may cause the construction like high blood pressure

382
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:07,179
of a stress response can increase these neural factors the catecholamines,

383
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:12,660
certain parts of the Pacific Islands and the building dominance.

384
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,839
This being, I don't know.

385
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:23,320
But if you are someone who reacts like this to stress, it can cause an activation of the sympathetic nervous system.

386
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:30,850
Okay, so here are the details for each of these that I've already discussed.

387
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:37,670
And I'm going to walk through these and we're going to look first at the kidney.

388
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:46,280
So the race stands for the renin angiotensin aldosterone system within the kidney.

389
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:57,490
And within the kids. Now, in terms of having problems with perfusion of the kidney,

390
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:09,159
let's say you have endothelial cell dysfunction or you have salt sensitivity in which you're absorbing more salt and excreting less of it,

391
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:19,960
or you have vascular injury. This is going to contribute to a reduction in the perfusion of the kidney lowering blood pressure.

392
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:31,390
So pressure nature, if this is a process by which whereby increases in renal perfusion pressure result in an enhanced sodium excretion.

393
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:40,959
Conversely, if you have more sodium retention and you have stable constriction within the

394
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:46,180
kidney under the influence of the urine and angiotensin aldosterone system,

395
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:54,240
you're going to increase blood pressure. So I'm going to go over again to what goes on in the heart.

396
00:51:54,250 --> 00:52:06,460
So the nature of peptides, these are coming from the atria and so they are monitoring how much stretch there is heart level of the atrium.

397
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:22,900
And so if that stretch increases, it can release this natural peptide that gets to the kidney that causes greater perfusion of the kidney.

398
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:27,489
You get some vasodilation, you get this pressure.

399
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:33,070
Pressure, nature is response. You excrete more sodium, you retain less fluid.

400
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,710
And this will lower your blood pressure.

401
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:45,800
So a journal nature and a peptide, and there's actually a brain nature added peptides that start to play a role in this response as well.

402
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:52,700
Now the endothelial cells are not passive in this process.

403
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:56,100
They secrete things that are that can be basal active.

404
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:04,370
So the prostate gland that I mentioned, prost, is cycling across the planet to are produced by the endothelial cells.

405
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:13,319
And in opposition to that you have things form the blood through boxing and other types of things that affect the vasculature,

406
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:20,970
the resistance to the vasculature. So salt sensitivity can affect endothelial function.

407
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:28,650
It can ultimately influence vascular tone. The endothelial cells also release nitric oxide.

408
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:33,210
So nitric oxide is that makes a dilator, reduces blood pressure.

409
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:42,390
And in opposition to that, there's and to feeling one which I mentioned earlier and this is a constrictor that increases blood pressure.

410
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:50,610
So, yeah, salt sensitivity, something that happens over time or is it something you kind of have as a child?

411
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,570
So I'll mention in the next in the subsequent slide.

412
00:53:55,470 --> 00:54:04,200
So with a central nervous system, this plays a really important role in supporting long term blood pressure.

413
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:11,720
So activation of the sympathetic nervous system in response to some kind of stimulus stress,

414
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:21,690
it could be something else that activates this catecholamine exercise can activate this catecholamines.

415
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,730
So what this does is that the catecholamines are released.

416
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:35,760
This occurs not only all over the body, through the vasculature, but in the kidneys themselves.

417
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:40,200
So the kidneys are actually innervated with the sympathetic nerves.

418
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:47,220
This increases the reabsorption of sodium and this increases blood pressure.

419
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:53,940
Then finally, there's the immune system that start to play a role, a role here.

420
00:54:54,930 --> 00:55:05,010
So within the kidneys now, you have some infiltration of immune cells that can influence salt sensitivity and increase blood pressure

421
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:11,910
in opposition to that under the influence of an inflammatory immune population to regulatory cells.

422
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:16,890
This can fold that down. It can lower blood pressure.

423
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:24,510
So if you have an environment where you have pro-inflammatory T cells, in this case is ath1 cells,

424
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:30,630
you can have an increase in blood pressure in response to immune system activation.

425
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,840
All right. Salt sensitivity. What is salt sensitivity?

426
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:40,550
It's a marked elevation in blood pressure following a load of sodium.

427
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:48,469
So if you give somebody five grams of sodium and if you're some kind of a liquid or

428
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:52,280
another way to adjust this and you watch your blood pressure increase over time.

429
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:59,690
If you had salt sensitivity, it would mean that your blood pressure, your systolic blood pressure,

430
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:06,110
would increase by at least ten milligrams a day over a few hours or within a few hours, I should say.

431
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:12,200
And if you satisfy their requirement, then you would have salt sensitivity.

432
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:24,410
What causes salt sensitivity? Well, perhaps there is an underlying and a feeling of dysfunction in response to that salt load.

433
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:29,720
This can be due to genetic and environmental influences.

434
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:35,569
So if you are chronically exposed to high salt intake,

435
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:45,950
this is an environmental affluence influence in which you can raise your blood pressure as a consequence to this increased sodium load,

436
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:52,460
making you salt having not raised blood pressure in response to this particular stimulus.

437
00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:10,790
So the average average amount of sodium chloride in our diet, but I think it's close to three grams per day, something like that.

438
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:13,930
And the threshold is 2.3 grams a day.

439
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:18,440
So we're above well above these thresholds for 400 milligrams.

440
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:22,610
So that again, I think it's a 3400 milligrams.

441
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:26,050
3400 million people average. Yeah. Wow.

442
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:31,400
And we're the threshold is 2300 right way above this threshold.

443
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:39,920
And this is a significant contributing factor to the prevalence of hypertension in this country.

444
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:48,020
So this is more detail about how the renin angiotensin system works.

445
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:54,200
So the scenario starts here and this is the macula.

446
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,710
And I put another little bit here to show you what this whole thing looks like.

447
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:05,790
So we're looking at macula tensor senses, the low fluid flow or low sodium concentration.

448
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:10,610
And here's the just checks to glomerular cells and they secrete.

449
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:23,759
So readiness circulates in your blood and rennet converts angiotensin in angiotensin one that circulates in your blood and that

450
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:33,830
angiotensin one goes to your the blood within your lungs and within your lungs you have the angiotensin converting enzyme.

451
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:40,730
You have the conversion to angiotensin two, which is a phase of constrictor.

452
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:45,560
So this causes widespread days of constricted, fatal constriction.

453
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:52,490
Angiotensin two can also stimulate the adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone.

454
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:59,750
This is a mineralocorticoid that is responsible for stimulating sodium uptake.

455
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:06,500
This this is going to occur within the apical cells and the membranes in the distal convoluted tubules.

456
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:17,510
We also have the release of anti diuretic hormones, anti-democratic hormone causes afriforum's to move to the collecting dust,

457
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,020
the classical membrane which increases water reabsorption.

458
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:31,190
So this is the process in which the angiotensin aldosterone system increases blood pressure over the long term.

459
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:36,150
All right? Yeah. Diuretics?

460
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:40,860
Yes. So you're going to. You're going to.

461
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:45,650
Two things are going to happen with the diuretics. You're going to pick up.

462
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:50,339
You're going to urinate right over one machine and you're going to lose sodium,

463
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:53,640
you're going to lose water, and you're going to lose potassium through this as well.

464
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:58,290
There are some drugs that are potassium sparing and some that are not.

465
00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:05,970
So people who are on the drugs that are not potassium sparing, diuretics, they have to take this potassium supplement.

466
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:18,500
Yeah. So this renin angiotensin aldosterone is elevated or activated more to stress,

467
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:24,480
some sort of salt load that the sympathetic nervous system is activated.

468
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,770
So it's a stress point. You've got to remember that.

469
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:38,340
Yeah, you can have a sympathetic response in terms of the stress response, but physical activity activates the sympathetic nervous system as well.

470
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:42,840
So if you're moving, if you're climbing stairs, if you're exercising.

471
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:48,510
All of these things are going to raise your blood pressure to perfusion of tissues

472
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:54,120
so that you can do more physical activity as you have lots of these devices.

473
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:54,900
So you can do.

474
01:00:57,010 --> 01:01:06,209
Yeah, I have a two part question, tying it in to like a medication like metformin as a side effect of metformin, like increased urination.

475
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:23,340
So like. So metformin and not having taking metformin makes you put out more sodium.

476
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,780
The second part of the question. I don't know.

477
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:40,809
I don't know. So here's here's more detail on this in terms of where these concerns are and the impact

478
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:46,719
that they have in the purpose of having this slide is not to be overly redundant,

479
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:55,360
but to bring into play here the, um, angiotensin two receptors, 81 and 82.

480
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:59,860
And they have different effects on blood pressure.

481
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:09,700
So we have the same things that I've gone over here in terms of the metabolism of angiotensin again, giving you angiotensin two.

482
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:18,390
And then here's the angiotensin converting enzyme two that you've heard a lot, a lot about in regard to SARS-CoV-2.

483
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:22,500
Um, this is expressed in your lungs as well,

484
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:30,690
but the receptor angiotensin one seven and angiotensin two receptors are things that lower blood pressure.

485
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:37,140
So this receptor now when activated by angiotensin, it can have a lowering effect,

486
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:44,160
but predominantly you're going to have with angiotensin two now an increase in blood pressure through these mechanisms.

487
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:49,680
So muscle cell contraction and suspended phase of constriction,

488
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:59,940
increase in peripheral vascular resistance to aldosterone release more sodium retention and less renal and ancillary blood flow.

489
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:10,300
The reason why I brought this out is there are drugs now that can inhibit these receptors that are used to treat people who have hypertension.

490
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:15,060
And I'll mention that this is the very last kind of drugs that are used to treat the condition.

491
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:27,240
So how does excess adiposity and impaired metabolic control and obesity increase the risk of hypertension?

492
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:33,090
You don't have to have a BMI of 30. If you have excess adiposity, this can it can happen.

493
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:38,400
So there's actually within adipose tissue.

494
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:45,030
There's a mechanism which nature naturally a peptide is actually sequester broken out.

495
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:56,110
There's increased adipose tissue derived angiotensin levels to the adipose tissue itself in addition to the kidney can produce more angiotensin.

496
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:04,500
There is, in addition to this, an increase in renal rent and production.

497
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:11,310
There's increased microvascular dysfunction perhaps related to end of feeling one.

498
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:16,440
And if you have a condition in which you have chronic systemic inflammation,

499
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:21,480
just can also contribute to having an increase in blood pressure as a consequence.

500
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:30,010
I think the reading mentioned actually physical pressure on the kidney in terms of an expanded adipose tissue.

501
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:39,989
So if you had somebody who has like a -40, perhaps they have very high levels of visceral, adipose tissue.

502
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:46,260
This can actually compress the kidney. This in itself can cause an increase in blood pressure.

503
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:58,419
So this diagram explains how excessive adipose tissue can affect nature in a peptide.

504
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:02,820
So the plasma levels in terms of nature, a peptide.

505
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:10,990
This is the one that's released by the atria in response to having too much stress stretch.

506
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:22,420
So the levels are lower and with this effect you have more insulin resistance and more mitochondrial dysfunction,

507
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:34,120
resulting in hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia and ectopic lipid deposition associated with having excess adipose tissue.

508
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:43,510
And then within the adipose tissue there's this nature adding peptide degrading receptor that's increased in the adequate tissue itself.

509
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:52,300
So this particular effect now lowers plasma natural peptide levels.

510
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:59,530
And this diagram explains all of the other things that were mentioned on that list.

511
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:10,030
So adipose tissue makes leptin and the correlation between adipose tissue very thin.

512
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:15,850
So if you look at the r-value, it's like .0.9.

513
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:20,110
It's almost one in terms of level of adiposity and leptin levels.

514
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:24,800
Leptin actually stimulates the sympathetic nervous system.

515
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:33,860
So with an increase in sympathetic nervous system, you have all of these pathways now that can increase blood pressure in the kidney.

516
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:42,860
We get. You get mad course tissue more of this and you're intelligent you get higher levels

517
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:52,830
of angiotensin two that affect the adrenal gland to to produce the mineralocorticoid.

518
01:06:53,300 --> 01:07:00,500
You have a phase of constriction in the arterials contributing to greatest lot of pressure.

519
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:14,510
Okay. So. It's there. Is there a way to look at the contribution of leptin to this elevation of blood pressure?

520
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:22,860
Well, what leptin is thought to do is start to affect primarily systemic blood pressure in terms of systolic blood pressure.

521
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:27,140
So here we're looking at two different groups of individuals.

522
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:33,350
So we have blood pressure, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure.

523
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:44,710
And you have 11 deficient patients and 42 age and BMI matched controls.

524
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:49,730
And there's a little bit of a difference in terms of that systolic blood pressure between these two groups.

525
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:59,360
If you look at in this case, people who have had deficiency, they don't have a leptin receptor.

526
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:08,270
And you look at people who are age and BMI matched, you find that the systolic pressure is elevated.

527
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:20,780
And the age matching groups compared to people who have less leptin receptor deficiency but no difference in the diastolic blood pressure.

528
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:27,400
If you were to measure arterial pressure, you would see no difference.

529
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:34,790
So the main effect of leptin here in humans is on the systolic blood pressure measure.

530
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:46,280
So in this final portion, we're looking at a change in mean arterial blood pressure after 19 weeks of

531
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:51,950
people who have undergone a weight loss protocol and both the controls and the

532
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:57,920
individuals who have left a deficiency and people who who have normal leptin

533
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:04,819
receptor expression at high levels have to be able to go this weight loss.

534
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:11,540
There's this significant change in their mean arterial blood pressure, but there's nothing deficient.

535
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:16,520
Individuals say they experience the same amount of weight loss.

536
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:20,840
They don't see an improvement, a hard reduction in their blood pressure.

537
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,950
It's a much lower drop in their blood pressure.

538
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:37,900
So this is in humans now demonstrating the role of leptin and its ability to affect systolic blood pressure.

539
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:51,200
All right. So one of the first things that a physician will say to somebody who's got hypertension or they're on their way

540
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:57,050
to having elevated blood pressure is they'll say you need to go through this lifestyle modification program.

541
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:03,170
And evidence for lifestyle modification goes back to the diabetes prevention program,

542
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:09,440
not only in preventing diabetes, but preventing hypertension and other types of chronic diseases.

543
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:22,340
So in this particular figure, you're seeing the same groups that we talked about before, people that were given just rice alone in a and a placebo.

544
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:33,730
People that were given metformin and advice. And then people that were engaged in this intensive lifestyle intervention with dietician regularly.

545
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:38,910
They met groups and they were monitoring their food intake.

546
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:47,720
They're reducing their food intake. They were increasing their physical activity through walking five days a week, 150 minutes per week.

547
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:56,540
And this is what happened to their blood pressure over time or terms of, I should say, hypertension, prevalence over time.

548
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:05,300
So this is a baseline that the participants with hypertension shown here in black.

549
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:12,990
And then the different bars correspond to the percentages of people with hypertension over time.

550
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:20,590
So you see placebo. We're seeing an increase in the prevalence of hypertension after three years,

551
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,880
people who were just given metformin about the same in terms of their prevalence of hypertension.

552
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:36,070
But the people who engage in this lifestyle modification program are seeing no significant change in

553
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:44,200
the prevalence of hypertension or the the participants with hypertension in this particular study.

554
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:53,290
So a lifestyle management of obesity related hypertension,

555
01:11:53,290 --> 01:12:00,280
the first thing that will be mentioned and recommended is this intensive lifestyle intervention.

556
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:07,980
There's diet modification. There's the dietary approaches to stop hypertension diet.

557
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:14,020
This is a low sodium diet, which includes lots of fruits and vegetables to increase potassium levels.

558
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:20,980
This is very effective as well. There's also an increase in physical activity that's mentioned.

559
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:29,770
And this is something that just about anybody can do is just just to retain your physical activity for 30 minutes a day.

560
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:42,070
So what do I mean by raising your physical activity, your increasing your physical activity such that it increases your heart rate?

561
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:50,530
You might think that, but you can still talk normal, raising your physical activity for 30 minutes a day.

562
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:57,640
You can do this. Whether you have access to recreational facilities are not.

563
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:02,650
You can do this and walking around in your apartment or your house or climbing stairs or whatever the case might be.

564
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:14,970
Alcohol, moderation. So I mentioned that excessive alcohol intake was associated with an increase in hypertension,

565
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:25,140
and reducing alcohol intake has been shown to improve high blood pressure and behavior modification.

566
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:36,260
How do you respond to stress? Do you blow up and get upset or do you seek out other types of responses to that,

567
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:45,090
that stress that can reduce or regulate your blood pressure in a more positive way?

568
01:13:49,510 --> 01:14:02,740
So in many papers we talk about the increase in hypertension associated with obesity to refer to this particular paper.

569
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:11,510
So in this particular paper, you had a large group of individuals who had bariatric surgery.

570
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:21,370
So in this particular example, you had about 200 people or 184 people who had the gastric bypass surgery.

571
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:24,430
So this would be the gastric bypass procedure.

572
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:31,960
Last lecture, we're going to go over gastric bypass surgery, bariatric surgery.

573
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:39,640
So the body mass index of these individuals was 40, 43 to 50 something.

574
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:43,750
So we're talking about people who will have a very high PMI.

575
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:52,810
So in this particular example, we don't use morbidly obese patients that terminology anymore.

576
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:59,470
You would say class three obesity to describe this level of BMI being over 40.

577
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:10,600
The black line represents all of the patients and the red line represents that those with that who had a BMI starting at above 50.

578
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:14,290
So after bariatric surgery, their BMI goes down.

579
01:15:15,190 --> 01:15:23,980
But notice that everyone's BMI is still above 30 after this procedure and this is months after surgery.

580
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:29,200
And then this is everyone, just about everyone five years later.

581
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:39,410
Okay. But what happens to the percentage of people who have hypertension after this time?

582
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:46,780
So there are a number of co-morbidities listed here that improve in the positive direction.

583
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:48,310
Your response to this surgery.

584
01:15:49,240 --> 01:16:01,660
And this particular table shows you that the percentage of people who have hypertension before at baseline and then five years later, so it goes down.

585
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:15,470
And this would occur in people who had less than that BMI, 50 or greater than a BMI 50 during this time period, starting out starting out at baseline.

586
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:21,280
So looking at the breakdown, systolic and diastolic blood pressure values,

587
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:31,240
we see a lowering of both systolic and diastolic values after people have had this bariatric surgery,

588
01:16:31,810 --> 01:16:37,540
even though they're still on the obese category, they still have a BMI of 30 and over.

589
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:45,720
People starting out at 50 or above 40 had the procedure done, is lowered to five years.

590
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:57,730
The surgery, this is an example of the dash eating plan.

591
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:07,570
So on the dash eating plan, this is the goals that you set for people or grain consumptions, 6 to 8 servings per day.

592
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:20,680
I'm an example how the serving would be one slice of whole grain, bread or vegetables, 4 to 5 servings per day, and I believe this is 4 to 5.

593
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:24,350
And for fruits and vegetables, this is recommended for everyone.

594
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:33,370
Peanut butter even not in the DASH program. So lots of fruits and vegetables to increase your intake of potassium.

595
01:17:35,290 --> 01:17:39,940
Dairy products are mentioned here. Cup of yogurt, low fat or fat free?

596
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:44,260
There are other substitutions that could be used here. Fats and oils.

597
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:49,360
You want to limit your intake of saturated fats.

598
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:55,480
You want to consume lean sources of protein.

599
01:17:57,130 --> 01:18:00,520
You want to increase your consumption of nuts, seeds and legumes.

600
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:09,310
And you want to limit your intake of things that are high in sugar and fat

601
01:18:09,730 --> 01:18:13,310
in terms of candy and other types of things that will contain lots of sugar.

602
01:18:13,330 --> 01:18:17,350
So you want to limit this amount of these things in your diet.

603
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:26,560
In the DASH program. And it's been shown to be very effective in reducing blood pressure in individuals with hypertension.

604
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:31,980
And we might touch on this later. And so maybe it should be tabled.

605
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:40,440
But just since there's often a co-morbidity of CKD and unfortunately like all these recommendations,

606
01:18:41,370 --> 01:18:45,310
if you have end stage renal failure, you can't do any of them.

607
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:51,629
And yeah, so chronic or chronic renal disease is another that's a whole nother issue in terms of what

608
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:59,940
people are advised to reduce their protein intake and potassium and potassium as well.

609
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:03,929
So that's really complicated situation. So Maria has a comment, the back of the report.

610
01:19:03,930 --> 01:19:12,059
Yeah. So there is a shift in that paradigm in terms of chronic kidney disease management that we are now paying more attention to

611
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:22,680
plant based diets and there seems to be a benefit better for small prevention and slower progression to later stage of CKD.

612
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:34,050
And that has to do with other elements of the diet in terms of bioavailability, of potassium and phosphorus and it has to do with high doses.

613
01:19:34,530 --> 01:19:41,570
So it is a little bit more complicated than how we used to deal with it, which is separate nutrients and changing numbers.

614
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:47,550
And with committee. Yeah, I have a question on slide 31.

615
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:51,090
Again, with the hypertension gastric bypass.

616
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:58,334
Yes, I'm just trying to read it because I feel like only under all patients it looks like the ones that.
