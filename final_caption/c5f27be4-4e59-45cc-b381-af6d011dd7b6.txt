1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:08,580
Any sense of humor there?

2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,710
Yeah, there were. They haven't been drinking, I suppose.

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,510
Yeah, that's true.

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,550
That's, I think that's an experience.

5
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,649
And like the one. Yeah. It's applicable to.

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:38,680
So. Yeah. That's something else I think.

7
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:55,170
Yeah. But now I have my. Most of my family came here.

8
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:08,900
And even now, if you.

9
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,610
Well, yeah, I guess I was.

10
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,650
Okay. So good morning, everyone. Happy Friday.

11
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:58,360
What we're going to do today is. Uh, about three things.

12
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:04,310
So the first hour we're going to talk about, um, goals and situation analysis.

13
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,230
Um, and that's going to be an important part of putting together your project plan.

14
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:14,000
So we're going to talk about that a little more. Do some exercises around that.

15
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,960
We'll take a short break and then we'll talk about personas.

16
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,780
And then I'll I'll give you a little rundown of some of your upcoming assignments.

17
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,900
And even though your personas are due immediately, it is something you'll start to work on.

18
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:37,580
So, um, I want to start to talk about that excitement and help you think about how you might prepare for that.

19
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:45,559
And then, um, the last hour of class, I know you have two upcoming assignments with your groups,

20
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,110
and I just put you into groups this week, so I want to give you that time to connect with each other.

21
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:58,220
Meet face to face. Um, I'm happy to go around and answer any questions, so that's what we'll all do today.

22
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,790
So next question. Okay.

23
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:10,040
Um. So, um. Want to talk about goals and objectives.

24
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:22,690
So so what is this? So when we think about an overall program goal, the thing we're really thinking about is like overall health improvement.

25
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,940
Most of the projects we're working on really are they're related to health.

26
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,640
We're at a school of public health. So, you know, when we're thinking about a program goal, um,

27
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:43,630
overall health improvement that the health communication program or product is really planning to achieve is really the end goal.

28
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:54,010
And so why do we do this? Um, can you think of examples where having or not having really clear goals and objectives really backfire?

29
00:03:54,490 --> 00:04:02,410
Um, or can you think of examples where this was really done well, when you think about maybe a health communication product,

30
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:10,390
uh, uh, health program, you know, why, why are what goals and objectives relevant?

31
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:18,820
And where have you seen this go wrong? Or perhaps done really well.

32
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,750
Uh, Darius.

33
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:38,970
And you just need to clear your head with your friends, which means that what you're hearing is that you're not trying to protect the most vulnerable.

34
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,000
This is a very clear goal that you try to get through.

35
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,550
And so these are. Yeah.

36
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:54,220
So it has a lot of relevance in terms of guideposts, like what what ends up actually being communicated.

37
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:00,320
Yeah. I was going to ask about, you know what? That fire's going down like the rabbit hole.

38
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:06,540
Like, oftentimes I've seen, like the goals are to find like everyone has kind of like their own priority.

39
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:12,959
So, like, they'll end up trying to do too many things at once and then a lot more conflict, I feel like happens.

40
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,710
And then you're not really sure what you're doing to focus on projects and then you're like, What are we actually doing?

41
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,380
And then the outcome is just muddied and not effective.

42
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,120
Yeah, to the points that have already been made,

43
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,530
I think ultimately goals and objectives really help you because I feel like communications is already difficult as it is.

44
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:43,320
And I think the art of trying to effectively communicate, especially hope messaging, you have to have some type of clear intent is what I did.

45
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,440
And then the second point is this is kind of left field, but I feel like if you don't have clear goals and objectives,

46
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,930
you're probably not going to get any funding or any endorsements for your your communications campaign.

47
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:02,069
I think whoever is once again the communications campaign that you're going to want to see exactly where

48
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:08,250
are you communications and who and why and what are the intended outcomes from the communications.

49
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,769
Yeah, so that's a that's a great point.

50
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:23,639
So in terms of being more and more mindful of how we're using funds, um, being very clear and methodical and that's what funders are working for.

51
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:33,900
Like, do, like is, is the end game here in terms of what you're trying to describe, have any of you ever picked up any sort of information pamphlet,

52
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:41,820
whether that's like in health care or outside of health care, which is have like lots of information around a topic.

53
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,489
Um, you know, did you ever walk away with it wondering what was their goal here?

54
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:55,139
Was it to really like shower me with information about this one thing, one topic in all different directions or, you know,

55
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:01,799
what was the purpose or were they trying to teach me about prevention or were they trying to teach me about risk factors?

56
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:13,950
Like what? What was their purpose here? Um, so, so we do see definitely a lot of that, but um, like you guys have already offered, you know,

57
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:22,029
the gist of it is it can make or break a program or a health communication or, um, a product you're trying to get into the hands of consumers.

58
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:26,230
So it's really comes down to make or break. Um.

59
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:31,860
So what are the different types of objectives that we have?

60
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,190
So there are three behavioral, social and typically organizational.

61
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,970
So when we think about behavioral objectives, these are actions.

62
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:55,200
Why do we want our audience to do? What are key actions that may lead to a decrease or an increase perhaps in incidence, morbidity or mortality?

63
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:03,750
And then social objectives are typically what policy or new practice should be implemented and institutionalized.

64
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,080
And when we think about organizational objectives,

65
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:13,230
how organizations should be perceived or act in relation to the health issue or be supported in its mission.

66
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:18,179
And we want to hit all of these typically and what we're trying to do.

67
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,180
But at the same time, we want to limit the number of goals.

68
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,219
We don't want 80 goals. And the one thing we're trying to do, because, again,

69
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:35,430
we then become unfocused and it becomes really challenging to figure out how do we where do we sort of concentrate our efforts.

70
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,379
So when we do set up goals and objectives,

71
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,640
the best set up is really like what you're really trying to communicate and

72
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:51,060
what you're writing up is who will do or change what by when and by how much.

73
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,840
So there's a who element to it. Who is our audience?

74
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,589
What are you trying to tell them to do? What do you want them to do?

75
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:02,820
That's really a behavior and action by when.

76
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,299
So there needs to be a time frame. And then by how much?

77
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,690
What is the magnitude? Sometimes we call this effect size.

78
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,290
By what magnitude of change do we hope to see?

79
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:28,870
So, um. Typically, I imagine many of you have heard of smart goals, smart objectives that I see a lot of nodding.

80
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:37,750
This this really captures what I just said. You want to be specific, measurable, appropriate.

81
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,650
And the goal should really reflect the audience needs and preferences.

82
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:49,420
They need to be realistic. Like, can this be realistically achieved in the timeframe and the resources that you have to do this?

83
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,670
And again, can they timely? Can they be achieved within a specific time frame?

84
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:00,530
And you often said, how do we you know, how do we get data around this?

85
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,390
You often want to validate your objectives against existing data or a literature review.

86
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:10,550
Um, you know, when we, um, for example, think about.

87
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,560
Diabetes programs. Um, you know, what do we know about, uh,

88
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:25,169
a magnitude of change that sometimes these programs on the aggregate bring to us to get get

89
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:32,549
people's diabetes to a level of control if you're thinking about disease control as an outcome.

90
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:41,580
So we often look at existing data in the literature to really benchmark the types of magnitude changes we're hoping to see.

91
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:50,910
So I want to just illustrate a few examples of a program goal, behavioral objective and a communication objective.

92
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:57,719
So a program goal might be to reduce the incidence and mortality of adult melanoma cases

93
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,870
associated with early and excessive sun exposure during childhood and by the year 2025.

94
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,530
So, you know, when I see this, I see this as being a.

95
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:17,680
But a larger a broad program that really aims to reduce incidence and mortality.

96
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:24,879
So it doesn't really specify how we're going about that. It's not clear, like, is this like health, education?

97
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,670
Is this self-management? Is this community organizing?

98
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:39,250
Is this health communication? It's an overall program that can encompass a lot of these things that aim to reduce incidence and mortality.

99
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:47,830
Then we have that behavioral objective. So by 2024, 5% of U.S. parents who live in Florida will use sunscreen,

100
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:54,880
sun hats and other preventative measures to protect their children from prolonged and excessive sun exposure.

101
00:11:54,910 --> 00:12:01,690
So what's key here is you see a lot of actions that you want people to be taking,

102
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,960
using sunscreen, wearing sun hats, engaging in other preventative measures.

103
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:18,100
And there's a clear magnitude increase by which they're aiming to see many of these actions and behaviors increase.

104
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:27,000
And then we have a communication objective by year 2020 for you,

105
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:35,760
10% of U.S. parents who live in Florida will be aware of the association between excessive sun exposure during childhood and risk of adult melanoma.

106
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:46,500
They'll be able to define excessive sun exposure. So here, what's key is, is really action oriented words around what a communication aims to do.

107
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:52,889
Communications aim to build awareness, increase knowledge, um, things like that.

108
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:56,460
Things communications are they process through our minds.

109
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:03,360
So what is it's really, you know, what is happening in our mind that relates to the outcomes of interest here,

110
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,980
um, as it relates to a communication objective.

111
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:15,059
And I posted these slides today because the next thing I want you guys to do is an activity around,

112
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,960
um, program goals, um, behavioral objectives and communication objectives.

113
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:26,160
And so feel free to look at these slides in these examples as you think about creating them.

114
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:32,010
So right now with your projects, you have like a really small description.

115
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,580
Some are actually way too vague. And you.

116
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,490
Yeah, what are you asking me to do?

117
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:44,640
So, you know, when you have your preceptor meetings or become very, very clear based on the questions you'll be asking them.

118
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,110
But part of your project plan will be to create program goals,

119
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:56,040
behavioral objectives and communication objectives, um, for the products that you're creating.

120
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,870
Um, and so what I want us to do is do an exercise.

121
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:07,140
I'm going to give you a brief description of an organization and what they want to create.

122
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:12,839
It's very brief, and I want you guys to think about, um, program goals,

123
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:18,470
communication objectives and behavioral objectives that, um, may come out of this.

124
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:27,270
And what I'm hoping that you get out of this exercise is what kind of questions do you need to ask your preceptors to get at creating,

125
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:36,330
um, sound objectives and goals with your project plan and subsequently to guide your project through the semester?

126
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:41,880
So we have four descriptions that I'm going to give you.

127
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,910
Um, semi large paper. So I want you to write them on here.

128
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:56,319
I'm going to give you three pieces. So write your communication objective program goal and behavioral objective on separate pieces.

129
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,770
And then after you've met with your group, we'll do a rotation.

130
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:06,730
So you'll look at what another group created with another description and, you know, critique it,

131
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:15,680
add to it maybe it was sort of spot on or maybe, you know, you can add to it or there need to be corrections.

132
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,390
So, so we'll do a little bit of that. So any questions?

133
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:28,510
Okay. So go ahead and get into groups of four by divide yourselves into four.

134
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:38,160
Um, just with folks around you doesn't need to be your project groups and then I'll assign you a description and you'll,

135
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,190
you'll work on program goals, behavioral objectives and communication objectives.

136
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:07,400
Yeah. Other wisdom on his part.

137
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:15,510
Yes, I know.

138
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:25,450
Okay, so we have a group right here, so [INAUDIBLE] be one, right?

139
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:43,629
Whereas the second person, I assume two or three of them are you guys and then there's three of them.

140
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:47,790
So maybe yeah. We can produce a write it out. So.

141
00:16:49,660 --> 00:17:03,280
Okay. So do half of you want to join a group over here and a group over here and then you'll be in the group or.

142
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:14,800
One, two, three, four.

143
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:19,490
Yes. Okay. You didn't do anything wrong.

144
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:31,780
So when I say that, I can join either the student industry.

145
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:40,350
So there's only four groups. So, yeah, I thought it was going to be like this.

146
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:45,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

147
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:56,810
You know, it's another.

148
00:18:47,100 --> 00:19:27,560
That was. And you know.

149
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,910
Especially because it says like that, it will be informed by that.

150
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:47,320
And so to me, that's a pretty yeah, yeah.

151
00:19:48,020 --> 00:20:15,940
I was over at first when I was 16 years old, which I was so close to my heart.

152
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:25,340
To heart. There's nothing wrong with that.

153
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:33,870
That makes sense. Okay.

154
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:46,130
Okay. Here we go. I didn't see anything.

155
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,080
Yeah, I heard you said you mentioned.

156
00:20:52,820 --> 00:21:05,580
So it isn't giving you what particular one because it was also it could be like awareness on screen or it could be adopted behavior,

157
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:13,960
like when I was one of those processing houses.

158
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:24,500
And I think that one of the behavioral engineers, one or two of them, is the reason, I guess like release for acquisition.

159
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:30,980
And then the promotion, I guess I do positions on those Hyatt Regency type of environment where they are,

160
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,459
the messaging is around their husbands and patients in that position.

161
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:46,190
And I was like, Yeah, that's kind of interesting because like physician is giving to the phones.

162
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:50,810
Like, why don't they just talk about what it's like? Like here it seems, yeah.

163
00:21:51,920 --> 00:22:03,500
There's like, there's this brochure on how to talk to the families, but you can't talk about this.

164
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:22,550
I was thinking of what's that got to do with that?

165
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:46,550
Yeah, I was like, I listen to them as an awareness of what it means to be very dirty.

166
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:51,500
Right. So communication directed to be like by this time,

167
00:22:51,500 --> 00:23:01,280
this is much of our population at least is going to be aware of screening guidelines for just hurry back and take you through my this time.

168
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,750
This may not have completed isn't it?

169
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,290
That was an honor.

170
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:29,770
And I don't write this down here. I think this is a place right now where we're going to help prevent that.

171
00:23:31,040 --> 00:24:07,180
Yeah, I read my partner with your business was very much an integrated significant infrastructure manager, started to get on this and I love it.

172
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:27,590
I think we're going to start to engage in whether Jackson and I use my time and resolution to be distributed by physicians working with and.

173
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:44,040
Oh said she couldn't.

174
00:24:44,310 --> 00:25:05,480
I was so told the entire program designed by U.S. companies to reduce their dividends.

175
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:13,730
Yeah. So maybe they.

176
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:22,880
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

177
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:38,640
Yeah. Right. Improve the health and welfare system and responsive life without it.

178
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:49,140
And it's going to be something that's very,

179
00:25:54,930 --> 00:26:16,950
very difficult in the U.S. And that's why we think it's quite a bit farther to

180
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:41,930
be around for any interest rate is not quite as important as you're saying.

181
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,910
That's what I said. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

182
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,200
Exactly. Yeah, that's what I would say that.

183
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:13,560
What is it like seven, eight years. Is that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

184
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:45,630
I mean, looking at them or just being able to look at specific times and I guess, you know, something like that.

185
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:52,070
But I don't think that's right.

186
00:27:53,160 --> 00:28:04,500
Yeah. So I guess we're getting very late.

187
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:14,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

188
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:24,270
Yeah. We're like morbidity and mortality or disease.

189
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:34,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess by tsunami in some cases.

190
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:57,240
And so need more and more people, you know, or we can just say either like we're going to be improving through the primary prevention.

191
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:10,229
Yes that's or you right. Are you ready bringing those forms with at least for now it's like they're like yeah okay I'll,

192
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:16,180
I'll like scribble before I do the whole I got them so.

193
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,540
Oh okay.

194
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:32,700
So by link they gave it to me and to, to or so.

195
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:38,790
Through the Johnson and Johnson areas.

196
00:29:38,790 --> 00:30:14,290
We are learning how to improve their objective, to close it very much.

197
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:29,820
I think just having something like that feels good to know that we are trying to accomplish things.

198
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:52,860
So when we shift managers, I think sometimes we know that prior years about why we're doing that because I mean,

199
00:30:52,860 --> 00:31:00,200
that is the reason that we've come to talk to you there.

200
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:17,180
You're. Yeah, I think so.

201
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:22,380
But I think so.

202
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:36,460
Yeah. Because we represent the goals the businesses are playing in the whole issue of how to write that.

203
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:41,810
Because they're both men, you know?

204
00:31:42,600 --> 00:32:00,490
Yeah. I think what you're thinking is the reason they are very were giving you that you might have the ring finger.

205
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:08,810
You know, that's something that I couldn't resist.

206
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:16,490
Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

207
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:42,730
I think the awareness is that, you know, I think no, maybe one or two years ago, they were like, oh, she was like, five years ago.

208
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:47,950
Yeah. Yeah.

209
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:58,600
I think that the families. Oh, yeah.

210
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:08,770
Oh, yeah.

211
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:22,690
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know how long they go through right now.

212
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:31,120
You mentioned something else.

213
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:43,890
That's one thing I would like where I.

214
00:33:44,970 --> 00:34:03,880
I know. I think that's why I'm glad I said $2,000 or maybe something like that.

215
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:23,770
And in fact, every single person for different reasons for doing what you are doing.

216
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:35,610
But it doesn't seem to be right now.

217
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:41,440
I was in the writers room and so forth.

218
00:34:42,940 --> 00:35:07,370
Yeah, well, I think we're going to get ready for that.

219
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:13,910
Are you sure?

220
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:31,540
Yeah. Just to increase awareness of the importance of reading and think about this whole situation from a little.

221
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,310
Do you hear me?

222
00:35:35,770 --> 00:36:03,510
So it's not like she's an old friend of hers and maybe, you know, finally, more access, more than somewhere between five and 10 minutes.

223
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,000
Do you think you'll be ready to switch? Yes. Yeah. Okay.

224
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:11,710
Okay. Important.

225
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:38,190
So that's an hour which appears to have happened just before the elections.

226
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:56,610
So I just wanted to increase to some experts material.

227
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:24,570
I mean, I don't even know that we want to actually be increased by 2.3%.

228
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:47,410
So I think it we grow on the people that live Jackson area residents like you start out because you have certain things that are going on.

229
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:59,890
Yeah. I mean like I was actually encourage know.

230
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:12,650
Yeah. I guess like what do they want? And this is not something that they want her to transition from.

231
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:27,549
So I've been wanting to have a discussion and having this conversation how I

232
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:35,020
think to our if we could interpret that was something that was necessary to say,

233
00:38:36,550 --> 00:39:02,620
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because that's a very good to know what it is that should be because I do want to know why you just let things go wrong.

234
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:12,250
I think we're always going to be come out and make it hard.

235
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,410
Yeah. That's more like it isn't that.

236
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:41,230
I would like to see that they were the ones that everyone's going to want to carry out.

237
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:52,610
So we're like integrated people. So that's what we are.

238
00:39:54,820 --> 00:40:10,300
Yeah. Yeah. We don't even realize that you should definitely be aware of what you want.

239
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:17,240
And then second, which will be I don't know, I wonder about that.

240
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,790
So just like Mary. Really? Yeah.

241
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,069
What do you want to be clear here?

242
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,540
You know, I didn't tell you about it,

243
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:57,700
so I guess the real reason I'm going to so many wars and just become known is that it was their ability to discuss Holder after is a real quick.

244
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:08,320
Yeah. Actually we talked about when they were handing out.

245
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:25,460
So at the end of the hour, the album that really important we had to gather more lives is coming.

246
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:31,780
This is Chris Weitz.

247
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:38,079
I think he's just waiting a number to have another ready to go.

248
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,590
Which only because we're going with.

249
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:46,330
Yeah. Are we like sharing with a different group what we did or.

250
00:41:46,480 --> 00:42:02,950
I think so. We might have been reading as much as we could you know.

251
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:14,620
Okay. So erm several of you are wrapping up I think our last objective.

252
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:24,790
But as you do that I just want to give you some instructions. So I want you to send a representative, I pass on your materials to the next group.

253
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,100
So we have like group one, two, three, four.

254
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,600
So just do a circle and let them know.

255
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:35,620
Give them your handouts and let them know what a description you had.

256
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:41,050
And then whatever you whatever lands in your group, you're going to look at what they came up with.

257
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:49,810
Um, and, you know, do kind of like track changes, like review it, see if you have anything different there.

258
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:58,840
Maybe it's spot on and something you agree with, but spend some time as a group looking at what another group may have come up with.

259
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:06,480
You like to do something like that.

260
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:13,500
I think this is a book I have learned a lot from.

261
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,600
So that's a lot of history, I guess.

262
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:25,540
Thank you. I'm very happy with it. I think that's fair.

263
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:43,270
So, I mean, I guess if you know what I think, I would say, yes, sorry.

264
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:46,930
I've got the longest regards provider.

265
00:43:47,870 --> 00:44:16,149
And her immediate reaction to it is that this is so weird and this.

266
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:23,020
I don't like this. Yeah. There's nothing I can say to you.

267
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:32,490
I want to talk about these things really. Because I heard the proposition doesn't really just tell them, hey, yeah, let's talk about it later.

268
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:49,710
Should I do it? And then I think I was going to just say something about who would be able to negotiate with their primary care provider.

269
00:44:52,510 --> 00:45:01,450
Oh, wait. Okay, let's go ahead and switch.

270
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:06,339
And it's okay, like if you're okay. I think both groups completed all three.

271
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:15,040
But if you did that, that's okay. Um, that's just work for the next group to focus off that or pick up where you left off.

272
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:36,430
So go ahead as well. Then we got all my personal submissions and I don't feel like I have to put my hair right forever and all that stuff.

273
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:53,460
Like little bit. So. Yeah, but I will let you go and.

274
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:15,240
Oh, that's great. Yeah, I was reading them to think of a story.

275
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:22,060
I guess that's. How do you know?

276
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:30,130
Together. Yeah, like.

277
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:44,560
I mean, that's pretty much the school's freshman grade.

278
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,290
For more.

279
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:27,520
They said they would have reserves within 48 hours utilizing business.

280
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:54,190
And also, I believe within weeks of the next one, I was supposed to order business.

281
00:47:54,460 --> 00:48:06,580
This is just something that I feel like it was really the second thing that risk adding on to other groups.

282
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:15,649
Yeah. So I want to make sure you're aware that it's now yours.

283
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:18,700
So do what you feel you want to do.

284
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,000
It looks like, right? Sometimes it's just like. Why did you write on our behalf?

285
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:37,630
Yeah. Yeah. So, like, the movie was actually really like a refund, actually.

286
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:59,020
Like, you know, like the reader is only really, you know, it's like, yeah, I was doing this for you, and.

287
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:09,190
I just want to go straight to the actual.

288
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:17,919
What's going on with this?

289
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,220
I'm making more specific. Yeah.

290
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:30,969
Well, I think we just. They are they're excited.

291
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:35,210
You actually say, okay, yes. You're sure?

292
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:39,340
Or maybe be more like a program or something.

293
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:45,380
That. Yeah.

294
00:49:45,580 --> 00:50:05,680
So we want to make it very clear that the people doing the financial yourself or do

295
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:17,020
you think it's very interesting because like if we're just doing the right thing,

296
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:57,550
I'm like, you also see, I never saw a writer and I'm like, Oh, I kind of have to wait in line with all the people that are going.

297
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:05,290
I remember it, but I think it's pretty cool.

298
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,750
I think it's like, Yeah, I said you weren't quite sure, you know.

299
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:23,380
Yeah. Yeah. I think that she had revealed the overarching,

300
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:56,160
the results and then I was definitely going to party on it and that I think that whole year that I've just been clear.

301
00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:02,220
Yeah. Yeah. I'm hoping that the benefit.

302
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:13,040
She says. I never wanted to have kids there.

303
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:26,550
That was a great idea because they should be like, this is like a starting point for musicians or is it kind of like, you know, they're just curious.

304
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:34,380
I think the examples I mean, that's all we were doing.

305
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:46,620
We just weren't in it. Yeah, I think I mean, like some slight derivation their first show into these things and.

306
00:52:47,430 --> 00:53:00,900
Yeah, yeah. And then I think we're making this show that there is something about them.

307
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:22,320
They're not really, really like any more influence than the last time you saw them.

308
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:27,990
So I was like, Oh yeah.

309
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:33,210
So I was like, Oh yeah.

310
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:36,480
I was just trying to have a word. I just was like, definition.

311
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:55,060
And, you know, like what they really want to hear is that they didn't have anything like that.

312
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:35,230
It doesn't have anything to be put in a statement to say was actually yeah, I was thinking, yeah, yeah, yeah.

313
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:49,530
So we're actually trying to get as many models to try to illustrate that.

314
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:53,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure. So, like starting with you.

315
00:54:56,670 --> 00:55:00,899
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

316
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:11,340
Because we want to add that to increase with the appropriate program.

317
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:18,770
So yeah.

318
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:23,480
So then role is how do you end up in it?

319
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:31,770
Yeah, this is a good opportunity. I mean, I don't know how we should behave.

320
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:48,590
Well, I mean, I didn't know how I felt like I was.

321
00:55:50,160 --> 00:56:01,320
So I went over unexpectedly, like this has been presented to me.

322
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:06,850
So I guess for communication. Yeah.

323
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:24,660
Yeah, she's. But I want to share my responsibility on the scale of experience.

324
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:28,200
It's like when you're talking about objectives.

325
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:38,670
And so maybe instead of communication, it's more at the open.

326
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:54,360
As much as important ones actually support us, parents will be aware of the association and will get into the house.

327
00:56:55,050 --> 00:57:04,640
So it's not like, Oh, they should know by this condition.

328
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:16,870
So you just know that I'm not. I don't think I want to talk about that.

329
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:26,500
Yeah, that's exactly what I was trying to get that.

330
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:30,570
Yeah. Yeah, I know, I know.

331
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:44,080
I guess. Yeah. Just listening to you and stuff like that.

332
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:54,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

333
00:57:54,380 --> 00:58:01,800
We know. It's so interesting.

334
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:12,560
So I guess on,

335
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:33,270
on a positive note is you can tell when you got someone who may not be able to get

336
00:58:33,280 --> 00:59:05,690
more than 100% of the people out there that really believe in something like that.

337
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:14,100
Oh, okay. Yeah. So, like, I think we all do.

338
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:38,290
Yeah, I don't I don't really like that because I think one of the things that's one thing I want to remember from my.

339
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:48,480
Yeah. That's always a big scene. Is your advice on how, you know, I don't want everybody to.

340
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:56,610
Yeah, I really think that my whole life I always think that.

341
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:01,570
Okay, let's go ahead and come together.

342
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:08,319
I mean, I was studying along to the next group or.

343
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:12,550
No, no, I know. So, um,

344
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:26,860
what sort of came up with for you after going through this exercise and thinking about your projects and what's sort of coming down the pike for you?

345
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:31,899
I think one thing that we were having a lot of conversations about was the program

346
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:38,410
goal and whether it's more aligned with the broader mission of the program itself,

347
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:44,020
because we kind of felt like we were writing almost like the mission statement of the organization or if it's like

348
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:53,200
grounded in this exact like help communication sort of intervention that they're aiming to achieve or carry out.

349
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:57,070
So that's a great question. And my response is.

350
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:03,690
It's sort of in the middle. So it's not necessarily the mission statement of the organization.

351
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:12,830
An organization can have multiple programs, and it's perhaps this whole communication that's part of one of their programs.

352
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:19,999
Um, but something else that could be under that program is like six other things.

353
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:29,030
So, um. So one of the questions you might ask your preceptor with the project that they have, um, offered you is, you know,

354
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:36,950
as part of your organization, what program is this a part of and um, sort of branch of work of your organization.

355
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:43,250
And can you tell us more about that? What else came up for you guys?

356
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:56,010
Was this easy? You know, medium, medium, active ingredients, stocks and hands and details.

357
01:01:56,030 --> 01:02:04,180
And I'm shocked because all of the descriptions just kind of like the work that we would be doing during.

358
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:11,210
And so kind of thinking through is this an objective for like hard work or organization?

359
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:22,010
So like is the objective to like create this product or is the objective for the reasons I have the password?

360
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:28,340
But yeah, we're just kind of sometimes. So, yeah.

361
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:35,990
So then, you know, thinking about that and stepping out of having given the fact that you'll be meeting with your preceptors next week,

362
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:45,230
what kinds of things come to mind that you might do to steer your project in a different direction, given the description you have?

363
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:58,040
Like, would you want to understand what? I think the bigger picture would be, yeah, more like Christ that we see like the force of nature.

364
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:03,280
So yeah, you know, they're just working for separate that thing.

365
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:09,920
Yeah. Yeah. So probably a lot of questions came to mind that you might already start filling

366
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,210
out for your questions for preceptor assignments to help with that objective.

367
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:25,129
Yeah. Yeah. I was going to ask about that status review or having that would be like based on like I didn't feel like having objectives defined.

368
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:32,360
So it always imagined like we would get like a project brief and like if I handed that to someone, I was like, are they going to know what to do?

369
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:40,540
Like, are they going to know what like really like more detailed, like, steps do we need to be like we're going to redesign the website, okay.

370
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:44,750
Like, or do we need to redesign about the website? Like, is it navigation?

371
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:49,490
Is it the imagery is so like really defining like what actually you do.

372
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:58,130
So I, I find more detail to be helpful and not like so detailed where it's like outlining the entire process for you.

373
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:03,350
But, and after you understand, like what the real understanding,

374
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:07,160
like what the larger goal is and like how those objectives are aligned into that goal.

375
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:12,530
Yeah. And sometimes people can give you a large brief around that and that's not even there.

376
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:19,490
So a conversation can really help bring that out or um, you know, help sort of, you know,

377
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:25,940
you as the designer helping to align that with what you're trying to create consistently.

378
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:27,640
So the same thing with every group,

379
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:37,370
you have to be kind of figuring it out from the pages to figure out exactly what kind of like broad goals and objectives for that program.

380
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:40,760
But then it's like, how do you what are you, how are you?

381
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:48,230
How does it compare to the specific traffic you expect this or that specific goal?

382
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:58,850
Yeah, exactly. And again, very clear questions that would be important to, um, discuss in a,

383
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:03,700
in a preceptor meeting to help guide your own projects and get it all something right.

384
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:09,170
But other thoughts that came to mind as you were working on this.

385
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:14,630
Yeah. I mean, that's a very bad situation for you.

386
01:05:15,530 --> 01:05:20,569
So we kind of have to think about we prioritize the audience for our posting.

387
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:23,960
This is a very like is our primary audience,

388
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:33,130
the program coordinator developing these materials or is it the people who are going to be using them in the community?

389
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:40,050
So we like kind of went back and work on that. Like I ended up landing on that, writing our objectives for the actual numbers.

390
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:47,630
Yeah. So in a description you might have to make a best guess, but um, in a conversation with a preceptor,

391
01:05:47,630 --> 01:05:53,150
that is something you could find out very definitively, like who is the end user.

392
01:05:53,490 --> 01:06:00,230
Um, and that's such a critical piece of information to be able to cross these goals.

393
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:10,700
Yeah. I think even someone really like, I like aligning the program goals with like the objectives.

394
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:19,369
Yeah, I'm afraid that for a little bit we can say like some answers about like a naughty program, like the program goals are not ultimately.

395
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:27,290
Obviously that was the goal here is that we're the materials. So we kind of have to figure out a line like, okay, we know what the program goal is.

396
01:06:27,290 --> 01:06:32,940
We know we're trying to do like with our communication, the same kind of thing, like how those match up.

397
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:41,240
And yeah, then the match is so critical it could very easily be going in three different directions.

398
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:45,200
Um, the behavior, the communication and the program itself.

399
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:51,560
So as you're creating your project plan, that's something to really pay attention to.

400
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:56,300
Um, you're going to be asked to provide these goals in your project plan.

401
01:06:56,750 --> 01:07:02,960
So, um, something I'm going to be paying attempted to are they aligned and you'll be paying attention to that as well.

402
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:08,059
And um, you know, in your preceptor meetings, if it's appearing discrepant,

403
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:15,800
that's a really good opportunity to work with your preceptor around getting that aligned with these projects.

404
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:25,220
Um, you know, they gave you a pretty brief description, but they're not like set in their ways and very prescriptive about what they're wanting.

405
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:33,350
Often times, um, they're interested in the creativity of the students and what, how you're thinking about it.

406
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:41,960
So I, I can definitely say in my conversations with the preceptors, there's, um, this will really be a dialog,

407
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:49,849
um, around, um, perhaps eliciting information and thoughts from them that maybe they didn't really think about.

408
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:57,080
But it helps get the project focus and both of you guys on the same page and direction of where you'll be going.

409
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:07,240
So, um, you guys brought up bits of this in your reflection, but, um, another thing you'll be doing, um,

410
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:15,080
as part of your meetings with your preceptors in the spirit of informing your project plan as a situation analysis.

411
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:19,730
And this is essentially understanding the health communication environment.

412
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:30,379
Um, it's really an analysis of individual community, social, political behavior related factors that can really affect attitudes,

413
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:36,320
behaviors, social norms and policies about a health issue and its potential selection.

414
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:43,340
And the point is really to help us understand what will or will not work in terms of what you create.

415
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:50,660
Um, so really understanding context, that's what it comes down to, um, and being clear about that.

416
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:59,630
So these are, this is a nice figure that really outlined the key steps of a situation analysis.

417
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:10,580
You really want to understand the health problem that may be the focus, the direct or indirect focus of your health communication, um, risk factors,

418
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:17,600
severity, significance among different audiences and groups, including opinions,

419
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:22,250
beliefs and thoughts about different treatments and prevention strategies.

420
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:30,620
You want to identify key audiences. So a primary audience might be the people that communication really seeks to influence.

421
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:37,820
Like if some of you are making informational pamphlets, for example, whose hands are those going to be in?

422
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:39,800
That's really the primary audience.

423
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:48,200
And secondary audience is often people that have an influence on the decisions and behaviors of the primary audience.

424
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:55,940
So it could be those service providers of those organizations or it could be other folks,

425
01:09:55,940 --> 01:10:01,700
but it's really about who has influence over the behaviors and decisions of that primary audience.

426
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:11,630
You also want to understand the social, political and other external influences, and these can really present challenges and opportunities.

427
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:20,449
Um, you know, individual decisions are often influenced by peers, institutions, social norms and policies.

428
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:30,350
So, um, in the context of your project, you really under, you want to understand what are some of those dynamics, um, potentially at play, um.

429
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:37,510
You also want to do some audience profiling and segmentation.

430
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:49,110
So part of this is. You know, this is not not necessarily like a demographic breakdown of different groups.

431
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:53,470
That could be one characteristic, but it could also be others.

432
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:59,310
So say you're thinking about parents. Say your, um, your audience is parents.

433
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:03,120
Um, one segment might be less involved parents.

434
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:12,540
Um, so it's really based on a certain sort of characteristic or behavior that's not necessarily demographic when you do audience segmentation.

435
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:21,840
So you want to, you know, think about that as you think about the different types of people that might benefit from your health communication.

436
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:31,370
And you might also want to look at existing programs, initiatives and resources, um, that are related to what you're trying to do.

437
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:35,520
And so why would you want to do that? Why would you want to see what else is already out there?

438
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:37,350
Yeah.

439
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:44,639
Have you ever been able to see, like what had been done and worked well and like what has in for you been awarded to do like the things that it was.

440
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:53,250
Well, and I feel like with the things that are yeah. So it's a really great way to get best practices, lessons learned, avoiding pitfalls.

441
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:56,820
Um, it's also an opportunity for partnership.

442
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:03,210
Um, maybe you come across some things someone else is already doing and versus reinventing the wheel.

443
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:07,740
What if there's an opportunity to join forces and partner and complement each other?

444
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:13,080
Um, so, and you also want to think about what might be an opposition.

445
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:21,630
So maybe you're promoting, um, a particular health behavior, but you come across a slew of health materials promoting the opposite behavior.

446
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:29,280
So you want to really understand, um, other forces that might be up against what you're trying to communicate.

447
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:42,650
You also want to highlight unmet communication needs and describe overall barriers to implementation and proposed change.

448
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:51,440
So these are a lot of different steps in a situation analysis and hopefully these, you know, thinking going back to this slide,

449
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:59,990
um, you know, with goals and objectives and also thinking about the different, um, steps of a situation analysis,

450
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:10,370
this should give you a lot of questions to ask your preceptors, um, in terms of getting the type of information you need to really,

451
01:13:10,370 --> 01:13:19,939
um, fill in key areas of your project plan and think about, um, uh, a nice plan forward in developing the product you have.

452
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:26,920
I haven't been. And then, um, this might be familiar.

453
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:33,460
Um, so swot swot analysis, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats.

454
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:40,260
This is a really nice organizing framework to organize your key findings from a situation analysis.

455
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:46,810
So after your meetings with your preceptors, I highly encourage you, um, you know,

456
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:53,950
make a table and sort of synthesize all the information you got into this framework.

457
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:02,110
Any questions about situation analysis?

458
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:16,550
So my goal with this is really to like one of your upcoming assignments is coming up with questions to ask your preceptor and organizing that meeting.

459
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:24,800
So what I really wanted to do this first hour of class is get your mind really thinking about what that looks like.

460
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:29,360
Um, you really want to go into depth in those meetings.

461
01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:34,540
You may not have an opportunity to have that same meeting throughout the semester.

462
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:42,200
So you really want to use this opportunity to move forward with your projects on a good footing.

463
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:48,700
Any traction. Okay.

464
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:53,109
So let's take a ten minute break.

465
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:57,880
So it's come back at 1025 and then we'll go into personas.

466
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:09,980
You know, I'm not really.

467
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:15,990
I didn't know that I had signed a letter and I have.

468
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:19,909
I'm actually not going to agree. And I really don't know because it's probably fine.

469
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:25,460
I'll probably like your lunch or the last question.

470
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:34,490
Okay. I'm just out of regular. I could get money, so I thought it would be too much.

471
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:44,180
Oh, no, it's not secret. Yeah, we do have some other more money.

472
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:56,200
Like you have, like, a private. Well, whatever. You want me to go home.

473
01:15:56,620 --> 01:16:06,590
Okay, so then you didn't have to go back, and I really didn't fill it, but everything.

474
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:10,290
And like I said, I was trying to find a template for my own.

475
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:13,340
But I guess it's like students actually bring that in.

476
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:18,950
It's not like their department has no say in the matter. Right.

477
01:16:19,010 --> 01:16:23,660
And there's like, yeah, I guess, like myself.

478
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:29,930
So do you ever know that it takes a lot of blood?

479
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:35,170
You didn't really know what to do.

480
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:38,929
I do like that. Or is this like a separate room?

481
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:44,240
Because that was kind of just like a. Oh, yeah, yeah.

482
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:48,740
It was nice, but it was really just a view of, like, a hospital.

483
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:52,850
Think it was like. Yeah, but.

484
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:58,850
I know that wasn't my thing. Like my sister. I forget. What? Who was she as a result?

485
01:16:58,870 --> 01:17:03,640
But how do I like the years where they have the cemetery?

486
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:13,640
And then you. Oh, that's really life.

487
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:20,650
And this is going to. Upstairs.

488
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:24,530
Downstairs? Yeah. I never knew the upstairs.

489
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:29,450
Oh, I was one of the boys to here.

490
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:36,480
And that apparently sums it up quite well, but.

491
01:18:22,340 --> 01:20:12,370
But the. Also.

492
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:51,260
You know, first of all, I do believe that there was something we had to do to honor the treaty in the hope that we can do something like this.

493
01:20:51,740 --> 01:21:01,310
Yeah, like it's a revolution. Yeah, I need to like because I've submitted them, but I haven't actually put on our campus.

494
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:06,379
Like, sometimes I like do it right away. I have created it now.

495
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:14,700
They never did. So I'm wondering, where do you submit that?

496
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:19,760
Oh, yeah. Don't. I don't have that.

497
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:25,350
Whatever works for you.

498
01:21:29,930 --> 01:21:38,330
I know you're busy, but we feel like so, you know, like.

499
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:50,870
I mean, I can't really explain to you what I mean.

500
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:58,720
Yeah, definitely. Definitely.

501
01:21:59,150 --> 01:22:15,860
When I was here, I usually insisted that they come into the first semester, just about everything I've done something like.

502
01:22:15,950 --> 01:22:22,260
I mean, yeah, I'm aware of them.

503
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:39,610
What they look like, they're going, I have a little fun.

504
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:50,080
Yeah, I heard that he was supported by President Obama.

505
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:58,120
I don't know that I know what I'm doing.

506
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:09,680
This is a good thing, but I don't think he told her.

507
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:16,340
Okay, have you seen this video making the masses like, you know,

508
01:23:17,150 --> 01:23:30,590
it was it wasn't even when you think about, oh, here it is, the recreation of the renovations.

509
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:37,900
Oh, yeah, I saw that. Yeah.

510
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:48,470
And then they made the commitment and that was it.

511
01:23:51,470 --> 01:23:54,800
Well, I know, I know.

512
01:23:56,180 --> 01:24:03,530
Everybody was like, well, I always knew I wouldn't turn into an opportunity to go.

513
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:07,610
No, I am not disappointed for sure.

514
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:21,139
So I know it's like it's like I don't think that every day trip or Sunday.

515
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:27,530
How long do that? You must leave my room.

516
01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:30,710
Just when I was nine years old. I never.

517
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:35,600
Oh, yeah. So we will there remember more.

518
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:42,109
So yeah, I just didn't make it a whole day and I actually have never been there.

519
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:45,710
So, like, the day. I know, I know. Isn't that weird?

520
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:49,700
Only so I want to see, like, the rest of it too. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

521
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:51,440
I don't know. I guess.

522
01:24:51,950 --> 01:25:05,540
I guess also, like, I'm just thinking, it's been like a three year that two of our know are all great rather than ever before that we did do that.

523
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:10,210
But I want you guys to also be excited.

524
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:13,710
But that's not going to here too. I don't know. But, um.

525
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:26,960
Yeah. Yeah. So there's a lot of money on those machines.

526
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:36,490
Yeah. So. Yeah. I feel like I saw that sort of thing.

527
01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:42,790
I know. I mean. Kind of a small one.

528
01:25:42,990 --> 01:25:46,110
Yeah, well, my.

529
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:55,040
My brother's feeling like he thought one was enough.

530
01:25:55,110 --> 01:26:04,190
It was like. I don't know. Like, one of them was like, there's $100,000 already.

531
01:26:04,230 --> 01:26:07,330
Like, I don't know.

532
01:26:08,350 --> 01:26:11,930
Oh, none at all. It was like a specific area, period. Right.

533
01:26:13,150 --> 01:26:21,500
But you could do it really high. Like I know many, many people live.

534
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:26,860
So they have like it really is almost like like if you don't like another record with me on there.

535
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:32,650
Oh, no, it's not my on this one.

536
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:42,320
I guess in my heart she is like she's in Chicago and she doesn't really want to get out of this real reason for like,

537
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:47,380
there's like literally dinosaur sex in the background.

538
01:26:49,810 --> 01:27:06,680
Yeah. And what I find interesting, that's like, you know, like, yeah, these are all, you know, the ability of them to meet like normal people.

539
01:27:07,450 --> 01:27:22,680
And so I'm very insecure about Yeah, you know, cause that's like my whole life, financial, my family's income, our whole day, like, running a place.

540
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:26,500
Like, it's all this whole time.

541
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:34,600
That's one of the countries. Okay, let's go ahead and get started again.

542
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:45,520
Know so one of the major, major things that's going to be critical to the success of your projects is knowing your audience.

543
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:51,220
So we say that often know your audience, but what, what does that really mean?

544
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:59,320
And, um, action on it when it comes to design science and really designing materials for a particular audience.

545
01:28:00,070 --> 01:28:08,469
So one of the things that you're going to be doing in this class is creating a persona as part of your assignment.

546
01:28:08,470 --> 01:28:20,290
And um, I consider this an individual, such group, um, project because you'll be creating personas that are related to your project.

547
01:28:20,890 --> 01:28:30,340
Um, but you want to make sure, you know, in order for it to be helpful with, um, with your projects as a group,

548
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:35,770
the personas really should, you should coordinate with each other, like who's going to make y persona?

549
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:42,879
And each of you will turn one in individually, but through your projects as a group, most of you are in groups of five.

550
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:49,090
You'll you'll have about 4 to 5 personas, different personas that will really help you guide your project.

551
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,159
So what is that persona?

552
01:28:51,160 --> 01:29:04,900
It really is a type of tool that helps us keep our audience in mind as we develop our materials and helps us build understanding and empathy.

553
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:09,030
I mean, what I mean by that, it helps us understand, um.

554
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:15,540
The the audience that we have in mind as we're thinking about the build process.

555
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:22,170
And, you know, that can come in a lot of shapes and forms when it comes to making a lot of decisions.

556
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:30,600
You know, the color, the look, the feel, literacy level, um, the type of information you include.

557
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:39,810
So, um, it really helps us build understanding and empathy when we make those sorts of decisions as we go through, um, creating our projects.

558
01:29:40,230 --> 01:29:45,030
And it also is a direction for, um, design decisions.

559
01:29:45,450 --> 01:29:55,169
Um, along the way this was mentioned earlier, but you can, you know, start somewhere but then end up going in this direction.

560
01:29:55,170 --> 01:30:01,680
And it could be very, it could be very much a mismatch from where you aim to go when you think about your goals.

561
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:06,300
So persona helps us sort of stay on track.

562
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:12,930
If we're about to veer off, we might go back to our personas and really think about, okay, you know,

563
01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:23,370
these are the different types of people that, um, really represent what this product aims to cater to.

564
01:30:23,370 --> 01:30:30,959
So what, you know, where do we need to sort of steer back based on what we've sort of outlined here and thinking about their needs,

565
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:38,340
wants, attitudes and desires. So it really is a focal point, um, you know, that you'll use throughout your projects.

566
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:49,290
And um, we're going to actually do some exercises to really think about what makes a good persona to really be effective for that.

567
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:55,079
And so, um, good first characteristics of good personas.

568
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:59,100
So they are fictional guesses at what a target user thinks.

569
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:06,630
Every aspect of a personas description should be tied back to real data, observed or researched.

570
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:17,280
Personas reflect real user patterns, and they're not different user roles, and they're not necessarily a reflection of roles within a system.

571
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:27,270
Um, they focus on the current state, so how users interact with the product, not necessarily the future because you don't have that information.

572
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:35,370
Um, and it is really context specific. So it's focused on the behaviors and goals related to the specific domain of the product.

573
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:40,020
A persona will typically include the name of a person.

574
01:31:40,290 --> 01:31:47,100
There's going to be a picture and specific demographic characteristics and other characteristics as well,

575
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:56,460
key phrases that they might say in the context of the issue that is relevant to the persona.

576
01:31:57,070 --> 01:32:02,160
It'll talk about their experience, their expertise, their emotions and values,

577
01:32:02,670 --> 01:32:08,460
um, perhaps like modes of communication that they prefer or are used to using.

578
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:12,450
And it also describes their social and cultural environments.

579
01:32:12,450 --> 01:32:21,749
So again, these are fictional guesses, but um, with your information gathering and um, research,

580
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:27,180
you'll be able to put together a pretty realistic persona to be able to guide your projects.

581
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:33,000
So, um, I want us to do an exercise to again think about,

582
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:43,409
to start to jog our thinking around what we might start to include in our persona, um, based on our project description.

583
01:32:43,410 --> 01:32:50,310
So this is for the Community Action Network, which is an organization that some of you were assigned to for this project,

584
01:32:50,670 --> 01:32:54,300
for this course in terms of your projects and our goal here.

585
01:32:55,790 --> 01:33:00,470
In thinking about this again not to do fictional guesses based on the.

586
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:10,610
Information we have here by our. But we want to make our best sort of gas to really help someone.

587
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:18,389
Come to life. So you have some information here and we won't have all that information to go

588
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:24,660
in-depth with a persona based on the work you would actually do with your project.

589
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:33,540
Where we're going to start the conversation based on what this group or what this project description aims to do,

590
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:40,680
so why a user might start to or to come to life around.

591
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:48,470
So, um, go ahead and um, read this description and then just jot down some notes individually.

592
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:53,420
Thinking about some of the characteristics of the persona by yourself,

593
01:33:53,480 --> 01:34:00,090
embody maybe some of the structure and maybe some of your observed knowledge or

594
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:05,160
even research knowledge that you have in this area of the health communication.

595
01:34:09,950 --> 01:35:04,210
I. I.

596
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:46,750
So if you were going to start to make a persona around and a and user of this product what are some things that.

597
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:50,830
What are some characteristics to help that might start this process?

598
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:56,290
I don't think you have enough information here to completely build out a persona for someone.

599
01:36:56,290 --> 01:37:00,250
You would need to do a little more homework and research. But, um.

600
01:37:01,130 --> 01:37:04,930
Well, what are some things we might start with to help this person come alive?

601
01:37:05,770 --> 01:37:09,520
So why don't we just, uh, start here and then make our way this way?

602
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:14,829
Well, this is, like, aimed at youth, so because we don't know the specific age range,

603
01:37:14,830 --> 01:37:19,120
but just knowing that we are going to be working with, like, children and youth, not like adults.

604
01:37:19,630 --> 01:37:23,260
Yeah. So what might you maybe give an age range?

605
01:37:24,430 --> 01:37:28,360
Let's say like 8 to 12.

606
01:37:28,810 --> 01:37:32,020
8 to 12. Okay. Could use uses a weird term.

607
01:37:32,230 --> 01:37:38,260
This is like, what does that mean? You know, I was also thinking like the amount of time that they'd have to be sitting in a lesson.

608
01:37:38,290 --> 01:37:44,920
Oh, a long. So maybe like 10 to 15, because, like, 20 to 40 minutes can be long for like a young child.

609
01:37:46,210 --> 01:37:52,300
Okay. So, like, about 10 to 15 might be the age of this individual.

610
01:37:52,510 --> 01:37:57,460
What else? Corresponding with age.

611
01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:08,310
I was thinking about literacy and more like a baseline understanding of the country better and growing off of that need to

612
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:18,960
have really engaging in these interactions because their attention span is going to make sure that you get your attention.

613
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:25,830
Okay. So for this first sort of this person need communication needs might be it needs to be engaging.

614
01:38:26,970 --> 01:38:35,340
Yeah, I think I would want to know more about the community actually and how long it's been there

615
01:38:35,340 --> 01:38:41,160
and know more about the environment in which this piece of this programing is taking place.

616
01:38:41,670 --> 01:38:44,610
So yeah, how long is the community been there?

617
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:53,790
How did it come to be about what are some knowledge, beliefs, attitudes that the target audience has regarding the community garden?

618
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:59,610
Because I feel like sometimes community gardens can start if certain populations or

619
01:38:59,610 --> 01:39:05,099
certain groups or even sometimes external groups without input from the community.

620
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:06,990
So I feel weird about that.

621
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:17,370
Okay, so why is this particular youth between the ages of ten and 15 who probably requires some engagement with the lesson plan?

622
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:20,999
What are their thoughts around gardens?

623
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:25,680
And do they know anything about gardens? Have they do they know about it?

624
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:38,760
And do they have some feelings about it or thoughts perhaps in favor or maybe not so favorable feelings about the garden?

625
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:42,510
It could swing either way. Do you know?

626
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:46,319
So I was basically going to say that. But I was thinking too, like,

627
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:51,870
it might be helpful to make a couple of different personas different in here and

628
01:39:51,870 --> 01:39:56,880
like different interests and like healthy eating and like opinions on the garden.

629
01:39:57,330 --> 01:40:04,050
And then I was like a secondary population you could maybe build out with a parents, right?

630
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:08,100
How you might target them and how they're better at foster care.

631
01:40:09,150 --> 01:40:12,260
So there could potentially be multiple personas here.

632
01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:18,450
One could be youth who would actually engage in the program, but another could be a parent.

633
01:40:19,870 --> 01:40:28,180
Yeah. I'm watching at the moment.

634
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:34,180
You have to be convincing them to want to eat fruits and vegetables, cause they want to listen.

635
01:40:34,510 --> 01:40:37,690
Yeah, that's fine. Yeah.

636
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:43,150
So what are. What is their sort of engagement with fruits and vegetables at the moment?

637
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:49,480
Um, do they like them? Not like them. What are their typical eating patterns right now?

638
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:56,050
Do they have favorite foods that they like? And do they fall into that category or perhaps a different category?

639
01:40:57,490 --> 01:41:06,120
Yeah, I'm thinking about culture because like whether or not or like something that they're thinking to be incorporated into their participation,

640
01:41:06,130 --> 01:41:15,340
they're not that. Okay. So how does culture play into this in terms of how they, um, think and interact with food?

641
01:41:16,850 --> 01:41:24,830
And how it ties back to the Garnett. So there was a youth group there, something of their parents on the.

642
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:30,820
Sure. And they don't want friends there. And this is like some very nasty stuff.

643
01:41:31,630 --> 01:41:40,930
Okay. So why do they. Why are they there? Um, from a U.S. perspective, but if it was a parents profile, why would they want their, um.

644
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:52,550
Child or. Um, um. It may not be their child, but whoever they're responsible for, like, why are they having them at ten?

645
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:58,850
So having that reasoning for a variety of personas might be quite relevant.

646
01:42:00,590 --> 01:42:08,059
Yeah. Yeah. And I was also there's other like basic demographic factors like which neighborhood that they live in,

647
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:17,620
like mode of transportation, like household dynamics, like how many parents, siblings, divorced, not.

648
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:24,740
There are all the family structure like home environment type and where they currently have like a parent,

649
01:42:24,740 --> 01:42:28,220
but like where they currently access, like where they shop or where they buy food.

650
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:34,700
And that could manifest itself into multiple personas, sort of reflecting that heterogeneity.

651
01:42:35,690 --> 01:42:40,249
Mm hmm. Yeah. Um, it also says up at the top, like,

652
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:47,450
the purpose of this organization is to work with people from under-resourced neighborhoods so this person or persons may be,

653
01:42:47,450 --> 01:42:52,040
like, lower like and lower estimates. Yeah.

654
01:42:52,070 --> 01:43:01,549
So given that their organization works with a particular segment, within that segment, you can also have some ranges.

655
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:09,110
So like low low SC is maybe low x, but perhaps higher.

656
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:18,649
Um, so that gradient, what would that look like there? But um, given that that is the scope, you probably have a persona that might not be relevant.

657
01:43:18,650 --> 01:43:25,250
Here is someone in a very affluent situation that this organization doesn't even serve.

658
01:43:26,170 --> 01:43:32,540
And I also think that there can be a persona built around the facilitators of the program.

659
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:38,630
And so gaining more information about it tells us who facilitates the program.

660
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:42,260
So we have like a miracle workers and I think the site director.

661
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:48,350
Yeah. Building a persona around that. What are their motivations for supporting the program?

662
01:43:48,740 --> 01:43:56,150
Well, experience they have working with this particular demographic in this age group, are they already know community, you know,

663
01:43:56,570 --> 01:44:05,330
are they already know within the community or will it be a process of having to gain kind of respect and trust with the audience?

664
01:44:05,870 --> 01:44:12,370
So they're we're coworkers. I'm thinking, is the ladder that maybe I don't know, they may be from the community, they might be.

665
01:44:12,410 --> 01:44:15,290
But I think a person around that. Yeah.

666
01:44:15,290 --> 01:44:23,140
Because those sort of have really direct influence on engaging with the materials builds and therefore the audience on the receiving end.

667
01:44:23,150 --> 01:44:27,830
So that's um, absolutely a very relevant persona that could be both out.

668
01:44:33,290 --> 01:44:42,980
So I think we get the idea here, too, that we're actually made for this particular project in description.

669
01:44:43,370 --> 01:44:49,490
Now, I want to hand both out to you guys and maybe, you know, with the person next to you,

670
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:55,840
like read through these and what the person next to you which one and choose.

671
01:44:56,720 --> 01:45:06,700
Um. As a more effective persona if you were to use it to guide your project, if you this was your project that you were working on.

672
01:45:06,790 --> 01:45:10,270
So you have to here which one would you choose?

673
01:45:11,610 --> 01:45:15,480
To be more effective. Yes. For this program.

674
01:45:19,780 --> 01:45:27,510
Like. Why?

675
01:45:46,140 --> 01:48:29,390
It's so. The.

676
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:05,870
Central. This is about.

677
01:50:20,010 --> 01:50:25,200
Three of the 100.

678
01:50:32,110 --> 01:50:53,610
I think. I mean, I guess we can't necessarily so.

679
01:50:54,130 --> 01:50:58,000
So the decision you're trying to make really is usability.

680
01:50:58,090 --> 01:51:04,180
Like, you know, if if you're going to use a persona to help you be your guidepost through the project,

681
01:51:04,190 --> 01:51:10,330
which one of these is more helpful in doing that for you, in your opinion?

682
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:26,590
I think we are doing great and they were here in person.

683
01:51:28,570 --> 01:51:53,190
Yeah, I think this is the first time this happens because like, I feel like I'm.

684
01:51:56,620 --> 01:52:02,440
Like what it was like, especially with Richard.

685
01:52:07,450 --> 01:52:10,750
Yeah, I know. It's specific.

686
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:15,010
Yeah. Yeah, something like that.

687
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:23,050
So, yeah, like. I mean, like I said, you have to do design work.

688
01:52:25,090 --> 01:52:28,450
Yes. I'm wondering if, like, your husband ever.

689
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:40,930
Yeah, I. I never met anyone because he himself is.

690
01:52:43,120 --> 01:53:02,340
I mean, they don't deserve a lot. So it's like, you know, so when we're 100 miles away, but this was talking about like I understand branding.

691
01:53:02,370 --> 01:53:15,870
And so it's like that's also what I think, you know, you're getting too much of a little girl.

692
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:29,680
You know, I was like, okay, I'm here because it is like, I'm really glad.

693
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:34,060
You know what I mean?

694
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:40,060
I think you're right. I think like, yeah, yeah.

695
01:53:41,380 --> 01:53:48,000
One of the major difference between the two of them is that brand is and, and, and,

696
01:53:48,720 --> 01:54:03,250
and the way I think I realized when I was like, you know, I think like you already have like a strong community.

697
01:54:03,250 --> 01:54:15,510
And so I feel like I think the problem is almost like a means to an end, which means that with anything like that.

698
01:54:16,900 --> 01:54:30,640
So why mean it just didn't I used to wear my daughter was 18 on a different context this year, but also because he doesn't have to be you.

699
01:54:30,790 --> 01:54:50,430
Oh, actually he didn't say that. Like about, you know, you know, they talk about the means of like knowing how to make them healthier economically.

700
01:54:50,860 --> 01:55:03,639
Maybe we'll talk about how we didn't really talk about affordable because like down here, like he has become a doctor.

701
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:15,459
So I guess because I think he doesn't mind nobody really which why he likes that and maybe other things like this I guess.

702
01:55:15,460 --> 01:55:19,590
Yeah. And actually so. Where did you guys land?

703
01:55:22,220 --> 01:55:25,490
I just. I feel like you said it. Yeah.

704
01:55:25,670 --> 01:55:32,000
What do you think of that? Well, we decided that it was the better.

705
01:55:33,170 --> 01:55:37,040
So I can see some of the details.

706
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:43,820
And they discussed every single structure of his life versus what it was very different.

707
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:47,980
I think, though, I think we did it.

708
01:55:48,150 --> 01:55:55,400
Yes. Disposability. But you don't know that much about mom on how something like that.

709
01:55:55,400 --> 01:56:03,450
How that or. So.

710
01:56:03,460 --> 01:56:06,600
But it sounds like you felt like that.

711
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:12,790
Like Brandon had more information to guide your material development.

712
01:56:13,450 --> 01:56:17,040
Yeah, he didn't think it was a really good fit as well for Cassandra,

713
01:56:17,110 --> 01:56:25,420
but we felt like Brandon was just better prepared for someone to cover more of, like, the social determinants of health.

714
01:56:26,820 --> 01:56:36,420
Bad as it was best like, although although they're in like a middle class family, that doesn't mean the whole thing.

715
01:56:36,790 --> 01:56:41,170
And so I think they kind of struggling because they can't really see benefits.

716
01:56:41,220 --> 01:56:51,700
And that's what you're not you don't have enough money to go out and learn, which means that even sometimes just having fresh food, that's we.

717
01:56:56,150 --> 01:56:59,510
I don't know why.

718
01:57:00,860 --> 01:57:04,440
I don't know what I can do to make it more difficult.

719
01:57:04,470 --> 01:57:09,910
Look, I. I felt like it was clear what was going on.

720
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:19,650
I know that these things about all these feelings, all the places like this.

721
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:26,290
So I felt like I. More information for all.

722
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:42,410
Okay. So, um, you guys preferred more information, and you guys sort of have the opposite feeling that more information was not necessarily a kind of,

723
01:57:42,830 --> 01:57:48,049
you know, you want to be specific to kind of get into that.

724
01:57:48,050 --> 01:57:51,170
It is harder to kill someone.

725
01:57:51,170 --> 01:57:54,920
It's like nationalized more than just one specific situation.

726
01:57:55,280 --> 01:58:05,740
But having it be a little bit more vague makes it easier to those who would be more like yeah or program.

727
01:58:05,810 --> 01:58:10,230
The person is just someone that I hate realistically.

728
01:58:10,670 --> 01:58:14,720
Okay. Um, I would go for here.

729
01:58:15,290 --> 01:58:21,439
Yeah. We have like some room where conversations like Brandon are probably easier for some.

730
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:29,870
As you heard when I was like in a relationship with the community center already, which is positive and like he's really motivated.

731
01:58:29,870 --> 01:58:35,269
But we thought about the fact that y it might be more representative of like the average kid is actually coming

732
01:58:35,270 --> 01:58:40,489
to the program where like his only relationship with the community center is that like goes to tutoring there.

733
01:58:40,490 --> 01:58:45,440
And that way he doesn't necessarily have the kind of intrinsic motivation in terms

734
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:50,380
of like food or diet and that there might be more challenges to talking about like,

735
01:58:50,510 --> 01:58:55,069
okay, we can see random like things he said about the program like something and then taking notes.

736
01:58:55,070 --> 01:58:57,469
But the average family, I mean,

737
01:58:57,470 --> 01:59:05,540
more reason for you to think more about how that where you like engage them and how to like build a positive association with them.

738
01:59:05,540 --> 01:59:13,640
So I see the more youthful persona, if we would consider is generalizability, I guess to that.

739
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:25,590
Okay. So yeah, my critique is also a little bit too like the actual like format of the persona itself.

740
01:59:25,610 --> 01:59:30,710
Like I feel like why it is easy to like using it as a tool to like refer back to still be like,

741
01:59:30,740 --> 01:59:34,680
oh yeah, like his needs are really summarized out like here.

742
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:39,830
And if I was going back and wanted to quickly understand what the needs of Brandon's words,

743
01:59:40,910 --> 01:59:44,210
I would have to like dig through the paragraphs to try and figure it out.

744
01:59:44,630 --> 01:59:51,750
So this I feel like that might be more like a formatting thing to be able to use as a tool later.

745
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:57,950
But yeah, you're also thinking very much like what you were saying upfront.

746
01:59:58,010 --> 02:00:05,060
Um, that Brandon seems like more motivated and maybe why it is more representative of like the average kid in this community.

747
02:00:05,330 --> 02:00:09,739
We're also thinking that Brandon would be someone who could maybe be like a mentor in this

748
02:00:09,740 --> 02:00:14,090
program because he already kind of has leadership roles with his little siblings and like,

749
02:00:14,390 --> 02:00:17,990
he seems motivated to want to be healthier.

750
02:00:17,990 --> 02:00:21,020
Like you talk about how he wants to be a doctor so people can be like healthier.

751
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:28,190
So we were talking about how he might not be the best persona for a participant, but that he could have like a leadership role at the center.

752
02:00:29,780 --> 02:00:34,939
So he just he had a very different purpose that yeah, that is relevant, you know,

753
02:00:34,940 --> 02:00:41,720
like he seemed like a bit more mature and just like motivated and already has like this leadership role like within his family,

754
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:45,710
but like his younger siblings and how he, like, he really wants his family to be healthier.

755
02:00:45,740 --> 02:00:51,590
So he has like a desire to like engage in this material, but also to, like, do something to help others.

756
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:56,430
Yeah. Yeah.

757
02:00:56,610 --> 02:01:00,840
Did you? Yeah, I did. Jackie and I actually spoke about this.

758
02:01:01,860 --> 02:01:08,290
We're talking about how. In Brian's situation, if anything, very similar to what they were saying,

759
02:01:08,740 --> 02:01:12,399
is that maybe the program would be best for him and he could take on another role.

760
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:19,000
But. There could be some room for building a persona around his sister.

761
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:24,370
Actually, the one he speaks about that is abuse and also suffers from asthma.

762
02:01:24,670 --> 02:01:33,250
And so that also might be more representative of the children that you're getting or that they're aiming for this from children.

763
02:01:34,100 --> 02:01:44,560
Okay. So that so in the throes of all or a lot of information there, another person has sort of popped out that might be very relevant to the program.

764
02:01:46,910 --> 02:01:54,470
So both of these personas are, are useful to that program description.

765
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:58,430
Um, again, a couple of things you want to keep in mind.

766
02:01:58,730 --> 02:02:02,900
Um, and they were very relevant to many of the points that you guys brought up.

767
02:02:03,260 --> 02:02:06,799
You'll be using these for guiding your project,

768
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:13,820
so being able to refer back to them will be really important and finding the information pretty quickly.

769
02:02:15,050 --> 02:02:18,620
Brandon had a lot of, um, relevant points.

770
02:02:18,890 --> 02:02:24,530
And are there opportunities if you as a group decide we need to have very concise personas?

771
02:02:24,950 --> 02:02:31,280
Is there ways to make sure that is captured without being difficult to navigate?

772
02:02:31,700 --> 02:02:36,860
Um, because as this group said, there was a lot of useful information there that just was not in the other one.

773
02:02:37,220 --> 02:02:40,990
But, um, and that was helpful to have, um.

774
02:02:41,990 --> 02:02:49,670
And also I'm thinking about the different roles like these are two very different folks that are relevant to,

775
02:02:51,140 --> 02:02:54,350
to the, the, the product that's being created.

776
02:02:54,360 --> 02:03:02,759
So when you guys come up with personas as a group, you have an opportunity to create four or five amongst you guys.

777
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:06,050
So how are those personas really distinct?

778
02:03:06,060 --> 02:03:12,200
So you have the variety there to really help you guide your project, so on.

779
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:18,110
And so that's also something to think about in terms of making sure that they're distinct.

780
02:03:20,170 --> 02:03:27,400
So I want to take an opportunity before we have you spend the rest of your time for yourselves in your groups.

781
02:03:28,300 --> 02:03:35,410
Some of your upcoming assignments. So your group communication and process plan really takes some time to think about

782
02:03:35,410 --> 02:03:39,040
how you want to work as a group together and understanding people's strengths.

783
02:03:39,730 --> 02:03:45,010
I always encourage you guys to come back to this and revisit it throughout the semester.

784
02:03:45,630 --> 02:03:49,380
Um. And it's not something I take lightly.

785
02:03:49,620 --> 02:03:54,179
You know, when folks have problems in their groups, they always ask them this question.

786
02:03:54,180 --> 02:04:00,690
And the consistent response is, no, we didn't go back to it. We had to just did it and then went in another direction.

787
02:04:00,690 --> 02:04:05,700
And things are a little challenging now. Yeah, I really encourage you to revisit this.

788
02:04:05,700 --> 02:04:10,620
You can come up with a plan and sometimes the way you end up working together just

789
02:04:10,620 --> 02:04:15,659
evolves and getting on the same page with that person periodically and checking in.

790
02:04:15,660 --> 02:04:22,709
Are things working? Can we do things differently? Is a very good thing that hopefully will meet the needs of all your group members.

791
02:04:22,710 --> 02:04:28,800
So this is something I hope you guys take some time doing together and really just put

792
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:34,500
a lot of thought into to ensure that you have an enjoyable experience this semester.

793
02:04:35,370 --> 02:04:38,850
The second assignment is your questions for your preceptors.

794
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:45,900
What I encourage you to do to start off with this is to probably do a brain dump of sorts.

795
02:04:45,900 --> 02:04:47,580
But that's not what I want you to turn in.

796
02:04:48,090 --> 02:05:00,090
I'd love for you to really use this assignment as an opportunity to organize a really helpful meeting agenda for your meeting with your preceptors,

797
02:05:00,090 --> 02:05:02,220
and really organizing your questions.

798
02:05:02,610 --> 02:05:11,940
To guide that meeting, you will, after your brain depth, know very, very clear categories of questions that you want to be able to work through.

799
02:05:12,690 --> 02:05:15,200
So as a group, I, you know,

800
02:05:15,210 --> 02:05:25,470
turn in one and really think about all the things you would want to know about your project to be able to move forward with your project plan.

801
02:05:27,100 --> 02:05:33,650
And then, um, this isn't due next week, but your persona's.

802
02:05:34,360 --> 02:05:37,870
So again, this is sort of individual, such group.

803
02:05:37,870 --> 02:05:46,040
I shouldn't have a persona turned in from each of you, but they'll be determined based on your conversation as a group together.

804
02:05:46,600 --> 02:05:50,650
Um, what personas do you guys want to sort of highlight for your project?

805
02:05:51,250 --> 02:05:56,970
Um, here, I provide a lot of detail about what it should look like and include.

806
02:05:56,980 --> 02:05:58,930
And then you have two examples here.

807
02:05:59,350 --> 02:06:08,560
Um, just to, you know, get your, your brain sort of thinking about what it might look like or how might you structure it.

808
02:06:09,070 --> 02:06:14,950
Um, so you're not married to this, but this is just some examples of self guys here.

809
02:06:16,510 --> 02:06:24,030
Um, and on your personas, you also want to have some communication objectives outlined.

810
02:06:24,040 --> 02:06:31,290
So that's something to also think about as a group as you start to gather more information about your project.

811
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:37,120
Like what are what are going to be the communication objectives that are relevant to that particular person?

812
02:06:37,600 --> 02:06:41,290
So that's what's coming up, um, down the pipe.

813
02:06:41,770 --> 02:06:49,569
Um, any questions? One of the things I also encourage you to do to prepare for your questions is go to their project

814
02:06:49,570 --> 02:06:56,889
plan assignment instructions that might help you see what I'm asking you to include and my job.

815
02:06:56,890 --> 02:07:00,700
Some questions that you might want to find out from your preceptors.

816
02:07:01,390 --> 02:07:06,820
Um, so that's another place to sort of take a look.

817
02:07:07,240 --> 02:07:13,160
Even though it's not due till February 3rd, um, it becomes relevant very quickly.

818
02:07:14,990 --> 02:07:21,460
So any questions about what's coming up? Oh.

819
02:07:21,810 --> 02:07:25,799
Okay. So the rest of the time is yours. I'll be here.

820
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:29,490
I'll check in with groups if you guys wrap up.

821
02:07:31,140 --> 02:07:37,200
Whenever you wrap up, you're free to go. But definitely use this time to get some face to face time with each other.

822
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:41,090
It's kind of weird.

823
02:07:43,140 --> 02:07:46,380
So if you want to submit the questions before we start.

824
02:07:48,130 --> 02:07:57,680
Yeah I'll um. There do so your your meeting is on the 20th so they're due on the 17th.

825
02:07:57,720 --> 02:08:01,410
So one. Yeah. Yeah. I'll get your feedback pretty quickly.

826
02:08:01,650 --> 02:08:05,460
So, um, and if for any reason, um.

827
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:14,280
Your meeting had to be scheduled before and then just give me a heads up and I'll make sure to give you feedback in preparation for your meeting.

828
02:08:17,890 --> 02:08:23,400
Okay. Go ahead and gather with your team members and then we'll start from that.

829
02:08:25,050 --> 02:08:29,010
Would you really? No. Sorry.

830
02:08:29,320 --> 02:08:37,920
Oh. Oh, but I mean, who else? Like, I really like.

831
02:08:37,930 --> 02:08:56,230
And I like people to, you know, like, things.

832
02:08:57,960 --> 02:09:02,360
I think she's awesome.

833
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:08,050
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

834
02:09:08,940 --> 02:09:14,710
Yeah, I'm. I'm. I'm sorry. I'm saying it for an hour.

835
02:09:14,830 --> 02:09:21,410
Is any know this Christmas?

836
02:09:22,690 --> 02:09:26,360
Yeah. I don't know. It's going to be. Is this anyway.

837
02:09:26,380 --> 02:09:29,650
Oh you can listen to that stuff.

838
02:09:33,010 --> 02:09:40,310
Yeah. Anything. Yeah. I was thinking about how to make.

839
02:09:44,470 --> 02:09:51,140
You're good to them.

840
02:09:55,620 --> 02:10:02,130
Let's have a word. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

841
02:10:05,330 --> 02:10:18,680
Are you all right?

842
02:10:23,350 --> 02:10:32,650
Let's get in there and. Yeah, there's another chance of getting to see you.

843
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:37,900
Well, yeah. Yeah, but I want my friend.

844
02:10:40,060 --> 02:10:49,450
I mean, I think, you know, I just.

845
02:10:53,410 --> 02:10:58,690
I just feel like, you know, I would say there's really good dogs.

846
02:11:00,290 --> 02:11:05,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

847
02:11:06,570 --> 02:11:10,200
We have stumbled. Yeah.

848
02:11:10,210 --> 02:11:16,930
Do you want to start with the can be on the night?

849
02:11:17,860 --> 02:11:21,370
Yeah, I just put it in one them directly.

850
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:27,460
Thank you very much. This is just like the instructions.

851
02:11:29,980 --> 02:11:33,350
No, no, it's. Isn't it?

852
02:11:33,670 --> 02:11:39,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

853
02:11:40,240 --> 02:12:02,530
Okay. Well, you know, I really want to have what is the most beautiful, you know, texting and why you look like yours.

854
02:12:03,190 --> 02:12:06,220
Yeah, I know how you do that. Yeah.

855
02:12:06,250 --> 02:12:15,700
You're not going to get tired of that.

856
02:12:16,430 --> 02:12:20,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

857
02:12:21,160 --> 02:12:27,610
Okay. I reckon it's a really good time. Sometimes I don't even know how.

858
02:12:27,710 --> 02:12:36,570
People don't know what it's like.

859
02:12:38,750 --> 02:12:44,520
Oh, my. Okay.

860
02:12:45,020 --> 02:12:52,180
I'm so glad to see that little.

861
02:12:52,240 --> 02:13:10,660
It's nice to meet you. I'm just saying that it's gonna be, like, primarily with each other for them to.

862
02:13:11,590 --> 02:13:19,420
For me. And then how do you guys feel about everything?

863
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:24,730
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

864
02:13:26,710 --> 02:13:33,660
We've been doing really good, really well over the course of 24 years.

865
02:13:34,690 --> 02:13:38,319
I really enjoyed with the freeze up here, like playing for ourselves,

866
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:43,690
we have really we might need some time to talk about how we interact with potential.

867
02:13:44,080 --> 02:14:06,160
So that's what I'm going to put our resources into the person and probably try to do that.

868
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:13,700
I don't know the things that I would like to do.

869
02:14:14,420 --> 02:14:33,830
You know what I'd like to get out of the loss of having a different name like I got up to now.

870
02:14:35,750 --> 02:14:47,700
Yeah, it's very easy.

871
02:14:49,630 --> 02:14:55,720
And in normal times, that's for sure.

872
02:14:55,720 --> 02:15:11,980
You know, I heard that. So. Yeah, that's. What do you make of that?

873
02:15:14,920 --> 02:15:33,520
I also like knowing that they're not utilizing the new stage.

874
02:15:34,750 --> 02:15:53,590
I think it isn't on the morning of November nine because it's just like radio consistent with other celebrities.

875
02:15:53,830 --> 02:15:59,880
Sometimes you search when you want to do that.

876
02:16:04,610 --> 02:16:22,960
I mean, I don't know what you are going to know that are able to do in her husband's every night.

877
02:16:25,180 --> 02:16:43,440
I can do that. Yeah, but I also think that I would suggest that we're out of time for everybody.

878
02:16:43,660 --> 02:16:51,950
Or if we want to get at 4:00 or something like that, they have a time networks.

879
02:16:51,950 --> 02:16:56,259
And if we don't do it. We're just like, Yeah, we can type.

880
02:16:56,260 --> 02:17:00,490
So I don't have anything at all. I never thought about it.

881
02:17:01,270 --> 02:17:07,330
You're trying to, like, scramble each week, but I also know that that can be tricky depending on everyone else's schedules.

882
02:17:08,020 --> 02:17:17,829
Like, if you're in the mine's pretty regular, I suppose you're going to have to remind them that my schedule runs from like nine five.

883
02:17:17,830 --> 02:17:36,020
He's my partner for he's writing afterwards and suddenly you can be like another 24 like, yeah, because I'm in my late husband.

884
02:17:37,100 --> 02:17:54,240
I know this is so hard, but it doesn't really seem like a move when there are so many things.

885
02:17:54,520 --> 02:18:13,599
I mean, I don't think the things that I reserved for not like living with some somewhere right now are like that.

886
02:18:13,600 --> 02:18:17,649
And then I want to read to really horrible.

887
02:18:17,650 --> 02:18:38,559
Just talk to people about it. It's nice to have one person who desire that can look over if there isn't any time

888
02:18:38,560 --> 02:18:52,420
during all that's going to have to make other members aware of what's right.

889
02:18:53,020 --> 02:19:08,600
Yeah, I also this is a bit of that, but I was just thinking like if we had to make room with like me and her boyfriend,

890
02:19:08,650 --> 02:19:16,809
the ones that you're like maybe like I always hope someone going, you know, I got your message like when the time I was like working out.

891
02:19:16,810 --> 02:19:23,050
So I know, like, I'm sorry. I didn't know that you can feel it.

892
02:19:23,450 --> 02:19:27,100
Yeah, I like that.

893
02:19:27,250 --> 02:19:41,450
And I think that some people don't feel like, yeah, I can say everything, so please team calendars and say, we want to be honest.

894
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:45,180
I work for most people who have it.

895
02:19:45,210 --> 02:19:56,860
I hope so. Yeah, well, I just wanted to thank you for everything.

896
02:20:04,290 --> 02:20:12,820
So that's why they were up there.

897
02:20:16,370 --> 02:20:40,560
So this was one of the things I actually think that, you know, and I was looking up at the time how, yeah,

898
02:20:40,600 --> 02:20:58,989
it was in Pakistan and the women who were putting on your shoes and also I don't know how people also with the citizens were like,

899
02:20:58,990 --> 02:21:20,160
I knew it was what to do. It was like 30 year old. Like it was like, no, it's not what you need.

900
02:21:20,890 --> 02:21:29,520
Well, yeah, I don't think, you know, you're majority.

901
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:41,210
The majority. Yeah. Yeah, I'm just, like, talking through any disagreement and just being okay.

902
02:21:44,800 --> 02:21:51,870
Oh, yeah, definitely. Yeah.

903
02:21:52,690 --> 02:22:01,690
But I think if anything to her approval rating for product like if someone's

904
02:22:02,200 --> 02:22:07,890
upset about something so right it was helpful to have other member countries.

905
02:22:08,110 --> 02:22:39,460
Yeah I think with every so that there's a little bit that they're like because I think also like when I think this might come over to idea that

906
02:22:39,910 --> 02:22:47,580
either during the week I think that the meeting that would be with like we're listening for like us to do this almost like who's doing what.

907
02:22:47,860 --> 02:22:55,730
Yeah, yeah yeah that that might actually you in somebody assistance.

908
02:22:56,110 --> 02:23:02,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

909
02:23:04,150 --> 02:23:12,040
That was kind of helpful and I think we don't need to talk about it,

910
02:23:12,040 --> 02:23:28,899
but there's no such thing as you're going to hear the numbers like on here and then I'll see you later in the day.

911
02:23:28,900 --> 02:23:38,710
How are you going to work towards.

912
02:23:41,170 --> 02:23:46,070
I just don't know.

913
02:23:47,850 --> 02:23:51,040
I just I can. I can sort of.

914
02:23:51,640 --> 02:23:57,360
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just telling you.

915
02:23:57,370 --> 02:24:11,800
Yeah, because I think on who feels more comfortable, like believe in meetings with the preceptors really kind of like younger sister.

916
02:24:14,410 --> 02:24:26,070
Yeah. Um, okay. As of right now, looks like Pakistan is not going to be in in the U.S.

917
02:24:29,920 --> 02:24:33,530
Yeah, yeah, I know what I'm going to just be like. Yeah, I know.

918
02:24:33,550 --> 02:24:38,260
I'm worried about, like, just in time for a meeting.

919
02:24:39,310 --> 02:24:50,680
Like, I was, like I said or I'm a believer in, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah.

920
02:24:50,890 --> 02:25:00,550
I like I'm like, well, like I can I can see like if I do like.

921
02:25:05,100 --> 02:25:13,930
I want to know. Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

922
02:25:21,090 --> 02:25:26,850
Yeah, I can do it. Like, when I was younger, I was like, Hey, this is going to be all that stuff.

923
02:25:28,810 --> 02:25:35,100
Yeah, exactly. Like, like the 101.

924
02:25:36,710 --> 02:25:40,080
Yeah. Yeah, it was a but it's nice to know that you have that.

925
02:25:40,110 --> 02:25:44,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And once you get around to that.

926
02:25:47,470 --> 02:26:00,480
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that will be good.

927
02:26:00,480 --> 02:26:03,920
Cause then it's not like I just, like, entirely on the air.

928
02:26:04,080 --> 02:26:24,480
Yeah. So we're going to try to get a plane and make sure that, like, you guys, like everyone in the group or.

929
02:26:24,630 --> 02:26:28,290
Yeah, just like, especially when it's one that like everyone else.

930
02:26:29,310 --> 02:26:36,690
Yeah, I think that's helpful because just like a day or a few days, like when we know that that's coming up to be like, Hey, I've got it.

931
02:26:36,900 --> 02:26:43,550
It looks good to me. Get that confirmation from everybody because, you know, I guess that's a ritual involved.

932
02:26:43,650 --> 02:26:51,299
But, you know, we can try to have like at the very least have, you know, like the day.

933
02:26:51,300 --> 02:26:59,950
I mean, like we shouldn't wait until the day to try to do like the day before, right?

934
02:27:00,450 --> 02:27:08,220
Because everything done like last minute positions so that we can submit a long time and not really running.

935
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:12,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

936
02:27:13,050 --> 02:27:18,000
I guess that's, that's what I thought.

937
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:39,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I would say the more I also think this is one that's focused on another role is like making sure we have a good time,

938
02:27:39,270 --> 02:27:59,110
like writing the list action items. That's like, yeah, because we can do like a match with somebody like that again anytime, you know.

939
02:28:02,590 --> 02:28:11,670
You know, I mean, you know you can.

940
02:28:13,260 --> 02:28:20,350
Yeah. So what have you. That's a real overlooked description.

941
02:28:22,920 --> 02:28:41,210
I mean, know, one of the things I just think about this today.

942
02:28:43,960 --> 02:28:51,550
You look at the interest rates clearly.

943
02:28:55,900 --> 02:28:59,110
But I think that's fine.

944
02:28:59,730 --> 02:29:06,020
I think we're just looking for it.

945
02:29:06,930 --> 02:29:11,900
So, yeah, I think that's what I would like to have it.

946
02:29:12,070 --> 02:29:17,890
Yeah. It's much easier to make this go towards it, just like I have.

947
02:29:18,190 --> 02:29:24,900
I also just love it. I always ride on this tremendous this here.

948
02:29:24,910 --> 02:29:30,010
It's my first year, you know, somewhere.

949
02:29:30,220 --> 02:29:49,830
Yeah. Okay. We also have to say that that was exactly what I would say.

950
02:29:54,570 --> 02:30:08,370
Probably, you know, if I were to get something like something on time rather than waiting until the last minute, I just like communicating.

951
02:30:09,510 --> 02:30:23,159
I'm working on this thing. How are you going to know what to do with that?

952
02:30:23,160 --> 02:30:32,370
I'm trying to sort of like an easy story about how we're doing.

953
02:30:33,180 --> 02:30:58,170
So we want to submit your plan for everything and you have to be using we hear like with them and

954
02:31:00,750 --> 02:31:07,860
they have been very consistent means a lot of ways that we decided to bet on Sunday afternoon.

955
02:31:07,870 --> 02:31:23,890
Are you saying I think I have it here, but I think it everything or is it because I, I feel like I wouldn't want to name the day,

956
02:31:24,300 --> 02:31:28,980
but sometimes I do like to get out of the house on the and I don't want it to be like that.

957
02:31:30,480 --> 02:31:34,110
So we were like maybe like earlier or later in the year.

958
02:31:36,390 --> 02:31:55,620
So I have been reporting from the evening sky, so many of which I mean, but night.

959
02:31:55,980 --> 02:32:17,930
I think we all know that we have to go there if we're starting this holiday weekend, is it okay to set out one week in?

960
02:32:18,240 --> 02:32:24,420
Yeah, you could also even be on day weekends.

961
02:32:25,960 --> 02:32:38,460
Yeah. So we're not going to tell you, but I know what's been said in her novel is right and then we can figure out what we're going to do that right.

962
02:32:38,460 --> 02:32:45,800
Which is why on Monday evening we're need to do our kids.

963
02:32:46,470 --> 02:32:50,380
Then we're afraid that, you know, happened.

964
02:32:50,700 --> 02:33:13,620
I have to go on Monday night with a friend like I know what kind of like maybe

965
02:33:13,620 --> 02:33:18,780
we can all try to bring together some stuff beforehand and bring in CNN's.

966
02:33:19,550 --> 02:33:29,330
I think we should go Monday this weekend then.

967
02:33:31,960 --> 02:33:59,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the thing that I don't want to be a part of this merger rule.

968
02:34:04,290 --> 02:34:20,180
I like the other stuff in this list on assignments over is part of this idea about

969
02:34:20,460 --> 02:34:24,660
can you just make like the reoccurring reading meetings on everyone's calendar.

970
02:34:24,660 --> 02:34:29,080
Yeah, I'm sure I know.

971
02:34:29,220 --> 02:34:35,650
You know, they will never. Yeah. I realize that we are.

972
02:34:35,650 --> 02:34:39,400
We feel good about the workload. Yeah, it's huge.

973
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:51,580
Yeah, well, yeah, I'll try and like, a couple ideas, essentially, just as our discussion today.

974
02:34:51,640 --> 02:35:03,070
But yeah, I'll try and get some of the technical things to come up with the unified structure.

975
02:35:04,810 --> 02:35:12,620
Like it's not like I'm not doing anything, so I don't want to find out where those are going.

976
02:35:12,700 --> 02:35:16,430
But there's nothing like that.

977
02:35:16,510 --> 02:35:22,650
Like, yeah, right, right.

978
02:35:29,480 --> 02:35:37,750
And then I think it should be everything.

979
02:35:37,750 --> 02:35:40,810
Yeah. They got one over one. Yeah.

980
02:35:41,240 --> 02:35:56,320
Yeah, definitely. The whole thing is appealing for doing so much and it is just sort of, you know, so they, you know.

981
02:35:56,830 --> 02:36:10,510
Yeah. And we can also ask like in the first one is joining the service communication receptor so they would like would you let

982
02:36:10,510 --> 02:36:35,050
your friends and like and he would want information that you have all over Twitter is going to be coming out all right.

983
02:36:36,070 --> 02:36:43,690
So I can start off with the same thing.

984
02:36:43,960 --> 02:36:47,590
Yeah. Yeah, right.

985
02:36:49,550 --> 02:36:54,890
You know how I like this?

986
02:36:55,140 --> 02:37:09,150
I think I think it's the right way to marry me and I'm happy about it.

987
02:37:09,190 --> 02:37:15,550
I think the babies are living there.

988
02:37:16,390 --> 02:37:26,200
It's just this is an area that. We don't have that in our folder.

989
02:37:27,500 --> 02:37:44,920
And I guess a couple of things I can also look at me for my job is to reach out to them and their responses to something like that, like always.

990
02:37:48,670 --> 02:37:51,910
So I've got like the assignment information in there too.

991
02:37:59,860 --> 02:38:06,640
So we can just throw everything in and then if we want to share that with our soldiers and their families.

992
02:38:07,480 --> 02:38:26,110
But as I just said, I just need to set up like that all members coming in with somebody else.

993
02:38:27,630 --> 02:38:31,420
I think I got it right.

994
02:38:31,720 --> 02:38:34,980
I got a plane and I with our agenda into it.

995
02:38:34,990 --> 02:38:41,740
So I'll be right there. Oh, and those are your are you private sector?

996
02:38:45,160 --> 02:38:50,880
Probably because there have been an impetus.

997
02:38:52,030 --> 02:39:06,510
For example, like I pulled out of the house that I had earlier today is the only thing I like.

998
02:39:07,910 --> 02:39:16,660
Practices. Oh, yeah.

999
02:39:16,840 --> 02:39:27,670
I like the organization. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1000
02:39:32,500 --> 02:39:37,210
So that doesn't worry me. And I'm very welcome.

1001
02:39:40,220 --> 02:39:50,800
Identify that. Even in this kind of thing.

1002
02:39:53,070 --> 02:39:56,500
Yeah. Let's see what we end up doing.

1003
02:39:56,620 --> 02:40:04,380
Yeah, cause I'm really interested in what is going on.

1004
02:40:04,870 --> 02:40:19,540
Yeah. So I was like, you know, like I was interested in doing this, and I just remember it's like, oh, yeah.

1005
02:40:19,810 --> 02:40:26,210
Oh, yes. I'm wondering, what is there? Yeah, yeah.

1006
02:40:27,040 --> 02:40:30,440
Right. I guess so.

1007
02:40:30,540 --> 02:40:43,810
You stay away from, like, I put on my website and all these different ways that they're trying to figure out how much you know,

1008
02:40:43,900 --> 02:40:52,360
because I know there's like a good job, but that would be like, yeah, well,

1009
02:40:53,560 --> 02:41:01,360
I know there's like some other type of clubs or is it just like in the countryside?

1010
02:41:03,250 --> 02:41:19,210
But yeah. Did you guys have any sort of an activity?

1011
02:41:19,960 --> 02:41:32,590
Yeah, yeah. But I don't that I don't know that it seemed like there were things like, for instance, from when you were here, I'm sure.

1012
02:41:33,520 --> 02:41:49,050
Yeah, I guess I was a long time is experience was more like, oh she was like this is something like family.

1013
02:41:49,820 --> 02:41:55,330
And I was like, I remember some of it was like we actually needed.

1014
02:41:57,130 --> 02:42:03,790
Yeah, that's true. I mean, I'm not trying to be I can go.

1015
02:42:04,720 --> 02:42:19,900
And it was like, I don't know how, you know, it would be a lot of learning ideas and I'd be like, Why don't you guys?

1016
02:42:21,340 --> 02:42:25,890
You know. We'll see. Yeah.

1017
02:42:26,530 --> 02:42:30,940
If it was really if there is nothing. I think some people don't want to lose.

1018
02:42:31,570 --> 02:42:42,560
I wonder if they are really interested in this, which is, you know, due to the one that has just come out.

1019
02:42:42,880 --> 02:42:47,200
Gonna be honest. Just doing some stuff. Yeah.

1020
02:42:47,210 --> 02:42:51,940
Yeah. Like, I don't know. I don't know.

1021
02:42:51,940 --> 02:42:58,020
They're like, Oh, that was very funny.

1022
02:42:58,900 --> 02:43:02,470
Well, if we, if we do need to use a to have one.

1023
02:43:02,530 --> 02:43:09,940
Yeah, they have premium. I sometimes I may get angry and I'll get in there and tears and all like really quickly download it and I'll let you know.

1024
02:43:10,090 --> 02:43:15,430
Yeah, I don't know. I feel bad about myself, but I think that.

1025
02:43:17,020 --> 02:43:23,290
Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, I know.

1026
02:43:25,140 --> 02:43:31,299
Yeah. So, you know when. Forgive me, I want you to know how to do this stuff sometimes, because sometimes they use it anyway.

1027
02:43:31,300 --> 02:43:38,620
I mean, it's just. It's just. Yeah. Like you were doing something, like, why can't you just.

1028
02:43:39,160 --> 02:43:43,420
You know. Yeah. Well, so I feel like everything I get out of it.

1029
02:43:43,940 --> 02:43:55,659
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was nice because in my group, my sister, one of my people just had it in her account, which is pretty new, I think is the word.

1030
02:43:55,660 --> 02:43:57,729
But it wasn't like her works.

1031
02:43:57,730 --> 02:44:11,690
We were able to clean slate, everything's circular thing, but I'd like to do something that you know, that I know I didn't even know.

1032
02:44:11,890 --> 02:44:20,200
So I just spoke with her.

1033
02:44:20,930 --> 02:44:24,530
Oh, yeah, yeah, I understand.

1034
02:44:24,550 --> 02:44:33,870
And so I just have to talk to the person that is, I guess, the student body, so.

1035
02:44:35,650 --> 02:44:40,470
Yeah. I don't think I was going to do that for.

1036
02:44:40,800 --> 02:44:45,370
I mean, if you were on the desert. Yeah, I probably rather go with you, but.

1037
02:44:45,370 --> 02:44:52,920
Yeah, I guess I'd like to hear somebody later, you know, like, empower them.

1038
02:44:53,140 --> 02:44:56,800
Like the library is becoming silly.

1039
02:44:57,430 --> 02:45:00,990
Oh, I think. Oh, I did have one that was going on.

1040
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,190
It's going to be more directly after that.

1041
02:45:05,140 --> 02:45:18,790
But I got into the class because I really are saying was like use of the violence prevention sounded really interesting.

1042
02:45:18,790 --> 02:45:25,150
I was just like, I don't think I can really goes back to that like library looking more so.

1043
02:45:25,960 --> 02:45:30,010
Yeah. So I was just like, you know, I just think it's just like, oh yeah,

1044
02:45:31,120 --> 02:45:38,739
I don't work out that way and I only work for 2 hours, so I really treat this like a little thing.

1045
02:45:38,740 --> 02:45:45,220
I've known you eight or nothing really is the big game plans that you know,

1046
02:45:45,910 --> 02:45:57,580
I need to get into it like a lot of people are going to my friends lives in New York, but it's not really nice to me.

1047
02:46:00,370 --> 02:46:13,360
Literally, some of my friends are with you, I would say, in the interest of energy intensive Saturdays.

1048
02:46:13,540 --> 02:46:17,410
No, not only do they always have like. Yeah, yeah.

1049
02:46:17,770 --> 02:46:19,260
Well, I guess only recently,

1050
02:46:20,500 --> 02:46:34,450
like I think maybe like the finale they don't like like so there's like Michelle besides who is always Tiger Woods and then there's two judges that,

1051
02:46:34,450 --> 02:46:37,480
like, switched on and then there's the judge.

1052
02:46:37,810 --> 02:46:47,230
So I think on the final, they just don't get stuck with it because then it's like, I don't know what to do.

1053
02:46:47,530 --> 02:46:50,770
So they want like, just like all genders. Yeah.

1054
02:46:52,720 --> 02:47:16,690
So I guess it does matter how aggressive you learn how to augment populations and at least address the question like.

1055
02:47:20,890 --> 02:47:30,520
This is important. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I don't think so.

1056
02:47:31,540 --> 02:47:36,070
Yeah, I think so.

1057
02:47:36,230 --> 02:48:01,220
Yeah, in certain ways. But you didn't have to have any kind of general questions about it.

1058
02:48:01,310 --> 02:48:14,470
They just as it seems like they're gonna have to go maybe 20 years.

1059
02:48:24,070 --> 02:48:42,450
Yeah. So they were very different than I. I mean, I thought I was going to be done.

1060
02:48:44,420 --> 02:48:58,220
I was like, you know, I don't really want to know in the long term, like.

1061
02:49:00,070 --> 02:49:05,110
Yeah. Yeah.

1062
02:49:11,230 --> 02:49:27,970
I think that's the wrong. And it's like, I don't know, it's like I yeah, I don't know, I, I'm married.

1063
02:49:28,480 --> 02:49:36,180
I only have one. And I said, okay, we have anything for you and I do this work for the morning.

1064
02:49:36,440 --> 02:49:45,020
We have to live the way I do now. You know, I really don't know.

1065
02:49:45,790 --> 02:49:49,750
But I was like I was very, you know, you like I'm done around like an hour.

1066
02:49:50,560 --> 02:49:55,629
Oh, my gosh. Yeah, yeah, something like that.

1067
02:49:55,630 --> 02:49:59,410
You hear a lot earlier. I just. Okay, so I plan to work. Yeah, no problem.
