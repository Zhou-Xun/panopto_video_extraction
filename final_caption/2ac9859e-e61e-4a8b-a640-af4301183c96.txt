00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:08,910
Scott. Good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:20,820
Good to see you. I had a couple for generous and to go over where it started to this lecture.

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:33,510
One thing is, as you try emphasis and I had posted the presentation guys and I also posted 530 paper.

4
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:40,980
So if you or if any groups want to, you know, discuss any questions,

5
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:51,480
feel free to schedule meetings or I think generally should be straightforward, but I'm happy to talk.

6
00:00:51,870 --> 00:01:02,510
And I tried to look into the possibility to have more early or late 30 or 40 year preparation pattern.

7
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,089
I don't think that's good is a good idea.

8
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:21,440
But because the epidemiology post, the session, I'm hoping to be a same day and so I try to look at a later date because Thanksgiving holiday,

9
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:27,830
we only have one chance before the last day of the console where we were.

10
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:34,500
Have a nice feel that will make people you know after Thanksgiving obviously things that

11
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:41,970
were not that big certainly not finished and so that could feel a little stressful.

12
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:57,770
And so a solution for those of you who are going to present as I respond to some of you for I think it's fair you work with your

13
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:11,520
office and to have the presentation ready if I think only you know if if any of the students who need to go to the post session.

14
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:22,679
So I hope the rest of the group will be happy to you know present and be you were in a group we may have some it's 513

15
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:33,870
students of who need to get ready for the post and may not be able to opinions but the rest of us will do the work.

16
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:45,260
Another possible solution is if you want to bring your good calls, you can store in my office, you can check my office.

17
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:53,100
I sometimes all of sudden cross. I saw one of two students, which was very nicely smooth.

18
00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:06,150
And usually when they go to interview or substantive to go to cover I almost up today in the class but I carried also I am going through a very

19
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:23,880
formal difference and require some there a special dress with and so just do whatever you you can and you are welcome to use my office for,

20
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,719
you know, a chance to store your clothes.

21
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:35,250
I have a hanger, that kind of thing. So that's for the post.

22
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:47,630
So we're we're still too and I sent you would be happy to have this done before Thanksgiving then you think okay so that's about.

23
00:03:49,800 --> 00:04:02,310
I think I will also if the assignment research posted by this week I had to review a

24
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:11,160
dissertation [INAUDIBLE] 200 page dissertation only one week after this cross before the post.

25
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:21,340
And I have to write all college of pharmacy for the defense because among the computer and other entities.

26
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:35,200
Still, I wish I could return the results sooner, but part of her work is a super nice Monday result.

27
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:51,000
So I must wait edition from model to give you a comprehensive for introduction of latest technology for vaccine development.

28
00:04:51,810 --> 00:05:02,100
I decide I was able to get a blend of former students who used some of the technology.

29
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:13,620
And I thought that give you the example how old this methodology Edison mentioned in his talk

30
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:25,020
actually could be used to identify new antigens or antigens of pathogens with vaccines for cancer.

31
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:30,330
So that's a example. What I decided to do.

32
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,510
I didn't get a chance to talk about TB vaccine.

33
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:46,350
Actually, I to the title in the home page I say TB Box and Back to Future and Lessons Learned from BCG Back.

34
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:57,030
I'm glad that you are here because today a lecture we're discussing many lessons learned from BCG, back from TB,

35
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:13,259
vaccine development that is highly relevant to infectious disease vaccines, especially those have relatively complex pathogenesis like TB.

36
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:18,030
So it's a great example to learn those lessons,

37
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:25,980
to understand some of the very important determines for vaccine fix that's

38
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:34,380
understanding hopefully will direct you to design more thoughtful clinical studies.

39
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:45,509
Now after this discussion and I invite the doctor and many of you know and of my colleagues from Epidemiology Department,

40
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:58,720
because this has been a major investigator in influenza vaccine effectiveness studies as part of the CDC supported that work.

41
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:07,649
So I originally encountered we were talking about the efficacy and the effectiveness because influenza,

42
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:15,150
some of the early studies done by some members of that group for some have retired,

43
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:24,270
but so they published some work to show how efficacy and the effectiveness can differ for a vaccine.

44
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,079
And those studies are in the papers.

45
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,090
I uploaded it for you to read, but did not.

46
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:36,240
When Dr. Martin come to talk, she will be focused.

47
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:43,580
Their work effective is in so vaccine assessment.

48
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:53,350
They are you this national network so you were with I know you all have answers to the question vaccine development.

49
00:07:53,350 --> 00:08:01,889
So even I didn't ask you after the licensure you all seem to get understand to the following the

50
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:11,250
licensure of your studies to further understand the protection effect in terms of effectiveness,

51
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:20,100
which is in the real read the realization work that's where from random control to the trial.

52
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:27,660
So how effectively this study are done and she's told me she would talk about her

53
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:34,790
research so I like to that were the effective this would be our focus this is

54
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:43,440
a vaccine but she also does some transmission the study of respiratory viruses

55
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:49,170
when she comes and may have to leave early because I have run two cognitive.

56
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:58,860
Pharmacy choose to attend to that dissertation defense starting out support for when they have to run.

57
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,570
So that's what I had. After that, I would go to another event at 6:00.

58
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:12,350
This would be okay. So what he'd like to talk about was evolution of TB epidemics.

59
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:26,880
I think a lot of since we can think about when we study TV, Brexit and in the in both epidemiology and vaccinology and how they relate to each other.

60
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:37,060
And TB vaccine actually also reflects on the evolution of vaccinology which were highlights

61
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:48,670
BCG vaccine plan mentions that in his talk that was one is one of the most widely

62
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:57,430
used the vaccine in the around the world cases has been developing for a century but why

63
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:04,850
we still don't have for a second the facts and in use and what are the lessons learned?

64
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:16,930
It mentioned that it's not so protected against all kind of disease or or age groups and even clinical trials come out.

65
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:29,170
What's the lessons we learned? How those lessons can be applied or can say that that when we develop a vaccine for other infectious disease.

66
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:37,850
So I, I think today this lecture really covers some overarching important concepts.

67
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:48,730
Don't which, which I don't necessarily ask you to memorize, but you understand when you are asked to design your study,

68
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:59,110
you want to think about what you want to see with you all know the increased trial,

69
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:12,460
the primary questions, the data collect to address primary question all seem to be quite clear from your assignment or from your other work.

70
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:21,280
But what else we need to collect in order to interpret the data?

71
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:32,710
Collect to address the main questions of the clinical trials that would be based on some of the sense that we're discussing today.

72
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:45,040
And so that's important. And then we talk about the immunogenicity immunogenicity trials and the human you may refer to.

73
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:54,070
TB. This is a major first for TB vaccine progress and we still try to learn what's the perspective.

74
00:11:54,850 --> 00:12:08,350
And then by reviewing quickly new TB vaccine development, I will show you similar approach when you do the exam you name to some of the vaccine,

75
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:16,929
including Subunit life weapon during the you know periods actually all these approach

76
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:22,930
have been explored and similarly with the COVID 19 and what's some consideration,

77
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,590
pros and cons and the challenges and opportunity of course.

78
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:38,110
So just a quick slide show once and so that's.

79
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:59,260
How many? Maybe it.

80
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,260
Stay the course. But.

81
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:58,600
There's nothing. Coming the.

82
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:16,500
Okay. So we you often sometimes probably see in the ads portrayed in the literature some of the drawings about TV.

83
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,690
Basically, TV is an ancient disease.

84
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:26,070
It's not new, despite it's the leading cause of death.

85
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:36,870
The more evidence that TV was found in spice for mummies dating back to 3400 B.C.

86
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:48,210
And studies have also suggested that Mycobacterium tuberculosis has a present in human population for at least 15,000 years.

87
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,970
Some literature, even. Or the.

88
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:59,490
Medical history books even say even longer.

89
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,950
So it's basically TB is an ancient disease.

90
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:16,140
But despite the long history of TB as a human disease, TB remains to be a major global health issue.

91
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:31,770
You want to wonder why it's so? And this is the W.H.O. 2020 report shown here is the TB is present in every country of the world.

92
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,360
Of course, with a significant regional disparity.

93
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,810
Is the darker color the incidence, the higher the incidence.

94
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:50,920
So what the population or affect look at this is sub-Saharan Africa and there's

95
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:59,970
some South East Asian countries and the Indian and the Pacific island countries.

96
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:10,770
So another substance is we reduce the like South Sudan.

97
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:22,200
So the sub-Saharan region also is the region where the HIV is very high.

98
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:30,530
And the TB another factor is a leading infectious killer of the world's population.

99
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:35,300
You wonder why for so long it has impacted humans.

100
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:45,750
We still don't have successes in control, and here, despite it, is preventable.

101
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:52,860
And the cure for it remains to be a leading infectious killer of the world's population.

102
00:16:52,860 --> 00:17:02,879
Here is the top causes of the deaths worldwide in 2019 by W.H.O. in 2020.

103
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,540
A total of 1.5 million people have died from it.

104
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:26,140
And what's really important is the challenge is of this, you know, if deaths and a significant proportion of people have HIV or co-infection.

105
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:38,850
So TB is the number one opportunity to seek infection for HIV infected people is also the number one killer of HIV infected.

106
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:45,860
Per se, and it's a recurrent theme 13.

107
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:50,330
But it is a powerful infectious disease.

108
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:58,070
That's cause it was the number one more than HIV cure.

109
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:02,360
COVID pandemic analysis just succumbed to COVID.

110
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:11,090
And another important lesson is, as you can see here, we have all TB cases.

111
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:25,370
I say that because the world TV coverage has made the ambitious goal to eliminate TB by year 2035.

112
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:32,690
So it's very important to monitor the trends.

113
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:49,300
What you can see from these trends and also in this milestone is the goal for disease control in order to achieve that innovation.

114
00:18:51,980 --> 00:19:01,510
This is the notification. This is the estimate of the cases, likely to be a likely season.

115
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:10,800
How do. It's what's in this application because of why I want to talk about the experience.

116
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:24,720
When you answer your question about the facts and study design for the trial, one of the challenges we don't know well about is.

117
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:33,090
Incidents. You have to know these. You have to know for the country, for the population, you are going to do the work.

118
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,900
You also want to know the population. So to.

119
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:48,799
Why it's important you make your vaccine priority science based epidemiologist based on how likely

120
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:58,820
the disease or infections were to determine how many people in your study sample would be how.

121
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:04,069
You can see the absence of protection.

122
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,910
So that's why it's important for you to pay attention to it.

123
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:15,290
And this is why for 513 paper, one of the top is for disease surveillance.

124
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:24,470
And so I think if you want to contribute as if you have a good chance of getting sick so you can see a lot of vacation,

125
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:33,740
it's actually how country reported they identify this is the activity once might present.

126
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,369
So there's still a huge gap right over time.

127
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:44,210
What you see the gap is. It's getting narrower at the barrel.

128
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:50,280
This reflects the progress in pieces of reporting impacting reporting.

129
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,060
But what happens here? What happens here?

130
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,210
So typically you drop what?

131
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:07,130
What happened here. You can see what happened when you had a huge drop.

132
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:19,990
Is this true? What happens in the world.

133
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:36,040
During 2020. Had there been cries to the COVID 19 pandemic or the public health, people who want to survive this tells you What do you do?

134
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:44,020
Seven. Well, that suggests enough about the disease in question.

135
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:51,490
All you really want to think about is the fact some prevent the disease as a whole infection

136
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:59,860
or medical condition of the population as a whole because of that kind of resource.

137
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:08,800
And many TV programs were not functioning as they were far away from the pandemic.

138
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:17,170
That caused people who didn't go to a hospital to see if they could manage itself.

139
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:29,440
So these are important to a sense of relevance to the vaccine and the stamp of the low ification versus the estimates, the incidence.

140
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:35,770
And then you once the gap smaller or bigger.

141
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:43,300
Of course you want to the gap between notification and the estimates the incidence.

142
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:54,030
The smaller, the better means that you are capturing the type of ever the case.

143
00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:02,220
And that's so by looking at these you can tell of course different region.

144
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:10,470
The burden was carried to the differentiate by different regions.

145
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:15,180
Another thing is that I get so much information we look at.

146
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,200
So here European region, the gap is really small, right?

147
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:25,830
For a developing country like the Africa region, it was very big.

148
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:34,230
It gets improved for some time, but it's the kind of stuff.

149
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,340
So even COVID 19 impact you can see in the for.

150
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:55,339
Yeah so the narrow the fence as you can see here your American region and we have four

151
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:03,780
relatively narrow spots of for high burden regions like Southeast Asia Africa and um.

152
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:21,040
It's a. The situation is very concerning and this definitely show you a big impacts of COVID 19 or other infectious disease that's reporting.

153
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:34,180
That's something thing. So now I'm going, Yeah, the reason I want to show the disease front is I hope some of you will be really interesting,

154
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:42,040
uh, thinking about how to improve for disease surveillance so that once.

155
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:53,710
Any questions? If. But not to ever talk about the history of the TB vaccine.

156
00:24:54,130 --> 00:25:00,370
It's very interesting. So it was developed for you, but similar comments, Jerry.

157
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:09,820
This bacteria was named after the scientists who invented for this ten year string, basically.

158
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:16,240
Here we have three pioneers for TB, vaccine development and microbiology.

159
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:30,700
Dr. Robert Cole. For those of you who has done a lot of the discovery of microorganisms of important medical importance,

160
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:49,270
including Mycobacterium tuberculosis that caused the invention of the BCG, basically is named after comment, comment.

161
00:25:49,500 --> 00:26:01,930
And to Jerry the two sciences of French sciences I think they both instructed Pasteur I actually basis

162
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:15,370
Pasteur minister of many long time ago and so this was the 19th pioneer vaccination between 1921 and 1927.

163
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:21,100
Then until 1950, BCG was widely used.

164
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:29,640
And now when you do your presentation, you will see it is one of the vaccine that.

165
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:37,250
You know, in the expanded immunization program.

166
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,370
The current vaccine is alive.

167
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:47,750
A new vaccine derived from involves.

168
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:56,510
Another important to note is a separate BCG vaccine based on different strains.

169
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:00,650
Available words of one. It's not just one single strep.

170
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:14,630
How this happens. These figures show you since the initial development involved, it's a clinical isolate.

171
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:24,230
Then this to scientists, the protein, a bio potato medium every two weeks has one pathogen.

172
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:29,120
I think it's a 1 to 2 hundreds in some passages.

173
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,800
So what happened? I'm not sure.

174
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:36,440
Until 1993 and 1990s.

175
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:51,620
You only know you. These are the strain no longer causing disease in animals, not in humans, of course, with normal immunity.

176
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:55,060
So these. They happen at.

177
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:06,930
That's just after the race. But the nine kids, nine when the whole genome sequence of the first MTV reference was released,

178
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,860
people were able to do all those microarray based hybridization.

179
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:24,480
What happened was they found the different species had lost different segments of the AMP genome.

180
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:29,420
So this is what we call the lot of the strands.

181
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:39,659
You can see many different strains since in this year from virulence and Bovis this

182
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:48,380
is a compares comparison between in what ways from which the BCG is developed.

183
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:56,069
And then we also have MPB, which is the primary human species that they would, you know,

184
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:03,780
make a difference are the images of regions of difference by sequence match later.

185
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,510
And so decades later. How 42 years later?

186
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:17,190
Actually more than than five. The difference of BCG spreads names here.

187
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:29,160
1934 we see the prices of our companies exports the strength that big fermentation companies are to to produce.

188
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,639
They had four different country.

189
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,879
BCG Pasteur is a famous one and the BCG Tunney's pasture.

190
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:45,700
One, three, three, one. These these two are very widely used.

191
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:51,540
They are the gospel. They use a defensive technique to maintain the culture.

192
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:59,010
So what's really happened here? It's all the region difference identified for different strengths.

193
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:07,830
When the vaccine was produced by different strains with different genetic companies.

194
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,160
Some bought some more genes than others.

195
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:27,300
And you could expect the variation in the the, you know, biological properties of the vaccine made a difference.

196
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:40,680
But the reason this was not really understood until the genome sequence came out and this is why,

197
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:47,220
you know, the mouse 4 to 6 Y demonstrates a significant difference.

198
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:58,200
It also demonstrates some variation cause for different disease across different age groups.

199
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:03,780
Why? Because the different age groups had a different type of disease.

200
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:13,100
That's that's important. And so what's really how bad it is?

201
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,660
I think Brant mentioned it very widely.

202
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:26,660
You can see here what what you can see here. It varies between 45 to 99%.

203
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:41,390
And also for different of age buildings, vaccination provides 82% protection against the public school age, you have no word.

204
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:47,360
And then for adults, it's even lower.

205
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:55,580
So for some of the early studies. I include the one child here.

206
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:08,320
You see how that affects people. As you can see, it's widely different and to some not marginally so.

207
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:12,820
And no protection around the zero.

208
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:20,950
And then some are really high or some for this one with their study shows other one.

209
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:27,550
So the take home message is that it's wide within the verbal.

210
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,320
If you are interested in. Fine.

211
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:42,130
Now I'm just before I go, I would like you to think about what could cause this a peak of variation among the different,

212
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:47,260
you know, different clinical trials strategies.

213
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:53,390
And I we were hoping a few minutes to answer that question.

214
00:32:53,810 --> 00:33:06,860
Here is a list of the different studies that show quite a range of issues and not all of them under in the pop today,

215
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:11,480
go to the medical library basement. You can find a review of literature.

216
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:26,060
Then what's really alarming in the history of obesity, that's, of course, a huge debate and what you had to call a group,

217
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:38,720
the Biological Products Expert Committee, to discuss particularly what could be the cause.

218
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:46,520
This is the study in southern India showing cooked food in the place.

219
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:57,260
And these studies really showed no protection at all.

220
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:06,480
You can go back to figures of vaccinated versus unvaccinated versus vaccinated.

221
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:17,720
And the number of TB cases, the high and the cancer protective vaccines ranged from 0 to 80.

222
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:26,600
But this is the largest studies. You know, certainly unvaccinated people versus 60.

223
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:31,310
Vaccinating people. You are talking out of hand, some people.

224
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:47,060
And then of was also use of the two most potent vaccines, the Spanish instrument and the puskas that's shown no protection.

225
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:59,230
So when this study came out, you really feel pressed to have of discussed it.

226
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,270
You know, you can see here what you can absorb here.

227
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:15,400
First, look at the protection effects that is so widely variable.

228
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,350
That's the what's this?

229
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:23,530
The follow up is the study results.

230
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:34,670
Is that based on how how many years by looking at the typical exposure, this is not important to consider.

231
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:44,060
What a typical exposure is means that exposure to a typical cycle bacteria you know

232
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:51,920
micro bacteria is a big family due and the mycobacterium tuberculosis it's only a.

233
00:35:55,010 --> 00:36:01,790
You know, some French have a big family, including some pathogenic,

234
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:11,040
some both cancer genetic environments, mycobacteria and a somewhat pathogenic opportunistic.

235
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,210
This group a hazard.

236
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:27,220
I saw an article, I think maybe four or five, six, 13 students in high school that had the opportunity to learn the concept of opportunities.

237
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:35,600
I know I want to spend. Sorry.

238
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,870
Could you repeat the question? Could you repeat the question? I'm sorry.

239
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:45,170
The question is, what is the pathogenic opportunistic pathogen,

240
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:51,590
opportunistic pathogens or like pathogens that will that are generally like in the body.

241
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:59,390
But when something happens in the body that causes you to compensate compensation or something like that, they're able to cause an infection.

242
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:03,439
Yeah, it's the organism.

243
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:17,030
Thank you. Um, that's. Don't cause the pathology in humans when the individual has a normal immune immune competence.

244
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:22,100
But when your immunity is compromised, this could cause disease.

245
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:29,870
And so the like, Mycobacterium Avians usually tend to cause the human disease.

246
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:37,100
But before HIV infected, it's a big it's one of the major pathogen.

247
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:46,010
So here's a typical is means the population being exposed to a typical mycobacterium,

248
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:52,360
which is in the environments which belong to the micro bacteria channel.

249
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,360
Um, but they share some common antigens.

250
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:11,270
They don't cause the disease, but if they share some common antigen with disease causing pathogen, what may happen if they have a high exposure?

251
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:24,220
Where is the population who are exposed to environments?

252
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:30,990
Organisms that have overlapping antigens.

253
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:42,450
What does that induce? Some immunity that can also provide some protection to the pathogenic organism.

254
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:53,040
So if the you know environment to have some packaging.

255
00:38:53,490 --> 00:39:02,760
That's packaging it I have. We have for the disease causing bacteria called the pathogen.

256
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:12,750
We also have some belong to the family but a lot lung disease causes pieces of this family complex.

257
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:21,750
So if they happen some homologous in their antigenic profile, they may.

258
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:32,340
When the residents are exposed to those environment capacity, they may also be kind of the,

259
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:41,130
you know, immune by the environment, the pathogen that's a shell or some antigen with MTBE.

260
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:44,760
So that could provide some protection.

261
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:55,230
If you run a vaccine trial in our environment, the local population has a very high exposure.

262
00:39:55,890 --> 00:40:11,460
Would you see the vaccine protects you higher or lower than its would have if the local population does not have high exposure.

263
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:25,150
The vaccine will be a higher protection or be higher if you don't know what it these.

264
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,930
Contributing some. Yeah.

265
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:36,780
The environment can contribute to some immunity, so can be effective.

266
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:42,690
Would be the efficacy if we run a clinical trial.

267
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:53,190
You know, here you have population, let's say, no matter if you if the so this is a community,

268
00:40:54,780 --> 00:41:07,050
it has a be it's also this is important concept, but it's not so different.

269
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:16,080
Okay. You heard from a some are typical. We see a typical a typical means they are not a typical person.

270
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:25,620
What are the here some are common and so people even these poor you being exposed

271
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:33,269
to these they weren't be immune by this lung pathogenic organisms because

272
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:51,629
of this pathogen pathogenic organisms also share some hormones with the pathogenic organism so this people we're be kind of immune against the MPB,

273
00:41:51,630 --> 00:42:08,090
for example, in this case. Correct. Because the sheer antigen by leukemia constantly exposed to this long pathogenic organ that's a shield.

274
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:17,149
And you will have some immunity induced by this pathogen because of this sort of pathogenic organism.

275
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:21,830
And the pathogenic organ have some common antigen.

276
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:28,310
Then some of the immunity induced by these can also work against that.

277
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:37,740
So you bring up population. You have many people who have been immunized by the environment pathogen.

278
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:50,570
If you run a clinical trial here without knowing who is exposed to the long pathogenic of open is sharing

279
00:42:50,630 --> 00:43:03,050
antigen with these pathogenic organism where you absorb for a lower protection of the vaccine or higher.

280
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:16,890
Right, Brianna. I mean, you may try be market or but if look like the direct effects.

281
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,080
You may cover some of the vaccine. In fact, Kroger.

282
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:36,690
Yeah. Explain a little bit more for just like overall will be more protection pretty good if you were looking at just the people who three effects

283
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:44,480
can see a much smaller difference between them and the unvaccinated people because the unvaccinated also have you will see small difference,

284
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:48,120
right. That's a small difference. Translating to a lower protection.

285
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:53,530
Why? Because your control group are supposed to be totally like you.

286
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:03,480
You may not say immunized against people because normally you have your control.

287
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:15,870
You are hesitant. A lot of exposure to a typical environment, but this too would be very different.

288
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:22,140
These are the person who gets the vaccine immunity from only a vaccine.

289
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:33,419
But for you environments where you have a lot of environment to organize that also provides some cross immunity against the disease,

290
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:38,700
causing people, then your control for the baseline will be higher.

291
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:48,090
If this is a high this is supposed to do this, then you your control, you already have this high is still under the.

292
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:53,680
So when you subtract these two. It will be smaller.

293
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:59,650
The difference that we're showing your bird, it's a protection.

294
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:06,150
This is important for cancer. When you design a vaccine trial,

295
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:18,120
you want to know if there are some environmental organisms that could provide the cause immunity against the pathogen.

296
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:23,010
This why I told you. You know, we were revisit all the concepts.

297
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:32,640
Now we are reverse. So you can see. Some of the very low protection claims.

298
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:37,740
If you look at these, they all have very high atypical.

299
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:46,650
Michael, back to your exposure. Does doesn't make sense because everyone agrees on this.

300
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:59,550
So if you this means the when you choose the population study site, you want to check if equally in the environmental studies site,

301
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:12,130
there are any organisms that actually share some antigenic profile from the disease causing organ people,

302
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:20,370
then exposure to that, you know, has no pathogenic organism after that.

303
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:31,830
To show the virulence the pathogen, you may see the protection is tested.

304
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:43,740
It's not really to the vaccine. It's just for your control groups will have been immunized by the environmental exposure.

305
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,560
That's a make of the differences. Smaller.

306
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:53,430
Is that clear? And of course, you can ask now.

307
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,260
Yes. Does that make sense? Yeah.

308
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:04,290
You know, normally you would just expect no protection here at all.

309
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:13,290
And then this is your back. And then if you subtract it from here to here, it's very big.

310
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:17,170
But if you only subtract this one, subtract.

311
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:21,740
So this one from here, the difference is solely what's.

312
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:34,320
Of course, this elevates the competition even without boxing, because of exposure to the typical organ in the event this is very important.

313
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:38,370
Okay, so what's the other possible?

314
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:42,930
Cause if you look at these, you can see.

315
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:51,830
This. These are the old age group, the relatively younger age group.

316
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:58,040
So these are a number of factors. This slide is very important.

317
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:02,840
When you interpret the vaccine trial. You want to keep this in mind.

318
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:11,720
I showed you the genetic difference in BCG stress, where you have four different trials run in different place,

319
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,370
all especially when the FDA is trying to make a license.

320
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:23,210
Sure. And they're trying to determine if one vaccine is better than other.

321
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:27,440
You want to make sure there's the strong difference.

322
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,350
Right. If that's a strong contribution.

323
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:40,190
And the methodological difference among the clinical trials, you really don't know if the study design has any different.

324
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:47,280
We're talking about the, you know, some someone you talk about to match the population.

325
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:52,370
You have to look at that so many clinical trials from your assignment.

326
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,780
And so methodological difference kind of hype.

327
00:48:57,290 --> 00:49:02,870
I'm going to also send a combine for clinical trial documents to you.

328
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:10,840
There were some submissions I thought I had to trouble, too, to go through the by there.

329
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:15,020
There's some some ghostwritten that I couldn't take.

330
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:20,970
I was still troubleshooting. And another thing is human population difference.

331
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:35,390
We talked about this epitope. You have to prep for presentation of your antigen presenting cells to present your vaccine to immunize the population.

332
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:47,240
If there are genetic difference, if the vaccine do not come from the epitopes, that's what the match will is recognized by the target population.

333
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:58,250
You may not see a good protection. Another thing is varying levels of precision among host populations.

334
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:05,750
When you see difference in the vaccine protects, you'll always wonder why nutritional status is important.

335
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,000
You know, can't, like, creative stuff.

336
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:20,610
So you'll have lots of protection. Definitely. Yeah.

337
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:28,190
Thank you. You. You have to, you know, generate the antibodies of any immune to respond.

338
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:33,310
If you are malnourished, you would not have that ability to regenerate.

339
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:42,550
This is why one of the very, very well known infectious disease physician in China,

340
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:50,200
when they were response to the pandemic, he said, I told my I knew him from some conference and he said,

341
00:50:50,200 --> 00:51:02,420
I told you my patient to go to have to accept the COVID 19 because basically you try to boost your immune system by has

342
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:12,640
a good sufficient nutrient supply otherwise you won't have the protein to make your antibodies or so that's important.

343
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:25,120
Virulence the difference among MGP strains. Our molecular epidemiology studies have really demonstrated despite the TB, you know,

344
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:34,810
is the everyone knows TB is caused by MPB but very few people to think if one

345
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:42,280
patient this strain may differ from another patient in a significant way.

346
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:53,919
And so we this if you happen to you know have vaccine use in a population where it's a very highly virulent strain that

347
00:51:53,920 --> 00:52:06,670
could also impact varying efficacy of the PC against the primary infection in children and the endogenous reactivation.

348
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:19,800
This is another important and why I think we need to use the GP as a model organ if you look at the pathogenesis.

349
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:35,430
Not so good. So here you have a birth and then you have an expo here.

350
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:47,340
So what happens is this exposure can cause some primary disease.

351
00:52:51,040 --> 00:53:02,800
It can also cause this aortic valve in a normal immunocompromised individual and maybe the life premature.

352
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:14,230
You know, you have more 5 to 10% of people if these and then the majority of people become failed CPR.

353
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:22,380
But this PVI at some point can reactivation.

354
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:32,520
So this is another episode kind of helping you to to react to things.

355
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:40,200
But the systems that episode have also been exposed here again.

356
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:58,310
So that you can also, you know, hey, Bergen County, this is the kind of episode also it's due to this calls.

357
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:12,500
And the reality is this is a very important city currently is considered to be very effective against the primary.

358
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:23,670
But it's a balance to help with these and how.

359
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,960
But this is the importance of passing,

360
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:39,390
because once a quarter to one third of the world's population is estimated to already be having these you exposed.

361
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:44,170
You have four positive for these contests. If you go to do that.

362
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:51,000
You have a peak in duration, then you can have this of.

363
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:57,630
But you can stay healthy throughout your lifetime if you don't come home so busy.

364
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:09,930
That's why most adult TB in developing country occurred due to this mechanism because they were high exposure.

365
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:14,130
Many people have been exposed so most the end of that.

366
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:31,000
This is why BCG hasn't works very well against adult pulmonary TB, but a pediatric TB severe type of TB all shown very quickly.

367
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:40,500
That's why W.H.O. recommend the BCG as the major and expanded.

368
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:45,420
You like to vaccinate most of the countries except for some western country.

369
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:50,610
We're not to use in BCG because the the risk is not.

370
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:56,580
So if you have a disease so complicated future poor disease,

371
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:12,840
it's not so all due to new infection then having only one vaccine that's protect the only primary disease would not be effective.

372
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:16,590
We have to find how these the process.

373
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:25,620
What's the organ doing? What's the major determines to make this performance?

374
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:31,050
Infection. Latent infection. Become a disease.

375
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:39,660
Become an active. So this is a lot of research.

376
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:49,530
So for a disease like this, keeping a large proportion of the world's population already infected, that carries organs.

377
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:53,819
And when their immunity is compromised,

378
00:56:53,820 --> 00:57:04,470
either having the some more than from chronic disease or cancer due to different ways of their immunity reduced.

379
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:12,020
In that situation they were have and can reactivate.

380
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:15,900
They become new future proof of the disease.

381
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:24,510
So for most vaccine preventable diseases, the vaccine strategy is to focus on, well,

382
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:39,240
these don't cause not cause the disease complete this pathway, but because people's disease can come from API activation.

383
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:45,500
So you need a vaccine. Neither vaccine for this stage.

384
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:51,890
This is why a lot of the research to date understand what it is.

385
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:56,370
They are some other not a disease.

386
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:06,330
Any disease that can include a lot of a latency infection, asymptomatic infection, if this infection can become future disease.

387
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:15,120
You want to have a vaccine charity for the vaccine, like most the vaccine preventable disease we are doing today.

388
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:19,920
You also want to have a vaccine that's focus.

389
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:25,050
Well, look at the activation of latency.

390
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,420
So this makes the strategy for TB vaccine more common.

391
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:40,310
Okay. Measles, polio, smallpox, or it's working, you know, but these don't have the disease.

392
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:50,640
No infection, no disease. But because the TB or TBI is present is such a big proportion of the world's population.

393
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:58,920
If they if we don't have a vaccine block this possible, then you wear this big of which would be to disease control.

394
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:11,240
Does that make sense? Yeah. So stop to think about if you are presented with a disease that's a similar pathogenesis

395
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:18,240
is not to just get the infection program with a disease and then the organism would be

396
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:24,629
there was an interest in saying once that you got so TB would be to have the TB forever

397
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:31,330
because it doesn't clear it's just a dormant grafting granuloma by all the macrophage.

398
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:36,110
I try not to get too much, but basically thanks.

399
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:41,250
But I hope you do understand this.

400
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:51,450
Okay then the last point we talked about, the effect is for the environment from mycobacteria.

401
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:58,650
That's a typical back here. You can see, you know, even you think about HPV vaccine.

402
00:59:59,310 --> 01:00:05,610
If you think about pneumococcal vaccine given sirup, you made sirup hydrates.

403
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:09,690
And it's because they are determined by antigen.

404
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:21,780
But if it's not determined by antigen, so by other factor, if you focus on Western, you may want to increase any environmental related diseases.

405
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:27,690
That's the normal strep in your head.

406
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:37,820
Maybe Sarah Pipe that of course, but you may want to understand if there are any overlapping that could cause,

407
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:44,360
uh, you know, reduce the protection because of the environment exposure.

408
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:50,040
So this is about BCG lessons from Prezi.

409
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:55,249
That's the implications really broad for any vaccine development.

410
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:59,070
Okay, then how quick note is BCG vaccine safety?

411
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:11,910
Um, basically what's important is to know, like any opinion or facts, um, the attenuation is a relative concept.

412
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:21,000
It's a virulence for some people, but not an issue for everyone.

413
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:27,830
If someone has a compromised immune yeah, then the next use.

414
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:31,590
This is more general the HPV pathogenesis.

415
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:38,160
For those of you who are interested, I. Encourage you to read some of the papers.

416
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:42,540
It shows you how complicated.

417
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:50,070
You know, you have this transmission. Don't think many people speak to me.

418
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:57,110
You have the initial infection and then the macrophage itself will destroy it.

419
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:04,180
Reaction and then subtract. And maybe there's enough we can do to fear you.

420
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:22,380
So they will all lined up become they used to call the corpses fact basically I'll try for all the immune cells into this form.

421
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:34,020
Some are more and more up the organs and then TCR immunity will take place.

422
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:43,200
And basically one important thing is to recognize this is a what and all the immune

423
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:51,480
cells were attracted to macrophage that's a component and you can see back here.

424
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:56,980
Are a what of it were stay here dormant for months.

425
01:02:57,450 --> 01:03:06,290
This is ATP and. Well, people have said they must have this structure in their lungs that you can do this.

426
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:13,040
But this compromise, this wall can be broken.

427
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:17,240
Simply, simply. Yeah.

428
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:23,300
Then one big segment is to be protected immunity.

429
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:33,560
Because when the immune response is so complex and you want to understand what particular subsets of the immunity is,

430
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:38,300
this is done in the vaccine trial. Some of the studies.

431
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:44,050
Example you have reviewed these are helpful in the study.

432
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:50,840
What's the immune response? We're, you know, absolved after the vaccine.

433
01:03:50,840 --> 01:04:00,050
That's, uh. So now I'm going to summarize this strategy for TB vaccine.

434
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:07,970
What we call is a TB pathogenesis oriented approach for developing TB vaccines.

435
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:14,120
So, as I say, we need the two types of vaccine for TB.

436
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:20,210
Prevent TB disease reigns supreme infection.

437
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:26,510
This is like any of the commonly used to try to with the vaccine.

438
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:37,670
Basically you give to people who had not been infected by MPB and then you generate the vaccine.

439
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:43,820
Generous immunity where? Oh, I told you what brought this up.

440
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:52,700
You also need some vaccine for the post-infection, which is basically if you've already got the infection,

441
01:04:52,880 --> 01:05:01,770
latent for the infection, and then you want to block the activation pathway.

442
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:05,750
So that's the post, the infection here.

443
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:09,350
The goal is very clear.

444
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:19,650
I already kind of explained. Of course, there's advantages or disadvantages this advantage.

445
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:30,080
If we try to put the vaccine we have where you start your immunization system to deliver this vaccine.

446
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:38,800
So and then also children have not been exposed and also a lot of infection.

447
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:53,090
Animal is a model presented to us for this kind of vaccine and for the then the post the vaccine that's in there.

448
01:05:53,090 --> 01:06:00,080
It's a great so because we have such a big proportion of the working population is latently infected.

449
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:13,830
So if you can prevent this one third of the working population that's actually custody because these people broke down with it,

450
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:17,720
become a new source of transmission. So it's very good.

451
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:25,580
And for this, we're really address the burden of the disease and especially and also the poverty.

452
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:36,020
And then efficacy trials could be shorter and smaller because these are already infected.

453
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:43,570
But the disadvantage, you know, is the major burden is in.

454
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:55,340
And that means it would take a very long time to have enough of disease occurrence to measure lots of the burden.

455
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:03,230
And those, especially with the BCG, is success in child protection.

456
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:10,940
And so it it's become very large, very long efficacy trials.

457
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:24,600
But the post infection has really a advantage focused on the major disease burden which is handled from that's very good,

458
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:28,880
you know, example of vaccines that work post-exposure.

459
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:41,180
So it'll also be some good understanding what microbial factors play a role.

460
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:46,940
In turn, these become active in disease.

461
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:57,100
Today, there have been some vaccine called a matrix stage vaccine, meaning have some antigen made the uh.

462
01:07:57,620 --> 01:08:06,890
Made from. You know, factors that regulate this stuff.

463
01:08:07,310 --> 01:08:13,340
There also is the antigens response for activation.

464
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:19,730
So to put this as a subunit vaccine, we see more than one antigen.

465
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:23,120
Several of them are under development.

466
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:33,050
Another is not really for TB prevention, but it's something you've probably heard a lot in the COVID pandemic.

467
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:42,230
There have been larger studies to see if you can protect against COVID 19

468
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:51,380
inches a lot of trials because it has this ability to induce cellular immunity.

469
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:57,560
And so it has been exported for immunotherapy.

470
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:19,010
And decades ago, people use BCG, largely concentration BCG, to flush the bladder for the purpose of immunotherapy, blood cancer, bladder cancer.

471
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:24,020
So this is speaking to the immunization infectious.

472
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,040
It's a puppis additional information want to issue.

473
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:34,490
So two men currently pursue the vaccine development strategy because the BCG is

474
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:41,990
still quite successful in terms of prevent against the severe pediatric TB.

475
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:48,290
So one approach is replacement of APC with that alternative priming vaccine,

476
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:54,650
and another is to deliver a booster vaccine months or even years after BCG vaccine.

477
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:58,040
So you don't in other words, you don't wish to.

478
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:06,740
BCG from your team, as is a common goal, is to return the protective benefits of BCG.

479
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:15,270
Here I see more potent and the safer version.

480
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:21,510
This would be another five of hundreds if we now we know what's the laws in different

481
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:28,970
the BCG thought strands the one positive instance of restore some of lost one.

482
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:39,030
That's because the over attenuation you know what it is when you this safety and the virulence of for a

483
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:47,490
ten year effects it's a tradeoff and if you over upon your age it may safe but it may not be as potent.

484
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:58,790
So that's the one work and this is the plans work 15 to identify you and teaching that's a could

485
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:06,570
be involved in importance of cancer genesis process especially we suppose that the consequences

486
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:16,860
and the potential vaccine strategies here is a subunit vaccine like I say gave some editing

487
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:26,590
the relevance to this the pathogenesis that we get some hydrogen with called the latent API,

488
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:34,770
the activation of antigen and to make the subunit vaccine can have a more than what antigen.

489
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:43,790
We see two things that protected all epitope vaccine taken from different entry into one and the another is because

490
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:56,579
people still people seem to live up and your vaccine may induce more sustained antigen stimulation because they are life,

491
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:00,149
they can induce the backs. So why approach is alive?

492
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:04,350
Michael, back to your vaccine. Why is a recombinant for BCG back?

493
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:11,259
Some use BCG as a vector and then incorporates some importance of pathogenesis.

494
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:17,190
Is that related? And this. Well, we have of course already in an exam.

495
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:25,490
See if you knew what technology or vaccine can control with back some better than nature infection.

496
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:40,230
The answer is yes because you really could you enhance the is then by you purposely enlarge some positive for good impact protect impact of

497
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:52,590
Brexit use instance of the vaccinology reverse vaccine and now it's the live attenuated strain of MTB making do a pioneer restrict in for BCG.

498
01:12:52,830 --> 01:13:06,240
It's a major selection process person person putting 230 some generations over a 12 years or 11 to 12 years appear.

499
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:16,400
It's naturally those but the today I showed you that the BCG fan and with no difference at all to students property then you could

500
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:29,190
think about to make a new one by you know repeats of some of the deletion but maybe people restore some beliefs to another.

501
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:33,390
You can also add to non pathogenic Michael back here.

502
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,100
This is what I told you.

503
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:49,559
This environment actually there was there is one non pathogenic back from the soil of South African in clinical trial of this because of the

504
01:13:49,560 --> 01:14:03,299
share from antigen the not a disease caused it's like a natural you attenuate the strain of microban so it isn't really an interesting thing.

505
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:07,680
You know active it's a wholesale vaccine.

506
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:16,860
So all the approach still being explored and the reason I want to talk to the by accident because

507
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:24,500
it's a really kind of for all what we talk about it's a different lecture into one vaccine.

508
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:34,659
So that's very good. Another thing I don't have time to talk in detail of today, but I want to highlight.

509
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:46,649
So once this is experimental models, it evaluates the anti TB effects and the latest advance in the field.

510
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:56,430
I want to call your attention to this and I have to mention this more than once at a different time.

511
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:07,500
That's when we use animal models have really contribute to the development of new medical.

512
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:14,910
Medication due to shocks or new vaccines.

513
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:18,930
But wouldn't we use animal studies?

514
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:28,620
One primary question we want to understand do we have animal models that really mimic human infection?

515
01:15:29,370 --> 01:15:39,659
And the reason that it post the infection TB vaccine strategy is that's a challenge because we don't have a good model animal.

516
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:51,120
Don't believe that low dose of form granuloma in mice they they don't have the same pathogenesis as human disease.

517
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:59,780
In that case the knowledge from small animal studies is limited.

518
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:08,790
There is a limitation in terms of how translate, how that can be translated in human experience.

519
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:19,670
For however long human primates a very good model, although it's very costly, as you say.

520
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:24,780
And so the epidemiology is the use sometimes to think about the population variation.

521
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:36,360
And then when you do just a few monkeys or other lung cancer really address that diversity.

522
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:43,890
That's why some of the bioinformatics approach could work together to answer this question.

523
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:50,640
Epidemiology studies. And that's where also the impacts of vaccine.

524
01:16:50,940 --> 01:17:00,840
You want to see how high is the latent TB in the population to determine if you really need to post the infection Brexit.

525
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:11,660
And so all these epidemiologists study work inform you do you need more and of the vaccine or childhood vaccine and

526
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:23,430
then HIV prevalence population also have you know different response to vaccine or the ability to make sure vaccine.

527
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:32,960
So these are the challenges and opportunities mechanism of NPV infection rates and the reactivation.

528
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:38,670
This is a challenge because we need a post-infection vaccine.

529
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:46,079
We have to understand the events of this mechanism and the determination of key elements of

530
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:53,940
protecting immune response to MPP and the Sirup and of for protective effects in vaccine trials.

531
01:17:54,240 --> 01:18:02,580
This is what we see we need to do more immunogenicity trials, collect comprehensive immune responses,

532
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:12,569
data, then try to analyze the immune response against the actually protection who gets a disease.

533
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:15,840
So who didn't get when using a vaccine trial.

534
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:28,530
It's not for all the vaccinated individuals are protected when you have if we're only let's say 70% protection you were hep was 30% up in the

535
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:43,520
Peskin group vaccinated group were not protected in that case by comparing the comprehensive immunity between the individual who got the vaccine,

536
01:18:43,530 --> 01:18:54,930
got protected and the individuals who were not so protected despite having a risk that will allow you to learn protecting immunity.

537
01:18:55,950 --> 01:19:01,570
Does that make sense? Yeah. So that's yeah.

538
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:05,970
More is the high rates of exposure reinfection here.

539
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:16,620
So in a way we may need some and the vaccine that's work like tried and protected from primary infection.

540
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:28,090
Then some of the important things ask you if you are going to do back after you come to wish to pieces your back.

541
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:33,100
So these are some even more complications, the status of the TV box.

542
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:38,290
And I have a review article for you. But I also want to show you this sofa.

543
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:44,170
It has been a long battle against TV.

544
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:48,220
And even back in 20 years, every year,

545
01:19:48,430 --> 01:20:02,740
international union against the TV and Land Pieces sells stamps and promotes the words contributes to a TV elimination battle.

546
01:20:02,770 --> 01:20:06,860
Today we still do, and that is a wonderful art science project.

547
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:21,970
This is a macrophage engulf the macrophage as a result of the mycobacterium the pig and see the acids faster than that.

548
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:27,580
That's all for today and the break. And then Dr. Martin will come.

549
01:20:28,150 --> 01:20:31,590
That's. 230.

550
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:40,889
If I don't get to stay to the end of talk, I would leave for my defense meeting then.

551
01:20:40,890 --> 01:20:44,460
I just wish you all good weekend.

552
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:50,100
No, I mean, that's the good to say goodbye properly.

553
01:20:50,610 --> 01:20:56,460
I already told you. Yeah. Let's take the 13 minutes of break and then come back.

554
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:03,120
Yeah. I don't know. Hmm. Oh, sorry.

555
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:06,440
10 minutes will come back to you.

556
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:07,650
Sorry.
