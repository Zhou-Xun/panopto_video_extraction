1
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:08,630
So in was safe. Can you want to add something to all that?

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,000
We always talk about the morning of the war. Right.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,580
You have to the world policy. You have the word, then that's.

4
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,790
You have one policy in this. Couple more things.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:29,620
Make sure that the war meets the water quality standard. Visual inspection is one way they as the video just show you that's great.

6
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,060
Chris The cool water OC Positive water, but that doesn't mean that's safe.

7
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,770
So you have to test them. This is democracy.

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:50,790
Okay. So in this week, we'll talk about testing chemicals and microbiology, contaminants in the water.

9
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,019
In the water, what we can do.

10
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,810
What I tell you is some you may not see the specific methods, but just general, what's the message we can use?

11
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,370
It's not easy. Okay. I mean, what's the I want to tell you, it's not really easy.

12
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,970
The reason for that, some of the chemical coefficient, it's very low PBT.

13
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,120
So let's talk about condition PPD part three.

14
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,260
Okay. And how many timpani we have. What?

15
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:30,530
A lot depends on how you classify. Okay. That's why a minimum of 84,000, 84,000, 84,000.

16
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,790
Probably more than that for use. You want to test all of them?

17
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:44,120
Okay. To test all of them. We do have a method to test all of them, especially in the water with matches for them in the water.

18
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,479
One test. All of them. And that's a problem we have.

19
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:53,570
Let me tell you, we have put them on my lab. We try to test some of the chemicals from the wastewater.

20
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:04,830
We try to develop the methods to do that. It takes that effort from the sophisticated instruments to do this, get some some equipment.

21
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,280
It's not easy. Job is very challenging to get. And sometimes we just cannot do it.

22
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,809
Okay. And then, I mean, is there maybe there are.

23
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,799
We can let you take them. Okay. Some of them before.

24
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,810
We don't know whether they exist. But now with development of instruments, now take them.

25
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,740
Some of the chemicals like that could before they may exist.

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,800
But we just cannot take it now because the development disruption that would tend to take.

27
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,280
Ever go to the puberty? New puberty?

28
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,090
Never. So. Testing.

29
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:52,430
Monitoring is a key one of the key component of the civil union.

30
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,960
One and that. Okay.

31
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:03,630
You will be able to depict two more things. How can we do this?

32
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,540
Yes, really? I just mentioned to really improve the House by default.

33
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,210
If we don't know, we don't see. Sometimes people need leadership and these are helpful.

34
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,710
Kiss them kisses if they don't require tested test.

35
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,340
So no test. No see. And there's nothing you.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,360
Okay. That's sometimes the practice.

37
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,200
If something goes wrong, we can test them. We can see anything.

38
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:41,050
And that's what's on the agenda we have set. When I first came to office, this department, I tried to develop a project with with a swim,

39
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:49,540
so to speak, of in the company and to monitor the waste water quality there.

40
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,560
And they don't want me to go there because it's yeah, we we comply.

41
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,950
Now, if you come here, you may find the problem. And I can see that before.

42
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:08,800
Okay, we'll, we won't. We use some more, relatively more sophisticated methods to to monitor, to detect.

43
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,970
Okay. So but that's really impact for the health, right?

44
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,469
So if we know something there and if before we don't know,

45
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,590
but now we know we won't be able to take some of these chemicals and then we can know that exposure.

46
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:30,200
Okay. I also know that we got into compliance, but we also want to know that was exposed to Labor.

47
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:36,020
So that was the health impact was the risk associated with this specific can contaminants in the water.

48
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,600
Okay. So that's really the monitoring is very important because these are very important.

49
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,750
And we talk about the chemicals, biological contaminants already in the water,

50
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:56,150
even some some genes or 12 out of the genes contaminants or for the chemicals or gaming chemicals are major chemicals.

51
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,270
Some ways or anthropogenic release some is susceptible.

52
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:08,440
Getting the chemicals we we reduce the effect a lot of synthetic or getting chemicals now we will

53
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:14,540
see you now volatile organic from the chemicals some of these chemicals you can see I mean,

54
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,850
now if you think about your life, daily life, okay.

55
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,600
Do you think about this in life now? When you woke up, we woke up.

56
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,690
We start exporting these chemicals. Right.

57
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:37,150
I mean, that necessarily they'll kill you, right? But just every time you wake up in the morning and in front of you explore chemicals.

58
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,280
Obviously the chemicals, a lot of them.

59
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:55,820
And then one day yesterday I went to a to the AGM facility when I gave the immediate estimate of the chemicals in the in the in the unit for CBC.

60
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:02,080
Did you just do the renovation recently and I talked to the staff to do this.

61
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,450
I have to smell this is. No, I don't smell that they use you can use it for one time.

62
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,330
I think you should open the door. Open the window now because you are exposed to the chemo.

63
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:20,290
I don't know what chemicals. Yeah, but I know this chemical is not good for you, so I think that's just.

64
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:27,150
What do we use all the time now? Okay, you are getting chemical metals, minerals ready, nucleotides of nutrients.

65
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,530
We'll talk about a lot of other nutrients, sediments. That's all the chemical contaminants we have.

66
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,160
And we asked Wilson how this disaffection by father right in the United States,

67
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,229
for example, we were required to use the chemicals to kill the bacteria.

68
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,680
Kill the microorganisms. Because these infections. Okay.

69
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,740
And. But. We'll see you in a disinfectants is strong oxidants.

70
00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:05,550
Okay. They will oxidize the bacteria of the organic components of bacteria or virus or or the microorganisms so they can really kill them,

71
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:12,330
basically to kill jobs. But we also have the organic magnets in the water.

72
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,670
But we will not remove all organic matter. So they will react to these toxins.

73
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,800
Some of the products cause this friction byproducts and could be carcinogens.

74
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,050
So of course you're right. So you would assume for some of the swimming pools.

75
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,020
Some people don't quite high concentration of the chlorine.

76
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:40,670
And you smell like there is the oil. There is some of these that swim for the various smells, brandy.

77
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,520
And that's really because the strong the the disinfectants.

78
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:54,160
Like Korey Reactive with ammonia or denim and swayed from some swimmers and didn't really smell good as far as the.

79
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,330
So you want to use disinfectant to kill the microbes and kill the peasants?

80
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,110
Yes. As good as pick of the other hand.

81
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:12,290
Your children byproducts that could be carcinogens and exposed to that could impact bad for the health.

82
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,210
So there's always a balance, right? There's always a balance.

83
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:26,080
So that's the reason we need to define what's the maximum level of the residual disaffection in your water system to set to reduce.

84
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:35,870
The disaffection purple quarterbacks significant or product good at risk.

85
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:43,730
There's a risk associated in some of these imaging contaminants with before the state pharmaceuticals the metabolites.

86
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,040
Okay that's that's one of the issues that we have. Okay.

87
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:54,170
Pharmaceutical and the, um, tablet for the pharmaceuticals, for the, for the industry.

88
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,210
They try to influence the ability of these products.

89
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:05,160
Okay. Because of that correctly issues, they want to keep it longer and they're not this temporary.

90
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:12,320
Okay. And some of these synthetic chemicals, there's no natural system to liquid them.

91
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:18,740
So basically, you fix a lot of 75, around 75% of these drugs.

92
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,680
They were just passed from your body and then released into the euro on their faces.

93
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,560
Okay. So where they end up in the world.

94
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:41,100
Okay. So you can use some of this to test what was going on, for example, before marijuana use is indigo.

95
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,500
And then but we try to understand how many people are using these products.

96
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:56,280
So what do you do? Because we always want to test this this tablet and then to figure out extent of the level of this use in the specific community.

97
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:01,650
And that's one can we can depict. We can try to depict them to be great.

98
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:06,090
But each one of the issue is really is a very easy to detect the.

99
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,480
Tell you to take. Customer care products.

100
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:17,200
We talk about in the enterprise disruptors, a lot of stuff that's associated with endocrine disruptors like hormones.

101
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:24,490
They use different byproducts of going to organic compounds, perchlorate,

102
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:33,640
that is some of the potty formulated compounds and some of these antibiotic resistant genes, the genes that are also chemical content.

103
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:39,430
So this is imaging the that we can see now before we have some of these imaging contaminants,

104
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:44,470
but we can detect them by now because of the increased development of the instrumentation that we get to take some of.

105
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:52,840
And become the concept. I was concerned some of them would have been very vague in them.

106
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,850
And yet, for example, the drug metabolites will have very negative on them.

107
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:01,540
Yet the reason for it, one of the reasons is it's very difficult to detect and to monitor.

108
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,240
So you have to have good methods to detect them, to monitor them, and then you can regulate them.

109
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:16,509
What is the reason of this in terms of the was the sources was a poor source and non-point sources, poisons.

110
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:25,629
Basically you can identify source which is custody for the limit, all for example with what you call source, but some is non-point source.

111
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:30,070
For example, the agriculture runoffs, some of the stormwater.

112
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,020
And then stormwater is another interesting topic. It could be points of importance.

113
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,450
Okay, that we can talk more about that, but just the sources where they come from, one source, non-point sources.

114
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:50,030
Now what's the issues with this that are organic matters in the in the water eutrophication.

115
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:58,420
You see the eutrophication issues almost in the summer that you see algal blooms, you see excessive growth.

116
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:07,090
That's reason we could use some of the ponds. For example, if it's not well-maintained, you'll see the overgrowth of this oak, the.

117
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:11,050
The. The plants in the water. Okay.

118
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,100
So that's the unification. You have all this neutrons. They have three cups of water.

119
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:21,760
You promote the growth, and then what happens? And then when the winter comes.

120
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:27,180
These fans died. Okay.

121
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,710
And then the war becomes. They use all this all to.

122
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,590
To digest this organic matters bacteria use this microbial uses to the water

123
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:49,330
becomes brown duck and this habitat for the commercial for the aquatic life is.

124
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:54,340
This happens all the time this kind of snowball and even I mean, the Great Lakes now we still have this issue.

125
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:02,590
Okay. So you should finish. If you could just do the model up to the Lake Superior.

126
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,080
Okay, some of this you do really have this issue. Okay.

127
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,350
But if you could have some input, would you like.

128
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:19,070
Ontario and the Lake Michigan, southern part of Lake Michigan.

129
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,440
You have this issue. Especially in the Bay Area.

130
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,020
The SEC, it'll be. They have these big issues every summer.

131
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:35,370
Surely. Aquatic life is not good and drinking water some recreational water damage this.

132
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:41,670
On this issue we have. So if you think about the water quality, what do you think?

133
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:54,170
Like interest you. Well, I don't I'm not doing research, but I think just in general, yes.

134
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:02,510
Linking the water quality of people's medications to the water treatment and then

135
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:09,560
how that determines what people's medications are on of treating those issues.

136
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:16,639
Because if it's labor intensive for the water treatment plant to treat the pharmaceutical discharge from people,

137
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:27,440
then it would be in their interest to reduce the amount concentrations in the various in the variable medications that people rely on and then have.

138
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,360
There's a public health issue in trying to get ahead of the issue rather than just cleaning up.

139
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:35,540
A backup to the of the medications.

140
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:46,850
There's always season. We need to think about life. So try to reduce the to pick from the source that we use from the source.

141
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:52,010
And that's particularly important for these medications that.

142
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,370
I mean, just another is the size of the stories.

143
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,450
We cannot really say people are going to use the kitchen, but what?

144
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:11,540
Okay. Right. I mean, they you they needed me for your life to improve the quality of life.

145
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,700
So. So that's. That's one thing they make.

146
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:23,000
The the simple way to put it is that people over there, your general is getting.

147
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,440
Right. But checks. All these checks. But.

148
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:34,340
But you can. But that's really the slogan for the run by to motivate people to stop doing this.

149
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:40,220
You can reduce it, but you cannot. That's that's part of the cycle right now.

150
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,020
So the pharmaceutical all these medications you're screening, but you can't really.

151
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:53,630
But we have some of the issue of water now. You ask people to reduce the use of medication, have a very difficult task.

152
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,900
Right. Was for in cases for like metformin which is specifically for type two diabetes,

153
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,290
like it might be better for them than just eat right and exercise and not take medications.

154
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah. Yeah.

155
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:13,910
I mean, like an example like that where it's like clearly something that can be done on the front end, that other medications, that's for sure.

156
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,210
Consequences of like the use of lifestyle to improve the health of the kids.

157
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,770
Yeah that's surely that the good pretty for that.

158
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:33,650
Okay. But the real things you can think about now with this kind of like for example, the medications.

159
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:41,720
Think about what can we do to remove them before deciding to that we seem to want to work with them.

160
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:52,700
Can we do something to do with what? Can we. And surely some other programs like to recycle.

161
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,900
Can we collect the how can we could all use drugs least of all good ways to reduce with the discharge?

162
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,670
But the other thing is really, can we do something to really to to, to,

163
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:09,500
to remove them from the waste water and then people getting to the surface of all.

164
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,760
Okay. Good point. Okay.

165
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:20,010
Good point. To reduce the pollution from the source is most effective with.

166
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:28,240
Okay. Reduce it. Social reduction is the most effective way to prevent the contamination.

167
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:38,010
The war recorded is also so many of we mentioned so many different types of contaminants.

168
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:43,260
So a lot of times we use the indicators to indicate water quality.

169
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:51,820
Okay. Specify what chemicals, but you also have these indicators the body will cook over the body is a biological

170
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,410
sentiment is talk about what's come creation of organic matters in the water.

171
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:03,820
The C.O.D is the Sims. Sims all talk about of getting a man who was a homosexual or getting matters in the war.

172
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,510
So the high of getting married in the water and then you promote the girls and these little good, you suffocated them.

173
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:18,880
And then nutrients is also a digestive phosphorous as another indicator is also could cause eutrophication of the water.

174
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:31,710
Okay. This again matters. And then we have this call for a potential suspension of solace as clarity to beauty.

175
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,520
Also the clarity we're talking about, a clean water, safe and clean water.

176
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:45,060
But if you see the height to be of the water, the broader open the faucet, you see the water like a milky surely as my good, I not have the cool one.

177
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:51,299
So the clarity, a lot of the comedy generated by spinning solids all to beauty and also the growth

178
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:56,280
of the microorganisms in the water can also increase the beauty in the water.

179
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:02,040
So that's really that you don't really want to see the dissolved oxygen as another very

180
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:08,370
important factor is what's the composition of oxygen to what we need that because aquatic life,

181
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,910
the health of the water body is the opposite of what and with.

182
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:18,350
Surely that is like a connectivity, just animals, some pesticides.

183
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:22,249
Either the same or very important. Chemical.

184
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,550
Physical. Physical parameters of the water temperature.

185
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:30,920
You can actually talk about the beauty and this can be very small, some of which can be done very easily.

186
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:38,230
For example, temperature, connectivity. The big dissolve of zoom that can open is just one quality bit.

187
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:45,089
Okay. They can monitor effect in real time. A lot of this time is in real time.

188
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:50,640
You can do it. Some of these parameters can be used to improve the operation.

189
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:58,140
For example, we have water in place. We want to make sure that operation as normal and these are functional.

190
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:04,890
So you try to monitor these tankers to make sure as the process is working, for example,

191
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,720
something you see the increase of the beauty in the watchman plant in some locations.

192
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:13,560
Means is some some process is not working.

193
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:20,910
But the division would be 0.05, 0.5, and you have the gap between.

194
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,630
Okay. But if some of you see the increase of the beauty in the water, that means systems fail.

195
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:37,110
Okay. She can feel. How do we use test the methods.

196
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:44,430
Okay. Most of the time we have to use the standard measures again by the EPA for the Clean Water Access to Clean Water Act.

197
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:49,020
If you use the methods, you have to use the methods approved by the EPA.

198
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,480
Okay. So they can report the data to the EPA. They will accept your data.

199
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:08,550
And the standard protocol think we will always use the SRP, the standard operational protocol that defines how we collect the samples,

200
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,060
how to process the samples, how the analysis, how do the test?

201
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:25,110
How do you report? What's a unit? So all of these have been defined in the standard measure of the extent of operation per protocol.

202
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,660
So what do you need to do if we are asked to use a method?

203
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,040
You have to go through the approval method.

204
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:40,830
We're going to go through with an event instead of a soap opera protocol.

205
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:50,490
And that always defined how to use it. So now they can compare the data from a particular bag from different patients.

206
00:21:51,300 --> 00:22:02,790
For example, last week the Washtenaw County Health Department at one point picked the water or something like what, the contaminants in the water.

207
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:11,630
And then the first thing that you do when you have a patient and we're using them officially and

208
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:18,300
how different how do you take this and how much time all this will be detailed in the protocol?

209
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,320
The EPA, for example, has given us.

210
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:34,660
All of them as they happen are every state and county health departments are required to do the same so that the federal government outlines,

211
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:39,910
like on the EPA, most of the time they have the same similar, similar S&P.

212
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,270
So sometimes there's a controversy, some debate.

213
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,400
What's the best of methods? Right.

214
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:56,020
So, for example, when the food and water crisis occur, unfortunately, and then there's this debate about how do you clean water?

215
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,910
Water samples during the water samples.

216
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:06,250
By the way, when you move from Cambodia in the morning until the morning, that often afforded people what they wanted.

217
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,799
First of all, you did the system run for 2 minutes or so?

218
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:19,500
You're thinking and thinking about something. And that usually you have to let it run for a year.

219
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,280
Most of the cases we used to, they didn't run for several time.

220
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:34,230
Right. And then people argue. Yeah. That's that's your taste of water that's already from the in the system in somewhere in the parking system.

221
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:38,190
Excuse me, but you should really keep the filthy the water that the water.

222
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:48,410
All only seats organize and then you how all this result of leaking from the system is not what it should be.

223
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:52,290
Is that right? So, so.

224
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:55,710
And you have to get out of to see what was tested.

225
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:05,150
So that's also one of the controversy. For example, if you don't have the country with you, then the test itself is also high, people say.

226
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:14,950
And then of the people who are trying to evaluate the data analysis is all this is from the first one.

227
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:21,780
It's not representative of what's going on, what system, but if you think about health aspects,

228
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:31,680
I suppose that's the countries that we to we get up early in the morning, we take the water and the food and we use, you know, the system wrong.

229
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,530
I mean, is that you pick it up very few people probably living in one of many places in the water.

230
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:44,750
Right. So. So that's the way you can develop the standard method.

231
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:52,010
So the EPA for contaminants, especially regular contaminants, they have a standard protocol for that.

232
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,040
And you can put the EPA website for that. Okay. To to ask for the other products.

233
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:07,830
We also try to monitor the water quality in the United States like still whites nationwide.

234
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,409
All these vary most of the time.

235
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:21,390
And we test the, the, the, the common water quality indicators with different areas to test the water quality and to look at the trends.

236
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:26,849
So this ongoing now, in fact, United States also like USGS.

237
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,870
Yes, they try to monitor water quality in the environment.

238
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:43,350
How come the whole map wasn't filled, which is not like the sum of areas, for example, me required by the EPA that you have to test your water system.

239
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:52,100
Every year we just give it to the EPA to see which one place is contaminated by this is integrated.

240
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:57,450
Okay. But the the the is a reality.

241
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,570
In reality, it's not really the case.

242
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:09,450
But not every time people report the data to EPA, for example, we have a small report somewhere and there's no people ready to go there at the moment.

243
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:16,390
Or what about like in Midland, Texas, where it is Austin and Dallas, like not covered at all.

244
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:22,739
It's and then this is like a visual wipes the effort to monitor the water quality

245
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,190
so they select for the average it's not like they kind of everyone system.

246
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:33,840
Okay. Okay. Didn't really come online every month in every subject one.

247
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:39,090
It's just it's the amount of the war, if you think about the war, is tremendous.

248
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:55,410
We can look. Okay. So I mean, you're you're probably aware of this already, but the sample collection is very key.

249
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:00,600
Okay. Very key. So you need to think about what kind of samples you collect.

250
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:05,970
Soak the water with water for the testing, what kind of tests?

251
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:16,260
What kind of the chemicals you want to test. So you need to develop what was created and then take custody of it.

252
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,950
You need to record all the detailed information where you credit sample,

253
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:24,540
how they collect the samples, what time the samples was, the other weather conditions, all these.

254
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:34,790
Okay. So every time you receive this, you have to have this child custody to to associate with with your sample.

255
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:41,540
When I received some of them, my lab received sample from the health department as it gave me the take custody of what you have.

256
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:48,530
So I'm somebody who's to do the test for to use whatever methods you use.

257
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:57,590
I use composites. I'll use scratch samples. So all these are very tedious process, but you need to.

258
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:04,880
Yes. Patient to that. Some of samples with the volume of the sample always had to out and then storage preservation.

259
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:09,710
So most of the camera sample came over to us on site in real time.

260
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:21,190
So we have to transport to the lab for this. The the some of the boys as well is something that you have to sample processed within 24 hours of your.

261
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:36,800
And when you transport assembly lines. Okay so that's the kind of generous and you can but sorry I just the and there's a mistress of this size,

262
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:42,410
this associate with a previous map just to the national evaluation program to move one point.

263
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,940
Requirements again, should be clear.

264
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:55,660
I mean, this is general information should be clear without the need for the law to for and the period of time to show the fresh water from the wells,

265
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,500
for example, although that's the general requirement for specific content,

266
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,880
not a lead contamination, for example, people really want to take first for the water.

267
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:13,570
If you run the system for 30 seconds, then you receive the water from the somewhere in the system that does not represent what you consume.

268
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,340
Okay. And again, she'll be announced within 24 hours.

269
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:26,730
So a lot of times you can see you can go with the 140 meters through the air,

270
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:31,940
collect some of the information temporarily dissolve out into be connectivity.

271
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:39,749
They can be collected right away. And all of this you need to you can test some of them in real time on the site for some different methods.

272
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:45,420
You can do it. But a lot of times you have to take the water and then bring them to the lab.

273
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:53,440
I mean, it's kind of fun job to go into the field, to carry the water through the atmosphere and use them.

274
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:56,510
And there was a time when I start just talking.

275
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:04,830
I have a project together with EPA and with tilapia, the tilapia microbe crab writer.

276
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:15,120
We went after the Circular Bay to collect the water samples and they have the, the, the, the, the Great Lakes like the ocean.

277
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,240
Right. So the EPA has their own boat.

278
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:23,590
Okay. EPA has their own boat, so went out to Craig.

279
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,940
What about the sample size like separate mile away from each other?

280
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:36,640
So we have to use the boat to do that. And then the operator has a there's a young guy who operated that boat.

281
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,180
When we come back, he's like super fast and the bumping all the time on the river.

282
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:49,090
I was like, Oh, he's vocalist from the. But that's just a form part of the company.

283
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:56,620
Sometimes you have to think about people going to the ocean to carry samples surrounding the group and includes a sample from there.

284
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:01,570
And it could take months. And that's kind of fun.

285
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:02,470
It's really fun.

286
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:13,000
And even sometimes some people from here, from like from the pharmaceutical departments or then some they go across the ocean kind of sediment.

287
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:23,410
So they will be able to use the grant money to go through the Caribbean Sea and then dove there and they can leave the sample and present back.

288
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:30,430
It's pretty a fun part of the we do the fear walk effect because that's the testing the lab but in fact

289
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:36,570
you feel that you that and my laboratory flying do quite a lot of fieldwork so we could collect samples.

290
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:43,180
It's not all painted okay but just Tuskegee sample my people now everyday before they go to the the

291
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:51,730
manholes on the streets to kick the the sewage we we do it like once a wise that's okay but now it

292
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:58,479
every day that's not okay so but you have to do it I mean then I mean some some see how we have to do

293
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,240
it against some of these chemicals you can use a or the marker parameter medium for that purpose.

294
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:11,770
The other most important, one of the most important contaminants in the water we need to test is getting matters.

295
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:18,380
Okay, again, it matters to test like how can we test what's considered organic matter?

296
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:25,420
Two different three different parameters, both about how chemical demand, chemicals in demand and then the organic carbon.

297
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:33,010
So we're basically we can use to do this the test measure the altered depletion potential of the biodegradable fracture of the water.

298
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:37,990
And I want you to be. Super clear.

299
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:49,580
Although we called Veolia biological out in demand, this is indication of organic matters in the water with a concentration of organic matter more.

300
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:57,570
Okay. Beauty could level with that, not dissolve opposite.

301
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,420
Okay. That's not all of an. So what's the news?

302
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:06,080
That's how we knew this was a development method.

303
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,200
That's the traditional method we use to see how quick.

304
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,570
How would the level of the.

305
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:20,400
Dissolve all you be used by the pessimism.

306
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:30,210
So it's kind of confusing. But the result of these was a continuation of the of the dissolving the one of the developed object.

307
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:36,990
Biological demand is how much dissolved you can use in the what removing the water.

308
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,180
So that's indicated organic methods in the water. A considerable amount of you.

309
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:50,610
I want to make it so clear now remember is the beauty field is concentration of organic organic matter in the water.

310
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:57,810
Okay, that dissolve auxin is auxin competition is auxin concentration in the water.

311
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:07,500
So we have a different type of covers in the water. You won't get any organic dissolve through all of this.

312
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:18,090
And this is how we would test the test, make it a beauty, basically a smoke probe, a portion of the organic matter in the water.

313
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:24,420
And then the CO2 effects is as that covers most of these parts.

314
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,940
So let's seaweed because we use much stronger organic matters of.

315
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,520
In the water. So this is how we do the beauty oxygen.

316
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:44,750
Why would why why? The confusing is that first you did to me when you start experiments with computational dissolve algae in the water.

317
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:49,620
Okay. And then after you run experiments, you test again.

318
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:56,469
What comes out of your heart? That difference to you?

319
00:34:56,470 --> 00:35:00,040
That difference? The calculation was the bulk of the money, the war.

320
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:11,250
With the consumer organic matter in the world. So more organic matters need more oxygen to oxidize.

321
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:19,150
It's how we do it. How is it tested and the chemical use a much stronger oxidants.

322
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:23,380
So it's better much stronger of them than the the organisms.

323
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:29,350
And then that's that you'll be able to organize more organic matter in the water.

324
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:34,650
So basically the CO2 would be higher than the beauty, beauty, beauty.

325
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:39,590
Just a portion of the sea. Biodegradable.

326
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:46,730
And these fields, you can do a lot of much amount of the organic matter.

327
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:52,490
So why are we still important? Because the beauty is the biodegradable.

328
00:35:52,500 --> 00:36:00,890
That's how much we use in the water, especially for the wastewater treatment process that we'll talk about even more.

329
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:09,660
Okay. The others are the nutrients. I will not go into all this detail about the nutrients, how to test the nutrients.

330
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:16,770
You can have even better. You can use the nutrients to talk about it and the lighter nitrates,

331
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:21,750
all important for the health, only for organic, but also for the health and then the phosphorus.

332
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:33,290
Surely different type of different forms of the first you test and most of the time we use iron from the core of us for this kind of metric methods,

333
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:41,580
for the for the organic methods for this the nutrients the nutrient is important because the usually important because.

334
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:46,150
The cap promoted the gross efficacy of this one.

335
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:52,840
Okay. Let's take a quick break and then we'll talk about some of the metals.

336
00:36:59,050 --> 00:39:06,920
But. I think it's.

337
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:32,280
But. A real.

338
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:09,220
So think about all this. The organic matters, the organic chemical contaminants in the metals.

339
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:12,790
If you think about metals in the water, so test them.

340
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:17,900
And there's no one methods that work for this metric.

341
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,290
So for each specific. Contaminants.

342
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:27,180
You need to develop a method for this way. So think about the process.

343
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:31,020
You create the wastewater in this test. Use the waste water as example.

344
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:38,010
Sewage creeps through some of the land, so the main ones that dissolve or attach to a different part of the water metrics.

345
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,730
And then you need to have this different method to check the purify them.

346
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,280
Separate them from the others and then do the testing and then different came for different

347
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,290
level have different property and then we have to use different methods for that process.

348
00:41:55,730 --> 00:42:03,290
Okay. So that's reason for the special metals. I mean, you have different metal has to be used for this.

349
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:11,930
Metal detection in the in general is the same but in the water the further you need to extract the purifies separated from the others.

350
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:25,070
And this the the the analysis. Okay so so metals you have different methods for that for that purpose you organize and use

351
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:32,930
iron chromatograph that's I see has been used pretty common in that in the in the water

352
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:40,169
analysis in fact we used to have one of the system not use our ability but then the one

353
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:46,700
really use that's some professor retire and no one really maintain that then that cannot be.

354
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:53,910
And now I'm not a biochemist, so I'm in microbiology that we do any, any biological analysis that would be able to do it.

355
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:58,710
But with chemicals, I just don't have the expertize to operate that.

356
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:05,140
Okay, so I have to meet him. But this is a very, very useful instrument for that purpose.

357
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:13,120
But we don't miss the the. A lot of times you have to space to labs who can do it for you.

358
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:17,110
Okay. Can do it for you. But sometimes you just chemicals.

359
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,240
You have to develop your own measures for that.

360
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:29,720
And for the research both I think I mean, my my students now I search on campus everywhere trying to find find the sites,

361
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:36,260
find the labs that can help us to do that analysis on the drug metabolites.

362
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:48,870
Well, you've seen the in the in the tragedy present for example in the west one and emphysema that mental health of students on campus.

363
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:57,960
We try to see whether we can be able to figure out the extent of these issues that we need to deal with on campus.

364
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,460
Okay. That's that's just one one example of what we're talking about.

365
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:13,620
But it's very difficult to do. The organic compounds, the gas chromatograph, mass spectrometry analysis, and then radioactivity.

366
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:17,730
There's different ways to talk about the to test the radioactivity in the water.

367
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:22,440
This or you first take them, separate them and then do that analysis.

368
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:29,670
Okay. So any message, any message you think about you first we'll take the water and then purify them,

369
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:33,630
separate them, and then to the analysis, they understand what's chemicals you.

370
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,170
Many, many times. What issues we run into is the the metrics.

371
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:47,500
Okay. For example, the wastewater. Think about it with all these measures there.

372
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:58,250
And that interfered this analysis. And then you really need to find good ways to provide discipline and.

373
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:06,050
And the other thing is really need to have a standard grade of a standard.

374
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:13,070
A lot of cases. What do we need to do? In fact, try to think about to find the real concentration.

375
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:20,060
Because when you do the extraction preparation, you can recover only a portion of it's contaminating the water.

376
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:24,650
Okay. If you take the 50% outfit, that would be great to.

377
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:39,030
Okay. So the recovery rate wouldn't in many cases, what we do will spike with one with the standards and then look at how much we can recover.

378
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:43,650
And it was contribute to the COVID wave of the COVID rate.

379
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:50,899
That recovery rate that you can calculate to see with a recommendation is that

380
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,970
either one can give you a better information about what's the competition.

381
00:45:54,980 --> 00:46:05,870
What? We are think about now I just show you this the the the video of the super clean water.

382
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:16,100
Right. They may have chemicals in it, but now instead of going to instead of going to test each individual chemical, we don't know.

383
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:23,280
So but but what we can do is see how secure this word is.

384
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:31,000
In general custom. How how toxic the the the the water is.

385
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,490
So think about the fish. Right.

386
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:40,240
If you think about the fish out of water, if we give you the different type of water, it's a similar water, it looks like.

387
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:49,480
If you have very heavy chemical contaminants to see the fish, you would try to escape from that.

388
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:57,550
Right. The fish will escape from their. Because it's toxic to us.

389
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:00,820
So talk to them. Okay. So.

390
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:13,810
So you have the general ways to measure the water quality, to look at how fish survive leaves in the water as kind of the biological methods of water.

391
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:20,680
So a lot of times, in fact, if you try to understand what's going on in that water, what your zebrafish have used.

392
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,620
They're also as a model organism to test, to monitor water quality.

393
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:35,550
So basically you grow the fish to grow the zebrafish and then feed the water to that zebrafish and then to see how they behave.

394
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:44,190
They'll behave more in their cellular response.

395
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:49,640
The development, in fact, especially when you look at the development impacts.

396
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,610
Of the perfect use of water as general ways to look at the water quality.

397
00:47:56,060 --> 00:48:07,610
The other ways you can use also the bacteria strains because the retention of the test basically puts you in the water with the bacteria.

398
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:13,600
And then look at the genome. With that happened is that if the wall is toxic.

399
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:22,479
It could induce highly induce the mutation. So the biscuit you introduce to the British you.

400
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,660
Would you. And then that can be tested.

401
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:29,140
And that was a pathological example of what we can help people do because.

402
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,510
Many cases because of mutation.

403
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:45,450
We have some of these random mutation, some induced by the exposure, by some by e.g. that's another petition we have with you on this.

404
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:51,690
And then you leave the feathered youth out of control to be expressed in the cancer.

405
00:48:52,140 --> 00:49:00,360
So basically you can kiss that to see how the water really induce the mutation.

406
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,270
In the know we cannot put ourself in the what to look out.

407
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:09,110
You know, that takes too long time and it is very difficult to do it.

408
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:15,960
So what do we do with you? You think you have helped me out?

409
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:22,100
You can kiss their doom. How they do in 55 feet of water before.

410
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,450
So that can give you overall toxicity of the water.

411
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:33,430
It give you what? A chemical contaminant in the water. But as this kill you.

412
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:39,560
What's the toxicity of that water in general? Okay.

413
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:48,140
In general. So what do you find where you will find the Justice Department for indicative of the water even in the of a world body?

414
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:55,290
Because the river if the river you don't really see the diversity of these organisms, you see all the law in of overwhelming the water.

415
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:58,550
I mean, that water is really bad. Okay.

416
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,260
If we find fish. If we find spuds, it out of your body.

417
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:09,310
And also, what is quit. Okay.

418
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,990
And you can do this that cure for that as well. That is.

419
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:17,200
That killed to test the overall toxicity of the water.

420
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:21,840
Okay, fine. Another thing we can use, we call the biosensors.

421
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:27,330
Bosses. Again,

422
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:34,470
the sparseness is can you kind of make real time to see what's going on and what the response to that to the to the water

423
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:43,760
so was a basic principle for that is we know the micro use spectrum that uses that for example when using the water they.

424
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:50,790
This is all the time with concentrations of chemicals significantly more.

425
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:02,960
Who would try these cables. But I mean, think about the surface to one ratio for the bacteria, tiny bacteria, their surface.

426
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:08,240
Is much to what? Immigration is much bigger than us.

427
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,229
We were jumping to the order. We don't really sense what's going what's.

428
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:21,860
He one really said on this you know this this criticism of wanting to know for example this is your the full body who says what's going you what?

429
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:26,290
And they're responding. Okay. Respond to that.

430
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:36,380
So with the spouses, the director, is that the bacteria surface, they have a sense, he says, what's going on?

431
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:43,360
What's the chemical in the water? And then they respond. So what we do is use the biosensors we use,

432
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:51,640
such as the three fluids in the property that they can activate the pressure if they have the chemicals there.

433
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:55,360
And in the sense that they activated the expression, that's visceral response.

434
00:51:55,840 --> 00:52:02,480
And we use a three force and protein. And so you see the high concentration of Gleason three, four and 24.

435
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:08,170
Then we see the the chemical as there. And they see that they grew.

436
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:14,910
Okay. So that's the principle for the for the policies.

437
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:20,340
I don't know how many how many of you have the bhaduri, the biochemistry, molecular biology.

438
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:29,440
So. Okay. So. It's a it's a.

439
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:38,680
Yeah. You know, sales, I have you know, we have all of these deals and then, you know, surface.

440
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:45,780
We have the sense since. How the sales were going off really simply.

441
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:50,630
Okay. We. Well, the sense is that. Can we smell?

442
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:57,979
Oui, oui, oui, oui. Taste it because we have a safety system with two is in the lowest light.

443
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:05,660
And since then, as I said before, the bacteria also have a sense of what that says, what's going on with them, and then they respond.

444
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:10,540
So that's the response is basically by changing the genes.

445
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:16,290
So if you. Says this, they will respond to try to get rid of them.

446
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:24,930
But the response, of course, is what do we do now? We put these three friends in touch and Jean says that he was even close.

447
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,730
So we have some sympathy with that choice.

448
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:35,750
Is it now the activists exclusive that Jean and then they also activated expression of the four of them as an indicator,

449
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:39,390
the report of their grief and sympathy that would be able to see that.

450
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:48,030
And so when you present, yes, the activist, now you see the goal, the present body, the high commission.

451
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:53,480
You probably see a high concentration of the intensity of this night in Mexico City.

452
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:54,240
Okay.

453
00:53:54,540 --> 00:54:04,170
So this is really what are we are doing here with about two spouses, which I use the the volume, the sense of what's going on in the in the event.

454
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,420
So either water. So what we do,

455
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:16,380
we generate the census and you can specifically pick the chemicals metals because we save most of time we can identify in fact

456
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:25,080
in the in the American biology is it's fascinating is that we can identify all these genes they can sense these chemicals.

457
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:29,940
Okay. Because now we have 400 different types of protein for this.

458
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:38,520
So and then we get develop that we can give up the sense of protein profiles that we incubated the water with that if we see the color change,

459
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:43,340
oh you see that the appendix and that's also been using the space station.

460
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:50,240
But in the Swiss there's a it's very difficult to take a sample and they come back bring them back to do that as year to date.

461
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:54,480
Right. So what we do, we draw these thousands of.

462
00:54:55,750 --> 00:55:02,920
And then we bring them to the station. So if you see the the the changes the color of the group.

463
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:08,080
I mean, all in all, you have the content less physical content in the space station.

464
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:15,270
That makes sense. The disadvantage for that is when we talk about.

465
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:20,100
15 men a Grammy. The police are in the water.

466
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:25,010
The boss says he's not sensitive. Okay.

467
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:36,750
It's not a sexy love message to we love to take that into consideration, but it can give you the red hot information very quickly like that.

468
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:46,010
Our sometimes our response. Okay. So so that's a very decent one just for that that this can be overall education is very useful.

469
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:50,640
But in terms of the extent of the masses, we haven't even understand that.

470
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:56,670
I mean, this cannot use our standard methods because, for example, if I think about the people's activity level.

471
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:06,000
This camel will not be able to compete with all of this will not be able to compete.

472
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:13,010
So so have the very low sensitivity for the spouses.

473
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:17,339
But this can be very useful to give you overall quality of the water.

474
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:23,870
For example, with fish, a fish has to use also, as it says, to look for flow one quality.

475
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:29,150
Questions. Which is.

476
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:39,710
Okay. So remember what you if you are working for the any agencies developer methods you need to send out a message.

477
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:46,450
Okay, to do so before that. But Tokyo talking about bastions fish.

478
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:49,930
That's mostly for the research purpose and sometimes I'm monitoring.

479
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:53,090
Just see what's going on. Okay.

480
00:56:53,360 --> 00:57:03,220
And the uses for the fish zebrafish has been used to see how really bad the water is, how toxic the water is packed with development.

481
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:10,040
Without understanding, it would be able to help us to see what this chemical is really that we have to work on.

482
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:18,150
Great. Thanks. We'll see you.
