00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:09,940
In this next section, we will answer the question, what types of evaluation projects might I see?

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:16,490
I will describe three different types of evaluation and when they are used.

3
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:23,290
There are many types of evaluation projects. I will give you a brief overview of three common types,

4
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:33,600
in this section by sharing others you can explore. The first common type is a needs and asset assessment.

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,870
These types of projects are typically conducted before a program is designed or implemented.

6
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,960
You are more likely to hear the term needs assessment,

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:51,300
but philosophically speaking the use of the word assets prompts evaluators to also consider the strengths of a community

8
00:00:51,300 --> 00:01:02,220
and not only its deficits or challenges. These activities are meant to assess feasibility for establishing or continuing a program.

9
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:11,370
One common goal of a needs and asset assessment is to identify which strengths and challenges are present in the defined community,

10
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:18,990
whether geographically or socially defined. Take a second to think through some of your past experiences.

11
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:26,790
Have you worked for a program where you were told or researched the rate of a disease or behavior before the program started?

12
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:34,270
That information likely came from a needs and assets assessment.

13
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,980
The second common type of evaluation is a process evaluation.

14
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:44,260
These evaluations are conducted during and after the program's implementation.

15
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,580
They are conducted to better understand how a program was delivered.

16
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:53,740
How long did it take? The staff have the resources they needed to deliver it.

17
00:01:53,740 --> 00:02:01,300
What conditions helped facilitate implementation? How did participants or clients feel about the program?

18
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:08,920
Have you worked with a program where participants were asked whether they were satisfied with how they were treated by staff?

19
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:15,220
That is an example of information from a process evaluation.

20
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:21,430
Finally, a third common type of evaluation is an outcome evaluation.

21
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:28,630
These evaluations are conducted to better understand the extent to which a program's objectives were achieved.

22
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:37,900
They are conducted during and after program implementation. Have you ever worked with a program where staff wanted to know if they met the mark?

23
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:50,120
This question is likely rooted in an outcome evaluation. Again, the three types of evaluation I just presented are only three,

24
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:57,590
and there are many different other types of evaluations one can conduct, and they aren't mutually exclusive.

25
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:04,250
For example in my practice I specialize in culturally responsive and equitable evaluations,

26
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:09,140
but will always combine that with process and or outcome evaluation.

27
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:19,160
What they have in common is that they are meant to understand, again the merit, worth, and significance of their value and like a program.

28
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:27,890
To summarize, three common types of evaluation are needs and asset assessment, process, and outcome evaluation.

29
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:35,850
These types can be combined with other types of evaluation.

30
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,840
That's the end of this.
