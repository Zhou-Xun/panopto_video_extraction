1
00:00:06,386 --> 00:00:10,837
So, I'd like you to imagine that you're
designing an educational brochure for

2
00:00:10,837 --> 00:00:13,570
community residents.

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,640
Let's say about some kind
of environmental exposure.

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,350
So first question, who?

5
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,950
Who are we reaching?

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:26,340
Now, this might be community residents,
but which ones in particular?

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,070
Is this a very small neighborhood or
anybody who lives in the city?

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,420
Is it ones who happen to have, let's say,

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,440
small kids or
ones who have particular professions?

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,770
What defines the community for
this communication?

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,730
And second point to think about is,
you may be focusing in on those community

12
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,850
residents who are gonna read this
brochure, who you want to educate about

13
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:57,160
this issue, but you also need to
think about all the stakeholders.

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,462
Who else is going to read or
hear your messages,

15
00:01:00,462 --> 00:01:03,531
even if they're not your target audience?

16
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:06,280
Is this gonna be seen by journalists?

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:14,020
Is this gonna be seen by the governmental
agencies related to this particular topic?

18
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,470
Is this going to be use by doctors

19
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,170
to guide the way in which they
talk to people in this community?

20
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,330
Thinking about all of those other
stakeholders is really important.

21
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,251
You can't just focus on
your target audience.

22
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:31,878
You have to think about everybody who's
gonna potentially read this brochure and

23
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:35,058
think about,
does it represent the content or

24
00:01:35,058 --> 00:01:39,424
your organization well for
all of these different audiences?

25
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:43,372
Second point, what's the context?

26
00:01:43,372 --> 00:01:47,892
So when and where and how are people
going to interact with this brochure?

27
00:01:47,892 --> 00:01:50,410
Now, it could be at home.

28
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:54,682
Let's say the brochure gets mailed out to
everybody who lives in this community.

29
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:58,190
But maybe it's been passed out
at a community meeting, and

30
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,830
they would interact with
it differently as a result.

31
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,740
Maybe it's in a professional setting.

32
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,820
Maybe this is being handed out to

33
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,450
health professionals who will
then be passing it out to others.

34
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,200
Either way, you need to think about

35
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,500
when's the moment that somebody's
gonna first interact with this.

36
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,790
Why are they gonna care?

37
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,410
Now, it depends.

38
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,710
They might already care about this.

39
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,939
In which case, this could be
kind of a poll communication.

40
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:32,130
You're just answering a whole bunch of
questions that you know that the community

41
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,750
residents are likely
to be concerned about.

42
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,998
But even there, we need to stop and think.

43
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:42,090
Is this gonna be information
they're gonna be accepting because

44
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,070
It's meeting their informational needs and
they're just desperate for it?

45
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,990
Or is this gonna tell them
something they don't want?

46
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,987
Is this gonna tell them that they need
to change their behavior, for example?

47
00:02:52,987 --> 00:02:56,710
And that might make them resistant.

48
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,200
It also might be the case that they
don't know anything about this.

49
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,740
That this is the first time that they've
ever thought about whatever this issue is.

50
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,110
If that's the case,
it's a push communication, and

51
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:11,300
we need to be careful to design it with
that in mind, to perhaps emphasize

52
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:17,140
why they should care, even more than
perhaps some of the other content.

53
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,144
The details about that,
whatever the contamination is,

54
00:03:21,144 --> 00:03:24,258
or the issue is that
they need to learn about.

55
00:03:24,258 --> 00:03:25,930
What's my goal?

56
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,340
What I might trying to
achieve with this brochure?

57
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,643
It could be just awareness of the issue.

58
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:36,898
I want you to be aware that there
is this issue in your community.

59
00:03:36,898 --> 00:03:42,850
But it could be that we need to
communicate some very specific knowledge.

60
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:49,380
You need to be aware that
a particular behavior is risky.

61
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,950
Or it could be a motivation
to do a particular action.

62
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:58,270
I might want to give you this brochure,
so that, let's say,

63
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:02,900
you change your gardening practices or

64
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:09,780
what you allow your kids to do
to limit the amount of exposure.

65
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,567
If that's the case,
it's a motivational point.

66
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:15,060
You need to be really concrete about that.

67
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,470
Regardless though, and
this is hard, you gotta pick one.

68
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,850
You can only do one thing at a time.

69
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,890
So you gotta choose which goal is primary.

70
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:30,190
What's the most important thing people
want to get from that brochure?

71
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,133
And then, think about barriers.

72
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:38,290
Some of the same things that have come
up earlier are gonna be true here.

73
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,080
Are residents gonna have attention for
this?

74
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,020
What's gonna make them wanna look at it?

75
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,960
Are there language issues?

76
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,090
Are there prior knowledge issues?

77
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,350
And here's an interesting
one we haven't talked about.

78
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,010
What's the past communications
about this issue?

79
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,890
Is there a history?

80
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,490
That let's say there's been lots
of communications in the news or

81
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,260
from other agencies about this issue.

82
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,630
And this brochure is coming
after all of that history.

83
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:08,208
Or is this the first thing that they're
gonna be exposed to on this topic?
