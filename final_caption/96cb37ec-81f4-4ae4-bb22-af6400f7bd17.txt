1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:12,510
Start the recording. Um, reminder, it's recording so the audience can hear everybody underneath it all.

2
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:23,500
All right, come on up, Amanda. I mean, she's gone.

3
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:37,370
It's up to you. Yeah. You're not going to be on to dance? I think so.

4
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,100
I think it's going to. All right.

5
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:50,100
I am happy to introduce you to Dr. Hagedorn, who's going to be presenting her work on hepatitis B infection today.

6
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,360
So if I could have everybody bring their attention to the front.

7
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:01,380
That would be wonderful. And I know that I'm painfully afraid of public speaking.

8
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,530
So let's preface with that. I'm doing great. So this is if I start shaking, just ignore.

9
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,250
Hepatitis B infection is causally associated with extrahepatic cancers, a Mendelian randomization study.

10
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:27,020
So for the introduction, evidence suggests that chronic hepatitis B HPV infection is associated with extrahepatic cancers.

11
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:34,760
These include cancers of the pancreas, lung, colorectal, kidney, cervix, gastric anhydride.

12
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:43,220
Clear evidence of this association is largely from observational studies, and so it's susceptible to confounding.

13
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:51,590
So to investigate the causal association between chronic HPV and extrahepatic cancers, we used Mendelian randomization.

14
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,690
MRI uses genetic variants strongly associated with the exposure.

15
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:05,350
So this allows for reduction in confounding and it makes it not prone to reverse causation.

16
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:13,870
MRI analysis allows for the investigation of causal associations between chronic HPV infection and extrahepatic cancers.

17
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,909
Okay. So for our methods for the exposure data,

18
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:28,960
genetic variants were selected from a genome wide association study of individuals of East Asian descent in Korea.

19
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:37,120
That becomes important because they standardize this for the population structure,

20
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,090
because the exposure data came from Korea and the outcome data came from Japan.

21
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:52,480
So they selected for independent genetic variants and they weren't associated with any of the site specific cancers.

22
00:02:54,370 --> 00:03:05,140
It was defined as seropositivity of hepatitis B surface antigen for more than six months, and they identified 1371 cases in 2938 controls.

23
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,540
So how come data was quite different between Japan?

24
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,379
And again, this was standardized because of the differences in the population structure.

25
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,810
It was also age standardized in sex database.

26
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:31,160
And these are the different cancers that they investigated the causal association between chronic infection and.

27
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:41,280
Okay. There's going to be a summary on this, but I'm going to throw some numbers at you first.

28
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,739
So we used a single multivariate statistical analysis to investigate the causal relationship

29
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:53,129
between chronic HPV infection and extrahepatic cancers in individuals of East Asian ancestry.

30
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,709
In Japan, the first was single variant and we use the inverse variance weighted method odds ratios

31
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:02,610
with the corresponding confidence intervals and P values can be found on the right.

32
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:13,980
It's really well documented already, but hepatocellular carcinoma was of course causally associated with chronic HPV infection.

33
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:22,020
We additionally found that there was a causal association with gastric and lung cancer of individuals of East Asian ancestry in Japan.

34
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:31,140
The remaining cancers that were investigated weren't statistically significant, but the high odds ratios indicate that there might be risk factors.

35
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:42,240
There may just not be a causal link. Interestingly, ovarian cancer was inversely associated with chronic HPV infection.

36
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:53,030
So this is the results of the multivariate analysis they used.

37
00:04:53,660 --> 00:05:02,300
Cigaret smoking and HCV infection and chronic HCV infection as their covariates and the results in this one are a little bit different.

38
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:14,000
Sorry. I just lost my. Okay.

39
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,860
So in this one, we can see that there's a difference between the cancer of the cervix.

40
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:27,830
This is likely due to confounding in the single variant model, probably from the cigaret smoking and the HPV.

41
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:34,790
Additionally, lung cancer is no longer significant. The association between that and HPV infection.

42
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,370
And same thing likely due to confounding.

43
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:50,880
So as a summary of the results, there was a causal association between genetic liability of chronic HPV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma.

44
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,530
This is consistent with observational studies. What's unique about this?

45
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,970
What's unique about it is that then you can study it causally. Observational studies.

46
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:11,600
There's the concern of compounding. Because it's causally associated with gastric and cervical cancers and HCV

47
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,640
and cigaret smoking compounded the association in cervical and lung cancers.

48
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:25,510
There hasn't been much research into the biological mechanism of the association between chronic HPV infection and extrahepatic cancer.

49
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:34,660
So it's not fully understood. They have found HPV in different sites in the body, like HPV antigens, and they suggest that HPV protein X,

50
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:41,680
which is a transcriptional activator, is which is involved in TUMORIGENESIS, might interfere with apoptosis.

51
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:51,049
Limitations, the small sample size for some of the site specific cancers, those on one of the previous sites.

52
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,230
But I did forget to mention that. And then again,

53
00:06:54,230 --> 00:07:00,559
the possible underlying population structural differences because the exposure data was collected from Korea and the outcome data

54
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:08,150
was collected from Japan and then in East Asia there was a higher prevalence of HPV infection than in other parts of the world.

55
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,740
So this may reduce the generalizability of the study to other populations.

56
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:23,700
Questions. Any questions.

57
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,950
So I know that you said that you probably ovarian cancer was actually inversely associated with HPV.

58
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:39,770
Are there any like limitations from your study you can think of that could be leading to that?

59
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:45,140
Because I know that's different from. It's probably because of the small sample size.

60
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:54,290
And also there's like different risk factors amongst the two populations that they studied for the exposures and the outcome,

61
00:07:54,530 --> 00:08:01,550
which is supposed to be standardized by this. But as you can see with the CIGARET smoking and HCV infection, it is still prone to some confounding.

62
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:09,570
It reduces most of it, but not all of it. Thank you. Because the study was limited to two countries.

63
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:13,530
Do you think the results are generalizable to any other populations across the world?

64
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,780
Probably not, especially because HPV infection is mostly prevalent in East Asian countries.

65
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,410
And so where it's less prevalent, you're probably not going to see such significant results.

66
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:35,860
I have not seen this method before for for this combination of like a very long developing condition in and a virus is really interesting.

67
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:42,100
Are there any other questions that you think would be good for this Mendelian randomization?

68
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,320
Any other viruses that you think would be worth investigating this way?

69
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:55,150
I think I would probably I think it would be worth investigating HPV and different viruses that are typically associated with that in that cancers,

70
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:03,820
because it's difficult to pinpoint whether or not the disease is, I guess, unique.

71
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:08,160
If there's like a differentiation between disease that's caused by like, for example, esophageal cancer,

72
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:13,750
there's a difference between HPV positive esophageal cancer and HPV negative esophageal cancer.

73
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:20,280
But they can't be for differentiation in all cases. Thank you very much.

74
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:33,710
All right. So I am actually going to pause.

75
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:44,340
Pause here. Turn off the. Oh, apparently.

76
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,460
Okay. So I need to restart.
