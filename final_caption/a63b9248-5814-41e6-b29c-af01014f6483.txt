1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:07,410
Oh, my goodness. I think it's the first time.

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:18,000
I think it's quite an announcement for this week.

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,760
I thought the session on Friday is going to be from three or four.

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:35,550
And so other than this week, it's all going to be 232, 330 about this week due to this conflict of schedule,

5
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,030
we're moving to three or four and same room, but 3 to 4 Smart House calendar.

6
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:51,540
That's for the Friday discussion session. Tomorrow, 3 to 404 are going to be assigned today.

7
00:00:52,260 --> 00:01:02,370
All my friends do it today. Uh, I don't see a lot of you showing up in my office hours, so if you have any questions,

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,360
either it's related to homework or anything about the lecture, feel free to join the office hour.

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:18,300
It's a virtual so you can join anywhere. So I don't mind the office hours.

10
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:28,020
Any question before we move on. And we are in the electric age right now.

11
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,399
There are a couple more nighters and we're going to have our major time.

12
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:42,570
Fine. So it's always good to start reviewing the materials, just checking whether there is anything that's unclear.

13
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:52,620
Make sure you get those questions right. You got those problems solved before the midterms and the midterms right before the fall.

14
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:59,370
Great for travel on Friday. Might be in class on Thursday, I believe on Thursday.

15
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:06,720
All the way to the floor. Always a question.

16
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:18,360
All right. Okay. So, yes, last time we talk about some transformations, and particularly for a random variable,

17
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,210
if that required transformation, which is essentially a function that mapped the real space.

18
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,920
Right. You can apply the transformation to the roundabout. We got another roundabout.

19
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:37,730
And as we said, the question of interest is to derive the city app or distribution function for this new random variable.

20
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:44,040
If we know the distribution for the original one, that's sort of the central called for this part.

21
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:51,050
Towards the end of the last lecture, we specifically talk about if our transformation is special,

22
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,700
particular, or if it's a monotone increasing or decreasing function,

23
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:06,929
then we can have a shortcut, we can have a form and all we can do right formulas for a PDF or PR or CTA directly.

24
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:16,790
Without going through the definition, we can directly write out the PDF or CD of the new right a variable if the transformation is monotone,

25
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,470
increasing or decreasing for the purposes that we have to go from the definition.

26
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,260
But once we have the familiar words that directly apply.

27
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:38,430
But today, let's continue and look at some more general relations and also some special transformations between roundabout roles.

28
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:53,219
First, this general relation for transformation is a theorem in the book that says the following If answer is a roundabout, I'm always P out of art.

29
00:03:53,220 --> 00:04:01,070
So that's why to be transformation of the night of our class.

30
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:09,840
And as we said, we have to decide the support first for any type of transformation, for any type of questions,

31
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:15,300
always a little bit of a support and that will give us a sense of what we are working on.

32
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,219
The support for our region random variable is defined as all of the x values,

33
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:26,730
such that a PDF is greater than zero and the support for the new round of variables for the transform right available.

34
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:34,920
And to find out all the my values such that y is equal to a g of access or some x in the support of x.

35
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,580
So that's the support within only by this kind of accepted example.

36
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:49,079
So support suppose there exists application of the original support acts within or about a 0 to

37
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:57,480
8 take down this A0 essentially capture all those irregular points in your original support.

38
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:03,990
So we assume that the probability of the random variable fallen into this case zero has zero probability.

39
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,310
The other words say it's a very small set, extremely small, small to to to the extreme,

40
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:18,300
that it has zero probability that the probability of having this irregular 2.0.

41
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:24,360
And then this is a continuous all of the other support.

42
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,150
It's a continuous right available for all the other support they want to maintain.

43
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:36,430
Furthermore, we barely exist this one to achieve a transformation.

44
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:44,220
Essentially the replicate of their original transformation as well as the second that satisfied the following conditions.

45
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,829
Then we can have a generic PDR formula for this transform.

46
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:55,650
Right? So the key conditions that we need to satisfy are we need to check his first.

47
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,430
This all this GI is the new transformation process.

48
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:08,070
One for each support, one for each patient is essentially the same as the original transformation function.

49
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,770
When asked, is it restricted to the corresponding parties?

50
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,350
This is sort of a trivial condition.

51
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:28,120
It just means that we are creating this to want to declare the property in our original properties about like a one size fits G.I.

52
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,510
Functions. Transformations. They are minor. I think.

53
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:45,730
But this is a very important condition. Each tie is monotone is a description I had is modest.

54
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:53,620
So when we say monotone, it's going back to its previous question last time.

55
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,750
Monotone means straight monotone increase are strictly monotone decreasing.

56
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,720
Well, when we say monotone implies straight quite decrease in less frequent increasing.

57
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,410
And otherwise it's not that that's not called monotone.

58
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:20,379
So GI is monotone on this air. And another very important condition that typical an overload condition is that this kind

59
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:27,490
of work why the support of the transform not available is the same for every GI or every.

60
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,330
In other words,

61
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:43,990
if you think about the support of this transport around available for a while and see one that's the same as a support for the second for the

62
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:57,339
second part of the financial aid to g to tax and same for all the other parts which are the other words for this are ignorant of our goal.

63
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,920
I think if it falls into one of these partitions,

64
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:11,650
one of it says they want to make the new roundabout about what always take the same values and they always cover the same values.

65
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,540
The news.

66
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:22,270
The fourth will always be this kind of graph y, and that's actually a very important condition and you have to check in order to use this later on.

67
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:30,100
And the fourth condition is that the inverse function for each condition has a continuous derivation on this support.

68
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:41,920
So that's sort of also a kind of trade operation, since if you don't have this container derivative and you cannot write out this formula.

69
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:49,479
So really what's most important is a made out to one is that each try this transformation

70
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,570
is a moment on each attention and signals you can focus on interpretation.

71
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:06,370
The support of the transport around a variable are the same once all this conditions are satisfied.

72
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:15,560
Now we can directly write out the idea of the run of the transform roundabout of a lie in this form or any Y in this support,

73
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,900
in this common support is always going to be the summation.

74
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:28,870
I'm one to k where each of it is essentially the same as what happened we have sent before for monotone transformation.

75
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:37,390
It's that I thought of as a value added t inverse y times the absolute value of the derivative of to immerse one.

76
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:46,470
So this formula we have to one. If we adjusted aim was one monotone transformation, then we do not have the summation.

77
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:55,570
Exactly. I have this formula. But if our transformation is not global in monotone, but is piecewise monotone,

78
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:05,800
then we can think about using this theorem by cutting your original support into pieces where each piece or transformation function is monotone.

79
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:13,180
Then you have to check whether the support corresponding to each piece is the same.

80
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,160
But this transform random variable.

81
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:21,370
If all is satisfied, then you can directly use this formula to write out the play out for the transport roundabout.

82
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:29,380
So that's the theorem. And let's take a look at the example to say how this is used in practice.

83
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,450
But before that, any questions about the statement of the theorem just.

84
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:48,090
Okay. So hopefully with that example, we will be become much clearer of what this forum is really talking about.

85
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:57,570
Suppose X is a continuous minor marvel by a normal distribution parameter 0.1 and but normal distribution, which we'll talk about later.

86
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:06,180
The PDF takes this Formula one over square root of two pi exponential to the power of negative square over two.

87
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:16,080
Right. So this is a pd l function. And if you draw this function, it looks like a battleship or the battleship.

88
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,890
That's where the battleship comes.

89
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,330
That's essentially the pdf of the normal distribution.

90
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:32,550
And it looks like this and the CDF essentially is acts on that.

91
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:38,399
You calculate this area under the curve up to this active point and that area.

92
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:44,210
I give you the CDF or the corresponding ax. All right.

93
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,440
Now, the question is, if we define life to be at square.

94
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,500
This is our transformation. What is the distribution of one?

95
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:05,410
All right. So why Contract Square again? We can draw that relationship between the X and y axis and g of X.

96
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,730
That's just the quadratic function that looks like this.

97
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,670
The global is not a monotone distribution. It's not a monotone transformation.

98
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,970
Right. It's not a monotone.

99
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:30,970
But the 19 part X last line zero is monochrome, decreasing the positive part as greater than zero as monochrome increasing.

100
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:40,390
But global is not monotonic. So we can directly use the formula for that monotone transformation,

101
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:49,270
but we can think about using the formula that we just introduced in order to use it.

102
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:55,810
What is the first step? If you want to use this mirror, what would be the first step?

103
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:10,990
We need to construct a plantation. I need to construct a petition that satisfies all these conditions without conditions.

104
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,400
There's no point talking about using if. You need a petition to start.

105
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,600
So, for example, what would be the petition?

106
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,780
Less than zero acts. Less than zero or all the words.

107
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:36,920
That's right. Insert a want equal to infinity is a zero.

108
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:50,469
Good. What about a two? We already have been part of the Iraq war for the positive part.

109
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,010
So it was zero to infinity. Anything else?

110
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,940
Is this the process? Yes.

111
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:03,730
Why don't we include zero anyway? We didn't include zero eight so far.

112
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:15,290
But if you look at the support of House, what is the support of Report?

113
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:25,780
What is the definition of the support for the run of any value against the PTA greater than the real thing?

114
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,380
All right. Is this a1a2 hour possession of the of the original subparts?

115
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:36,940
Not. Right. We are still missing one point.

116
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:43,270
That is zero. And these are going to be this A1, A2 and a03.

117
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:47,140
So going to be a quotation of the original sample space.

118
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,990
Part of the reason support. That's right.

119
00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:00,600
And now we have to check our conditions to see whether this is a good addition for use or not.

120
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:05,520
First, a zero, a probability, since it's a continuous random variable.

121
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,840
So the probability of x taking any particular value is always zero.

122
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:15,620
So that why is it good? So this this condition is satisfied.

123
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:19,680
This probability of acts will also be zero zero.

124
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:26,810
Indeed, all this irregular point in this case, just one point is collected in this case, zero.

125
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:32,880
So we don't have to worry about that. Okay. Next, let's take a look at this A1 and A2.

126
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:42,709
Because of access, but to have access continuous on both sets of access,

127
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:53,050
the continuous globally right that is also satisfied and data defined as t one and G2, X, A1 and A2 separately.

128
00:15:53,500 --> 00:16:01,090
As I said, this g1x on request. Essentially they are just the replicate or copies of the original transformation function.

129
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:06,580
Original transformation function is what g is equal to x squared.

130
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:15,610
That's the original transformation function. So they can define g1x to be the same g2x to be at square.

131
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:23,380
Are they already find out different sets or j one acts x is defined by a one party two x axis define

132
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:30,490
in two other functional form is the same is the same as the original transformation function.

133
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:38,690
It's always x squared. Okay. Now let's just check one or each one of these connections.

134
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:44,090
The first connection, as I said, it's trivial because that's how we gave this to.

135
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,160
It's just a copy of the original transformation concept. All right.

136
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:58,940
Second one guy is monotone. Yeah. So it's this tie function monotone t one monotone A-1.

137
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:14,020
The g1 x is x squared, right? This base curve A1 is just the left hand side of the x axis.

138
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:28,420
So it's this function monitor on this art. Yes it is is monotone decreasing sigmoid G2 is monotone a two is monotone increasing.

139
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,910
Okay. So that means the second condition also satisfied.

140
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,959
So that's good. That's very important. We need to check.

141
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,580
The third is the patient. So you are seeing examples.

142
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,469
You your homework where if the third condition is not satisfied,

143
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:51,500
you cannot directly use this because you can still calculate the PDR using definition.

144
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,410
You can not directly use this formula.

145
00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:04,070
And so now let's check the third condition, one of the support of the transport running parallel and the same for each set.

146
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:22,660
First, let's consider. The support for g1x for x belongs to two A1 as denoted by y one.

147
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,460
And what is that? What is a part of this transform around a variable?

148
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:39,790
A one. And Asia is here and all the Y values such that y whatever t one acts or acts belongs to anyone.

149
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,610
What is this? Support y1g.

150
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:50,760
You just got to choose if you want.

151
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,280
It's a sad or what? Alive. Alex? Yes?

152
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:08,020
Excuse me. Very good. Zero to infinity. Okay.

153
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:14,970
And it's an open set. And why is that often?

154
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,260
You can take a look at this transformation. All right.

155
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:27,210
A way that this support is defined is you think about all of these acts activity.

156
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:34,970
It's a one and. The support we want is going to be all the Liberals are responding to.

157
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,930
This g1x or an x takes a while.

158
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,860
So that gave you pretty much all the Y, essentially all the Y.

159
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:57,400
Now the base loved part of this parabola of this quadratic curve can take, and that is from zero to infinity.

160
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:06,100
And also, it's an open sac because I cannot take value at zero zero is not part of this A1.

161
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:11,650
So zero is not a part of this either. So that gave us this Y one.

162
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:19,450
All right. So that's a support of a transform run of our both corresponding to this partition.

163
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:32,080
This a one partition. Similarly, we can calculate this y two, which is the support corresponding to g two, x and a.

164
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:39,450
And what is that? What is the setup?

165
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:44,250
Why values are important to us. X belongs to a two.

166
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,690
Very good. It's the same, right? It's same zero to infinity.

167
00:20:53,790 --> 00:21:00,810
And these two are the same. So that is satisfy this condition.

168
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:13,780
The third condition. And the fourth condition is that this g i inverse y has a continuous derivative.

169
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:24,220
So if, uh, if our g is at square g one Emerson y.

170
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:31,790
It's. What? What is the G? Am I j to do?

171
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:56,890
But gee, why Imus? Why? What is the popular? We know that she won.

172
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,880
All right. They want to say that square for acts belongs to being one or the other.

173
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,810
Acts less than zero. So what is G y inverse y?

174
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,170
What is the humorous function of that as a momentum function?

175
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:12,650
So it has a unique inverse function.

176
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:18,389
And what it's not. Square root out.

177
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:22,500
Why not? All right. Good night.

178
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:28,560
Square root of one. And because X is in a one axis is less than zero.

179
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:33,239
So it type if you calculate the inverse function of that. Don't forget about this.

180
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,049
Not cosine, nothing square no more. And what about G2?

181
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:42,240
Inverse one grab the square root of white and all the same.

182
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:48,000
Very similar. Right. So it does not have a negative sign because it's a positive part.

183
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:56,370
Now we have this so explicit formula, it's easy to check that it does have continuous derivative on the support.

184
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:03,380
You can. You can take the derivative. So such as? So all the conditions are satisfied.

185
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:08,210
Now we can directly write out the pdf using the following or not.

186
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,960
So the premium or y.

187
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,620
Is just the summation. I want you to.

188
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:24,040
All right. And each element is acts of.

189
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:39,260
J. Inverse y giu versus y times the derivative of C.

190
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:44,780
Inverse y with respect to y absolute value.

191
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,440
Okay, so that's the formula.

192
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:59,300
I'm not quite copying the formula here, so I'll give you one minute and try to write out one based on our hits by plugging in the corresponding.

193
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:26,100
Okay. I hope you all got it. So the final answer is that the Pdaf function is a one over square root of two times

194
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:33,630
y times this exponential to the power of negative y over to a y greater than zero.

195
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,210
Right. Any other y y any y last are equal to zero is always zero.

196
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:46,620
So that's the PDF and this distribution is actually any random variable.

197
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:52,110
Having this pdf is called a chi square retroviral with the growth rate of one.

198
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,240
And you can see the chi square out of our box.

199
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,830
The graph main one is essentially constructed by this taking the square of the standard normal distribution.

200
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:08,010
Alternatively, this is one way of calculating the alternative.

201
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:16,010
Like I'm using the thumb, you can use the formula I gave in the last lecture to directly write out the PDF.

202
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,770
You can see that it's going to be exactly the same.

203
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:29,780
So this theorem just provides us a more general relation between the PDF, all the original roundabout, all the media, all the transport of available.

204
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:34,670
It is satisfied as a patient and in question.

205
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:49,470
Okay. So that's the most general formula that we can give for driving material for transport around a variable.

206
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:58,710
Now let's look at some special cases. One special case is using the P the out function as a transformation function.

207
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:03,600
So the function itself is, is a function.

208
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,310
If you think about a CDF or any random variable, it's a function.

209
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:14,580
And it's not only a function but also a sort of a good function with some nice properties.

210
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,390
I say the function has to be what?

211
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:22,500
What are the properties of the city function and the function?

212
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:33,980
You still remember? What are the sample size properties of the KDR function and continues by continuous

213
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:43,650
to produce one from 0 to 1 approaching and zero to nothing in any approaching one.

214
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:51,860
I suppose to call that insensitive and it imbalanced. Monitor increasing or increasing now decreasing.

215
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,920
That's the that's a regressive way to say not necessarily.

216
00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:00,330
Monitor increasing CTF is always non decreasing.

217
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,340
Right. So those are the good properties of sitting up.

218
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:12,240
Now let's think about if we use the CTO function as a transformation function, what would happen?

219
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:15,720
Okay, so you want to do that.

220
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:26,309
Let's first properly define what is the inverse, because if we want to use the CTA function as a transformation,

221
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:32,540
we need to make sure that it has that inverse function. Otherwise all this derivation doesn't work, right?

222
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:39,900
So we have to make sure the facts immerse is properly defined so that us two different scenarios.

223
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:51,540
The first scenario, if our focus is strictly increasing, our monitor increasing, then our focus is while defining, right?

224
00:28:51,990 --> 00:29:08,280
So if you have a monotone the increasing of ax areas, there is always a for every Y from 0 to 1.

225
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,270
There is always a unique ax corresponding to what?

226
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:21,100
Even Ambien has charms. It's the same, but I can use.

227
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:29,170
Even if you have a charm or any y value, you can always find a unique ax corresponding to it.

228
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:47,950
So ax inverse is well defined in that is for any y we can define acts to be equal to the inverse y, which also means aspects of x is equal to one.

229
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,380
So this case is slightly more complicated.

230
00:29:52,390 --> 00:30:02,830
So we'll talk about this in a second. But anyway, this this applies as strictly define inverse function.

231
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:10,420
So this is easier case analysis is when attracts is constant on some intervals then.

232
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:17,760
Attacks. Imus is not exactly defined its concern.

233
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:30,750
That's the right approach. Want your attacks as this system?

234
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:41,050
This pattern is now decreasing, but it has a flat rate from x one to x two.

235
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:51,580
Then perhaps the inverse is not exactly defining of these particular y value and y is here.

236
00:30:52,600 --> 00:31:03,400
Then, without special definition we do not know what is inverse y y that s one or two are anywhere between x one.

237
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,780
So it's not well-defined.

238
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:13,240
So we need to specifically define what do we mean by about the inverse Y in particular, our one way to define the inverse is using the implement.

239
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:27,120
I have as immerse why cannot be defined as the embodiment of all the arts that is such that attracts us is quite important.

240
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,510
Why? So that's one way to define.

241
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:44,550
Another way to define it is you can use an inverse equal to the supreme of acts such that acts is greater.

242
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:53,320
We? The.

243
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:15,560
Last. The. So that's that's another way to define this.

244
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:19,380
The. Emerson.

245
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,530
Why? So if we follow the first definition, use an animal to define that fact.

246
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,400
EMERSON But this particular why? What is the value of that famous?

247
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:38,049
What? In this example, what is the actual value of this artifact?

248
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:51,660
Same or small? So we need to think about what they said is right.

249
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:59,070
It's a collection of all of the values such that no facts is greater or equal to all.

250
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:13,750
That is to say, all the values, all the values here for everyone to hear the corresponding facts of acts is always going to be greater on why.

251
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:20,450
And the embodiment of that. It just this point. Right.

252
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,610
So there's going to be two. And if you follow this definition.

253
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:33,780
The collection of all that such that appearance is less than what it's going to be.

254
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:40,230
This part of the access. And if you take this a premium that's going to be it's one.

255
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:46,300
But this to finish, I'm going to give you a different Imus value for the same line.

256
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:56,620
You can use it either one, but you have to fix one of them in order to properly define what you mean by the numbers of this.

257
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,170
See the function that it has that is constant on some animals.

258
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:12,110
And once we define this up as immerse.

259
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:32,360
What's really fun is about skimmers. Now we can talk about using this app as a transformation function.

260
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:42,650
Just so folks know you belong y equal to the theme of x of x is equal to y.

261
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:56,480
So I think the integral x12x2 is x when you include it is like also belongs to the set of like because of x equal to y is from x one to x two.

262
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:00,110
So yes, you are saying there is x one.

263
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:11,180
So those two definitions are equal. So let me take one step back and there's the mistake here of Merry go fetch.

264
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:25,450
So revisit this definition. That's what I want to what I'm actually writing.

265
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,980
Okay. So very good point. So now let's revisit this.

266
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:35,890
I take what I said. So the first definition of facts.

267
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:39,340
Why if we use the environment of this site.

268
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:44,830
Again, the key is to really understand what this site is.

269
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:52,120
Right? The collection of all that's value is such that our back tax is greater or equal to why?

270
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:58,600
And when I said it was incorrect. Because that's not going to be this part.

271
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:05,140
All right. Well, any ads in this part?

272
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:10,470
If you take a look at this exact scenario, it's always going to be great.

273
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:15,560
Of what? Right. This this right.

274
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Thank you. All right. So these if you take the impact of this collection, that's going to give us x one.

275
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:34,790
Yeah. I just want to make sure that everyone's clear about this. Any question with this?

276
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,150
The correct answer, actually, for the first definition is X one.

277
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:56,240
And for the second one I say I should write it as the supreme of all the x values such that as of tax is last or equal to this small line.

278
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:02,690
And what is that going to be? Just as two same logic.

279
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:17,720
Okay. Because that's going to be this is a collection of these values that Superintendent Supreme is going to be asked to write.

280
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:23,120
So that's the value. Two ways of defining this hypoxia inverse.

281
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:41,810
So personally, I'm so I prefer the second definition using the, uh, the supreme to define the inverse.

282
00:37:42,140 --> 00:38:01,560
And the reason is that. As I said, there are other conditions where you have a monotone PD sitting a function, but now it has a jump point.

283
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:06,110
And that's because in another scenario or a half hour.

284
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:16,950
It's this. So recall that for anyone in this function.

285
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:28,470
Traditionally, conventionally, the way that we define the universe, it just or any way corresponds to this interval.

286
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,290
The Earth acts ourselves. Life is defined.

287
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:40,660
That's right. That's the convention.

288
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,790
If you look at our calculus book, that's how we define that universe wide.

289
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:54,370
But this particular point or the other particular point is the easy case where you have a 1 to 1 mapping from the X axis and the Y axis.

290
00:38:54,940 --> 00:39:02,680
Only for this part and only for this part is that it's not super clear for anyone.

291
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,120
Conventionally, the inverse is defined as this particular axiomatic.

292
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:13,180
So now let's check these two definitions and say What do we get first?

293
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:18,489
If we use the first definition, if we use the facts, the inverse.

294
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:26,650
Why he pointed it in favor of all the acts such that our facts tax rate are equal to why?

295
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:42,680
That's going to be. The collection of this, right.

296
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:48,970
And the collection of this set and the minimum is going to be X and on the second definition.

297
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,920
You take the supremo. Facts are facts.

298
00:39:56,370 --> 00:40:06,580
Last, how to lie. It's going to be exactly the same point.

299
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:16,590
All right. So that means both definitions give us the same inverse manual for this particular one so you can use either one.

300
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,200
But in practice, as I said, you have to face one plus you face one.

301
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:29,770
All of these inverse function is probably fine for anybody, for any type of CDP function.

302
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:44,380
All right. With that, we have a well-defined clear function and a well-defined inverse of our function.

303
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:57,160
Then we have the following theorem. That is, If AX has the key, our function F of X, which is continuous, then this Y equal to this of acts of ax.

304
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:03,790
Okay. Now facts is treated as a transformation function, applying to the same random variable.

305
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:09,190
And then we have Y as follows a uniform distribution.

306
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:20,680
Right. Which means the probability of this y last all equal to any small line is always equal to what if y belongs to zero and one?

307
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:31,380
Recall that uniform distribution means the support is 0 to 1 and the PTA is a constant function.

308
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:40,180
So this is actually a very strong conclusion. It just tells us that if we have any arbitrary, continuous, random variable X,

309
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:46,920
we take a city and use that as a transformation function applied to the same random variable.

310
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,630
Then we can always end up with a uniform run about.

311
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,930
Think about this. This, as I say, a very strong conclusion.

312
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:03,750
Any arbitrary, continuous, random variable, you can always apply this trait to get a uniform random variable.

313
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:09,570
Even better, if you think about the inverse CDF as a transformation,

314
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:16,410
you can always convert any uniform random variable to any continuous random variable.

315
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:23,700
As long as you know their CDF function. So this is a very strong conclusion.

316
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,700
And let's take a look why this is a case.

317
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:39,040
So let's try to prove this. First if Y is defined as this type of house.

318
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:52,450
Okay, what is the support of what? Yes.

319
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,240
0 to 1. Very good. And do I need to care about the support of X?

320
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,420
I also write openstack or continuous running around.

321
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,840
Why? It doesn't really matter. So I just write an open set.

322
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:18,050
Do I need to worry about the support of X in order to gain the support of Y?

323
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:23,020
I mean this case, we do not as can be.

324
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:28,810
I have a support on the real space or I can have a support on a subset of the real space.

325
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:37,480
Regardless if your plot, if you think about the definition of the support particle line is any Y value

326
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:43,030
such that there exists to support this app acts takes the values in this.

327
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:57,150
The definition is all the y value is such that my or to add some x or pax belongs to the support of x.

328
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,300
So as we know, x is a continuous random variable.

329
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:08,370
So basically this affects our balance has to take continuous matters and it goes from zero to 2 to 1.

330
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:19,110
So regardless of what this support category acts is, this support for the support for Y is always 0 to 1.

331
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:25,170
All right. So that's the person that I need to decide on the second.

332
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:31,500
Now, let's take a look at what the CDF is or this new round of our life.

333
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:39,220
Since the support has an 0 to 1, that means we only need to consider the values between zero and one anyway.

334
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:45,540
Less than zero. A city is always zero anyway. Out of greater than one, a city is always one.

335
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:50,230
So we only need to worry about y close to zero and one.

336
00:44:50,640 --> 00:45:04,650
Okay. And if any y belong to zero in a y a city app of y by definition is the probability of the random variable taken minus the last one.

337
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:16,350
And that translates to if you plug in this transformation, that means the probability of of acts.

338
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:21,030
How X or this acts as a run of our land are equal to Y.

339
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:35,520
And what it is. This is a set right now available with this transformation.

340
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,700
And that's why it's a set. It's a set of.

341
00:45:53,060 --> 00:46:01,580
It's a bit by definition this about is a continuous function is a continuous function.

342
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:07,930
It is monotonic, increasing. Then apparently this directly translates to acts.

343
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:13,560
So that's how I got to its name or why it is nonvolatile increasing.

344
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:19,640
You can ask that constant part. Now we need to use the definition of this affects inverse.

345
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:30,680
And you can verify that if I use the definition of our artifacts images, regardless of which one we use, you always have these inequality.

346
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:34,910
Always equivalent to acts Lazare or two of these attacks.

347
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:43,590
Inverse one. Now we end up with these power and that is exactly what.

348
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:50,780
AX. Evaluate that. See the IMAX immerse fly.

349
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,560
And these composite function,

350
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:08,710
the inverse function and the original function composite composite together is this going to be identity function so that give us what?

351
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:22,270
So we know a CDP, a y is equal to Y and that just means the probability of y last are equal to why it's always equal to one anyway, close to zero.

352
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:26,280
And what that means lies a uniform variable.

353
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:36,290
Any question? Again, this is a very strong conclusion.

354
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:46,850
Just convert any continuous random variable to a uniform random variable using its own city approach and actually has many utility in practice,

355
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:58,100
especially in the random number generation because in computer it is easy to simulate uniform random random numbers.

356
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:05,630
And if you know we actually we cannot similarly any random number,

357
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:11,600
any true random number all of the random numbers that are similar using computer are just soon a random numbers.

358
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:16,129
But I assume these are just random numbers, a someplace random number.

359
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:25,900
The simulated is from uniform distribution. It's about how do we simulate a random number following any continuous distribution.

360
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:30,170
While we can directly use this theorem to help us achieve that,

361
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:37,530
the way to do it is first you simulate from this uniform distribution, you got a bunch of random numbers, right?

362
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:47,270
And then you apply this inverse transformation or in other words, solve or hacks or any aspects of equal to you.

363
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:55,760
Then you've got a bunch of X values and those X values following that theorem that we just talk about,

364
00:48:56,010 --> 00:49:02,840
going to be samples from this desired distribution with a PDF,

365
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:10,310
with a CDF of have of x, which means if we know of the city out of our random variable,

366
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:16,040
we can always use this procedure to generate random numbers from that distribution.

367
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,760
But that just opens up all possibilities, right?

368
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:28,879
If you are interested in getting normal random arrivals always need to do is to know what

369
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:35,959
the city our function is but rhinovirus and then you can start with uniform a random

370
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:42,740
number apply it to the city out of the normal division and you got the normal rhinovirus

371
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:53,720
and any others as I as you know the CDF you can always apply the 20 things any question.

372
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:04,580
So let's take a break and come back.

373
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:48,770
And 2,632.30000000000.

374
00:50:48,770 --> 00:51:36,900
You know, what you have to do is also will cost me so much here in New York City with a few of his

375
00:51:38,990 --> 00:52:07,700
kids and come to work with a lot of people who also want to talk to you about this.

376
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:26,810
So here's my favorite story.

377
00:52:28,100 --> 00:53:01,680
You know, this is you know, so I think you should ask them learned.

378
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:25,130
I'm going to give you the start of three sites where they try to work through.

379
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:32,270
It depends on how long the speaker speaks on Thursday.

380
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:45,290
And that's why I want you to get out there.

381
00:53:45,290 --> 00:54:23,290
And I want to say I'm not a research assistant, but I have to tell you about this, right?

382
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:49,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

383
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:57,920
But you to help.

384
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:12,820
They want it to go on for so long.

385
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:29,880
I know what you just said yourself.

386
00:55:31,650 --> 00:56:15,470
You know, it's also in terms of, you know, I just don't want to do anything 20, 25 kilometers north, West Yorkshire.

387
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:25,390
This seems to be a possibility.

388
00:56:32,910 --> 00:57:02,150
So what are you interested in is concentrating on the U.S. economy?

389
00:57:04,920 --> 00:58:18,320
I feel like I have got to tell you one thing I do not listen to say to those who is out there.

390
00:58:22,360 --> 00:59:31,720
It's just it's okay to look at some of these words, but I don't think we should stop now.

391
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:57,450
What do you make of this?

392
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:03,270
Come on, let's talk about it now.

393
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:08,070
All right. So let's continue on the next topic, which is the Taliban.

394
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:18,780
So we're running out of all or any transformation of the of arable once we have the PDR senior piano.

395
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:30,470
The characterization of the distribution. The very next step is to use some simple statistics, simple statistics to quantify a distribution.

396
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,650
So the distribution is a is a is a distribution is a function.

397
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:40,579
Capsulize everything about this brand available in context.

398
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:46,790
We may not need to know so much about the random variable reported or something.

399
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:51,050
I resemble the age of your study cohort.

400
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:57,290
You do not need to provide every single age of the participant in the study.

401
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,930
Right? Everybody, whatever.

402
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:09,680
Whoever is writing the report is only interested in knowing some of the key values, some key quantities summarizing this distribution.

403
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:14,300
So expect that tomorrow is one of those most important summary statistics.

404
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:29,479
But as the average weight is defined, the average or the weighted average of the random variable over the entire distribution of family,

405
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:33,560
the definition of the expected value mean is defined as follows.

406
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:41,120
If for a run of arable, I see g of x and just for generosity.

407
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,950
And around and around and around.

408
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:52,150
So this job actually is our out about all the interest.

409
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:57,190
Okay. So we use this notation e to expand to the know the expectation.

410
01:01:57,610 --> 01:02:10,479
If they expect a patient of this absolute value of this chance is less than zero, then we call this formula to be the number calculated,

411
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:16,820
using this formula to be the expected value of t acts that is denoted by this e objects.

412
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:23,280
And the formula if it's a continuous random variable.

413
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:32,790
Now we're going to take integration. The integration of nickname Infinity to Infinity G Jehovah's Times.

414
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:38,400
This PDF function and it is a discrete random variable.

415
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:49,470
There's going to be a summation sum over the sample space for the support of Jehovah's Claims, the probability of the randomness of each mathematics.

416
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:59,350
So probably is easier to first consider this this case if you think about the formula.

417
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,920
Right. We take all possible values for X in the support.

418
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:12,640
And to calculate this weighted average, the weight is defined by this P.A.,

419
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:20,050
the probability of the random variable taking its value and what we are averaging in the city of X function.

420
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,530
So it's a weighted average of ATX.

421
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:36,430
That weight is defined by the probability the PMF and that is defined as the expectation or expected value of this environment.

422
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:47,450
Similarly, for the continuous case is just changing this summation to integration change in the PMT function to the PDR function,

423
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:56,770
and it still can be conceptually conceived as the weighted average again.

424
01:03:56,780 --> 01:04:02,240
Now the when is PDF is defined by the PDF.

425
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,020
And what we are averaging is still this function.

426
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:14,370
And one important thing to notice about in this definition is that you have to check

427
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:19,870
this condition in order to properly define the expected value for a random variable.

428
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:29,290
And if a base condition is, it's defined in the same way.

429
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:36,730
So your expectation of this absolute value is going to be the integration of this absolute value of the function times,

430
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:46,900
the PDF or the summation of that. So the value of the plan and the definition that the following are for this expectation of the same to

431
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:54,130
first check whether the expectation is a spectator value of the absolute jacks is less like entity.

432
01:04:54,340 --> 01:05:00,020
If it is, then we can formally define what the expected value is on our original chance.

433
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:06,370
Otherwise it's not defined. So that's the definition.

434
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:17,530
So probably it's more definition, maybe a little bit more abstract.

435
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:22,690
And let's take a look at some examples to say what the expected value is.

436
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:31,830
So the first example, let's assume the right amount of X is an unequal distribution where from number nine in the area like

437
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:41,880
this one amounts of equal to one over lambda times e to the power of Lambda AX over Lambda 20 x zero.

438
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:47,110
So the support of this random variable is zero to infinity.

439
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:55,690
Now the question is what is the expectation or what is the expectation of this amount

440
01:05:55,690 --> 01:06:05,890
of our bodies that are trying to get this high expectation of this random variable?

441
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:11,180
To calculate this expectation, we just follow the definition, right?

442
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:19,270
Says X is a continuous amount available. What do we need to do is to calculate this integration of the function.

443
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:26,649
So times the p pdf now we are calculating the expectation for ax itself.

444
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:33,970
So the function itself just as it's going to be an infinity infinity x times.

445
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:42,870
The period when over lambda e to an active ex overlap with the ex.

446
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:57,840
Is that all? Is that correct? They say that the support rating was very good.

447
01:06:58,110 --> 01:07:01,980
So notice that this acts as a support from zero to infinity.

448
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:06,960
Right. If you directly run out, the problem like this is, it's simply wrong.

449
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:17,370
All right. Because this guy is not the PDF on the global scale is not the PDA of this random variable.

450
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:27,240
It's only the PDA. If access is greater than or equal to zero, the proportion going to be equal to zero if X is less than zero.

451
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:35,880
So you have to have additional indicator function greater are equal to zero in order to make this a valid PDA function.

452
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,130
So if you right this way, that is correct.

453
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:45,720
And one one thing that I can notice right away is that for any X less than zero, this function is always going to be a zero.

454
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:54,030
So when I can write the equivalent A's, integration is not from nothing repetitive infinity, but rather from the zero to infinity.

455
01:07:54,420 --> 01:08:07,760
Then you can write it this way as. Then the question is what is the integration?

456
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,930
Once you calculate the negotiation, you got the expectation, yes.

457
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:20,230
So the way we're defining our PDF saying that is the parts that are now hard for.

458
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:27,600
Are we saying that he's made the point or is it wrong to write this strategy of up?

459
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:33,410
Yeah. Yeah. So this is the PDR function.

460
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:37,430
Right. So this is one way to write out the PDR function.

461
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:41,900
Or you can create a line right at the PDR function as our facts equals what's.

462
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:55,820
Attacks equal to one over lambda e to the mathematics over Lambda Times Indicator function of acts radar in quantum zero.

463
01:08:57,540 --> 01:08:59,990
Very few write the PDA function in this form.

464
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:07,820
You do not have to define x is greater than zero because this indicator function automatically taken into account.

465
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:12,230
Now this function is going to be zero or any acts less than zero.

466
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:16,610
So this is a more general way of writing the PDR function.

467
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:24,469
Once you write the media function in this way, you can directly use this definition to plug in one g access,

468
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:27,260
what app access and do this integration from nothing.

469
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:36,320
And I'm going to give you exactly the same thing as, you know, if you do the integration from zero to infinity.

470
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:44,420
Right. Essentially the support of our inside is Acts Times, a PDF on the support.

471
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:48,710
It's just two ways of writing the same thing. Does that make sense?

472
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:57,120
Yeah. And now the question for all right, now, the question is, why did this matter?

473
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:02,670
Once we have this video, we can define this as the expectation of this run of our lives.

474
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:15,810
Do we have to check the condition in this case? I mean, this case luckily, we do not need to attack the nation because each of us is what.

475
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:24,330
It's just the box itself because it has to be ground zero.

476
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:32,220
So as long as we can't get a finite value from this integration, we are going to go.

477
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:41,850
We do not need to do extra checking. All right. It's not always the case, but in this example, we do not need to check because of this equality.

478
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:56,570
So now I'll give you one minute to calculate this integration.

479
01:10:56,870 --> 01:11:01,370
And ahead, we can do integration by far.

480
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:11,600
I got it. So now is really a good time to review the calculus since we're going to use

481
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:16,940
this type of integration differentiation in a lot of the rest of the semester.

482
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,540
Anyhow, this is not a matter to you. Definitely.

483
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:23,570
It's the time to go back and check your previous notes. Okay.

484
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:27,770
So now let's take a look at how we are doing this integration by part.

485
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:35,600
Essentially what I learned is you can rewrite this as.

486
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:49,620
This, right? Then you have access to the Lambda Zero entity plus zero infinity.

487
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:55,110
That's Lambda. And what is this part?

488
01:13:56,790 --> 01:14:01,230
The environment? Infinity. It's going to be zero if you evaluate.

489
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:04,950
Zero is also going to be zeros with zero.

490
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:23,160
And what about the integration of this part? Lambda e to the fact that that's over a lot and that even the ability.

491
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:29,420
I can I give us? Look.

492
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:39,580
All right. So since about hastened of this exponential run of arable rice is longer.

493
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:50,220
That is how we calculate expectation for a typical case.

494
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:57,490
And this is for arts itself. Of course you can calculate the expectation for any function of x.

495
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:04,660
All we need to do is to replace this X by the function and then do this integration.

496
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:10,900
Maybe it's harder. Maybe it's easier. It depends on the actual form of the function.

497
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,050
All right. Any question.

498
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:26,540
But this is a continuous case. Next, let's take a look at the discrete case.

499
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:30,710
And this is a binomial distribution, as we said before.

500
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:40,400
What that means is X actually records a number of successes out of many independent trials for each trial of success rate.

501
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:55,220
P In other words, the PMF is defined in this way by any small x belongs to zero one all the way and which is a support of this.

502
01:15:56,260 --> 01:16:04,280
This quarter run a parallel. The PMA is defined in this way and choose x times P to that one minus p.

503
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:10,630
So then minus x. Question, What is the expectation?

504
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:20,290
Again, give you a couple minutes. Write out the definition, try to solve this problem.

505
01:19:07,330 --> 01:19:13,030
So let's look at this together and say trust this first step.

506
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:17,790
First, we need to ride out the fallout, our public expectation ride.

507
01:19:18,190 --> 01:19:23,830
But this quite roundabout about all expectation is that's a weighted average with some

508
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:34,730
impacts from zero two and at times the probability of the ground available taken by Roberts.

509
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:41,550
That's the definition. All right. That's how we define the expectation for the this great amount of animals.

510
01:19:43,270 --> 01:19:56,230
And then we plug it in the car funding formula. We have X zero and X times and choose at P to the highest one minus P, minus X.

511
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:07,120
All right. That's when we have directly write out the power and then what it would be.

512
01:20:07,330 --> 01:20:11,140
And that's not how do we simplify this situation.

513
01:20:14,890 --> 01:20:21,180
So actually for these terrible problems, there is no surefire way of doing it.

514
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,030
It really is a case by case scenario.

515
01:20:25,630 --> 01:20:35,710
And we have to be a little bit creative and also, you know, think of different ways to simplify this.

516
01:20:36,190 --> 01:20:46,060
And along the way, we will we may need a lot of the qualities, different types of qualities to help us simplify the calculation.

517
01:20:47,530 --> 01:20:51,370
And it takes practice to master all those techniques.

518
01:20:51,730 --> 01:20:55,660
So don't panic in the in the beginning if you don't get it right away.

519
01:20:57,100 --> 01:21:04,600
The more you do it, the more practice that you do, the more you will be familiar with this type of a calculation.

520
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:15,460
Okay. So, again, as I said, sometimes it takes some creativity in order to simplify these formulas.

521
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:19,540
And that's why you need a this project in this particular example.

522
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:26,650
If you look at the term inside this summation, this power terms are pretty straightforward.

523
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:36,940
Right. There's not much we can do about it, but these entries are notation from outside great and broken down.

524
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:42,490
And that would be the starting point if we're graded on this and transacts.

525
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,960
Operation. What do we end up with at times?

526
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:54,860
Factorial divided by x, factorial and minus x factorial.

527
01:21:56,910 --> 01:22:00,390
He adds Y minus P and minus X.

528
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:10,790
Now, if you look at your tax value and the denominator of this and it shows that there is a common term tax,

529
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:15,620
that is actually the motivation of why we want to.

530
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:26,330
Bring down this and choose X notation because we can simplify this formula by removing the acts this extra term.

531
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:31,580
Because without this acts, the summation of this pop acts, the contract is just a one.

532
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:35,570
That's something that we know, right? Because PMF always add up to one.

533
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:40,160
It's only this this extra acts that give us the trouble.

534
01:22:40,910 --> 01:22:48,680
So that's why we want to get rid of it. And by breaking down this and shows acts formula, we can actually get rid of that.

535
01:22:49,130 --> 01:23:03,410
But that's how this is started. If we do that, then we end up with X goes from zero to N and factorial x minus one factorial and minus x factorial.

536
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:08,240
Packs y minus plus and minus x plus.

537
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:16,450
All right. So that's what we kind of have once we simplify that to move forward.

538
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:22,480
One general guideline for this type of problem is especially this type of problem.

539
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:31,930
Always try to manipulate your followers so that in memory some PM our function or our function.

540
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:38,080
Because once you kind of have a PMT function or a PDR function, you know,

541
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:41,740
the summation is always a quarter one or the integration is always equal to one.

542
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:49,240
That is the most common trait that people use with simplify in this type of calculation.

543
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:59,260
So now if you look at the what's inside the summation, it's almost the power of binomial distribution.

544
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:07,660
But with the max returns. Right. We want some and choose k type of calculation by the first part.

545
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:21,130
But it's not really not. So one way to do it is to make and choose K out of this first term by removing some extra quantity that is not needed.

546
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:29,980
In particular, we kind of break down the numerator into end times and minus one factorial.

547
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:37,600
Now the denominator, we can rewrite it as a minus one, minus x minus one.

548
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:44,209
That's horrible. All right, now we just copy.

549
01:24:44,210 --> 01:24:59,790
What's. Not. And once we write it this way, you can say that end is not a parameter and it is not a value that is has anything to do with that.

550
01:25:00,030 --> 01:25:04,680
So it's a common it's a constant. It can be taken out outside of this summation.

551
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:19,809
And what's inside the summation. Now becomes a new and used k notation, which is a minus one, shows x minus one times p two.

552
01:25:19,810 --> 01:25:24,460
That's one minus P to the minus x.

553
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:34,440
All right. Now, if you look at this term, they become even more similar to the point of a binomial random variable.

554
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:47,910
Now what's left is just to make sure that you do some additional manipulation to make sure that this is exactly a piano of some binomial runabout.

555
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:53,250
And once you have that, you can get rid of this summation because, you know, the summation is always in for one.

556
01:25:53,910 --> 01:25:59,370
Right? So why don't you take a take a shot from here and see whether you can further simplify this?

557
01:26:00,870 --> 01:26:07,590
The think about a what you need to do in order to make this an exact piano or some binomial random variable.

558
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,790
Extract the crystal signals to what I was doing goes to zero.

559
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:32,050
All right. Good point. So here I am still writing, I think, on a zero copying from the previous.

560
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:36,460
But, you know, that, in fact, is exactly equal to zero.

561
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:40,740
This time I'm going to be inactive. I mentioned. When do we recall that?

562
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:45,400
When we defined is interest K inactive? This is always zero, right?

563
01:26:45,430 --> 01:27:00,310
In other words, this is the same as writing. Actually what I want to add and minus one x minus one key to that one minus p to the minus x equivalent.

564
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:16,930
So from here, how do we further simplify this so they don't get restructured to include those like we read part way or another followed by.

565
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:24,890
Can. Very good. So we have this entrance notation, right?

566
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:30,680
All we need to do is to look at the original piano for the binomial and P.

567
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:34,370
We notice that a what do we need is for the p parameter.

568
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:42,590
We need the power term to be the same as this and chose K the k and the edge was K and we need the other term,

569
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:48,200
the Y minus P, the power of y minus P to B and minus the previous.

570
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:52,400
Now we have this m minus one. Choose X minus one. Right?

571
01:27:52,940 --> 01:28:02,690
So one thing to do is to make this x x minus one so that the power term is equal to that and to escape the K and interest K.

572
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:13,490
So that motivates us to take out the P where we end up with acts equal to one to man and minus one x,

573
01:28:13,490 --> 01:28:21,440
minus one p to x, minus one one minus p to the minus one minus x minus one.

574
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:28,430
Which was going to be all right now is going to be even more closer to what do we need, right.

575
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:35,420
This term is pretty much there but was not there is this summation what do we need

576
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:44,450
as a summation from the zero to the to this number if it's a binomial and p,

577
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:51,350
but here we start from a one and notice that we always have x minus one in this summation.

578
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:59,240
So one thing I can do is to replace x minus one by y, by defining y to be x minus one.

579
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:03,590
Okay, then you can have y from what?

580
01:29:04,730 --> 01:29:16,420
If you define y to be an x minus one I think, or a one means Y on a zero and actually column means y y minus one just to have our change.

581
01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:29,240
Right, right on variable. And inside it's going to be minus one to its y, p to the y, one minus p to the minus one minus Y.

582
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:34,910
And now if you look at this term, what is that?

583
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:45,020
That's exactly what. And why is that? Yes.

584
01:29:45,450 --> 01:29:49,200
Some kind of distribution of minus one.

585
01:29:49,770 --> 01:29:54,780
Very good. Not exactly the piano or a binomial distribution.

586
01:29:56,130 --> 01:30:01,170
How do we sign a different parameters? Is that a. Now it's a minus one.

587
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:09,480
Right. And we know, as long as as I point out, that summation is always going to be equal to one.

588
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:15,390
That's why we can get rid of this term and all of that so that it doesn't repeat.

589
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:26,040
And that completes this calculation, because this is not something that's, you know, super straightforward.

590
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:27,860
It definitely takes practice.

591
01:30:27,870 --> 01:30:38,790
But this type of idea, the trick of manipulating calculation to mimic some piano or PDA in order to simplify the calculation is a very common trait.

592
01:30:39,990 --> 01:30:53,250
So in context, you can you can try some more examples and eventually you will be very you won't be very affluent or proficient with

593
01:30:53,250 --> 01:31:02,660
this type of calculation that helps us play specification of this random variable and following binomial distribution.

594
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:13,170
MP is n times p. And if you think about the meaning of this, the roundabout way I say it makes perfect sense.

595
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:19,979
Actually, the number of successes and independent trials, each with success rate.

596
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:31,860
P What is the expected value or mean value of success is just that to multiply the number of trials and the success rate.

597
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:36,570
And that is exactly what this formula tells us.

598
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:44,550
And that gave us the mean value of successes out of this and trials and independent trials.

599
01:31:47,610 --> 01:31:54,140
Any questions? Okay.

600
01:31:54,470 --> 01:32:04,940
Nice example of coaching. Example assume a random variable and follows a kosher distribution which means it has these expression pdf

601
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:13,090
one over five times one over one plus x squared by x greater than negative infinity last night infinity,

602
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:20,210
in other words, in a real space. So what is the expectation of X?

603
01:32:23,870 --> 01:32:31,280
And by the way, for the previous example, we also didn't check the exportation of the absolute value of X and Y that.

604
01:32:36,010 --> 01:32:39,060
Yes. Positive access.

605
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:44,140
Positive, right. Access. Non-active. The support of access and non-active.

606
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:53,560
So there is no point of checking expectation of our total value of access because it's always going to be equal to that expectation of access.

607
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:57,040
If we can get a finite value for expectation of access.

608
01:32:57,580 --> 01:33:01,480
We know for sure that the expectations exist as that value.

609
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:07,270
And so that's why we didn't shy away from this example.

610
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:12,700
Access to the real space in Jonathan calculated expectation.

611
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:17,410
First, we need to check the expectations exist. Okay.

612
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:24,040
So instead of calculating expectation of at first calculating the expectation of access.

613
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:32,380
That's alright. And I'll give you 2 minutes, kind of write out this and say why this is.

614
01:34:47,670 --> 01:35:00,980
It's. She?

615
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:42,010
She's. Let's look at this together.

616
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:50,430
First, we need to check whether the expectations exist by calculating their segmentation of absolute value of X.

617
01:35:51,310 --> 01:35:56,860
So by definition, that's not going to be infinity to infinity, the true value of X times.

618
01:35:57,190 --> 01:36:09,190
This PDA may do the integration of that, and you plug in this PDA function, you will see that this said this is actually a symmetric function,

619
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:18,040
which means for mathematics and x is the same finally so that to simplify this

620
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:27,070
integration to be to over pi from zero to infinity x over one plus x squared x.

621
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:34,659
Right now, what is the original function part of this integration for this ax?

622
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:44,420
Over 1000 square. And now he's testing your knowledge in calculus,

623
01:36:45,230 --> 01:37:02,690
and you should be able to know that the original function is a log function of one plus x square right over to evaluate it from zero to infinity.

624
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:17,350
And that gives one infinity push log and infinity, that's infinity.

625
01:37:17,770 --> 01:37:21,100
Plugging in zero zero, you put it in -0.

626
01:37:21,430 --> 01:37:27,250
So what does that mean? There's no place.

627
01:37:27,670 --> 01:37:35,440
There's no expectation. Very good. Then we do not need to calculate the expectation, because just by definition, it doesn't exist.

628
01:37:36,670 --> 01:37:40,690
And that is actually not very intuitive. If you draw all this PDA.

629
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:51,160
And I tell you, it looks like a battleship. It's a very classical example of this culture.

630
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:56,800
These reviews and the PDA looks like a battleship, and it raised the maximum.

631
01:37:57,070 --> 01:38:04,990
And I think what a zero. And it's a symmetric function. I became two zero when I was approaching infinity or negative infinity.

632
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:09,700
So if you just look at this PDA, you may think, okay,

633
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:16,840
if I take the average of the random variables from this distribution, it should have a mean zero.

634
01:38:17,860 --> 01:38:29,380
That's absolutely right. But that's not the case. And the reason why that expectation doesn't exist is because the tail is actually

635
01:38:30,070 --> 01:38:34,240
having one that we mean by that is comparing to the normal distribution.

636
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:58,930
The draw. This last line, this arrived last night.

637
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:06,700
Is the PD out on the normal distribution? If you look at the tail of the normal distribution, a process to zero.

638
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:13,030
Very fast yellow was the probability of this normal random variables taking large amounts,

639
01:39:13,630 --> 01:39:23,650
either as far as positive or negative is very low in comparison, missed calls and distribution have a right to have a tail.

640
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:32,530
What that means is it has a relative, a much larger probability, taking those extreme values compared to the normal distribution.

641
01:39:33,670 --> 01:39:39,910
And the result is that if you randomly sample from this culture distribution,

642
01:39:40,540 --> 01:39:44,979
there is a very good chance that it will get a lot of extremely large numbers.

643
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:47,230
Either it's a large, positive or large nothing.

644
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:55,840
So let's say your sample 1000 point from this culture distribution and to calculate the average sample, those one solid points,

645
01:39:57,280 --> 01:40:05,740
this is not going to you know, it's not going to shrink to zero, but rather it could be anywhere because of those extreme values.

646
01:40:06,370 --> 01:40:13,780
And that is really why the expectation does not exist, because no matter how many points your sample from this kind of distribution,

647
01:40:14,290 --> 01:40:22,090
if you count by the mean, there is no guarantee that the mean going to shrink with zero, it can be anyway because of this outliers.

648
01:40:23,290 --> 01:40:28,120
Okay, so the having to really blow up this expectation.

649
01:40:28,330 --> 01:40:36,880
So the expectation for culture distribution does not exist even though the period looks symmetric it doesn't have a me.

650
01:40:37,510 --> 01:40:44,080
Okay so mean is not it is not just something that we can take for granted.

651
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:47,080
It depends on this calculation.

652
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:57,940
Always check the expected expected value for the absolute absolute random variable if it's less than infinity and exists otherwise it does not exist.

653
01:40:58,630 --> 01:41:04,640
Okay. Questions. All right.

654
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:12,320
So a couple of properties for the expectation expectation itself is is actually on

655
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:18,040
operation for amount of arable and it convert original out of arable to a number right.

656
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:27,260
If it exist. And this operation is actually a leaner operation in the sense that you've been asked to be a run a variable and I run a variable.

657
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:40,080
That's A, B and C to be called sense and tell you one on C to to be to functions of the rent a marvel whose expectations exist

658
01:41:41,190 --> 01:41:48,840
then we always have the final result as lies the expectation of this to you want access to to actually exist.

659
01:41:49,230 --> 01:41:57,059
We always have the following result a first as if you take the expectation of these linear combination of this g one accent.

660
01:41:57,060 --> 01:42:04,890
G To us it's the same as taking the linear combination of the expected about two and g2x.

661
01:42:07,740 --> 01:42:14,880
A leaner transformation can switch position with this expected expectation operation.

662
01:42:15,690 --> 01:42:21,750
And second, if t1x is always greater or equal to zero, then the expectation is always greater zero.

663
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:32,160
This is kind of intuitive. And third, if G1 acts as greater equality to us all, then the patient is always equal to.

664
01:42:32,820 --> 01:42:39,180
And finally, if 21x is always between A and B, then the patient is always between the AP.

665
01:42:40,590 --> 01:42:47,130
So these are four properties that defines the linearity of this expectation operation.

666
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:55,980
And the proof is, is, is sort of straight forward directly from this definition.

667
01:42:56,280 --> 01:43:00,840
For example, if I assume the roundabout was continuous, this transformations are continuous.

668
01:43:01,170 --> 01:43:06,580
We can express this expectation as the integration, right?

669
01:43:06,970 --> 01:43:26,300
The integration of a G1 X must be G2 X plus three times a pdf of x, whereas nothing affinity between finished.

670
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:35,400
That's the definition. Right now we know that for integration, this linear operation can be broken down.

671
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:45,700
So it's equivalent to saying that's a integration, but I'm not going back to the G1 X times.

672
01:43:46,530 --> 01:43:54,180
So that's the X plus B integration g2x.

673
01:43:55,940 --> 01:44:03,380
That's the Bronx was see integration of itself.

674
01:44:04,970 --> 01:44:10,430
So that's that's the property of the immigration and then we can easily say that they

675
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:16,130
integration is just expectation of g1x they see integration is expectation of G to us.

676
01:44:16,610 --> 01:44:23,149
And they say that tension is just one because it's just integrating the of itself and putting everything together.

677
01:44:23,150 --> 01:44:30,350
You got this on the right hand side. So the probe is really directly from this definition.

678
01:44:30,590 --> 01:44:36,709
Similarly, for the second one, you can also use the definition to write out this expectation of G.

679
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:42,080
One acts as the integration of g1xxx.

680
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:47,360
Yes, says G. Mars is always an actor, no matter how bad it's not.

681
01:44:47,450 --> 01:44:51,320
It's always known that it so that the creation is always not active.

682
01:44:54,400 --> 01:45:00,880
So that gave you a second property. And for the third and fourth, that can be implied from the second.

683
01:45:02,330 --> 01:45:13,840
So I'll leave the proof to you again, just one line of. So all I mean, all this theorem is about is the expectation operation is a cleanup operation.

684
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:21,730
If you do the linear transformation inside of the expectation, you can do the same thing outside of expectation.

685
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:28,090
That's what this is about. Okay. Questions.

686
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:37,560
All right. Last example, why expectation matters.

687
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:48,060
And the base example of I give you a rationale why expectation or memory actually is an important quantity.

688
01:45:48,660 --> 01:45:54,210
Suppose then you were asked to predict or I guess the value of a random variable from some distribution.

689
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:59,900
Okay. Given the distribution, given the CDF of a distribution.

690
01:46:00,390 --> 01:46:07,790
If I asked you to guess the value of any random variable taken from that distribution, what would be the capacitance?

691
01:46:10,890 --> 01:46:14,520
Well, we need to have some criteria in order to define what is best.

692
01:46:14,730 --> 01:46:21,980
And so the criteria is based on the distance between your cost and the actual value of the random variable.

693
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:31,380
And if I define a distance using the Euclidean distance, which is measured by this X minus B, assuming P is your gas,

694
01:46:31,620 --> 01:46:37,530
x is a value that is guess actually is that random variable from that distribution,

695
01:46:37,770 --> 01:46:44,370
it can measure the distance between your gas and the random variable using this equation distance X minus B square.

696
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:56,010
And we want to minimize the expectation of that of that distance for any acts of value in this distribution.

697
01:46:56,430 --> 01:47:01,140
What would be the value would be that actually minimize this expectation?

698
01:47:03,670 --> 01:47:07,420
The mean of us. That's why me is important.

699
01:47:07,570 --> 01:47:11,260
Let's say why men achieve the minimum.

700
01:47:11,630 --> 01:47:15,020
And then we got here.

701
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:19,790
The question is we want to find to minimize our of.

702
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:38,810
Of this. The amount upon which be actually minimized should see Artemis of this a spectator value at max minus B squared where acts follows.

703
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:44,100
I find myself x some given distribution. All right.

704
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:51,300
Well, let's take a look here to minimize this. First, let's break down this expectation.

705
01:47:52,200 --> 01:48:02,030
More specifically, a breakdown was inside the expectation that is equal to acts squared minus QB X.

706
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:21,150
Actually, I. The original expectation is equivalent to this point.

707
01:48:22,110 --> 01:48:30,870
I can plus and minus accounts where in this case I use the constant that is the mean of this distribution.

708
01:48:32,190 --> 01:48:38,250
If I write it that way, I have with this clause.

709
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:56,340
I can break down this square tremor into this three buttons.

710
01:48:57,910 --> 01:49:07,570
Recall that the expectation has linearity is a linear operation, so that means I can further break down into three terms.

711
01:49:27,130 --> 01:49:32,170
That's just because it is. The expectation is that Lena operate the Lena operation.

712
01:49:32,980 --> 01:49:39,070
So now let's look at these terms separately. First time doesn't have any to do with BE.

713
01:49:41,230 --> 01:49:46,180
There is no being in it. Right. Regardless how well gas is the first time always state.

714
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:55,089
It's always the same. Quantity is independent of B. We don't need to worry about it if we want to minimize this like the first time.

715
01:49:55,090 --> 01:49:58,140
That definitely has nothing to do with minimization. Okay.

716
01:49:58,900 --> 01:49:59,279
And the second.
