1
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:16,150
Just by nature of being alive, we can all relate to the situation where we have a family member or somebody that we love,

2
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,380
develop an illness and perhaps die well before their time.

3
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,050
When this happens, it is so understandable to ask the question of why them?

4
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:33,520
What was it about their particular experience or their particular genetic makeup that made them die much too young?

5
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,800
On the individual level, it's very hard to answer that question.

6
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,049
However, as epidemiologists,

7
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:52,990
we try and get information about this exact question by using populations where what we're looking for is asking why certain people become sick,

8
00:00:53,260 --> 00:01:02,830
whereas others do not. In effect, what we really want to know is whether or not some exposure is a cause of someone's disease.

9
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,050
Now, of course, because humans like to do what they want. We all have free will.

10
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:17,270
Studying people can be quite hard and knowing how to sample populations to get at these causal questions of

11
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:24,080
whether or not exposure causes an outcome is a key skill set that you have to learn as an epidemiologist.

12
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:33,560
Effectively, what we want to know is who you need to sample, what data you need to collect from people, and when you want to collect that data.

13
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:43,710
In this particular unit. We're going to talk through how you conduct studies to test associations between exposure and an outcome.

14
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,030
We'll start by talking about this notion of causality.

15
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,299
And I'll walk you through a framework that's called the counterfactual scenario that helps us to

16
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:00,360
ask the question of what would have happened to somebody if only their experience was different.

17
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:08,400
Well, then talk about how we use this counterfactual scenario to inform different study designs,

18
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:16,610
and we'll go through different study designs that are commonly used by epidemiologists in the context of those study designs.

19
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:24,990
We'll also talk about the different measures of association that we can get between exposures and outcomes by each type of design.

20
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:34,780
In the second part of this unit. To me, some of the very exciting components of this are really the most critical pieces,

21
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:44,290
as epidemiologists will talk through about how you look at other people's research or other people's reports and figure out what they did,

22
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:50,300
what type of design did they use to answer the question of if an exposure is related to an outcome,

23
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,190
and what are the potential strengths and weaknesses that come along with those designs?

24
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:05,450
Finally, I'll tell you about how you go through and select your own study design that's appropriate to address a certain research question.

25
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:13,040
Effectively, these two final pieces are what's really going to set you up to be a working epidemiologist in the world.
