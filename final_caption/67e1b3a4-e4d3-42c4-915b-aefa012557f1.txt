1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:10,020
Yeah, I think I. Yeah. I could have.

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,330
Yeah. I mean when I was pushing myself to watch.

3
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:20,410
Yeah. Because I have other stuff, you know, I think it was.

4
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,740
I know. Yeah. I don't even.

5
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,500
Oh, yeah, exactly. That's true.

6
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:52,510
But, I mean, it's. Yeah.

7
00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:00,560
I don't want to put in. I.

8
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,080
But yeah, it's.

9
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:19,909
Yeah. Right. Seems to me.

10
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,660
To me as I am.

11
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:30,310
Oh, yeah. Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

12
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,640
Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes.

13
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:39,500
I like it fully and with your minders at times.

14
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:48,330
Yeah. Yeah. I think that's what I like about it.

15
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,540
I don't think it's too much.

16
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,900
Luckily enough, the country has recruited us. Pretty anything though.

17
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:05,540
Our introduction. Really? Because I think.

18
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,950
Yeah, I think those are just because then my results were.

19
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:23,560
Oh yeah. I mean, yeah, it was just yeah, I know that in terms of involvement, I mean, I'm like, oh, great.

20
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:29,720
So we're going to I guess I'm going to give it another minute or so so other folks can filter in.

21
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,000
We're going to do class in two parts today. You can split yourself into two groups.

22
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,120
So it's kind of there. It's fun and we're going to old school.

23
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,159
This I know this is painful, but I'm going to ask you to close your computers.

24
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:55,610
We're just going to focus on the cases I'm showing you. So, like I said before, nothing on today's class.

25
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,570
There are some new things in today's class. None of that will be on your exam.

26
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,489
There are some cases that are somewhat similar to things that we talked about, so it'll be nice practice,

27
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:09,440
particularly for the history interpretation because it's different pictures than you've seen before.

28
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:16,940
So when I ask you to do is just concentrate on the histo that you see on the board and try to interpret from that.

29
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,950
Okay, so it'd be good practice for what you're doing on the exam.

30
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:30,080
Um, so none of the new weird stuff is going to be on your test as far as housekeeping things are.

31
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,700
Exam for this class is next Friday. Let's see.

32
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,839
So it is the the long period of time.

33
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,650
So I'm giving you from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. It's on canvas.

34
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,300
It's open book just like the midterm was. So it's a little bit more constricted time period.

35
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,980
But similarly, the exam is designed to really take about 2 hours.

36
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:58,580
You know, depending you can take longer. But the period of time that it will be open will be from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.

37
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,670
So you can do just like you did on the midterm. I go through it fast.

38
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:07,070
Do the ones, you know, look stuff up, go back to it, take a little bit longer than 2 hours, you know,

39
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,189
to take the whole period of time if you want to, although I don't advise it because you're just going to start changing things.

40
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,760
That's right. And then it will close for a bit.

41
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:21,830
You can submit it when you're done or it will close for availability and automatically submit at 10 p.m. that night.

42
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:27,080
Okay. I have a couple of people I've talked to who had arrangements to take it on a different day,

43
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,620
and so those are deal with that individually, but it will be available next week, Friday.

44
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,849
And I think what I'm going to do, the Panopto will be recording.

45
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,370
So I think I'm going to show up here and give instructions.

46
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:47,120
You're welcome to come here to get that instruction for the last hurrah or do that on the Panopto, I guess.

47
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,639
Yeah, if I don't do Panopto if I do zoom, it won't in the Panopto.

48
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,560
So I'm just going to keep doing that. But so I will be here at 10 a.m. to give instructions.

49
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,020
It should be pretty self-explanatory and then I'm going to be obsessively checking my phone throughout that period of time.

50
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:09,800
So if you run to some problem that campus crashes, it submits it weirdly or some weirdness happens,

51
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,060
you know, email me, contact me right away so we can figure out what that is.

52
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:14,930
Okay.

53
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:25,130
And as far as preparing for it, I would suggest that you use the quizzes, use your, you know, review sheets where there are where they are available.

54
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,940
That should stress for you what the main points are.

55
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,479
And remember that there's partial credit all over the place.

56
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,390
So, you know, if you short circuit can't identify the organ and just get the process right, you'll get partial credit for that.

57
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,520
So don't get too panicky about it. Okay. Any questions about the final?

58
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,140
Yes, I'm sorry. It's a little bit shorter than the midterm.

59
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:58,070
It is because. Yeah, it is because there is a less sort of long pathogenesis explaining mechanism me type questions.

60
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:05,150
Don't forget the structure function lectures because there are some questions that are just based on how this organ functions.

61
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:11,240
So don't forget the keys on the structure function. But those should all be I mean, some of them you have to write a little bit, but it's short.

62
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,570
Shorter answer. Does that make sense? Okay. Yeah.

63
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,720
It's based on previous like style wise, previous exams that I've given,

64
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,250
which seem to have fit well into this sort of shorter time structure framework.

65
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,180
Okay. All right. Any other questions about the final?

66
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,200
So I will be here next week, briefly to record instructions.

67
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:37,390
You're welcome to come. And otherwise it should be pretty self-explanatory.

68
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:43,390
Other stuff for just end of semester. So that's the ninth. And then once you're done with that, you'll be done to be great.

69
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,800
The evaluations reports as I believe they are open now and they're open until the 11th of December.

70
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:58,180
You know, feel free to like concentrate on getting everything done. If you don't want to worry about that until after the final is done.

71
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:04,750
But I do encourage you to fill out those evaluations, both for this class and for those of you in 717.

72
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,870
I don't none of your instructors get to see any evaluations until after grades are submitted after the whole semester is done.

73
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,760
So don't worry about that. It's all anonymous. I do look at them every year.

74
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,910
It's very helpful to kind of get some perspective. I tweak stuff for the class every single year.

75
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:23,140
So, you know, if you have things that worked for you, things that didn't work.

76
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,120
So suggestions are helpful. So, you know, just like a path description justified.

77
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:34,960
If you think the class soft, you have to say it's up because so it's helpful if you can give specifics,

78
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,860
you know, in the comment section for things that worked well and things that didn't.

79
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:45,730
So I do encourage you those are up until December 11th for both this class and of your in 717 for that one as well.

80
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,710
Okay. All right. So here's some loser.

81
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,720
Okay. So we're. Yeah.

82
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,790
All right. That's the way it's going to work. Has sort of a structure.

83
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:06,139
Kind of works differently every year. But we're going to try to do two teams.

84
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:14,000
So probably we're Margaret sitting and we're at Amber sitting as one team over there.

85
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,820
And then Rachel, everybody on the side will be on another team.

86
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,360
It helps if you guys have like, I don't know, you want to make up a nice name of your team, pick your favorite cell.

87
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,340
Otherwise, you want to be a cell type or whatever. Team one, the team two.

88
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,979
And we're going to do some cases.

89
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,510
Like I said, some of them will be new,

90
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:41,540
some of them will be things will be a little bit helpful for the exam in terms of reviewing what you had before.

91
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:51,920
I'm asking that during his the puzzle. You guys have your computers closed just so that we can focus on what we're seeing on the screen.

92
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,990
Okay. So here's how it works. Each case is a series of questions.

93
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,050
It can be sort of group, sort of individual.

94
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:04,580
The team who answers the first question correctly gets to stick with that question and try to get credit for it.

95
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:10,160
If your team misses the question, a whole series. If you miss a question, it bounces to the other team.

96
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,520
And if they miss, the same question goes back to you.

97
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:20,000
The key is that time a different person on your team has to be the answer so you can confer amongst each other,

98
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,900
but a different person has to answer so we don't have one person playing for the entire team.

99
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:31,219
If you guys missed it again, we go to the next question and the point here is where you can steal the points for each case.

100
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,350
Go to the team that gets the final question. Right.

101
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,899
So if you guys get all the questions right below the last one and this team steals, you guys get the point.

102
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,980
Look at that. It's really it's just system live.

103
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,639
The winning team gets first pick of our fabulous prizes. There's enough for everybody.

104
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,030
Don't worry about it and please. Okay. All right.

105
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,359
This is what we're going to do today. We're going to try to get through.

106
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,970
I press I have some other ones that I crossed out because I realized that too much stuff in there because I get overexcited about his stuff palooza.

107
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,469
But we have a case that relates to behavioral alterations in marine mammals.

108
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,730
There were a lot of people interested in like marine stuff this year,

109
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:11,000
so I've tried to find some stuff like that and I just had a weird species sudden death,

110
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,340
sudden death in kangaroos in a zoological institution, we have forgetfulness and lethargy,

111
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,430
and in aged baboons you can already start thinking about what could be going on.

112
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,719
I do. Have I hid the slides. If we have time at the end, I'll show you.

113
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,920
But those pictures that have been on our campus home page all semester are pathologic lesions.

114
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,420
In case you guys are wondering about them.

115
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:38,390
I have a weird animal that is I have some comparative presentation for all the repro fans in the room and then finally, some human pathology.

116
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:47,510
All right, so let's give it a try. Okay, here's our first case. This case relates to abnormal behavior in in marine mammals.

117
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:54,710
So in sea lions, otters or dolphins. So here we have a poor sea lion that was found on a beach who's showing some neurologic abnormalities.

118
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:59,000
This is a behavioral posture called upper starkness, so they lose their balance.

119
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:04,339
He's having some difficulty swallowing. He's having a lot of difficulties. This is an otter being treated.

120
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:09,290
This is an order that was stranded another and that's the ties them and they're drawn blood trying to treat him.

121
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,680
So these are marine mammals that are having difficulties. Okay.

122
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:19,520
So here's our first question. So we have anyone from any team can answer a unfixed tissue from a sea otter.

123
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:29,150
There is the normal, here is the abnormal. And I want some just to name the process this jump up wherever it goes to your team first.

124
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:39,350
So name the process anyone can you want him to shout out grab it for your team.

125
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:47,810
All right, team to the first one. You are correct and I'm clear out.

126
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,010
All right, everyone. So this is the brain. I hope everybody got that far.

127
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,190
This was the brain I gave you big hint, because they're showing behavioral things.

128
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,180
And we didn't really talk too much about meninges when we talked about the brain.

129
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,270
But there's reddening and it's if you were able to cut into this brain, you could see it's mostly on the surface, but there's hemorrhage in his brain.

130
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:10,280
So start off. Nice, simple. Hey, do you want to start with prize? Do you want a food or a non non-food items?

131
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:15,230
Amira, would you like a private? Okay, I'll make sure this is as fair as possible.

132
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:24,020
Yeah. All right. All right, here we go. So we're going to stick with you guys, but if you blow it because you guys, so make sure you concentrate.

133
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,850
So here's fixed tissue from a sea lion, a different animal, but it's the same toxicant.

134
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:34,370
And I'm looking for you to name the gross finding. So one word only.

135
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:39,980
So I helped you a little bit because this is fixed brain, this is the hippocampus, and this is the normal animal.

136
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,250
And something is different. Something is different in this picture.

137
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,839
And so we're looking for it. So team one, talk amongst yourself, get your answer.

138
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,920
A team to talk amongst yourselves and a different person has to give the answer.

139
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:59,010
Let's see a little bit. Something's here. I'm looking for a word to describe that.

140
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:06,020
If you can't remember the word and you can describe sort of the process I might take.

141
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:12,590
I don't know if you can't remember the word. It could describe sort of the process, give it a shot.

142
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:23,400
Seem to. All right.

143
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,800
I said to you two, you can't have a good cavitation.

144
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,150
All right, look at that. It's to stick with it. So that's it.

145
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:39,090
All right. Do you remember what happened? Like what? Why is there is this hole, this cavitation, what happened here?

146
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:45,480
Can you do that? You're on that? Yeah. Yeah. So neurons died. And so this is a pretty big area of neuronal death.

147
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,320
Right. So first you get that rarer faction, just little holes in the tissue.

148
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,130
And if enough of that is there and the macrophages have cleared it out, you get an actual hole.

149
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:57,510
And remember, if it's small, it's just rough action.

150
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,630
Glial cells can come in and scar that down.

151
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:07,020
If it's a big area, you'll end up with Leo cysts around the edges of it and you'll still have that hole remaining.

152
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:13,050
It'll just fill with CSF and the deficits that remain depend on where that is and how big of a region it is.

153
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:18,570
Okay. So that was kind of the end result of previous neuronal death cavitation.

154
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,519
And that's kind of a gross term, right?

155
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:27,900
And gross meaning seeing with your naked eye and the cavitation just refers to a large area where there's been a normal loss.

156
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,490
Okay. Good luck to you, too. Do you want to? Okay. You can steal this at the end.

157
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:37,450
All right. So I'm going to show you a slide here. But this is sort of the prep to the slide.

158
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:41,010
So this is also tissue from a C line, same toxicant.

159
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,339
I've already kind of told you. I told you you didn't have to know parts of the brain,

160
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:51,190
but this is the hippocampus and all the different letters and for particular neuronal clusters in the hippocampus.

161
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:55,850
So this gives you a sense of what the normal one should look like. This is the affected animal.

162
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:01,110
This is the same magnification. Okay. So you look at that for a second.

163
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:10,550
So that's from an actual case. This is from experimental rats, a little bit better photo micrograph, same toxicant in an experimental administration.

164
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,350
So you can see the cellulari a little bit better. So it's normal and abnormal.

165
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,080
So you can kind of get a sense because what this is going to be,

166
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:25,300
I'm going to show you a slide and we're going to do a short description and then name the main lesion.

167
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,590
Okay. Experimental rats. Last view. Okay.

168
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:36,510
So I'm going to show you, I don't have a histo of slide of the rat or the sea lion, but I have a very similar lesion in a cat.

169
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,890
All right. So we're going to try this slide. Hopefully, this will refresh.

170
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:46,950
So this is from a cat. This is kind of a beat up section, but we're going to focus in.

171
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:54,870
Is it working? Yeah. This is the hippocampus. And so this can be a little bit harder because I don't have a normal next to it.

172
00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:01,110
Seem to kind of remember. So this is the hippocampus. I'm going to try to go a little bit closer and closer.

173
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:08,430
I'm going to drive around a little bit and then I'm going to ask for a short description and then the main morphologic finding.

174
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:16,050
All right. So but you look at the middle of the hippocampus there, then we're going to drive a little closer.

175
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:31,810
It doesn't like it when I refresh to where I go to fast. They're thinking about what those rats, experimental rats look like.

176
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,299
I'll probably zoom in here as we have some more stuff. All right.

177
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,850
I'm going to zoom in one more me, see if I have. All right.

178
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,300
So the first thing, remember, we're going to do big to small, right?

179
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:53,590
So, you know, this is the brain. You know, this is the hippocampus. I'm going to leave it there because it's easier than keep zooming.

180
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,700
Well, maybe a little one more. Well, keep zooming in and out.

181
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:00,570
But what? Thinking back to those rat images, I'm looking for a description.

182
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:05,700
Big picture. When you looked at low magnification, what did you notice was different about the hippocampus?

183
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:12,120
So big picture sentence and then tell me the detail based on perhaps what we see in this image.

184
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,200
It's a team, too. It's still with you. But team one. This is where things get difficult.

185
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,900
So get ready to steal. Who has a big picture sentence thinking about those rat images?

186
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,710
Remember, pathology is something added, something lost, something changed.

187
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,320
Big picture symptoms are the results.

188
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,910
You will see the Little Mac again, but it's not as much as I.

189
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:43,800
Here is the low. Matt, do you want to do your sentence off the low? Matt. What is different?

190
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,600
If you were just telling me about this tension versus that issue.

191
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:55,100
All right, time's a wastin. You guys get about 5 seconds. More big picture sentence.

192
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,710
Five more seconds. All right, give it a shot.

193
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,160
So there's. There's an increased cellulari. Where?

194
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:10,070
In the dig area. Like in the party.

195
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:16,970
Okay. That is an excellent attempt at a description.

196
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:25,000
And I can see where at this low magnification I of feel sorry that I went back to this image,

197
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:31,900
but thinking with the other image I showed you and with the overall size of the tissue,

198
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,250
I am sorry to have to tell your team, too, that that is incorrect. All right.

199
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,910
So we're going to pop over to Team One and see what they can contribute. What do you think about the big picture?

200
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,000
Let's use this image. Don't worry, you can get it back.

201
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:50,200
Do you have a big picture sentence to describe what's different about this tissue, the abnormal one versus that one?

202
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,700
I think also that all of this is related to these images.

203
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:01,330
So what do you think is happening? Big picture sentence.

204
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:14,280
There is more cells in one area. Just so you know that. But remember, we have something that like this.

205
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,620
All right, team one, you've got 5 seconds to come up with a descriptive big picture sentence.

206
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:29,340
I don't have one. I just want them to start with one sentence and jump off the fence.

207
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:38,470
Increased competition in the race. And I'm going to have to not take that because we've already done cavitation.

208
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:43,080
I'm looking for something. Right. One more shot. I'm looking for something about Cellulari.

209
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,130
I simply want to say, hey, don't worry about that.

210
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:55,610
Let me go back to the slide. This is what it was like.

211
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:01,950
Here, I'll show you a little bit. This is the other side. This is the other side, guys.

212
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:08,280
This is of this is a little bit more normal than the here's the most affected side.

213
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:15,150
So think about what tissue this is and what should be there. A little higher.

214
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:21,870
Another shot? Or do you guys want to skip? You can skip that big picture sentence if you want to say something more detail.

215
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,650
And we'll just call that picture a sentence. No, no. Start with type.

216
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:34,870
I just want to sit back out.

217
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,010
So remember what the hippocampus looked like in the normal.

218
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:50,640
And this is what it looks like here. All right, but five more seconds seem to make your choice.

219
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:56,400
If you want to try another big picture sentence or you want to say something about these individual cells.

220
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:02,399
Yes, I think that there is like a friendly elephant.

221
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,880
You like something, right. To figure out. And he is like they're they're all consistently small.

222
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:13,950
All right. What do you think? Increase or decrease?

223
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:21,870
Something changed and it can't be subtle again because he answered the first one and oh, it's on me.

224
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:29,430
No, no, no, it's not. Because you did your you did somebody else. It was more routine, like increased vocalization.

225
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:35,330
Okay, I'll take that. It's actually kind of a little bit of an indirect way.

226
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:40,590
What if there's increased vocalization? Like, what does that usually mean in the nervous system?

227
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:46,030
Why is there vacuoles there? What was there before? Cell, the brain cells.

228
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:51,580
Yeah, there were neurons. Yeah. So when I was trying to get everybody to say was that there is decreased cellular needs,

229
00:21:51,630 --> 00:22:00,510
decreased neuronal cellulari and you can see that in you can actually infer that by the decreased size and at low magnification,

230
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:08,070
like in this animal, you can hardly tell. You can see this stripe, but you can't see like the dark wine that you saw in the normal tissue.

231
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,920
So there's decreased secularity in sort of the areas of the hippocampus where there is neuronal density.

232
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:21,360
So and you see that both by knowing this is hard because I didn't give you a normal next to it, by knowing the normal cellular parity.

233
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,890
And then, as Bernie pointed out, when a neuron drops out, there's going to be a vacuum left to space.

234
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:34,400
Right. So we had the cavitation, which was the big space. This might become capitated, you know, if there's enough damage here.

235
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:37,590
So this could be the beginning of one of those big spaces.

236
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:45,710
Okay. So now we need to say something about the cells in the area of decreased cellulari so we know there should be neurons here.

237
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:52,570
So now I'm looking for with team to still we're looking for a sentence about what is different about these cells.

238
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,850
I'm terrible at scoring for this.

239
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:06,040
I think all of those are nuclei. That's true.

240
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:15,450
Yeah, they are. But what's the Friday in your time, right? I don't know if it's Friday or if it's is done because there's multiple three.

241
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:23,480
Can we get a higher magnification on that looking just like you might be at Max right now.

242
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:27,950
Oh, no, I don't have electron microscopy, so don't worry.

243
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,670
There's a lot of cells here that look similarly. There's the fried egg looking things and then there's these guys.

244
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:43,100
So sort of pick one of those that, you know what it or you have a good idea what it is and that hopefully centrally

245
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,540
related or like pertains to what we just said about decreased cellulari.

246
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,250
All right. You got about five more seconds before team one can try to steal.

247
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:58,930
Can we see that? There's no foam looking up, folks.

248
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:08,540
Okay. So do you have the these slides but the answers and then.

249
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:11,900
Yeah, afterwards, I think I think.

250
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,740
All right. What do you think, team two? Who do we have left?

251
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,840
Whoever. I don't like people.

252
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,070
People may be wrong, but we are connecting with them.

253
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:27,920
Okay, so tell me when I hit the cell that you're talking about that one like these?

254
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:31,700
Yeah. All right. So. All right, tell me more. There's a condensed nucleus.

255
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:38,569
And what anything else about that cell you want to mention so it can pick gnosis means condensed nucleus.

256
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:43,060
What about the rest of the cell? Yeah.

257
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:48,320
Pinker. Pinker? Well, who is your spokesperson? Your finger is redder.

258
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,600
Yeah. Okay. So Tepper is in a field and it's condensed nucleus.

259
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:55,450
So what is your conclusion about that? So you got to tell me what kind of cell you think it is, too.

260
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,040
It's hyper eosinophilic with a condensed nucleus. It's in the hippocampus.

261
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:06,550
It's dying, is undergoing the process and it's not undergoing the process.

262
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:13,520
Okay. And what kind of cell is it most likely? Audience.

263
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:20,650
Oh, get ready for the SEAL team. 155 seconds.

264
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,670
No, it isn't, Duran. All right.

265
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,920
Red dead. Remember? Red is dead in your arms.

266
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:32,020
It's shrunken. It looks like a pyramid. It's angular.

267
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:38,410
It has red cytoplasm. It has a condensed nucleus. So this is harder because all of these cells are of Nora.

268
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,680
These are a ton of red dead neurons in here.

269
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:49,160
So zero necrosis. We already heard that. There are usually if I were doing this, there's decreased cellular regularity in the affected area.

270
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,930
The neurons are shrunken red, angular, consistent with necrosis.

271
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,660
Then I would probably say something about my. There is also sentence.

272
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:01,810
There is also the population in the adjacent area. What do you guys this wasn't one of the questions I asked you,

273
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:09,280
but what do you guys think about some of these cells and this if we can find mice, what happens once you have neuronal necrosis, we find.

274
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:15,010
Do you remember that sequence that we talked about? The sequence of things that happens and neuron is dying and then what happens?

275
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:21,639
We found a device. Let me let answer. Yeah, let's just this just anybody settle in terms of satellite ptosis?

276
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,840
Very good. And what like what is happening there? There was a really good area that I'm going to try to find.

277
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,560
What is happening there? What do you mean? Like, what is that? Oh, here's a good one.

278
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,480
Oops. Come on. Look at this table to eat. Yeah, yeah.

279
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,220
Look at it. Look at these real well. These are probably astrocytes.

280
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,810
And the problem, this is not quite dead yet.

281
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:48,040
So they're probably like, I'm trying to help you neuron trying to support it by acting as a metabolic sink for anything toxic in there.

282
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:54,129
But if that neuron dies, the micro glial cells are going to come in and phagocytosis it it's going to be gone.

283
00:26:54,130 --> 00:27:00,700
And then you get the holes that we had in the other area, and then the astrocytes are going to expand their processes and fill in that area.

284
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:05,880
So neurology generation around the cell death, glial cells, accumulation wheels,

285
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:10,750
microbial cell phagocytosis, clean up cells of the body and then scarring.

286
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,610
So in this picture, which one is other neuron and which one are astrocytes?

287
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,479
It gets harder once there's damage. So this is like a real slide.

288
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,630
This is the neuron. It's starting to shrink up and die.

289
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:28,090
And then the little cells gathered at the table. These are reactive astrocytes.

290
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,880
Okay. So they're bigger than they would ordinarily be.

291
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:38,000
So over in this collection on the what is it, left side of the screen, like our left or my side?

292
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:41,379
No, no, sorry. Over here, it's like a lot of dense. Oh, yeah.

293
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:45,460
Those are all neurons. These are all. Well, the ones.

294
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:50,050
Most of these are neurons. There undoubtedly are some glial cells around it.

295
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:56,050
That's another good point for pathology is like you have to focus on the big picture.

296
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,850
Like there's a lot the big picture here is there's neuronal necrosis, there's a lot of necrotic neurons.

297
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:08,590
You see that happening. I would expect there also to be an increased glial cells cellulari because they're responding to that.

298
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:17,200
So it's less important to be able to point a finger and identify every single one of these cells than to identify the overall process that's going on.

299
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:23,620
And so these are neuronal necrosis like this is probably we'll sell this is product yourself, but like these are neurons.

300
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:27,850
So you can recognize the big picture, red dead neurons.

301
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,190
Okay. There's also another type of cell death in here that was a little bit less obvious.

302
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:37,150
These cells with the foamy cytoplasm are probably macrophages.

303
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:44,860
So those are probably the micro glial cells that are fantastically active and they're just phagocytes, housing, all that dendritic debris.

304
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:51,940
This red round thing is a spheroid, which is a swollen axon, if I can find Oh, there it is.

305
00:28:52,540 --> 00:29:00,040
So this also looks kind of this looks like it might almost be the other type of neuronal cell death that some will damage first.

306
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,130
And you have chromatin lysis, which was a swollen red cell.

307
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,530
That's where it's just dying a little bit slower.

308
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:11,709
But the take home point here is that there is neuronal necrosis, cell death, and that's what's causing the rare infection.

309
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:19,960
That's what's causing the cavitation. And the animal is having signs because it's losing all those neurons in the hippocampus.

310
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:25,650
All right. So let's see what this was. All right. So we had a marine mammal.

311
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:32,530
Oh, no, I don't mean to do that. We have marine mammals with behavioral signs.

312
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:36,620
We saw that they have. Okay.

313
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:40,069
So this was my description. So this is all in the presentation.

314
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:50,840
If you look at that, this was neuronal necrosis in the hippocampus and this was this is marine mammal, neurologic symptoms.

315
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:56,730
And here's a little hint. So anyone know what this is? Never heard of this.

316
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:01,080
I'll give you another hit, Inhumans. This happens as well.

317
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,950
And it's called amnesia. Like amnesia. Amnesia.

318
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:10,389
Amnesia. Shellfish disease. Never heard of this.

319
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:13,690
Great. Was it like this? Yeah, it's a toxin.

320
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:18,080
So I'm looking for this person. It's not a parasite, right?

321
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,170
It looks like it. All right. Is it a raisin? No, it's okay.

322
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,220
So, protein. These are.

323
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,430
That looks like a. This is a red algae that grows in that.

324
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,440
It's like a marine algae that is a diatom, which is little microscopic organism.

325
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:40,550
And both of these organisms can produce a toxin called domoic acid.

326
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:46,670
Red Tide Story Lab should have known this. Okay.

327
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,700
So this is good because, like, you probably heard about this toxin.

328
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,790
Now you're looking from the other side, from the pathology side, you put it together a little bit.

329
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:57,620
So this is a naturally occurring neurotoxin made by marine diatoms and red algae.

330
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,710
And there are many species, a couple of different species that can produce it.

331
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:10,370
It's toxicity comes from the fact that domoic acid is a structural analog of glutamate, which is a major CNS excitatory neurotransmitter.

332
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:18,670
Okay, so there's another kind of experimental youth compound called Unique Acid, which is used to study this, but this is glutamic acid or glutamate.

333
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,970
So here's the structure of glutamate. Look how the left hand side of this molecule's basically the same.

334
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:31,730
So it can bind to glutamate receptors. It is important because it can accumulate in food webs.

335
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:35,810
So it's made by the diatoms in the algae. They can get into sediment.

336
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,600
And then all of that, the diatoms, the algae, the sediment that's contaminated gets eaten by shellfish.

337
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:48,290
We like shellfish, otters and things like shellfish, too. So the larger animals get demolished.

338
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:57,880
Acid toxicity by eating the shellfish. And the preponderance or the prevalence of domoic acid is related to harmful algal blooms.

339
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:01,460
So when conditions are right that these organisms can overpopulate,

340
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,139
that also has favorable conditions for them to produce increased levels of the toxin.

341
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,490
They don't produce it all the time.

342
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:15,410
And then you have these sentinel events where you start seeing increased strandings in marine mammals in the affected area,

343
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:22,820
and humans who eat shellfish that is contaminated with well, that contains domoic acid can also be affected.

344
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:30,770
So that's the amnesic shellfish disease. And as the name implies, it causes you to have some memory loss, usually pretty short term, usually recover.

345
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:37,520
But the effect is due to effect on the hippocampus and the toxicity of it, if you are severely affected,

346
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:44,060
is related to the reliance of the hippocampus on glutamate as an excitatory neurotransmitter.

347
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,329
So this is related to those algal blooms. This was in 2015.

348
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:54,680
There was a large algae bloom in the west coast of the US and that was associated with a huge number of marine stranding events.

349
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:03,380
And so this is also thought to be a problem related to climate change because warmer temperatures and increased rainfall,

350
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:08,240
you can have runoff from agricultural pesticides.

351
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,850
So increased nitrates in the water, algae likes nitrates and that can contribute to algal blooms.

352
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:22,450
Okay. So as far as the cytotoxicity, it's related to domoic acid interactions that both the pre and postsynaptic neurons.

353
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:26,690
So remember we had a diagram similar to this that's important for your structure function.

354
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:33,290
So both pre and post synaptic neurons have colonic acid or carbonate receptors.

355
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:41,180
The green thing here and domoic acid can actually trigger depolarization by binding to those kinetic acid receptors.

356
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,690
So they're showing domoic acid in green. Here, it's binding and it causes an influx of sodium, which is depolarization.

357
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,299
And remember when we talked about the synapse,

358
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:58,070
we said as the action potential reaches the terminal button and depolarize it, you have voltage gated calcium channels.

359
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:02,930
So sodium comes in, changes the voltage, calcium gets released.

360
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:08,960
So that domoic acid depolarization triggers in voltage gated calcium influx.

361
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,440
So they're drawing calcium in red here. So calcium is coming in.

362
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:18,049
And that signal that calcium influx triggers release of glutamate,

363
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:23,540
which is the excitatory neurotransmitter, which is it's released by a vesicle binding to the membrane.

364
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,719
They didn't really draw that very well here. So now glutamate is released.

365
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,330
That's excitatory, right? Both, too.

366
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:35,570
So this is an excitatory neurotransmitter and it has a number of different receptors on the postsynaptic neuron.

367
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,769
Both domoic acid and glutamate can actually bind.

368
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:46,400
NMDA receptor is so an excitatory receptor for excitatory neurotransmitters on the postsynaptic neuron.

369
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,400
And that in turn triggers calcium influx.

370
00:34:50,780 --> 00:35:00,620
And then the unfortunate thing is that usually glutamate binds and then after a time it'll detach and it gets taken up by receptors on astrocytes.

371
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,740
So it has like an astrocyte sync that can be sent back to the neuron.

372
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:08,450
Domoic acid doesn't really detach, so it doesn't detach as readily,

373
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:15,350
so it prolongs the action potential by persistently binding the receptor and that preserves that calcium signaling.

374
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:23,739
And further it also blocks a glutamate receptor because it just looks like glutamate, an uptake receptor on the astrocytes.

375
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:30,160
So the net effect is both due to domoic acid binding and to the prolonged presence of glutamate.

376
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:39,040
In the synapse, you have prolonged action potential and that triggers so excitatory neurotransmitters.

377
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,940
You have receptors down to increase calcium inside the cell.

378
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:51,440
And just like we learned at the beginning part of the class, increased intracellular calcium triggers, both necrotic pathways.

379
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:58,060
You have enzyme activation and it can be a signal to the through the mitochondria to trigger apoptosis.

380
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:05,770
So it's the prolonged glutamate signaling and the resulting increase in intracellular calcium that kills the neuron through cytotoxicity.

381
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:12,730
Yes. Is that why we saw the length of the one cell in the histone pages had that really swollen axon?

382
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:17,620
Yeah. So the swollen axon, things like the neuron, that's just part of the neuron.

383
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:24,100
So whenever a cell swells like it's progressing towards death by a necrotic pathway, the cell is going to swell.

384
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:27,550
So that's just swelling that part of the cell, the axon.

385
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:35,469
Yeah. So that is domoic acid just, you know, auto that otter he made it has been released here.

386
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:39,940
So happy ending. It's astonishing to me like how big orders are.

387
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:45,520
Like, you think they're kind of cute little furry things, but they're quite loud. All right, let's do another case.

388
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:50,140
Here's your memory. Kangaroo. These tissues were were from one.

389
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:54,309
There's going to be a couple of tissues, one of several kangaroos that died in a zoo,

390
00:36:54,310 --> 00:37:02,440
a logic exhibit in Texas over a period of four days after an acute event that I'm not telling you there is no previous history of disease.

391
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:06,280
So I'm going to show you three organs. You have to identify the organs.

392
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,930
It's going to be good practice and then give. We're just going to concentrate on process.

393
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:14,170
So Morphologic diagnosis concentrated mostly on the process.

394
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:20,320
Okay. I have the slides fill up hopefully. Uh, I think it's a.

395
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:26,820
Okay. All right. So there's lots of pieces here. Tissues from a kangaroo.

396
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:30,630
Unusual species. All right, let's start with this thing.

397
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:35,250
So, first job. You know where we are now.

398
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,970
Domoic acid. Nobody got. Let's give team one a chance.

399
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:44,249
Or actually, whoever can identify this first. All right, get ready. The organ first.

400
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,940
Organ, liver. Good. All right, team one kind of your team.

401
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,320
All right, it's liver.

402
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:58,379
Okay, so I'm going to drive you around a little bit, so I'm gonna show you some areas, and then I'm going to kind of settle in one area.

403
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,440
I'm going to ask you to identify the major process.

404
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:06,630
All right. So low mag. So it's liver. So it's a solid organ.

405
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,670
And probably what helps you identify it is you can see that there are structures.

406
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:18,360
This is a little bit different. This has a little bit more connective tissue around it. But this is a bile duct and this is also very altered.

407
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:22,650
But it is liver. Okay. So here's the edge.

408
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,920
This is the capsule of the liver. And then we have something that looks kind of different here.

409
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,560
And we're going to zoom in and look at that. And then we have the rest of it, which looks kind of like this.

410
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:37,250
I'm gonna zoom. Whoops. Come on. Refresh the mind.

411
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:45,230
Yeah. All right, let's let it refresh. It's nasty.

412
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:54,720
All right. So, team one, I'm looking for you to tell me which half of this is the most affected area and what is the major process going on?

413
00:38:55,290 --> 00:39:04,560
Ooh. All right. It has to be somebody with an answer before confirm and just team one.

414
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:10,230
Our team two, you guys can feel it. All right, so which side is more affected?

415
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:16,340
Think about cell changes. We talked about the very beginning about basic cell changes.

416
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:23,430
Nuclear changes. I'll go a little higher. Yeah.

417
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,740
Well, let me go higher. Let's see. Can we ask your question?

418
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,550
Let's see what they come up with. Yeah. You want to help them? All right.

419
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:41,310
You got about five more seconds to decide which side is more affected and what is the major change present?

420
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:49,860
All right. Name. Got a name? A spokesperson, someone who hasn't answered a question.

421
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:58,380
I think the right is more like their side or your side.

422
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,480
You think this is more affected? Hmm. Oh, team one.

423
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:11,070
All right, so we may come back to you. There's, like, two other organs.

424
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:15,510
Tim Two? Well, by default, we now know that this side is more effective.

425
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:19,580
Yeah. What do you think is the message? Keep.

426
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:22,830
Keep with it. What do you think is the major problem going on here?

427
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:26,220
I need somebody who has not answered before on your team to be your spokesperson.

428
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:32,850
And you have because you've got a lot of time to look at this. You have only about 5 seconds before it swings back to team one.

429
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:39,390
He's like Tarzan. This is 5 seconds.

430
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:44,280
You don't know who's left, who is not.

431
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,389
Answer the question on the Steve. All right.

432
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:54,210
I need an answer. Yes, go. Is it? Every hemorrhage is one of them, so I will give you that.

433
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,290
There is another change in the cells.

434
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,440
There's no there's there's hemorrhage that's spilling out of the capillaries.

435
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,650
There's another change in the cells themselves and the hepatocytes themselves.

436
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,430
Color nuclear changes. Yeah.

437
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:18,930
Um, you know, they have to blow it first. Well, we only have one who's left.

438
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:25,530
We have. Do we have somebody who's answered every question? All right, 5 seconds.

439
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,660
No. All right, let's just go back to the one. Yeah.

440
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,770
Is that a morphologic? I need the process not just to color genes.

441
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:40,010
What does that mean? I can paint her picture.

442
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,340
I'm sorry. I have to see one here. See what I'm.

443
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:49,120
What's going on with these cells? You're thinking hypnotic. What is the process?

444
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:53,280
What does that mean? Morphologic diagnosis. Necrosis.

445
00:41:53,400 --> 00:42:03,460
Yeah. All right. So what? Remember, a process is the morphologic diagnosis, hyper eosinophilia, condensed nucleus.

446
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:08,370
Those are all descriptor descriptors that tell you that the cell is dead.

447
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:13,830
So here, this wasn't a parasite, but there was no nucleus to be found.

448
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:17,970
These cells are still pretty altered, but there are still nuclei present.

449
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:23,520
Okay. So these were hepatocytes. There are some nuclei here, but they're all shrunken.

450
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:27,060
Some of them are blood cells and they're all shrunken into the side.

451
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,980
Okay. These are swollen, hyper eosinophilic cells with either absent or hypnotic nuclei.

452
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:35,280
This is a huge area of necrosis. Mm hmm.

453
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:41,820
Yes. So when you're saying morphologic. Oh, my brain is going to shape because morph means shape.

454
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:49,410
So I think. Sorry as you're asking for us to describe something, it's a morphologic diagnosis.

455
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,040
It is a process. It's a diagnosis.

456
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,310
A pathology diagnosis based on form. Yeah.

457
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,700
Okay. So in that case, we can say necrosis. Yeah, you should say that, though.

458
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,600
Okay. That's good. Thank you for clarifying that for everyone.

459
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:11,320
That is probably my fault because that's our short term as a pathologist where I give me a morph and what we mean is a morphologic diagnosis.

460
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:16,770
Okay. And sometimes I forget where I am. Like, did you want the descriptors with it?

461
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,560
So yeah. So it depends on what I ask for.

462
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:28,590
So for this, the Morphologic diagnosis or there's really two, it's hemorrhage and necrosis.

463
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:33,210
As far as distribution, this is regionally extensive.

464
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:38,980
This is a little bit of a difficult descriptor for you guys because essentially this is sub capsular.

465
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,150
This is underneath the liver. That's not really a location that we talked about too much.

466
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:52,320
But for you guys, I'll probably be giving you things that are either focal or multifocal or diffuse across everything.

467
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:58,560
So yes, you can keep those descriptors in there. So I didn't do that for this one because it's a little bit more complicated than we talked about.

468
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:03,750
And then for team one, what is the other change that is present?

469
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:08,100
Come on, refresh. What is the other change that is present on the other side?

470
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:15,629
The main change activation. Well, okay, that's a description.

471
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:18,990
But like, what is your interpretation? What type of population is that?

472
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:26,400
Most likely, these sharp, well-defined valuables, um, steatosis good or lipid doses.

473
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:34,560
So they're lipid vacuoles, so they're very clear. So they're compartmentalized versus the water vacuoles are kind of, you know, hard to see amorphous.

474
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,030
So the main diagnosis in the liver were necrosis and lipid doses.

475
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,630
Let's do this tissue. Okay. Oops.

476
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:46,320
Know I'm terrible at this. All right.

477
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:51,959
We're going to do this tissue hard. I forget usually.

478
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,650
So, like, we never know what the prize is for everybody.

479
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:59,530
All right. All right. So here is another tissue. I'm going to zoom in.

480
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:04,770
This one. This one is a lot of a says this is a real this is a kangaroo that died in Texas.

481
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:12,629
So it's not like someone was waiting there with a jar of formalin. But let's let it refresh.

482
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:18,480
And then I'm looking for a tissue. So whoever, whichever team grabs it first gets to pursue this one.

483
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,570
I'm looking for a tissue kidney.

484
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:26,580
Good. All right. All right.

485
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:31,510
And I'm going to say for time, this one pretty close up. This is a pretty diffuse change.

486
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:39,960
And there's actually a lot of fatalities in here, too. But this is a good place to start for a place to see what the main changes are.

487
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:45,540
Okay. So thinking about your kidney, thinking about the structures that are present in the kidney.

488
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:51,960
So this is the structure that we know. And then here's stuff that should be in the kidney but looks very altered.

489
00:45:52,140 --> 00:46:00,780
So I'm looking for a morphologic diagnosis, and there is a couple stages of things going on here,

490
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,780
but I'm looking for kind of the main process that's happening.

491
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:08,550
It's like, What do you think? Let's start with this. What do you think this thing is?

492
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:13,720
Keen to hear this is one.

493
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:19,000
Here's another one that looks a little bit different. There's another one that was sort of different.

494
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:25,420
You know, this is the kidney. So what do you think these things are? What's in a kidney?

495
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:31,640
I think everyone's answered at least once. You guys can roll around again. All right, let's start here.

496
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:35,020
What is this? What do you think this thing is looking at? It's glamorous.

497
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:38,410
Okay, so we know we're in the cortex, right? What else is in the cortex?

498
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:45,020
You don't remember who else is in the quartet? We are. Let's go, Mary Alice.

499
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:48,350
That's where the blood filter's into something.

500
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:52,070
The loop, the loops, a loop of Helen Tubules.

501
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,319
All right, Brian. Now you're going to have to remember proximal tubule.

502
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:01,129
Remember? Proximal tubule, distal tubule, medulla loop, apparently.

503
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:04,540
So we have some structure function studying to do that.

504
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,430
So these are profiles of tubules. Okay. So it's going to be hard.

505
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:14,089
Probably the closest one to normal that you have here is maybe this one.

506
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:20,980
But even this is not normal. What happened here? What do you think's going on in this tubule or this one does?

507
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:32,270
Look at one, two. You have about 5 seconds to come up with a likely morphologic diagnosis, starting with the process.

508
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:39,250
Get rid of two SEAL Team one. What are you going to leave us?

509
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:47,000
You only know a couple of processes. No.

510
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:52,560
If you guys remember when we did kidney, we showed one example of acute lesion.

511
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:59,680
That was our gentamicin toxicity. We showed a crystal thing and then we showed that end stage kidney with all kinds of fibrosis.

512
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:03,610
So remember everything injury, response, resolution.

513
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:08,230
What do you think for 5 seconds or do you want to do?

514
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:14,920
Well, this is clear from groups. All right?

515
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:21,250
Yeah. Yeah. There is this is tubular degeneration in the process.

516
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:26,710
So we have a cell here hanging on. Remember how it's a tubule, it's a lumen.

517
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:32,890
So as the cells become die, they crunch up, they separate from their neighbors and they spill into the middle.

518
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:36,880
So you have some of these like this one. This is a cell that's fallen off the edge.

519
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:40,210
Look at that tubule like this. Even this one is not looking so good.

520
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:42,670
It's missing a lot of nuclei, but it has more cells.

521
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,250
This one has hardly any cells, and the cells are actually falling off and flopping into the middle.

522
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:52,340
So we have tubular and the longer it goes on, everything degenerates.

523
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:57,610
So this tubular tubule has no cells and just goo cellular debris in the middle.

524
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:01,840
Okay. So we have different stages of tubular degeneration and necrosis,

525
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:08,200
but the overall change is basically necrosis and we don't even have a lot of inflammation here.

526
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:14,320
We don't have really fibrosis. So this is pretty acute. So we had acute hemorrhage and necrosis in the liver.

527
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:20,620
This poor animal is going through multi systemic distress, acute necrosis in the kidney.

528
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,090
And then finally, this is another tissue.

529
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:32,220
This might be a little bit harder. So just to show you the tissue, refresh faster, right?

530
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:42,130
Oh, right now. Yeah, that's fair game. They are they have generally known I mean severe does create personal good.

531
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:52,450
All right. It's hard. It must also now to be okay.

532
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:57,160
So, I mean, given all that, it's going to be pretty straightforward.

533
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:07,870
Yeah. This is all cardiac. Let it refresh my memory, all right.

534
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:12,309
Because it's a little bit different. Difficult because this is not a tissue we've seen before.

535
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:16,480
But what do you think is happening? It's our turn.

536
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:19,660
Yeah, it's your turn. Yeah. Yeah.

537
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:25,980
Um, kind of different, like I was supposed to say.

538
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:31,590
So I'm looking for. I guess I'll leave it here. There's some other areas, but I guess I'll leave it here.

539
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:41,600
All right. What do you think? During the call, he finished.

540
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:50,090
Yeah, there is inflammation here. And so there's actually a couple of things.

541
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:53,380
There's a loss of myocardial sites. So there's some somewhat.

542
00:50:53,410 --> 00:51:02,840
Yeah, okay. They're not hard to see, but there's there's lots of some of the parallel myocardial fibers.

543
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,899
And then when that happens, this doesn't show up really well.

544
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:14,389
But Mac macrophages that are on site will come and actually phagocytosis along that mild fiber remove in this animal is pretty acutely affected.

545
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:17,720
So we're also having some hemorrhage. We're actually near a blood vessel here.

546
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:25,340
But this is all loss of my part. There's there's some connective tissue here that should normally be here, but this is inflammation and hemorrhage.

547
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,770
So, again, this is a very acute process.

548
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:39,020
So this animal has necrosis, hemorrhage and inflammation in its kidney and its liver and its heart is in some dire straits here that we find.

549
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:51,050
So this was one of several kangaroos that died in a zoological exhibit within four days of being stung by a swarm of Africanized honeybees.

550
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,650
So this is multi systemic organ failure.

551
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:59,030
So these were the processes necrosis and hemorrhage necrosis.

552
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:02,330
There's some descriptors here, but that's basically what was happening.

553
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:07,430
So how did that happen? So African honeybee is actually the same.

554
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:11,160
They're basically a substrate of the same honeybees that, you know,

555
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:14,900
that are derived from European honeybees that we use to produce honey in this country.

556
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,530
So both are APIs.

557
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:25,430
Oliveira But this is a subspecies that differs in its venom composition, so it has more forceful OPC two, which is a destructive enzyme,

558
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:33,410
and it has different behavior, which is it's more kind of virulent characteristic compared to European honeybees.

559
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:37,580
African honeybees frequently swarm, you know, honeybees when they want to make a new nest.

560
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:40,910
They all swarm together. They go fly off, find a place to make a new nest.

561
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:45,710
African honeybees do that more frequently, so they're more likely to be moving around.

562
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:49,070
They're also highly territorial and faster to defend.

563
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:55,129
I don't know who did this horrible experiment, but it was found that compared to a European honeybee,

564
00:52:55,130 --> 00:53:03,800
which is all agitated for about 3 minutes after you disturb it, the Africanized bees remain irritated and angry with you for almost half an hour.

565
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:07,670
So the two main mechanism. Yeah, go ahead.

566
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:11,480
What would be the reason for such higher venom concentration?

567
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:20,630
Probably just adaptive to where it maybe there's more competition from other insects in it's where it lives.

568
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:24,080
It's just an adaptation to survival. Yeah, I don't know.

569
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:30,829
So they're actually not very big. They're actually smaller than a European honeybee, but they look almost identical.

570
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:36,140
You can't really relate because honeybees also differ depending on whether it's, you know, the queen, the drone, what their role is.

571
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:44,720
So you can't reliably identify them visually. They look very, very similar unless you're the expert, but they are very identifiable by their behavior.

572
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:50,780
And actually in this country, it's more common where you have this as an invasive species that you get hybrids.

573
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:57,230
So Africanized bees in this country are really usually hybrids of European and African honeybees.

574
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:02,900
There are two main mechanisms of toxicity. One is an allergic mechanism.

575
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:07,700
So people would be allergies. For that to be the case, you have to have sensitization.

576
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:16,159
So if you're having if you're suffering from a bee allergic attack, you have to have been sensitized to the honey bee venom first.

577
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:23,510
So that never happens on first exposure. But there is toxicity associated with the first exposure if you have enough exposure to venom.

578
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:32,660
So like these kangaroos are probably not allergic to honeybees, but they underwent the pathology due to non-allergic mechanisms.

579
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:41,090
So bee venom is a complex mixture of peptides and enzymes and there are three pathogenesis pathways for in venom Asian.

580
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:46,040
One is just the local response, which is what most of us get when we get a regular bee sting.

581
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:48,230
Even if you're not allergic, it's going to hurt, right?

582
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:56,329
So you have a local innate inflammatory reaction which is related to nonspecific, not allergic nonspecific.

583
00:54:56,330 --> 00:55:02,240
My activation histamine release. Remember, histamine was an activator in acute inflammation.

584
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:08,930
It causes swelling because it's vasodilation, increased permeability and it induces a little acute inflammatory response.

585
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,950
So that's like what most people, most of us get to like a European honeybee sting.

586
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,150
If you are be allergic the first time you're exposed to bees,

587
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:23,630
your particular immune composition developed an acquired immune response to some component of bee venom,

588
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:30,590
and you developed an IG e usually type antibody so you can undergo a hypersensitivity reaction.

589
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:41,180
So there's an allergic response to for some individuals, but then for other individuals there is a non allergic systemic reaction.

590
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:46,290
So. There's a number of factors in B investigation that contribute to this.

591
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:52,629
And one of the main ones is mass of the granularity factor, which is a direct math.

592
00:55:52,630 --> 00:56:02,500
So D granularity agent allergic reactions you make IGT, IGT binds to the surface of the mass cell and triggers de granulation.

593
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,720
So it's an immune mediated mechanism,

594
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:12,160
but there are also substances that will bind directly to a mass cell and cause it to do granulation without a previous immune response.

595
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:16,960
Because Africanized honey bees sting in such large volume, they're really angry.

596
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:24,820
You get a lot of them. So there's more of this going on when you suffer an attack from that group of bees and with a regular European honeybee.

597
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:33,040
And so you have a larger amount of histamine release. And then further you have two substances that actually directly like cell membranes.

598
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:37,930
And that trigger is the arachidonic acid cascade, which is an inflammatory reaction.

599
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:46,360
And part of the acute effect of like an Africanized bee attack is that one of the main cells that gets lice are red blood cells.

600
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:52,840
So you essentially have hemolysis occurring in your blood system after you get attacked by some of these bees.

601
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:57,010
So this is basically what happened to the poor kangaroos.

602
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:02,170
They had intravascular hemolysis. So their red cell count is dropping.

603
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:07,209
So they have some hypoxia, which in and of itself, you know, the heart is sensitive to that.

604
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:12,340
The liver is sensitive to that, the kidney is sensitive to that. So some of that necrosis is related to hypoxia.

605
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:16,600
Plus, this is a tissue injury like anything else that triggers inflammation.

606
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:20,170
So now you have an inflammatory response in your blood vessels.

607
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:25,150
And when you have an inflammatory response in your blood vessels, that predisposes you to clotting.

608
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:30,640
So now they're getting little clots forming the blood vessels. So they're getting activation of the clotting system all over.

609
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:35,830
That's something called die C or disseminated intravascular coagulation.

610
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:42,340
So are multiple clots part of their system is going to try to dissolve those clots, predisposes them to hemorrhage.

611
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:47,200
Meanwhile, their whole system is coping with the lower blood pressure because of all this vascular damage.

612
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:52,420
So that essentially leads to multi-organ dysfunction and that's the mechanism.

613
00:57:52,570 --> 00:58:02,140
Yes. Just given the hypocrisy element was there in the liver, I think I maybe saw some general toxicity where toxicity for brain damage.

614
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:10,060
Yeah. So there was probably some if you looked at like the distribution of the lipid doses, probably more central lobular zone three,

615
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:17,440
that liver was pretty diffusely damaged and actually almost looked like it went all the way up to the portal area.

616
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,980
It almost looked like there was damage to the pericardial area as well.

617
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:29,230
But if you look at low mag, the distribution was central lobular, but it was so severely affected.

618
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:31,120
I mean it had a lot of that stuff going on.

619
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:38,590
So that was non-allergic systemic toxic reaction from B in ventilation in just happened to be in kangaroos which

620
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:45,520
is strange and this is just a description of how the there has been territorial extension of the those bees.

621
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,519
All right. So let's try to go look at that.

622
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:58,700
Right. Is kangaroo. He is just built. I love other people.

623
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:08,139
I know they can be a little bit different. This is not one of the.

624
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:12,880
If I could take it. All right. Let's do this.

625
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:18,190
Let's do this one, and then we'll do maybe the humans. All right.

626
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:22,600
So this was a case from the BP meeting that I just went to.

627
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:28,570
This one was like, oh, that's going to be the case. This is tissue from an aged baboon.

628
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:34,450
I guess I'll tell you this. This baboon was described as forgetful.

629
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:42,820
Oh, I think I have to go back to here on. Okay.

630
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:57,470
Okay. Primate, this was no mystery slide session at HBP so this one and see if it's going to give me.

631
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:08,530
Oh, yeah. Okay. This is a different virus. A little bit harder to follow this viewer, but I'll do my best.

632
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:13,390
All right, so this is another. It's a forgetful baboon. I'll tell you, it's another brain case.

633
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:19,940
This is a lesion that we did not really talk about.

634
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:26,750
Okay. All right. So here we have a copy a little bit here.

635
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:32,630
Basically, I'm just asking I'm going to describe a little bit and then I'm going to ask you to name the likely condition.

636
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:36,290
And that's going to be open for anybody because I can't remember where we were.

637
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:45,379
All right. So this is an area of the brain that should have it's kind of an area called a nuclei, but not in the sense of a cells.

638
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:49,520
It's a nucleus where there's a lot of neurons. So the bigger cells here are neurons.

639
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:54,680
Here are some blood vessels. And the neurons have a couple of things going on and we find a good area.

640
01:00:56,570 --> 01:01:03,560
Okay, this is fine. All right, so here's some blood vessels and you'll notice that there's a little bit of rarefied action here.

641
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:06,890
It's kind of foamy looking around the blood vessel like we've had some drop out.

642
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:12,290
We have some strange stuff going on here. Here are some cells that have, like, brownish droplets in their cytoplasm.

643
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:20,690
Brown droplets. Bear that in mind. Keep that in the back pocket and see.

644
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:31,120
Oh. Okay. See if I can find. Well, we'll do this first.

645
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:35,110
All right. So these are neurons, the big cells here.

646
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:41,530
And then as we scroll around. Oh, here we go.

647
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:47,080
So here are some blood vessels again. Here are those cells filled with particulate stuff.

648
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:51,910
Here's a neuron. And here's this pink thing outside the neuron.

649
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:58,090
Here's another pink thing. Kind of particulate looking outside the neuron.

650
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:04,300
Oh, my God. Here's another pink thing. Here's a smaller one.

651
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:11,320
So everywhere we go, we're seeing these kind of eosinophilic extracellular deposits.

652
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:15,399
Here's another one. All right.

653
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:23,310
So we have eosinophilic extracellular deposits. I know it looks a little bit looking like our neuronal necrosis, but it's not.

654
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,230
It's something different. Here's another one. It's kind of granular looking.

655
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:36,530
And then we're also seeing something else in a neuron, if I can find a good example of it, the way we do this at HBP.

656
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:39,670
This is Mr. Slide session done at night. They have a bar.

657
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:43,510
Everybody's drinking and they show the slides. Just the slides.

658
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:50,590
There's like no presentation or anything and somebody's driving and people are just yelling stuff out and then they get more and more history.

659
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:55,570
It's a fun time. And by the end, you get pretty crazy with your differences.

660
01:02:56,170 --> 01:03:01,270
Oh, fun with pathologies. All right. So this is a little bit hard to see, but some of these neurons.

661
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:06,490
Here's a good one. Sort of have that particulate material inside the neuron as well.

662
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:11,380
Some really good ones at a certain area. But I didn't mark them. So I don't remember where they are.

663
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,030
Maybe here. All right. So here. Oh, here's a good look.

664
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:21,130
See, this neuron has particulate material inside it. These neurons have stuff accumulating.

665
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:28,959
Okay, so we have a forgetful aged baboon with material isn't even bacterial,

666
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:35,110
is accumulating just in the parenchyma randomly and then some granular stuff accumulating inside.

667
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:44,620
It's. Neurons. And then we have blood vessels that are maybe a little bit or it's actually some mineral in the wall of this blood vessel,

668
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:47,740
maybe a little bit thickened with maybe some degeneration around them.

669
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:52,030
And so what I'm asking you is, what is the likely condition?

670
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:56,880
Not a morphologic diagnosis, because I didn't teach you this one, but all that put together.

671
01:03:56,890 --> 01:03:59,940
What do you think might be the problem with this baboon?

672
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:09,200
It's just a palooza being wrong as you still get a prize at the end of condition.

673
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:14,160
What if you want to do. Yeah. PARKINSON Oh, that's a good one.

674
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:17,670
But just wait because now, because it's not Parkinson's,

675
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:24,360
because that would be in mostly in the substantia nigra and I didn't actually go there it is it.

676
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:33,090
But that's good. That's a degenerative neurologic condition. Type one of it is Alzheimer's disease, like it's Alzheimer's disease.

677
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:38,220
Yeah. So those is the. That's all right.

678
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:46,040
You guys are extremely competitive about his and that's good. Yeah.

679
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:52,960
So those eosinophilic things or the neuritic plaques, those are beta amyloid plaques.

680
01:04:52,990 --> 01:05:00,790
I can't find them now. The those eosinophilic things are the beta amyloid plaques appear more down here.

681
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:07,150
And then tomorrow is neurofibrillary tangles.

682
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:11,799
That's more. It starts intracellular only. Those are harder to see in an ancient stain.

683
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,670
Usually you have to just go to my slides because I took images.

684
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:19,780
Usually you have to special stain to actually see how.

685
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:27,370
All right. That was Alzheimer's disease, which is an age related protein misfolding and neuronal degeneration condition.

686
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:31,300
And this particular animal had two things that you could see.

687
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:33,490
It had Alzheimer's like pathology.

688
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:39,569
And in the animals, because Alzheimer's is really a clinical has a clinical aspect to the diagnosis, like there was cognitive tests.

689
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:42,940
So you get you can't really baboons that really cooperate with those cognitive tests.

690
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:48,000
So a lot of times we'll say Alzheimer's like disease to avoid you know,

691
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:54,490
it's to avoid the implication that clinically it's exactly like Alzheimer's, but it does share many similarities.

692
01:05:55,090 --> 01:06:02,560
So Alzheimer's, like pathology, includes the accumulation of beta amyloid plaques that were extracellular.

693
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:09,130
And this animal also has all that granular stuff that I showed you that is a pigment called lipo perfusion,

694
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:16,120
which is just a generic degenerating, a generic pigment of degeneration.

695
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:21,969
Most aging brains, humans, animals, otherwise have some lipo fusion accumulation.

696
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:29,560
So all it's really telling you is this is an age the brain in Alzheimer's disease, because that happens usually in aged people.

697
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:35,830
Usually there is some type of fusion as well. But you can have lots of light perfusion in your brain and not have Alzheimer's.

698
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:41,110
So the Alzheimer's pathology is really that neuritic plaques. So he has severe eosinophilic things.

699
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:46,870
This is just an and other lesion that's indicative of aging related degeneration.

700
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:53,110
So this is the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's. There are two main aspects to the pathology.

701
01:06:53,470 --> 01:07:01,510
One is the accumulation, usually extracellular release of amyloid plaques, neuritic plaques, senile plaques, or some of the other words.

702
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:10,120
These are degenerate aggregates that stem from amyloid precursor protein, which is a protein that's still kind of mysterious.

703
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:20,140
It's probably a cell receptor protein. And with age, it degenerates and is cleaved to a sub protein to protein A, which is what aggregates.

704
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:24,540
And for the neuritic plaques, typically those aggregate extracellular.

705
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:34,090
And if you get enough of them, they can interfere with synaptic function, they can accumulate around near synapses and also in the walls of vessels.

706
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:38,560
So just kind of garbage accumulating outside the cell.

707
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:42,730
And then you can get because that induces an inflammatory response,

708
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:47,680
you can get all the secondary changes that we would with any sort of injurious response to the brain.

709
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:52,450
The other thing that happens is there's a protein in the cell called tau protein that

710
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:57,520
normally functions to stabilize microtubules for transporting things down the axon.

711
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:02,740
And with age that tends to decrease function, it becomes hyper phosphorylated.

712
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:06,610
And ordinarily there's a mechanism for getting rid of tau protein.

713
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,730
So inside the cell, hyper phosphorylated tau is going to be targeted by ubiquitin, which is a nice,

714
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:18,010
helpful protein that brings sort of misfolded or messed up proteins in the

715
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:22,870
cytosol to protease ohms which are aggregates that will enzymatic breakdown.

716
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:30,610
Tao So you have like a garbage truck inside the cell that will grab a misfolded protein and bring it to a disassembly area, which is the protozoan.

717
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:34,000
But with enough accumulation of Tao,

718
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:42,280
this mechanism kind of breaks down and you get tau accumulating inside the cell and that contributes to the neuronal degeneration and type of fusion,

719
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:50,739
I told you, is a nonspecific aggregator. So basically you'll have these amyloid plaques forming extracellular near

720
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:55,150
synapses and can interfere with functions and induce an inflammatory response.

721
01:08:55,570 --> 01:09:00,820
And they also go around the walls of vessels and the inflammatory response then weakens the vessel.

722
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:04,299
Meanwhile, Tao accumulates inside the cell.

723
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:11,260
And the weird, funky thing about Tao is that there's evidence that the way Alzheimer's progresses in the brain,

724
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:16,120
rather than just kind of random, is, it seems to progress along neuronal pathways.

725
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:22,330
So the neuron projects to another one, which then tends to start showing those degenerative changes.

726
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:25,900
And there is some thought there's the Tao propagation hypothesis.

727
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:29,710
This is a protein involved in microtubule transport. There's some thought.

728
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:38,380
I don't know how strong the evidence is for this, that there might actually be passage of Tao somehow to the to the postsynaptic neuron.

729
01:09:38,830 --> 01:09:44,280
So that's people who believe that Alzheimer or the degenerative disease of Alzheimer's can act a little.

730
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:50,860
It's like a prion disease because the misfolding of Tao and this neuron tends to cause it to misfolded here.

731
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:57,070
And it's unclear whether that's a direct transmission of tau, which seems kind of hard pathogenesis wise,

732
01:09:57,490 --> 01:10:02,890
or if there's something in the signaling that causes this neuron to undergo similar changes.

733
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:06,340
It's kind of a weird, cool area of Alzheimer's research.

734
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:12,010
I have a question. It doesn't relate to the class, but and this is weird, so go with it.

735
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:20,680
My junior year of high school, I took it in anatomy class and we had dissected sheep brains and my sheep brain.

736
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:28,450
I remember this very well. It had a weird, little spongy brown thing inside of it was that tail.

737
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:31,590
Then you can't see that with the cow, with the naked eye.

738
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:36,400
So it's unlikely, we tell you. I mean, without seeing it, there's lots of things that could be there.

739
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:44,440
Sheep, brain in particular, they often get like a brown to black discoloration, which is called melanocytes, which is just melanin accumulation.

740
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:49,630
So sheep that have like a black face, they have melanin pigment, like in lots of their different tissues.

741
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:53,420
So just melanocytes as a pigment is just pretty common in sheep brands.

742
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:58,030
So it might have been that, but why don't you take a picture and bring it to me these years later?

743
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:05,979
Yes, I know that did not think it had so unfolded.

744
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:08,980
Protein response is important in neurodegenerative diseases.

745
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:14,910
We touched upon this a little bit at the beginning of the class. The proteasome is kind of related to,

746
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:21,580
but not really part they're not really part of the protein complexes in the E.R. that are in the unfolded protein response.

747
01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:26,710
So the UPR relates to sensor proteins that are normally inactive in the.

748
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:36,250
And then when you have misfolded proteins, they become activated and do things like increase chaperons, slow the process of protein translation,

749
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:43,930
increase apoptotic signals, and they also increase shuttling of proteins outside the ER to the proteasome.

750
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:49,240
So remember Tel though utilizes this process directly, it doesn't have to go through that.

751
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:54,729
But there is some thought at drug mechanisms that rather than targeting things like beta

752
01:11:54,730 --> 01:12:01,150
amyloid directly trying to target the unfolded protein response in increasing autophagy,

753
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:10,750
increasing self digestion, trying to digest things like endoplasmic reticulum that's accumulated with with unfolded proteins.

754
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:16,480
And it's a little bit of a double edged sword because potentially that could be protective at certain stages.

755
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:20,460
But if you're increasing autophagy in a healthy neuron, I mean,

756
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:25,420
you kind of don't want to be invoking that mechanism unless the neuron is degenerating.

757
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:27,670
So the timing of that may be very sensitive.

758
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:35,470
And those of you have been looking in the news might have heard there's this Alzheimer's disease trial right now with a monoclonal antibody,

759
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:39,010
the monoclonal antibody targeted against amyloid plaque.

760
01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:46,570
And unfortunately, they've had two individuals die who had, you know, they're aged people, they have Alzheimer's, they're on this trial.

761
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:52,059
And because their age, they also are at high risk of stroke just because that's an age related thing.

762
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:56,860
So they developed stroke and were given tissue plasminogen activator TPA,

763
01:12:57,100 --> 01:13:06,100
which is a drug that you get for stroke and you give it to dissolve clots right in your your thrombosis or your clotted cerebral vessels.

764
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:12,730
Remember what amyloid does. Amyloid also likes to be around the vessel and induces inflammation.

765
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:16,750
So what happens to the wall of that vessel? The wall of the vessel is going to be weak.

766
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:22,959
And now, just because of age, you end up with a clot in the vessel. You give a drug that's going to dissolve the clot.

767
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,780
And there is always a little bit of inflammation and a cleanup for that.

768
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:32,140
So what they think is happening is that the individuals who had Alzheimer's and are being treated with this compound

769
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:39,280
are actually getting because the monoclonal antibodies binding to the to the beta amyloid around the vessel,

770
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:44,709
you're getting weakened vessel. And then when you give the TPA and you induce a little bit further inflammation,

771
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:48,820
trying to dissolve that clot, that's too much of the vessel and they're getting hemorrhages.

772
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:56,050
So they're getting acute brain hemorrhage related to the stroke treatment because the vessel has been weakened by this monoclonal antibody.

773
01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:57,909
So that's unfortunate.

774
01:13:57,910 --> 01:14:05,230
It might mean that to use this drug successfully, people will have to be screened pretty stringently for preexisting vascular disease.

775
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:09,400
But that's one of the complications that people are seeing with this treatment.

776
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:16,300
All right. That was I bet that's my favorite non-human primate. Let's go.

777
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:20,650
I'm going to go directly to our human case.

778
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:25,570
This presentation will be up so you can feel free to look at the other ones.

779
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:32,470
But I know that everyone's getting tired at the end of the semester, so I want to kind of end pretty much on time here.

780
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:37,059
So let's look at a human help. Did not mean to go to the beginning.

781
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:41,320
I meant to go to the humans. There's no human.

782
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:45,140
Oh, there's a coral case in here that I love.

783
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:53,040
You guys make sure you do the court case. Okay.

784
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:57,040
So the human case is so cool, so sad.

785
01:14:57,130 --> 01:15:01,470
Let's do it. Okay. This is tissue from human. But this will be good because this will help you.

786
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:08,530
So I'm looking for a team to grab this by naming the tissue now.

787
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:12,450
Okay. Who is doing this? Like you got it this time.

788
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:19,140
All right. I lost track of the points some time ago, so it doesn't matter whose life is, like, random.

789
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:25,410
Yeah, the one so matter. All right, so tell the 10211.

790
01:15:25,530 --> 01:15:29,260
And we're going to name the changes that has to be stated by the arrow.

791
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:33,330
It's so washed out. I'm sorry, but let's try. Let's start over here.

792
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:37,830
So we're actually. Where are you? Do you think basically in the last like, what is all this?

793
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:42,150
What, every argument. Oh, yes. You're in the alveoli, basically.

794
01:15:42,990 --> 01:15:46,040
And you're like, we're going to get the team killed.

795
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:49,949
And then there's something here and here. It's kind of pinkish.

796
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:53,190
I know the color is not. Might look weird to me too, because I'm like, right.

797
01:15:54,210 --> 01:16:03,470
What do you think that stuff is in the alveoli? Is it cellular or not cellular?

798
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:08,590
It's not so good thinking back when we did Lung.

799
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:14,360
Think about we showed some acute things where we talked about the lung, which has numerous sites.

800
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:24,710
It has a capillary, has a very thin things we talked about. So what do you think is the non cellular pink stuff kind of cruising inside the alveoli?

801
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:33,470
Where are we? We're a team one, right? Confronts each other.

802
01:16:33,950 --> 01:16:41,690
Nominate somebody who hasn't really said anything. You have 5 seconds because team two is eager to steal this year.

803
01:16:43,190 --> 01:16:49,040
Is that what this is? Or if you if you want to pick, if you're more confident about one of these and want to pick one of these,

804
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:55,310
you can say, all right, five or it doesn't matter.

805
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,910
No, you're going to be blunt. Okay.

806
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,260
Good luck. That is an excellent thought.

807
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:06,130
Team one, what is cellular?

808
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:14,030
If this is not selling well and there is there is a fluid component of blood, to be fair.

809
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:18,590
And that's kind of key to this team, too.

810
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:26,670
Do you guys ever thought about what might be accumulating? Anyone who said I'd say yes.

811
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:32,630
We think it's like goblets all over production. You guys, that is extremely creative.

812
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:43,879
Was I wrong? Yes, you were wrong. But I feel like you should remember.

813
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:47,300
We're in the alveoli. Remember? Structure, function.

814
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:53,060
We don't want mucus from the alveoli. Yes, because that would clog up your air space.

815
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:58,489
But that was an excellent reminder of the singularity. And that is something you guys are going to have to know for.

816
01:17:58,490 --> 01:18:02,270
The exam of a singularity is different. That is a team one.

817
01:18:02,690 --> 01:18:05,780
You have another thought about something perhaps related to blood.

818
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:13,050
That is not blood itself. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

819
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:17,510
I'll take that. This is a dilemma. And what it is, there's a damage.

820
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:23,210
We have new missiles, right? The thin titanium insides, we have a capillary next to it.

821
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:28,860
If we have damage to one and we get damage to the other. So remember the lung I showed you.

822
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:34,970
What was that? It was racing, I think. And we had pink stuff all through the lung that was fluid because all the vessels are damaged.

823
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:39,410
It's permeable. The fluid part of blood is oozing into the alveolar space.

824
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:43,820
So this is edema. So we've had damage along those lines of damage.

825
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:48,560
What is this or what should this be? What should be there?

826
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:56,760
What type of cells? The flat cells in the lab and the type one tumor sites.

827
01:18:57,510 --> 01:19:04,469
Everyone's going to study that and learn that. Right. So but like what is missing here?

828
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:09,960
What is missing here in this particular part, if these are type one new, besides, what do cells have?

829
01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:14,820
Nuclei. This one doesn't have it. It's just pink. What is this process team want?

830
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:24,160
Yes. Yes, they. Now.

831
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:29,780
Do you remember the review that right inside this is alveolar necrosis?

832
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:35,330
When you have alveolar necrosis and you lose those type one new missiles, it damages the adjacent capillaries.

833
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:42,740
Then you have oozing fluid and then that's a capillary that's damaged damage to a blood vessel.

834
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:49,339
Damage to a blood vessel. What is the end product of damage to a blood vessel?

835
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:52,520
What is this? I mean.

836
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:57,770
Yeah. Who said the word beginning with an EF five fine by Elizabeth.

837
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:03,830
Oh, no. Yeah, it's fine.

838
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:08,540
Remember I fibrosis is the word means we do not mix those two.

839
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:13,850
They sound very similar. Thank you for demonstrating that common mistake. You see another example you're going to have to get that wrong.

840
01:20:14,450 --> 01:20:19,159
So fibrin is the and predator clot. So we have necrosis, we have edema, we have fiber.

841
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:23,210
And what stage of what time course is this process?

842
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:29,629
Yes, very, very acute. Okay. So this is alveolar necrosis.

843
01:20:29,630 --> 01:20:33,470
This is very similar to what we saw in that recent case.

844
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:38,750
Yes. Yeah. Can you do a quick differentiation between edema and inflammation?

845
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:43,130
Besides, like I mean, the DNA is fluid. Edema is fluid.

846
01:20:43,610 --> 01:20:50,480
Inflammation has in a general term, inflammation has a vascular and cellular component.

847
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:57,500
In terms of histology, most people, when they say inflammation, they mean cellular infiltrate and you'll see those peppered cells.

848
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:03,020
Okay. So this doesn't actually have a lot of inflammation yet. It's so acute this long.

849
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:10,040
This is a cool one. Oh, so that was pulmonary edema, edema, plasma, fine, diffused alveolar damage.

850
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:13,250
That was overall necrosis and that's fibrin this long.

851
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:18,620
This is from a paper from 2020 and this was very early in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

852
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:22,819
So this was one of two patients that were in the original outbreak.

853
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:29,300
And this poor individual, this poor guy was 84 and had adenocarcinoma in the lot of the lung.

854
01:21:29,570 --> 01:21:33,920
And so he was in surgery. He had a surgery to remove the adenocarcinoma.

855
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:37,550
Unfortunately, he died after that surgery.

856
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:44,120
And then and that was at the time, right when Coapt went on COVID two was breaking out first and move on.

857
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:54,080
So when he went in for a surgery, it wasn't really a thing yet. So he died, unfortunately, after his surgery and retrospectively in the biopsy sample.

858
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:57,530
This is not an area that has adenocarcinoma. That's sort of another area of lung.

859
01:21:57,530 --> 01:22:02,390
And his more back to me retrospectively, they were able to diagnose SARS-CoV-2.

860
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:05,750
This is an acute response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

861
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:10,910
So very sadly, when he went into the hospital, he either was infected or got infected there.

862
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:17,210
So what he died of, basically, he was he had become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and died of that.

863
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:22,159
But this is the one this is the reason this was important is this is a very acute infection.

864
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:28,190
They didn't know he had COVID when they took him to surgery for his you know, they would have taken to surgery or otherwise.

865
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:31,850
So it was a snapshot of early, early infection in the lung.

866
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:36,890
This is not what everybody who gets a mild infection with SARS-CoV-2 looks like.

867
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:42,320
Usually if you're healthy and there's no complications, just going to be upper respiratory.

868
01:22:42,650 --> 01:22:47,960
But this is the acute response in the lung when you get acute sar's related pneumonia.

869
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:54,170
Okay, this was another one. Well, how we can do this one.

870
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:57,560
Okay. This is another similar thing.

871
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:02,390
This is another patient. This was a paper that had two patients. The same thing happened where they went to.

872
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:04,129
It was right at the time of the outbreak.

873
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:09,800
I think it's really cool that they published this right at the time of the outbreak and they went to surgery for an unrelated reason,

874
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:12,800
and then they turned out that they had COVID at the time.

875
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:20,660
And so they were able to show like the acute because most of the pathology in humans from COVID two obviously is like over a period of time.

876
01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:24,710
So this is just fortuitous that we were able to get a snapshot of an earlier infection.

877
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:29,269
So here we're looking for the lesions indicated by the arrows.

878
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:32,900
The serum is hard to see. This arrow is trying to point at this thing.

879
01:23:33,710 --> 01:23:37,670
So this is the same situation where somebody who had a retrospective era of diagnosis,

880
01:23:37,670 --> 01:23:41,630
but this looks a little bit different and this area is pointing at this stuff.

881
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:47,720
So I'm looking for what is the process in either of those arrows, anything.

882
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:59,840
So remember the time course of what happens after injury and the one who wants to try this.

883
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:11,220
So the easier one. He went looking, confused him to the left.

884
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:14,970
One in side there. Yes, very good.

885
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:19,710
Her junior mistake. Everything looks almost like an airway rather than alveoli.

886
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:23,280
And what? What is type? You never said her conclusion. Like what happened here before?

887
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:28,330
It was like a murmur. Yes. So remember, the first guy had that alveolar necrosis.

888
01:24:28,350 --> 01:24:31,320
If he had made it longer, we'd seen that later.

889
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:37,350
That would have been repaired by the type two to make sure the stem cells for the alveolar lymphocytes.

890
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:40,440
So this is taking the side hyperplasia. Okay.

891
01:24:40,470 --> 01:24:46,470
Any thoughts, Tim? One on this guy. So this is the alveolar space, right, to somewhere like that.

892
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:51,050
What's going on there? Those macrophages. Yes. The helpful clean up cells of the body.

893
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:55,530
So these are pulmonary macrophages, increased pulmonary macrophages.

894
01:24:57,350 --> 01:25:01,610
Okay. Well, I don't know. Not you're adding something, but that's okay.

895
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:07,640
Your friends do. Okay. It's true. It's very good. So we have a good team.

896
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:12,920
I know you guys are really competitive, but you use well.

897
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:21,650
Yeah. So, like, think like this is actually showing us a snapshot a little further along of what happened to the poor person before.

898
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:32,420
This one else already has an inflammatory response. The new Messi or the Macrophages are picking up all that other fibrin and edema.

899
01:25:32,690 --> 01:25:40,340
So type two to the side of a plasma increased over macrophages. And so this was a similar this was the other patient, this person actually recovered.

900
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:45,500
So but this was retrospective diagnosis in the lobectomy specimen.

901
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:54,170
The two nuclei in that one cell. Oh yeah. Is that of so proliferation.

902
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:57,590
Those are just macrophages who are really active in it. Here's one.

903
01:25:57,590 --> 01:26:03,530
The three macrophages are cells that, if they're really ambitious in their phagocytosis, they tend to like.

904
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:07,969
They'll do all the things they need to do to expand, to survive.

905
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:12,020
But then they don't actually divide, so they just have a multi nucleated cell with lots of cytoplasm.

906
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:15,980
So it's just a thing that macrophages do when they're really pharmaceutically active.

907
01:26:16,770 --> 01:26:25,090
Um. Yeah. This is the same guy but a different area of law, and it's showing you a slightly different lesion.

908
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:32,980
And so what I'm looking for here again is just name the process, name lesion, or tell me like first you could start by telling me the area.

909
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:42,640
So we're, you know, we're in the lungs. So what are these faces? Alveoli.

910
01:26:43,930 --> 01:26:47,020
Usually the alveoli have spaces between them like this.

911
01:26:47,470 --> 01:26:51,320
Right. So let's see. There's this real picture.

912
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:57,160
Yeah. Interstitial thinking. Good. And what do you think it's thinking by information?

913
01:26:57,550 --> 01:27:03,100
Yeah, inflammation. So I was expecting two answers here because there's inflammatory cells in here.

914
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:06,670
And there's also this is harder to see because this is still pretty early in the process.

915
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:14,560
What else might be thickening the interstitial space in a previously injured lung production of the cells?

916
01:27:14,650 --> 01:27:17,140
Of what cell proliferation? What kind of cells?

917
01:27:18,190 --> 01:27:26,590
And in your end stage of injury, think about remember, we had the silica lungs, we had chronic injury to the lungs.

918
01:27:27,010 --> 01:27:32,020
What was the process that happened? And we showed a couple of different examples of distribution.

919
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:35,260
What was the end process of like severe injury in the lung?

920
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:41,700
It's the word that we jumped the gun on earlier because it's on an app.

921
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:46,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

922
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:52,319
So this person, this is like a real tissue.

923
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:56,370
So, like, it's not as beautiful as examples are. Try to give you this is early fibrosis.

924
01:27:56,370 --> 01:27:59,610
So remember there's that transition phase, granulation tissue.

925
01:27:59,790 --> 01:28:06,870
You have inflammation. You also have increased fibroblasts, laying down collagen and then things can go either way.

926
01:28:07,230 --> 01:28:15,000
You can either have the inflammatory cells resolve everything and things go back to normal, or the fibrosis takes over and you get scarring.

927
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:20,040
And this is a 74 year old person. So they can also have some preexisting pathology, but this could go either way.

928
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:25,199
So this was interstitial both things because from a visual standpoint where you guys are,

929
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:31,280
I think the inflammation is the more obvious interstitial inflammation and interstitial fibrosis.

930
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:37,260
So when people talk about pneumonia as interstitial inflammation,

931
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:41,280
like if it's just the decision, when people say interstitial pneumonia, that's what they mean.

932
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:45,990
When you have an acute pneumonia, it's going to look more like what I just showed you the previous one.

933
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:51,180
Okay, so this was the same patient. Here's another area this person actually had.

934
01:28:51,180 --> 01:28:54,629
These are like proliferating advances of fibroblast.

935
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:56,550
So these are called fibroblast foci.

936
01:28:56,850 --> 01:29:03,389
This is something you see in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis that people have sort of immune related pulmonary fibrosis.

937
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:07,830
So it was not clear whether this was underlying pathology that the 74 year old

938
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:13,350
man had or if this was response or exacerbated perhaps by the COVID infection.

939
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:21,840
Okay. So I love that paper because it kind of illustrates that we have that all pathology is a continuum,

940
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:26,940
which is what we've tried to emphasize through the course of injury of tissue, responsive repair or resolution.

941
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:32,669
And so one this was from a letter to the editor after this paper where somebody was commenting about,

942
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:36,690
well, this looks very different from those described by somebody else.

943
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:42,269
And the point the authors is making, which I think is an excellent one for most fatal acute infectious diseases.

944
01:29:42,270 --> 01:29:49,530
Pathology studies are in autopsies, which a lot of stuff has happened by the time, you know, especially as a human, you have interventions.

945
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:53,220
Maybe they were on a ventilator. There's been a lot of co-morbidities occurring.

946
01:29:53,760 --> 01:30:01,680
So with this, the fortuitous part from a pathogenesis standpoint is that they were able to get kind of a snapshot of early disease,

947
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:05,040
relatively uncluttered by other findings on top of it.

948
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:08,400
And their point, which has turned out to bear a lot of fruit,

949
01:30:08,730 --> 01:30:15,299
was that the early pathology of COVID 19 is essentially highland well, diffuse, alveolar damage like that.

950
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:17,400
REISEN Remember we said with that rise in lung,

951
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:24,839
anything that causes acute damage to those alveolar tumor sites is going to look very similarly and that if it's severe enough,

952
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:27,840
you get hyaline membranes. But that doesn't happen in every case.

953
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:37,380
And then so basically he's saying it starts with an Exadata process and what happens in the lung downstream depends on which way it goes from there.

954
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:44,580
Did you have a question around? I just want to clarify. It's not that it's not COVID itself like the COVID virus, though.

955
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:49,740
It's the it's the. Or is it is it the inflammatory response to.

956
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:53,100
It's both. Oh, okay. So excellent lead in.

957
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:56,940
So well, let's do this first.

958
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:06,719
That's an excellent lead in because that is a good explanation for some of the variability in pathology amongst COVID patients and for some of

959
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:14,490
the outcomes where some people appear to have more lingering symptoms and are actually only talking really about respiratory pathology here.

960
01:31:14,490 --> 01:31:17,130
But there are other systems, as we know, that can be affected.

961
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:23,550
But some of that is related, not so much to the initial viral infection, but to the body response to it.

962
01:31:23,850 --> 01:31:32,010
So if you're unable to really turn off that inflammatory response, either due to features of your immune response or underlying disease,

963
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:38,940
you're more likely to have, you know, subsequent pathology that even after the virus is gone.

964
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:47,610
So in terms of some of the work that's been done on pathology of COVID 19, there are three basic histologic patterns the epithelial pattern,

965
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:53,670
which is basically like that diffuse damage and then the relative response of type two Newman site hyperplasia.

966
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:57,370
And for some people that's basically it. But because there's so,

967
01:31:57,390 --> 01:32:02,700
so much inflammation going on and there's actually some evidence related to its ACE2

968
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:08,220
receptor that COVID can cause direct damage to the vessels through a hypotensive mechanism.

969
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,410
You also kind of a vascular pattern.

970
01:32:10,710 --> 01:32:17,880
So some of the early autopsies they saw thrombi in the lung, which is not really something you see with things like rice and or direct toxicants.

971
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:20,430
And that's a slightly different pathogenesis.

972
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:29,340
And then finally, depending on how well you resolve it, you can have permanent damage related to pulmonary fibrosis.

973
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:34,530
And so these patterns can be simultaneous, they can be consecutive, you can have one and not the other.

974
01:32:34,530 --> 01:32:37,300
So that's some of the variability. This is from a paper.

975
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:43,479
This is from a presentation given by Jana Ritter, who was my resident mate and is now working at CDC.

976
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:46,300
And so she works with human pathologists as well.

977
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:53,740
They're doing some of the animal models and some of the pathogenesis descriptions for COVID 19, among other conditions.

978
01:32:54,310 --> 01:33:00,730
These are kind of those three manifestations. This was the diffuse membrane, death damage and the highland membranes that we showed.

979
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:07,390
This is showing these micro thrombi, which, as I said, is unusual for just a strict alveolar damaging agent.

980
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:12,580
And then you have individuals which end up with interstitial inflammation and fibrosis.

981
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:20,260
And the interesting thing, this whole class there is the same pathology is a continual acute damage, body response, repair or regeneration.

982
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:27,620
This was a great paper out of the Netherlands which kind of collated from the time of symptoms.

983
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:29,890
So like this is Pre-symptomatic period.

984
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:37,060
So if they had some pathology, I don't remember exactly what the cases were, but this is a whole bunch of different cases.

985
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:44,410
This is people who had biopsies or autopsy samples taken in the early period after they became symptomatic.

986
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:49,270
And then later the blue things are if there were epithelial changes described,

987
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:58,120
the red things are the inflammatory changes, including some vascular responses and then the gray or fibrotic responses.

988
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:05,320
This is a ton of overlap, but their point was for the people who were affected later or who had symptomatic changes in the lung later,

989
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:12,700
that's when the fibrotic changes seem to come. And remember, some of these individuals may have been on a ventilator, so that itself causes damage.

990
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:16,660
So some of that may be mediating this fibrotic response.

991
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:22,060
And then interestingly, the virus itself, this pertains to Arianna's point.

992
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:28,960
The virus itself tended to be immunohistochemical, detectable in the lung only in the early stages of disease.

993
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:35,500
So all that late stuff is related to the cleanup response and perhaps to the perpetuation by your own immune system.

994
01:34:36,130 --> 01:34:39,760
So it's kind of a nice reminder that it's all in a continuum.

995
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:47,110
Let's remember this from our kidney lecture. So SARS-CoV-2 binds the Ace2 receptor.

996
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:55,300
We didn't talk about this, but ace2 not the receptor. Ace2 itself is a negative regulator of angiotensin.

997
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:59,590
So what it normally does is it deactivates angiotensin.

998
01:35:00,430 --> 01:35:02,860
In this diagram we said that angiotensin.

999
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:10,929
If the blood pressure is low at the kidney, you instigate this cascade and angiotensin does a bunch of things to increase blood pressure.

1000
01:35:10,930 --> 01:35:17,410
So it's a hypertensive agent. Normally it's control because you don't want that to go on forever by ace2.

1001
01:35:17,950 --> 01:35:30,850
So Ace2 binds a receptor and inactivates angiotensin two stars binds its receptor so you lose the ability to inactivate angiotensin two.

1002
01:35:31,270 --> 01:35:37,210
So you have an exacerbation, an unregulated and dysregulated hypertensive effect.

1003
01:35:37,540 --> 01:35:45,730
So one of the thoughts is that some of that microflora by is because of the dysregulation of this normal control of this hypotensive effect,

1004
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:52,540
because removing that control mechanism for these pregnancy attempts. Okay, we're just about done here.

1005
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:58,209
This is kind of snapshots from a different lecture I have on comparative coronaviruses.

1006
01:35:58,210 --> 01:36:06,700
But all these animals have something in common, and that is that they are either vectors for or are affected by their own corona viral illnesses.

1007
01:36:08,590 --> 01:36:13,479
So Corona and when I teach infectious disease, stuff like that, students or residents,

1008
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:18,639
one of the things I think is really helpful when you think about comparative stuff is if you learn the general first,

1009
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:23,080
like learn what a corona virus does, learn what an influenza virus does.

1010
01:36:23,470 --> 01:36:28,400
And then especially on the memory side, you paste the species specific things on top of it.

1011
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:31,180
So you need to know the general and then you can learn the specific.

1012
01:36:31,930 --> 01:36:38,470
Coronaviruses in general are either usually intestinal or respiratory or multi systemic.

1013
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:45,460
So if I look at coronaviruses in animals, we have some intestinal ones that basically cause a little bit of diarrhea, usually in young animals.

1014
01:36:45,910 --> 01:36:52,780
And then we have other versions that either cause respiratory signs or multi systemic signs like multi systemic SARS.

1015
01:36:53,290 --> 01:36:58,050
So there is a lot of you know, this is from my veterinary thing, there's a lot of coronaviruses.

1016
01:36:58,060 --> 01:37:01,060
Almost every species has its own coronavirus.

1017
01:37:01,450 --> 01:37:11,200
And if you look at the manifestations, enteritis or poly, systemic respiratory enteritis, respiratory, they can be kind of and in one species,

1018
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:18,970
like the pig, pig, you have an enteritis coronavirus and you have a respiratory one, so they can kind of jump around.

1019
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:25,990
These are the clinically important coronaviruses in humans. These are the ones that we worry about because they have severe clinical symptoms.

1020
01:37:26,350 --> 01:37:29,530
But we also have beta coronaviruses that are just cold viruses.

1021
01:37:29,530 --> 01:37:32,530
Right. So this isn't the only coronavirus we've ever seen.

1022
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:36,220
And the interesting thing about coronaviruses is.

1023
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:44,300
That many of them that are symptomatic and humans appear to have made the jump some time in their evolutionary history from animal species.

1024
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:50,390
So this is just kind of a reminder, if you remember, Murres, that the Middle Eastern respiratory coronavirus,

1025
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:57,469
the first species that was affected, all of these are bat derived just from their genetics, bat derived coronaviruses.

1026
01:37:57,470 --> 01:38:04,280
But the intermediary species there was the camel. So people, you know, in the Middle Eastern working with camels more as a domestic animal.

1027
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:10,750
So people became infected through their interaction, camels and similarly through some of the other coronaviruses.

1028
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:14,540
This was that pangolin. There was a theory that the penguin was the intermediary species.

1029
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:23,090
Not quite so clear that that's really the case. But all of these are bat derived coronaviruses that people came into contact with through interaction,

1030
01:38:23,090 --> 01:38:26,240
either directly with bats or with some intermediary species.

1031
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:33,950
But the interesting thing is that if you look at sort of the genetics and how these viruses have sort of adapted with their human hosts,

1032
01:38:34,250 --> 01:38:44,239
we have kind of two patterns. There's one that are the viruses that were sort of new, highly pathogenic and appeared as epidemic viruses.

1033
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:51,620
And that was because there was not a lot, you know, not previous exposure and not a lot of immune cross-reactivity in the host population.

1034
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:55,040
So the epidemiology is that we had severe disease in humans,

1035
01:38:56,300 --> 01:39:03,740
but the less pathogenic coronaviruses appear also to have been associated with outbreaks like in our distant past,

1036
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:10,940
but have mutated and reached sort of a level of coexistence with humans or either causes no disease or mild disease.

1037
01:39:11,030 --> 01:39:17,570
So these are common cold coronaviruses originally derived from bats that are now endemic in humans.

1038
01:39:17,930 --> 01:39:23,440
So they've adapted to make the switch to humans that can infect humans, but they don't cause epidemic disease.

1039
01:39:23,450 --> 01:39:28,130
There's a switch epidemiologically to an endemic phase of the virus infection.

1040
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:35,360
Did you have a question around do any of those also have like names that are more common names like that?

1041
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:41,160
And sorry that each code, as far as I know, they're just common cold coronaviruses?

1042
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:45,990
Oh, yeah. I wasn't sure if there were like if people know about the Spanish flu.

1043
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:51,840
I have not heard of any of these, in fact. And aren't these because these have been around forever?

1044
01:39:51,860 --> 01:40:01,580
These are just common cold. These have names associated with their epidemic, because it's been recent enough that that was a new thing.

1045
01:40:01,670 --> 01:40:08,780
Got it. So, like, the natural coronaviruses do mutate frequently based on a number of features of their biology.

1046
01:40:09,110 --> 01:40:19,040
But the natural pathology of coronaviruses and any virus, really in a population where it's emerging as an epidemic over time in general,

1047
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:23,090
the tendency is for that virus to become endemic and less pathogenic.

1048
01:40:23,630 --> 01:40:28,910
And it kind of makes sense because from the perspective of the virus, it wants to infect a new host.

1049
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:35,750
So if you have a virus that hits the host species and sort of kills them very quickly right away,

1050
01:40:36,230 --> 01:40:41,000
that's that much less long that that person can walk around and infect other people.

1051
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:47,840
So you can have viruses like Ebola, things like that, that are highly, highly pathogenic and kill people quickly.

1052
01:40:48,230 --> 01:40:54,950
Those tend to kind of spike up and then go back down because you just don't have enough circulating susceptible populations,

1053
01:40:55,460 --> 01:41:00,650
things like coronaviruses. If you have people walking around with mild symptoms,

1054
01:41:00,650 --> 01:41:05,570
that's great from the virus propagation perspective because they're more likely to spread it to new hosts.

1055
01:41:05,570 --> 01:41:11,450
But the net effect over time is that just like the evolution of those common cold viruses shows,

1056
01:41:11,780 --> 01:41:17,600
over time, you tend to preserve less severe strains because they just can spread more wild, more widely.

1057
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:21,470
And there's kind of a nice model for that in comparative pathology.

1058
01:41:21,830 --> 01:41:31,460
This is a pig, as you can see. And in the Internet Corona virus of pigs, there was a virus called TG or transmissible gastroenteritis,

1059
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:36,230
which was a diarrhea virus that was pretty pathogenic for piglets in the seventies and eighties.

1060
01:41:36,230 --> 01:41:39,470
It was killing a ton of piglets. So it was a big thing for the pork industry.

1061
01:41:39,890 --> 01:41:40,969
It was the seventies and eighties.

1062
01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:47,450
None of the vaccines they made were effective and basically they would try to contain it by just killing a whole bunch of pigs.

1063
01:41:47,450 --> 01:41:50,600
So it was pretty economically impactful.

1064
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:53,990
And then in Europe, this virus just kind of went away.

1065
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:59,150
But the piglets were still testing a serologic positive for coronavirus.

1066
01:41:59,510 --> 01:42:06,950
And what had happened at some point in its rampage, the coronavirus had mutated and generated a mutation in the spike protein.

1067
01:42:07,310 --> 01:42:15,860
So the pig coronavirus spike protein, but it's the same basic pathogenesis and that changed it from being an interim to a respiratory virus.

1068
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:23,149
So the pigs, then it could only really infect respiratory cells, so they still spread it to one another, but its symptoms were much milder.

1069
01:42:23,150 --> 01:42:32,030
So it became essentially an endemic common cold virus of piglets, and that is the form of this pig virus that is existent now.

1070
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:35,720
So we ha we learned about this and very slowly almost never see it.

1071
01:42:36,270 --> 01:42:40,170
But we see this and it's mostly like a mild cold virus of pigs.

1072
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:45,659
So the epidemiology of this was that the more severe symptomatic virus was replaced by an

1073
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:50,250
endemic version that still circulates in pigs today but is less symptomatic for the species.

1074
01:42:50,670 --> 01:42:53,700
And so there are people this is a slightly different corona.

1075
01:42:53,760 --> 01:43:00,239
I mean, it is a betacoronavirus. But people are studying this epidemiology and these mutations as potentially a model for what

1076
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:05,310
might eventually happen with SARS-CoV-2 in terms of the persistence of less virulent strains.

1077
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:10,710
So it was kind of an interesting comparative example, just reminding us, again,

1078
01:43:11,820 --> 01:43:17,729
that animals can be models for human disease and talk about mouse models and things like this, but you can't really look at them in isolation.

1079
01:43:17,730 --> 01:43:20,910
Environmental health and animal health does impact human health.

1080
01:43:21,150 --> 01:43:26,250
So I hope that's one of the themes that we've been able to get through in terms of a one health approach in this.

1081
01:43:27,810 --> 01:43:36,270
So that is actually there's a lot of hidden slides in there, and I'm on a Post-it note at the Plaza and posting that presentation,

1082
01:43:36,270 --> 01:43:38,820
so you can feel free to look at those, ask me questions about those.

1083
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:45,360
But we did get a chance to look at some similar things to what we did in class, so hopefully that will be helpful.

1084
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:48,360
We looked at the Alzheimer's case. There's a whole coral case in there.

1085
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:53,280
Okay. But that's all that I have. Do we have any questions?

1086
01:43:54,330 --> 01:43:58,680
All right, everyone come up. Pick some prizes. Thank you.

1087
01:44:01,050 --> 01:44:05,750
You have to take some prizes, because otherwise it's just going to go back to my life.

1088
01:44:08,130 --> 01:44:24,650
I mean, this is. There was only lady was stopped when she was having lunch with some second group and they

1089
01:44:24,650 --> 01:44:28,580
went through like a bunch of different areas and then at the end it was like no one.

1090
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:40,399
First food items, non-food items. So a game of clothing she already supplied.

1091
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:44,870
That will probably break the second time you use it because we didn't do it alone.

1092
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:55,140
Senator. He wants to have as many people as possible.

1093
01:44:56,100 --> 01:45:00,209
Yeah. You know.

1094
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:05,050
You know what I'm saying?

1095
01:45:06,150 --> 01:45:12,380
Yeah. Thank you so much, Doctor, for another.

1096
01:45:13,620 --> 01:45:18,870
Mrs. Clinton is going to take the country all the way back.

1097
01:45:20,070 --> 01:45:23,820
Well, that's why you need the poetry for your refrigerator. There's yo yos.

1098
01:45:23,820 --> 01:45:30,960
If anyone remember things that should be on a roof over your head.

1099
01:45:32,550 --> 01:45:41,840
Yeah. All right. So again, I have a somewhat famous case, but I want to ask you about what now?

1100
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,420
A somewhat famous case of this toxic lady.

1101
01:45:46,110 --> 01:45:52,410
Have you heard of her? No. So that's the name if you want to like Marisa or remember it.

1102
01:45:52,830 --> 01:45:59,100
And so it was a woman who went to a hospital and she ended up dying and getting

1103
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:03,150
people sick around her because they felt they said that they had no money.

1104
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:09,270
And then they ended up like having like shortness of breath or like high blood pressure or something.

1105
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:21,900
She had particulates in her blood. Particulates was fine and like different sorts of drugs in her blood and shiny like greasy, oily skin.

1106
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:27,540
And what like the like finding reported by the hospital was that she covered

1107
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:34,110
herself in DMSO because it used to be like used and like like in medicine ability.

1108
01:46:34,290 --> 01:46:41,250
Yeah. And then it said that like that interacted with something in her body to produce a toxic chemical.

1109
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:49,670
But toxic. Toxic like all the toxicological research and like experts say that that's how they'd like, they still consider it a medical mystery.

1110
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:57,180
No, I haven't heard of that. So I actually have seen dinosaur toxicity is used as a vehicle.

1111
01:46:57,240 --> 01:47:01,649
Yeah. For like it's terminal and diluted massively, but it's for things that are cool.

1112
01:47:01,650 --> 01:47:07,110
I was like, you're I have to apply to yours to higher volume, higher concentration in particular.

1113
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,500
I mean, it actually can be linear.

1114
01:47:10,860 --> 01:47:18,150
So I've seen like I've seen it injected IPI and it causes lysis of the outer side of the liver if you have it in too high concentration.

1115
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:26,190
But like DMSO actually in lower concentration is anti-inflammatory some of the kidney so people women who have like interstitial

1116
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:32,100
cystitis sort of like irritable bladder syndrome infusions of edema so in the bladder is actually used as a treatment for that,

1117
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:44,430
but it is a permeable opposing agent. So like when you're using experimentally, you're not you don't forget to get all right, well, gather your men.

1118
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:52,140
It does have like a little hernia blown in effect, which can cause like if you have another chemical, it can kind of bring it into your body.

1119
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:57,159
It stinks if you've ever worked with it. I can imagine it's an acute respiratory.

1120
01:47:57,160 --> 01:48:01,200
If you even if you caught your body with that yourself, you probably make some of his eyes water.

1121
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:06,629
Probably not that like an irritant. Exactly. Yeah, but know, I don't know enough about individuality.

1122
01:48:06,630 --> 01:48:12,990
Yeah. Like eventually I think it ended up being like the family thought it was from like unclean hospital conditions.

1123
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:16,979
And then there was also the possibility it was in like a drug trafficking place.

1124
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:20,100
And she had another in California.

1125
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:23,370
They thought that her bag, her I.V. bag might have been contaminated.

1126
01:48:23,370 --> 01:48:28,620
But then she also had DMSO, and I think it was B12 and like DMSO might do something or be there,

1127
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:33,549
you know, as I just don't know if you ever heard of that case. Yeah, it was from like nineties or early 2000.

1128
01:48:33,550 --> 01:48:37,200
There's something super interesting. You're a big Harry Potter fan.

1129
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:42,540
I mean. Yeah, I mean, which I have to show you.

1130
01:48:42,660 --> 01:48:46,170
Okay. Because I think you. Oh, my God.

1131
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:49,710
I go. I went to New York.

1132
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:51,840
I'm not doing my father. So I went to that.

1133
01:48:52,170 --> 01:48:59,280
So really, when my daughter, my one is in college now, she was really she was the Harry Potter Authority or someone they had, you know.

1134
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:04,980
Oh, yeah, she has a wand and all that. And we got her the certificate that says you're admitted to.

1135
01:49:06,270 --> 01:49:10,499
Like, that's not every child's dream. Yeah, it's weird.

1136
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:13,950
I don't know what that is, but, like, every generation has, like, a UFO. Yes.

1137
01:49:15,810 --> 01:49:19,350
Oh, yeah, yeah. I do remember. This was such a thing.

1138
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:23,260
Yeah. It's like the auto explorer or something.

1139
01:49:23,290 --> 01:49:24,779
Oh, they like little magnets.

1140
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:31,880
And, you know, the magnets, like you put the magnet letters on the refrigerator and you can make whatever kind of weird stuff.

1141
01:49:33,210 --> 01:49:44,190
All right. I do remember I'm making breakfast and it's like, oh, my goodness, it can be very hard to find one little.

1142
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:47,999
I was like, Oh, I didn't realize that at the time. Right. I'm just going to get. All right.

1143
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:52,049
Last comment. Anything else? Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

1144
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:58,200
Try to make it look like you're Ariana.

1145
01:49:59,050 --> 01:50:02,660
Oh, oh.

1146
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:08,010
All right. You know, I just. Thank you very much.

1147
01:50:08,030 --> 01:50:12,309
No worries. A great semester. You know, you're an awesome teacher.

1148
01:50:12,310 --> 01:50:21,190
Thank you. Very dynamic. I this. All right, guys, I want to remember that at the event, only 2 hours.

1149
01:50:21,910 --> 01:50:28,680
Well, the exam itself has that time period from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. for the people taking on Friday.

1150
01:50:28,680 --> 01:50:29,950
It's not the time for everyone.

1151
01:50:30,370 --> 01:50:37,720
When I write it, I design it to be similar to the exams that I used to give in class, which were a two hour time period.

1152
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:42,069
So what I'm telling people is that it's designed I mean, I should probably caveat that too.

1153
01:50:42,070 --> 01:50:47,230
Like a cute I think the exam is a 2 to 4 hour period of study.

1154
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:52,210
Okay. But it doesn't kick you out. No, I sent an email to clarify.

1155
01:50:52,580 --> 01:50:53,950
I didn't came in a little bit later,

1156
01:50:53,950 --> 01:51:01,870
so I maybe I wasn't clear enough in that you have you can sit there steering that exam from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. the entire time, if you want to.

1157
01:51:02,470 --> 01:51:06,730
I do not advise you to do that. I think it's a two hour to four hour period of time.

1158
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:09,980
But the exam is open that entire time period. Okay.

1159
01:51:10,090 --> 01:51:13,540
Does anyone? 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. And I'm going to do it. 10 to 10.

1160
01:51:13,870 --> 01:51:15,060
Oh, nice. Nice, cool.

1161
01:51:15,070 --> 01:51:22,389
Two American girl with me next Friday is dandy for me because then what you can do is you can go through fast, you know, where everything is.

1162
01:51:22,390 --> 01:51:26,140
Write down some stuff. Yeah. And then you just close the browser window.

1163
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:29,290
It'll keep you in there. Oh, okay. That's good. Going to look at my thing.

1164
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:34,840
Make sure that's the case. So once you leave it, it's closed. No, there are actually, you can go, but you have to submit it.

1165
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:39,879
Don't submit it. Submitting it sends it in and it'll just stay open because I'm going to give it whatever.

1166
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:43,060
But what is that 12 hours, 12 hour time frame for?

1167
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:48,040
If you herself are through it like you've studied all semester and you know this stuff in the back, your hand, you're done in 2 hours, you're done.

1168
01:51:48,070 --> 01:51:52,440
If it takes you 8 hours, who cares? You just can use your own time for it.

1169
01:51:52,990 --> 01:51:59,410
Thank you very much. Sure. So for you, we're going to do the same thing on Monday m to 10 p.m.

1170
01:51:59,590 --> 01:52:06,850
Okay. Does that make sense? Okay. All right. That's good. And like, if something happens, like, oh, my God, I submitted it, you know, 2 minutes in.

1171
01:52:06,850 --> 01:52:10,989
Like, I can see how long everyone's been in the exam just handed me.

1172
01:52:10,990 --> 01:52:15,370
Like, as soon as you notice that some terrible thing has happened so that I have time to figure it out.

1173
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:19,310
Yeah. Okay. All right. No worries. Take care. Don't.

1174
01:52:19,860 --> 01:53:04,900
Right. Well, yeah, well, you know, it's not exactly certain.

1175
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:05,260
All right.
