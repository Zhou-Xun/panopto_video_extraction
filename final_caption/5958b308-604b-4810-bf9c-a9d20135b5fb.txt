00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,204
Hi, I'm Carrie Karvonen-Gutierrrez, and

2
00:00:08,204 --> 00:00:12,050
I'm a faculty member in
the Department of Epidemiology.

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,860
Today we're going to talk
about acute inflammation.

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:19,430
Acute inflammation is the way in which our
body works to keep us healthy in response

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:24,270
to a pathogen or other invader or
some type of injury.

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,090
Inflammation is vital for
the health and repair of our body.

7
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:33,190
It serves as a non-specific defense
mechanism against injuries and invaders,

8
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:38,530
and also works to signal the immune
system to respond to specific pathogens.

9
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,080
Inflammation can be either acute or
chronic.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,500
In this module, we will learn about
the difference between acute and chronic

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:52,190
inflammation, and specifically how acute
inflammation works to keep us healthy.

12
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,600
The immediate inflammatory responses
that are vital to our health

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,100
are known as acute inflammation.

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,160
You may have likely experienced
acute inflammation in your own life.

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,340
Perhaps you've had a sore throat
after exposure to a pathogen, or

16
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,160
had pain and redness in your
finger if you have a splinter.

17
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,490
Or perhaps you fell playing basketball and
experienced a swollen knee.

18
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,610
All of these are examples of
the acute inflammatory response.

19
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:24,510
Acute inflammation is the short term
a mediate response to local injuries or

20
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,800
invaders.

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,400
The acute inflammatory response
can be measured in hours or

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,240
days, it's quite short.

23
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,200
Unlike acute inflammation,
chronic inflammation last for

24
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,230
several weeks or longer.

25
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,500
In our next module, we will examine
what happens to our body when

26
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,970
it is in a chronically inflamed state.

27
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,490
Many things can trigger
an acute inflammatory response.

28
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:53,730
We can broadly classify these
factors as exogenous or indigenous.

29
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:59,020
Exogenous factors are those that invade
and injure our body from the outside.

30
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,020
We are often exposed to pathogens
from our external environment, so

31
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:08,580
things like viruses and bacteria might
be considered exogenous factors.

32
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,460
Other examples of exogenous factors
include toxins and foreign bodies.

33
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,990
For example, that splinter that might
have been stuck in your finger,

34
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,380
that's an exogenous factor.

35
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,360
There can also be things within our body
that can trigger an acute inflammatory

36
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,200
response, these are known as endogenous
factors because they come from within.

37
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,740
Products of cell death
through immune reactions

38
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,230
are both examples of endogenous factors
that can trigger an inflammatory response.

39
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,270
This happens because the cells
die within our body,

40
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:46,430
they may become necrotic, meaning that
they release toxins into our body.

41
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:51,550
Our inflammatory responses initiated
to destroy these endogenous toxins and

42
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,120
keep us healthy.

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,950
There are four goals of the acute
inflammatory response shown here.

44
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,130
First, we work to recognize
the initial infection or injury.

45
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:08,190
Our body has specific signaling pathways
that are able to do that, to recognize and

46
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,680
initiate a response.

47
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,610
The acute inflammatory response
includes a vascular response,

48
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,930
this is when the blood flow is
increased to the site of injury.

49
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,030
Accordingly with that vascular response,

50
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,810
we have a cellular response that is
coordinated with the vascular response.

51
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,680
The cellular response occurs when we
mobilize products and cells of healing to

52
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:36,910
the site of injury so that we can repair
and clear out the damaged tissue.

53
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,180
And finally, we remove the injured
tissue and prepare the site for

54
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,560
healing and repair.

55
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,280
So let's take a look
specifically at the vascular and

56
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,030
cellular responses of our body with
respect to acute inflammation.

57
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,560
In this picture, we see that the thumb
is injured by a sharp object

58
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,300
breaking the surface of the skin and
bringing bacteria into the wound.

59
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:03,150
In response to this tissue injury
inflammatory mediators are produced

60
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,000
at nearby cells.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,510
Inflammatory mediators
are molecules that intensify and

62
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,090
prolong the inflammatory response.

63
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,400
This is good because we want our body
to able to mount an efficient yet

64
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,530
robust response.

65
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:22,371
Histamine is an active inflammatory
mediator early in the acute inflammatory

66
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:24,105
response.

67
00:04:24,105 --> 00:04:28,465
Release of histamine by cells near
the injury causes capillaries or

68
00:04:28,465 --> 00:04:31,755
small blood vessels to dilate or widen.

69
00:04:31,755 --> 00:04:33,875
The dilation of capillaries allows for

70
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:38,395
more efficient transport of needed
cells to the site of the injury.

71
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:41,655
Also in response to histamine
the capillary membranes or

72
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:46,600
the outer walls of the vessel become
more permeable, or leaky to allow for

73
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,980
easier transport of white blood
cells to the site of the injury.

74
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:56,080
Both of these actions, dilation and
increased leakiness of the blood vessels

75
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,670
allow for
more blood flow to the site of injury.

76
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,230
This increased blood flow
results in redness and

77
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,078
heat, two of the cardinal
signs of inflammation.

78
00:05:06,078 --> 00:05:08,500
With the increased leakiness
of the vessel walls,

79
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:15,180
cells known as phagocytes can more
easily move to the injury and invasion.

80
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,800
Once phagocytes reach the site of injury,
they work to engulf and destroy bacteria

81
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,450
and other particles or debris,
this process is called, phagocytosis.

82
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,760
After phagocytes have engulfed and
destroyed the bacteria,

83
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:35,150
platelets cross through the capillary
membrane to help seal the wounded area.

84
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,020
As platelets and

85
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,140
other fluid cross through the capillary
membrane to the area of infection or

86
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:45,420
injury, we see the excess fluid called
exudate, accumulates at the site,

87
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:51,500
and this results in swelling, another one
of the cardinal signs of inflammation.

88
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,690
There are several local manifestations
associated with the acute inflammatory

89
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,910
response.

90
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,650
Local manifestations are those that
occur close to the sight of injury.

91
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,080
These local manifestations are also called
the cardinal signs of inflammation, and

92
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,470
include heat, redness, pain,
swelling, and loss of function.

93
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,970
And all of these are primarily
due to the vasodilation and

94
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,870
fluid accumulation in tissues.

95
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,520
We can also experience systemic
manifestations associated with

96
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,160
acute inflammation.

97
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,480
Systemic manifestations are things that we
can experience throughout our whole body,

98
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,240
not just at the localized site.

99
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,550
Some examples of systemic manifestations
of inflammation include fever and

100
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,870
leukocytosis.

101
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,460
Fever is due to the impact of
these inflammatory mediators

102
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,000
on the hypothalamus
which trigger an overall

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,920
increase in temperature throughout
our body to maintain homeostasis.

104
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:54,010
Leukocytosis is when we have higher
than normal levels of white blood cells.

105
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,480
This is because these white blood
cells are used by our body,

106
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,720
to help destroy the pathogens and
mounting inflammatory response.

107
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,830
And so when we have a need for
this type of response,

108
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,260
we have higher than normal
levels in our body.

109
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,940
In this module, we will review
the acute inflammatory response.

110
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,466
The acute inflammatory response
is beneficial to our health and

111
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:19,643
well-being, as it is our body's way to
not only signal the immune system to

112
00:07:19,643 --> 00:07:21,224
mount a specific response.

113
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:25,319
But also works quickly,
efficiently, and without need for

114
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,720
specificity to any invader or pathogen or
injury that we might experience.

115
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,019
And in doing so,
it works to keep us healthy
