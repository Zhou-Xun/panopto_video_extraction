1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,530
Let me know if you need it. Somehow it's not working. So today what we're going to focus on is.

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,240
It's nothing to do with the smells. Okay. So we did the housekeeping.

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,910
And basically today what we're going to talk about is targeting. So you got an American government one rating.

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,150
If you look at the United States government in its crazy town, it makes no sense.

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,640
I hope you enjoyed it and I recommend reading more of the book.

6
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,810
If you're really into politics or your double majoring in political science or something,

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,419
you probably were able to test your skim reading in which you look at a section, you say, Is this saying anything?

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,200
I don't know. And if you're not learning anything, then you can carry on.

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,780
And if you are realizing that you don't know it or you know less well than you think, that you slow down and read in more detail.

10
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,560
So feel free to look at the rest of the book if you feel you need that.

11
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:57,700
I can get two classes for one price of one, but otherwise we weren't doing it just because this is basic literacy.

12
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,600
To figure out how stuff happens in the United States, although it is,

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,599
we're doing it also because it is crucial to a skill without which you're going to look like a fool.

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:13,030
When you try to do policy advocacy, which is target, which is the simple act relevant in all contexts,

15
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,820
to figuring out who can help you fellow, by how you persuade people.

16
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:23,070
It's that simple. So I'm going to give a brief lecture on how to think about policy tools and targeting,

17
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:30,600
and then a lot of class is going to be an exercise in doing it, which will build, of course, into a being an effective actor in the world.

18
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:36,450
Be doing your analysis of strategic landscapes and see doing all your other assignments,

19
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:44,400
all of which begin at the very top of the first page with who you're targeting and the easiest and most common way to lose points in this class,

20
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:52,620
reflecting the easiest and commonest way to look silly in the world is to write to the governor of the state of Michigan to say,

21
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,679
you want to do something about Medicare. Well, Medicare is entirely federal.

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,980
The governor is not relevant. Or write to a senator to ask for a change in federal policy.

23
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:06,710
Yes, the federal Senate is the right place to go in terms of federal government,

24
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,420
but a senator might not be the right person right to within the government.

25
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,300
So what we're focusing on here is not just American government in all of its beauty.

26
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,380
We're actually focusing on how to find the person who's most relevant to to quality.

27
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:26,190
So that will be the focus of our exercise and also the short lecture to give us a round up.

28
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,660
Now, the thing that we that the language that they use is asks, what are you asking for?

29
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:40,340
You don't bother to come to a politician just to say hi. You come to a politician to ask something.

30
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,280
And it's very funny.

31
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:49,500
Occasionally I'll be around or have interacted purely socially with a politician, or for that matter, even a high ranking university administrator.

32
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,770
Like when you run into the provost at the University of Michigan, they're not equipped to have you just chat.

33
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,940
They're equipped to have you ask them for something because that's life.

34
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,360
If you're powerful enough, people ask you to let people try to persuade you of things.

35
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,590
And so when you go into policy, what you want to do is have your ask, what are you asking this person to do?

36
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,970
Because they're very likely to correctly think you're wasting their time if you don't have an ask.

37
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,540
So what are some of the things you can ask for? Well.

38
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,320
Here's a list. I won't run down all of them, but it can be, for example, pass legislation.

39
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:33,810
Right. A lot of things have to be done through legislation, can't be done through the budget, through executive action, through agencies.

40
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,120
You need to amend the law. Right.

41
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:42,240
So what, Michigan, what's no fault insurance that required legislation to change the structure of our insurance market,

42
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:48,570
which was a health issue in so far as the health insurance is keeping a lot of health care providers afloat.

43
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,940
Executive orders, by contrast, are essentially using the executive's managerial discretion.

44
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:01,750
So in Joe Biden's capacity as manager of the executive branch,

45
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:07,180
he can send out orders saying within the law, you can't change the law by executive order, do something.

46
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,969
Now, the problem with executive orders, unlike legislation, is legislation.

47
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,630
If you want to do it, you have to pass more legislation or control the courts.

48
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:20,940
Whereas an executive order changes when the executive changes. So we have a thing called the Mexico City policy.

49
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:28,740
This was enacted by Ronald Reagan. You can't spend American federal money on abortion in foreign countries.

50
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,010
Nixon. Nixon.

51
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:39,950
Reagan pushed it a little bit further and said, you can't spend American foreign aid money supporting an organization that refers people for abortion.

52
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:46,849
Right. So you can't have your abortion clinic is a formally separate organization that doesn't get American aid.

53
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:52,620
And then your main clinic next door say, okay, and if you wish to have an abortion over there, you can't do that.

54
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,850
As soon as you do that, you violated the Mexico City rules.

55
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,580
Now there's no more deflation saying that Reagan just did it. He said, you know, dear USAID, here's what you've got to do.

56
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,430
The problem with an executive order is Bill Clinton came into office and immediately undid it and said,

57
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,730
Yeah, sure, you can give abortion advice with American money. George W Bush came into office.

58
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,910
Guess what? He said, you cannot do it.

59
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,710
He reinstated the Mexico City policy.

60
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,139
Sensing pattern here, Obama came into office, repeal the Mexico City policy and said, yeah, sure, we'll pay for you.

61
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,740
Good advice. Donald Trump came in and handed the issue to Mike Pence.

62
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:34,190
And so we got a much tougher, stricter version of it saying you really, really, really can't give anybody advice about abortion with American money.

63
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,540
And guess what Joe Biden did on his first afternoon in office? Really sensing a pattern here.

64
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,260
That's the problem with executive orders. They change with the executive. So, for example,

65
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,720
Michigan has a bunch of executive orders that Gretchen Whitmer issued in 2020 saying that the

66
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:53,170
state government needs to catalog and collected data on racial disparities in health care.

67
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:59,230
The next time we have a governor who doesn't care about that, they're free to say, no, no, no, spend the money on something else.

68
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:06,700
Now another thing you can do is budget, right? If you ever want to really understand an organization, look at its budget.

69
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:11,969
Look at what it really does. This is reassuring in some cases.

70
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,690
For example, Michigan does not budget that much money for all.

71
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,040
It's just very prominent.

72
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,760
On the other hand, the United States federal government clearly reveals itself for what it is, which is an insurance company with a large military.

73
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:32,610
Everything else is just basically around in here. So you can ask people to budget for something, budget for a program that you want passed.

74
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:37,670
I want to achieve something. Please give us some money. That is regulations and rules.

75
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,330
We call them secondary legislation. This is not normal American legal usage.

76
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,620
It's international, but it really works by primary legislation, as the legislatures do.

77
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,050
It's what Congress and the Senate passed the president or the Congress.

78
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:58,629
By contrast, regular regulations with a capital R are secondary legislations where you delegate,

79
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:05,800
you tell the EPA to identify pollutants under the Clean Air Act and come up with the best available technologies.

80
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,830
And it. Now, that doesn't mean Congress all of this is the wish of some people on Supreme Court has to

81
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,750
specify the exact levels of pollution that you can have in order to satisfy the Clean Air Act.

82
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:23,799
That is the direction of conservative jurisprudence. Instead, it means that EPA has to have secondary legislation.

83
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:31,180
It needs to write a specific regulation saying this many part per million of whatever constitutes pollutant, and you have to get rid of it.

84
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:39,300
A huge amount of what you do in politics is about regulation. That's why you're going to be doing the response to regulations, your policy memos.

85
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:47,290
And so you can go to an agency and say, we need a regulation of capital R or just struggling.

86
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:52,140
We need guidance on, for example, what should be at the school practice for paramedics.

87
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,400
I'm skipping over a few other words their support ballot initiative.

88
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:06,250
Right now, Michigan is having an extremely unedifying fight over which petitions to get stuffed onto the ballot in November are going to be accepted.

89
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,259
Basically, the most prominent one is that three quarters of a million people signed a

90
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,920
petition saying that they wanted abortion rights to be in the state constitution.

91
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,190
There's a board of canvassers, two Democrats and the Republicans. They deadlocked.

92
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,210
The Republicans said it was illegible due to bad spacing that words were run together.

93
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:30,800
The Democrats said, you just don't want to force it to be on the ballot in November because A, it'll pass the Republican candidates.

94
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:38,570
The Republicans said nonsense. We want a legible and interpretable statement that voters can realistically vote for, and you have to look at it.

95
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,829
What? Being a petition drive got this on to the ballot.

96
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:48,930
Despite the fact that it is 100% not what Republican candidates want to run on, it is efforts 100%.

97
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:57,880
What Democratic candidates are running? Then there is local stuff in Ann Arbor.

98
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:02,090
This usually means being here registered to vote in August, which I know all of you are right.

99
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:11,980
Yeah. American local governments basically never have enough money, and some American local governments structurally don't really have any money.

100
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,720
So what they have to do, and this varies by state, you know, one state, you know, one state,

101
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:25,090
what they have to do is get somebody and it varies who can do that to what we call in Michigan,

102
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,630
apparently only in Michigan, a millage which is a little special tax.

103
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,149
So if you want to have a bus service,

104
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:40,090
the outer transit authority has to get people to turn out and vote to authorize a nice bus service which constitutes a share of property tax.

105
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,560
And if you look at an Ann Arbor tax bill or a tax bill pretty much anywhere else,

106
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:51,310
there's a very small amount really of money that's fixed by state law to go pay for your local government in your schools.

107
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:57,430
But then if you want to have nice school buildings, you have to pay a millage for the building, for the construction.

108
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,190
If you want a bus service, you have to pay a village for that.

109
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,630
If you want to help the homeless, you have to pay a millage for the Gillen Center, etc. etc.

110
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:13,680
Another one you could do is hold a hearing, but being in front of a congressional or even a state legislative committee is no fun whatsoever.

111
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,150
It's absolutely ancient history. But if you want to watch Powerful Men be humiliated,

112
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,300
I recommend what happened when the Big Three auto executives went to Washington, D.C., in 2009 to ask for bailouts.

113
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:34,960
One thing politicians are very, very good at. Even the right politicians like, say, our regents are very, very good at is public humiliation.

114
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,350
Ask Mark Schlissel. Never seen so many undergrads doing original research on a Saturday night.

115
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:50,589
Right. And by the same token, it turned out to be trivially easy to humiliate the chief executives of Ford,

116
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:54,100
GM and Chrysler, including they showed up in private jets.

117
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,380
What's the point of CEO if you don't get private jets?

118
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:03,670
And they were basically told to go home and come back and cars their companies made, which was just wonderful in terms of, you know, bloodsport.

119
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,870
But you can find a lot of it. Preparing for a congressional testimony is no fun at all.

120
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,610
Ask the people in front of the January 6th Commission asked Hillary Clinton, who got like 10 hours of grilling about Benghazi.

121
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,690
And so if you hold a hearing, you can draw attention to something. But it's also a weapon.

122
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,480
It's a weapon that's going to ruin weeks of somebody's life preparing for it,

123
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,110
potentially leave them known as the guy who was humiliated by the committee on whatever.

124
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,890
These are all different things you can ask for. Right. And you have to think through what you're trying to achieve.

125
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,770
And I for. Right.

126
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:43,800
So, for example, if you want a better bus service, you probably should be thinking about who can put a village on it to improve the bus system.

127
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:52,200
And if you are asking for attention to be paid to a policy issue, just to get further up on the agenda,

128
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,660
maybe a nice hearing with some experts who think that this would do the trick.

129
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:03,230
If you don't think you can legislate, but you like the president, for example, Mexico City, you can ask for an executive order.

130
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,520
This is not an exhaustive list. I have talked about everything on the list.

131
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,600
The key point is there's a lot of different things you could ask for.

132
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:14,510
This is an area of skill and knowledge and creativity. Don't underestimate it.

133
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:25,030
They're targeting the core of why you need to know American politics one way it's identifying who to approach, who could solve your problem.

134
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,080
This is what we're parodying when we make jokes about. People always want to speak to the manager.

135
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,560
Can this person do something and will this person do something? It's that simple.

136
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:38,910
So, for example, Medicaid is a federal and state program.

137
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,440
There's federal people who've been affected and their state people have been affected.

138
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:51,800
Medicare is purely federal. Therefore, if you want to talk about Medicare policy, there's basically no state level politicians on that.

139
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,739
Gretchen Whitmer can agree with you 100%. Yeah.

140
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,100
That's about as good as would be. Agree with you. I enjoy it.

141
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:05,460
So you have to figure out, is this person in a position to help you and.

142
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,209
That is this person in a position to help you? And then secondarily, will they help you?

143
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:18,980
Right. So, for example, if you define the problem as limiting access to abortion, there's a lot of things the president could do to help you.

144
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:26,510
But this president is not going to help you. That gives you where you need to pay attention to plan B, right.

145
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:30,410
So Plan A might be the president has the authority to do it.

146
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:38,160
Let's go right to the president. And if the president doesn't plan to listen to you, then you say, well, how can I pressure the president?

147
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,550
Can I go to the Senate to have to hold a hearing?

148
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:49,140
Can I get states to pass resolution legislation that does part of what I want to do in order to create some groundswell?

149
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,760
So that's the way you think, right? There's plan A, plan B, let's see.

150
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:03,870
Plan B. And one of the trickier things are grading papers in this class is, is this a really elegant plan for plan G level targeting scheme,

151
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,520
or is it somebody who actually doesn't has done their homework and realized who they should actually be targeting?

152
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,950
So going to build up your skills on that to make that determination. Why do you do this?

153
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,820
It's a crucial skill. It shows that you know what you're doing.

154
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,370
To do otherwise is to look silly, right? To write to a senator about a state level matter is to look silly.

155
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,940
And that burns up your credibility pretty much for good.

156
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,549
And you don't want to waste anybody's time having a nice chat with the senator about Michigan State.

157
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,640
Politics might be enjoyable, but it achieves nothing.

158
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:42,219
You might as well talk about sports. So what do you need to know?

159
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,080
I've been kind of referring to this. You start with what kind of government has the authority to take the action?

160
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,700
Sometimes it's very clear only the federal government can, for example, forget student loans.

161
00:14:54,890 --> 00:15:00,650
States can't do anything. Don't talk to states. Only the federal government can declare war.

162
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,659
There's a lot of things only states can do.

163
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:11,470
Only states can enact major non-pharmaceutical public health measures to lock societies down through the pandemic.

164
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:18,400
And whether they could do that varies by state law. I snuck territorial on there at the whole world of its own.

165
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:24,250
But what are we talking about? The United States? Don't assume it applies in the territories.

166
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:32,110
Do you see that technically territory? Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Virgin Islands, stuff works differently there.

167
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,920
And likewise, don't assume your policies work the same on tribal lands.

168
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:44,020
Given the last few hundred years, Indians are frequently quite reticent about exercises of federal and state power on their territory.

169
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:51,240
You can see what? So you get to the right government and say, I want to get rid of student loans.

170
00:15:51,990 --> 00:16:00,180
The federal government is the place to be. I want to do a medicaid pilot with the idea of something a fraction.

171
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:04,440
Some combination of Indiana and DC is I need to be.

172
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:10,670
But then you have to think back to your list of stuff you're trying to achieve. You're asked to do it.

173
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:20,980
Because the hearing or legislation or budget, you probably should start with the legislature to see if you want an executive order.

174
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,860
I recommend the executive. I'm very smart.

175
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:32,550
On the other hand, if what you want to do, for example, is fight legislation that you don't like, that's judicial branch.

176
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,260
So if you don't like regulatory restrictions on your business,

177
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,970
but they're popular and hard to get rid of, you probably just want to find a friendly court suit.

178
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,180
If your house has just been searched for nuclear secrets,

179
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:50,280
you want to find a friendly court to get somebody to stop them using the documents that they found in your house.

180
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:56,270
This is a problem a lot of us have. I understand. A lot of the time what you want is a regulatory agency.

181
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:04,220
Right. So if you have a complaint about, for example, the Stafford ratios that Medicare will pay for between nurses to patients,

182
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,260
that takes you CMS for Medicaid, Medicare services, Medicare, Medicaid.

183
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:16,010
Sorry, because even if you could somehow get your issue onto the president's desk, it's not his determination.

184
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:25,090
All this boils down to you need to figure out what level of government is handling your problem primarily,

185
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,930
and then what kind of government has the authority to take the action.

186
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,150
So you might have noticed in Ann Arbor over the summer, sanitary stuff appeared at all the public restrooms.

187
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:42,700
That's Ann Arbor local ordinance. Now, in theory, the state of Michigan could also mandate that a legally.

188
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:49,160
Allowable toilet has sanitary stuff, but I won't hold your breath.

189
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:55,580
And so there's two areas, two kinds of government that could do it. Once local one state federal government can't.

190
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,669
And so advocates said, let's do it at the local level.

191
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:02,450
And that's why you find a little basket or vending machine in all the public restrooms that are.

192
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,610
Now, Ann Arbor also tried to put a bag tax rate an extra $0.05 if they give you a free plastic bag.

193
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,730
And this was outrageous to fundamental American principles.

194
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:18,210
And so the state rushed in and passed a law preempting it so that no local governments in Michigan have a bag tax.

195
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:24,179
So if you want a bag tax, if you don't like plastic bags and want to discourage their use, well,

196
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,950
your first stop has to be Lansing to get rid of the state legislation banning bag taxes at the local level.

197
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:37,780
You. And if Lansing doesn't plan to listen to you and the state, people who pass that,

198
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,940
who pass a law preventing local bank access is still an office of the legislature.

199
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:49,950
Well, then you have to figure out plan B or C or D, maybe you need a petition drive organization to get it on to the state ballot, for example.

200
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,930
But you always start a play if it's fundamentally a state issue, a starter state.

201
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:03,060
If nothing else, people are going to ask why you're bothering them when you didn't try the obvious office to address yourself to.

202
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:12,670
Are there any burning questions? In that case, we'll do some targeting practice.

203
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:17,380
I feel like I should make a joke about target practice, but it doesn't somehow.

204
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:23,310
And the slides are on canvas if you need to go back and reconsider.

205
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:34,109
But. We're going to do. Of those three or four people who figured out how to work with this horrible group, you're smart enough collectively.

206
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:41,670
I with. And pick a reporter who's going to take legible votes and be willing to pull out their opinion into this microphone.

207
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:48,910
You got 20 minutes. I give you a list of policy groups and the report is going to be your conclusion.

208
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:52,720
So you'll pick one policy area and if you finish it, then pick another policy area.

209
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:59,450
First of all, what's the problem? Secondly, you can have more in your pocket.

210
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:05,490
What's your ask and who do you ask those seven to do it right and pick the most important part.

211
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:11,660
Say this is plan A, you can't think of plan B, C, D, E, f, g until, you know, planning, right?

212
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:19,160
So if you want something that is fundamentally the power of the governor, the answer is the governor.

213
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,099
Even if you might say the government will never care many to come up with a more elaborate

214
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:31,510
strategy so that their people might have the authority to implement your policy idea.

215
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:36,240
Who could deliver what you asked for? And then pick the most important one.

216
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:45,000
We're not focusing on how you the. We're not interested in how you plan to persuade the governor of your idea.

217
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,390
We're not interested in how you plan to persuade the chief of staff at the White House.

218
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:55,620
We're just interested who could do it? And like I said, this is one of the easiest ways to screw up this politics of this class.

219
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:04,320
Okay, I'll put up the list of topics and forming groups will be circulating if you have any questions.

220
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:43,160
I didn't want to take her out of this.

221
00:21:43,340 --> 00:22:12,210
I can't live like.

222
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:14,520
In our time.

223
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:28,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

224
00:23:31,020 --> 00:25:26,550
I mean, I, I, I feel like I'm personally, after years of being honest and I'm like,

225
00:25:26,790 --> 00:26:55,450
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

226
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:13,260
I know.

227
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:26,500
It's a big difference.

228
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:55,110
And this is what I felt like.

229
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:18,600
I was like, this guy.

230
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:53,300
You know, it's like this country and it's like anything else.

231
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:07,990
I'm glad you like it.

232
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,050
I miss you, too.

233
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:34,630
I need to look for you.

234
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:43,940
I'm really looking forward to you.

235
00:29:49,790 --> 00:30:16,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

236
00:30:17,720 --> 00:31:18,260
That's fine. Obviously, you can get the message out like this is what I do.

237
00:31:18,740 --> 00:32:40,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

238
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:52,760
I heard. Yes.

239
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:12,430
I think how to.

240
00:33:20,700 --> 00:34:15,840
Right. I don't think I know what I look like.

241
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:41,140
But it wasn't. It wasn't there.

242
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,270
Yeah. Oh, no. Oh, yeah.

243
00:34:49,690 --> 00:35:20,540
Excuse me. Yeah. My purpose in life is.

244
00:35:45,220 --> 00:36:00,030
But that doesn't.

245
00:36:28,170 --> 00:38:00,680
But if you look at the elements that I want it to be, like I said, I don't know.

246
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:22,580
It's just like I don't like what I said.

247
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:58,230
I don't have any idea what it is.

248
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:19,410
Yeah. Yeah, I think that's.

249
00:39:31,640 --> 00:40:31,140
Well you know mean that's what it have to wrap up and make sure your reporter is reporting to you that she was able to see this thing.

250
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:59,240
So I really have to figure out one of these for this story.

251
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,950
I'm going to be here to make it happen.

252
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:08,870
I couldn't get this thing to work. I have no idea. Do you?

253
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,200
Yes, I would. And we didn't have it.

254
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,890
Not like, you know.

255
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:26,660
I also don't know how I got it.

256
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:35,170
I think it was like I could see activated remotely.

257
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:49,010
I just want to ask you this, but.

258
00:41:55,070 --> 00:42:39,320
But I didn't want to do anything.

259
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:48,530
Okay. So I hope the lesson number one, which is the target, is actually kind of tricky as it adequately communicates.

260
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:52,280
And we don't have time for every group to report out.

261
00:42:53,210 --> 00:43:01,380
So I also am happy to do our IT to take volunteers for people who are happy with what they did or interested.

262
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,120
One other say. I could throw that.

263
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:12,960
Okay. So we wanted to focus on restricting the use of solitary confinement.

264
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:19,410
So our ultimate goal with that is to pass a primary law with the state legislature.

265
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:30,180
We were considering an executive order with the governor that we wanted to make sure of, and that would be easily, I guess.

266
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:38,220
And we said that the easiest way to do this would be to start off by getting a lot of people to some organization to lobby

267
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:46,930
the phone they want to say to make sure that it is really on the forefront of their minds or to hopefully go insane.

268
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:51,709
And we know. Nicely done.

269
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:57,260
Right. So notice you identified the state problem following on the executive order,

270
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:02,149
of which has the appeal that basically the head of the prison system could sign a piece of paper.

271
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:09,770
It's done something more lasting and then start thinking about the correct pressure strategy to get the legislator rejected.

272
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:14,210
So the target. Anyone I decided to of.

273
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,490
We talked about banning the sale of menthol cigarets in Grand Rapids.

274
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:29,130
So our primary target being the city consists of three methods and none of the legislative

275
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:36,180
entity or state efforts and their inclusion sessions includes opportunities for public comment.

276
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:42,320
So if you go to those meetings for a bunch of people who support and use around

277
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:48,750
health threats and they just have an opportunity to possibly get around the city.

278
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:57,240
So they have a couple different sections of the health and safety regulations that would be a good place to start.

279
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:04,920
The mayor, I guess, also has a little bit of authority to make administrative policy smarter for supporters.

280
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:13,140
But we've got a set of concerns with the purpose of correctly identified, local level, correctly identified.

281
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:19,230
That's likely to be legislative and the icing on the cake, because this is a city code that we would actually do.

282
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:25,630
So again, that's a really high target list of Cigarets is a fascinating and depressing area of public policies.

283
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:33,070
I feel like it's such a good representation. And to me that's the abortion.

284
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:47,970
It's. So, you know, we have our clients again, what to do.

285
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:56,330
So the idea is to add up the voting block enforcement and enforce the law.

286
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:02,900
And we're doing embassy in Michigan so that we start on the part of the lawyer and

287
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:10,550
get to move along with the voter on what we can do to sort out the judicial system.

288
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:20,870
And then we'll go on local court and fight for an appeal. And once we get to the local court system of appealing until we get to the Supreme Court,

289
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:25,400
the question of a requirement for something like that, which.

290
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:33,000
So notice the task was structured, of course, because that's essentially all Roe v Wade did,

291
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:41,220
was it blocked the enforcement of a bunch of laws restricting advanced abortion, including Michigan law, willingly as number one.

292
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:47,880
So it's 1931 because it's abortion is criminalized in most cases.

293
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:56,080
Or is there some other thing that you can use to argue this is of course, this is bad for the state.

294
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:03,530
And as you said, they went to all the court judges and there's actually two major losses of the primary.

295
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:08,860
One is the dying guy who said if you go on Election Day,

296
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:14,770
you cannot enforce this law because there is a decent chance of people say the law is unconstitutional, that.

297
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,350
And so given that there's a decent chance that the law will be ruled unconstitutional,

298
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:30,080
it would be grossly unfair to enforce it for a while and then take away or right away to the fact that this was supposed to work.

299
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:37,060
So that's why we have a statewide injunction on enforcement of all this based on lower court judges.

300
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:44,500
It's going to go straight back to the state Supreme Court pretty quickly, because it is, I would say.

301
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:51,650
So they got a little. They're running a perfect campaign at the state level.

302
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,870
And here's where the pressure is at the local level, where all the tax.

303
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:05,030
Okay. So what? You guys are super. Subjects.

304
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:17,830
So we decided to look at specifically all of our offers on the security administer and walk them off to being trained to administer MOXON.

305
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:28,499
So we are much more aware of the state government issue because different so different topics are connected at state versus other levels.

306
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,990
But at the state level we talk about targeting state legislator,

307
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:41,140
the state legislature for similar reasons of wanting to try to finance the law instead of just creating the second order in this country.

308
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:49,040
And specifically that this facility probably represents our very high levels of abilities and that we would

309
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:55,429
want to lobby for because they historically oppose the crime reduction programs and for that matter,

310
00:48:55,430 --> 00:49:06,140
opioids. So and because the House and Senate in Michigan is very Republican, needs to target them to do those cuts.

311
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:12,649
So we said it was a majority issue that tend to be those comments that face the largest

312
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:20,690
issues of crisis and in which there are more individuals being trained in the lawsuit.

313
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:26,420
So once again, legislation at the scene is coming through. That legislation is ideal.

314
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:34,190
Like that's a correct. And the question is simply sometimes are you just not going to get legislation?

315
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,270
So we chose the complete stranger than ever as a gift.

316
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:50,500
And the problem that it's addressed is that there has been terrorism over the past five years.

317
00:49:50,980 --> 00:50:02,880
Even though our partnership has been slightly specific, space is basically just like clean sidewalks and crosswalks.

318
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:08,170
And so we decided that this is definitely a local issue.

319
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:22,290
And we found that in order to share this story inside empathy and compassion, and we found that there was an inverse of the numbers that occurred.

320
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:33,940
So we felt like I could share contribution as our person to go to figure it out for the rest of the country.

321
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:44,590
So other there's another woman who's a councilmember also said that it's perfect.

322
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:52,380
So while I'm sure these two people reserve the right to be terrible, this is a really nice place to say, Oh, you know, it's in our pocket.

323
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:58,980
It's in our streets. So who exactly is going to do all of this credible?

324
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:05,739
Who has the ability to force the issue? So that's a high level of busy organization.

325
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:16,790
Each other's what? A few people accept their faces as.

326
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:36,300
And so we do expand Medicaid eligibility.

327
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:47,240
So we have the southern expansion of the city is that they would need to actually pass it.

328
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:53,730
One thing we do talk about is that if it is an expansion state, that will do that.

329
00:51:54,520 --> 00:52:04,330
I said to do that. But it's not just that. Again, when we talk about it and the studies show that there is support among the state

330
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:12,150
actually expanded and that we are talking about also a little bit and I think many,

331
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:19,760
many of the statements that it is showing, I persuaded the department is actually doing that.

332
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:27,880
Yeah. And that's good because by definition it's Medicaid expansion.

333
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:34,290
States like the political some large share of political will to the state is not sold on Medicaid eligibility.

334
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:40,150
So what you did and that's the reality for a lot of people in Florida.

335
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:52,329
Okay. So these are good examples of targeting and you can kind of see the logic right here is picking up plan A, which is if we're working Metropolis,

336
00:52:52,330 --> 00:53:01,389
we better go to Grand Rapids and our order and some of the more complex looks like how do you do energy policy on the topic?

337
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:07,330
By putting it on real quick. It's like who is best place to do something about monkeypox?

338
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:11,770
Vaccination is the White House, HHS.

339
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:18,260
You go to SEMA, you go to the FDA, the CDC, there's a lot of potential targets and it takes a lot of food.

340
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:29,600
So after it's hard and it's important, one of the takeaways I noticed is a lot of your neighborhood isolation,

341
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:33,240
and that's great because hate legislation is pretty effective.

342
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:38,160
It takes a very, very activist courts to say legislation doesn't say what it says.

343
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:44,220
We have activist courts, but nonetheless, legislation is still a pretty clear statement of intent.

344
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:48,590
The reason that people don't call for legislation is frequently that they don't.

345
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:53,270
It's going to pass the civil act. So in Michigan,

346
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:58,639
I think it was clever that the two groups who spoke about Michigan legislation were both on issues where you could

347
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:04,340
actually see ways in which a Democratic governor and a Republican in the House would actually be able to agree.

348
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:10,560
But there's a bunch of areas where the states have lost.

349
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:15,160
And obviously there's a bunch of areas where the United States federal legislature is completely gridlocked,

350
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:21,610
which is why you see more and more attention to executive actions on both sides and use of the courts.

351
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:29,330
So it's no accident that Donald Trump and Joe Biden are both extremely prolific with executive orders.

352
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:34,149
It's because the legislature is not going to do anything positively and the

353
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:39,790
legislature is unlikely to a around because they see legislators unlikely to do it.

354
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:53,140
So. Okay. Yes, I'll bring my. So I wasn't to see that.

355
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:57,760
So that seems to pass through my head.

356
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:04,510
But then what is that also essentially be 500 by five.

357
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:09,730
So what's the best way to go about cases with that?

358
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:18,200
And that is a nice example. By the way, did anybody notice that just happened? Plus even better.

359
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:22,760
It isn't just the Jubilee. It also includes policy changes.

360
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,170
You know, when I saw it, stop meetings, cancel your debt or not cancel the debt.

361
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:32,700
So there's also changes to the program going forward. So your answer is this is a technical one.

362
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:39,419
It's in the power of the White House because the legislation governing the student loans program says that

363
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:46,800
the debt held by the federal government so banks are not relevant to this can be modified as they choose.

364
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:53,540
So the pretty clear legislative clause, which could help to cancel all of our support, we believe cancel all of them.

365
00:55:53,540 --> 00:56:00,990
And we hope that. For whatever reason, the White House instead opted for the $10,000 for everybody, $20,000 Pell Grants,

366
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:08,410
which moved like all statistics, was half a million black families were prepared to deposit that wealth overnight.

367
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:15,310
So the big policy. But the trick was it was in the legislation for whatever reason,

368
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:22,330
that the executive branch had the ability to modify loans, and I suspect that was to allow them to do the payments.

369
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:29,000
But I can say that it didn't say limitations, and so they used it to represent ourselves.

370
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:33,520
That's the same politics that they also they get to pay for a couple of years down the road.

371
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,360
So. That's one of the many lessons the Chinese watch.

372
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:43,460
The legislation, the constraints. Right. So another example is go back to Mexico City policy.

373
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:48,710
The legislation says you cannot use U.S. foreign aid money to provide abortions abroad, period.

374
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:55,560
So. So all Mexico City policy stuff is about advice pertaining to abortions, right?

375
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:58,050
Because that's how much in the legislation.

376
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:03,510
So it's another case in which the executive orders operate in the spaces where the legislation doesn't work.

377
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:14,300
That's why, for example, under the Trump administration, a lot of those executive orders were orders to study ways to achieve a policy objective.

378
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:22,370
So President, his first day, he signed an executive order telling HHS to study ways to not enforce the Affordable Care Act.

379
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:33,030
Okay, studies. But obviously, as the entire first topics of the Trump administration showed, repealing the ACA was the actual objective study.

380
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:35,460
It was the administration and task force.

381
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:42,440
So that's kind of limitations of executive action are set by the regulation implications of what legislation,

382
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:46,530
although the reason a lot of people don't know what else we did last week.

383
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:53,270
So. Okay. In theory, we're 2 minutes early, so I have a burning question.

384
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:58,610
What would we have? Okay.

385
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:02,450
Well, there's also a lot of two pieces of advice.

386
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:11,060
I'll see you next week, by the way, all about our readers.

387
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:16,850
They're not third rate. They're third tier, meaning it's not a job that you use as a setting.

388
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:18,380
So the governor. Senator.
