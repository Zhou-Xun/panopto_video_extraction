1
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,920
Finally fed up. How are you guys doing? All right.

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,040
I'm about 80% back. Not quite there.

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,500
Lingering cold still. Good to see you. Just by way of logistics.

4
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:25,810
We are right now in the surface water unit, small lake models, mass balance, this kind of stuff.

5
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,040
It's going to be a little challenging mathematically and stuff like that.

6
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:35,230
Okay. But I'm going to walk you through all of it. So don't worry. Next week, fabric.

7
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,870
Already got plans. Okay, good.

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,000
And then a case study review this. Essentially dealing with any questions that you might have on the homework.

9
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,040
Okay. And I'm going to I poured you up in teams and we'll talk about that after the break.

10
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:01,780
Okay. And we'll start in on some of the discussion on the homework after the break as well.

11
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,200
Okay. Yeah. The assignments folder folder, this assignment there from 2019, you know, that's gone now.

12
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:15,550
It's updated now. Okay. I promised you three weeks to work on the assignment so the assignment won't be due until October 31.

13
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:26,770
Okay. So this is actually not too bad a plan because usually fall break occurs the week when the assignments do.

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,520
But now you've got it the week before. So you should be able to get together with your buddy.

15
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,500
Okay. And talk about how to do the assignment.

16
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:44,830
Okay. Probably we won't do too much on ground water until October 31.

17
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:51,340
Okay. But it depends. I intend to walk through some of the homework examples.

18
00:01:51,550 --> 00:02:00,670
Okay. But not going to write it up, obviously. My intention is you understand what's going on, that you can interpret the results.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,680
I don't expect you to be, you know, modeling geniuses at this point.

20
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,090
Okay. But I do want you to be able to understand what's going on. Okay.

21
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:19,490
That's the plan in terms of quizzes.

22
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:28,360
You're getting to where I want you to be. The fourth quiz, I think I printed it out here.

23
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:44,720
There's three one. It's weird to copy over.

24
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:51,200
Anyway, grades were like 90% to 100 in most cases, so I'm very happy with that.

25
00:02:51,620 --> 00:03:01,849
So that's where I'd like them to be. Don't sniff hopeless sniffle and there weren't any problems that I saw with any of them.

26
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:07,850
So that's that's really good. Okay. Any questions from last week before we start pulling ahead?

27
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:20,620
Okay. So again, on surface water quality, where we left off was just starting to look at some of the models.

28
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:30,670
And, you know, as I mentioned, we're first going to look at river models, which we're going to consider as one D models.

29
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,920
And again, the key here for me is to understand the assumptions that go into the models.

30
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,180
Okay. So you can interpret them. Okay.

31
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:45,100
So we're going to start off and build this simple model up in four stages.

32
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,860
So, okay, my depiction here is a1d process.

33
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:58,360
The river is flowing from left to right. We have a discharge and that discharge is assumed to have an outfall assumption.

34
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:03,370
This is the outfall such that mix completely. So we say it's fully mixed.

35
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,860
Okay. In the reverse direction that is across and also in the depth direction.

36
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,830
Okay. So my assumptions are continuous point source.

37
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,430
This discharge is occurring at a constant rate.

38
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,660
Nothing changes in time.

39
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:31,050
I'm going to assume steady state conditions which mathematically mean DCD or anything with a derivative with respect to time is zero.

40
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,170
No change. Okay. So that means the flow is constantly different as well.

41
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,490
Discharge is constant. Nothing else changes.

42
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:51,260
I'm going to say a conservative or non conservative contaminant and fully mixed alcohol will do both cases.

43
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,030
Okay, that's the ground zero level.

44
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:05,420
Everybody good? All right. Now, there's a number of ways to model this.

45
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:17,120
And mathematically, we define or control volume of delta X long the flows coming in or at Q in flow

46
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,940
re concentration in C and something happens inside the box and things flow up.

47
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:33,979
Okay. I'm not going to go too much into the math of this for you guys, but I can model this with this equation such that the change,

48
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:41,870
the discrete change over a discrete distance or a time solve for to solve for other things,

49
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,290
get a differential equation ultimately boiling down to this.

50
00:05:45,800 --> 00:06:00,020
Okay. But what this is representing here for a non-conservative source is that the K that occurs over time such that the concentration

51
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:08,390
is initially high boundary conditions for you and then it decays down shown by increasing intensity of the color in there.

52
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:17,260
So something's happening in this river segment to cause the contaminant to decrease in concentration.

53
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:25,570
What could that be? Why would the concentration decrease?

54
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:32,280
It's not conservative. Right. And why is it not conservative?

55
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:38,070
It could react. So it could just form some inner type of contact.

56
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,910
Okay. It could volatile lives. It could be lost from the system that way.

57
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,890
It could soared to the sentiment would be lost to the water column that way.

58
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:58,470
Okay. So these are different possibilities. And the key for us here is that with this kind of system, if, in fact,

59
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:08,330
the rate at which the material decays or drops in concentrations constant, then we can solve it with a rate constant.

60
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:19,020
K. Okay. And this is essentially providing us a first order decay for exponential decay, if you like.

61
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:27,120
And so this page sort of shows some similarities between distance and travel time.

62
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:36,360
So X over you, the distance downstream, divided by the river velocity gives us the travel time.

63
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:45,630
So if you're traveling in a meter per second and you're a thousand meters down, stream, 1000 seconds, it takes to get there.

64
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:56,010
And as I can determine t star where the travel time by simply taking x the distance, dividing it by new velocity.

65
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,070
Okay. So this seems all very trivial.

66
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:02,710
Okay.

67
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:14,070
But in fact, it's important because now we have a system which allows us to account for decay as a function of river flow or travel time or velocity.

68
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,980
All right. We good? Okay.

69
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,980
Now, we also assumed a well-mixed outfall assumption.

70
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:33,300
This is a fiction. Okay. Some examples of more realistic falls are shown here.

71
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,000
We have a pipe discharges. It doesn't move to the other end of the water.

72
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:48,270
It doesn't reach the shore. And when we look at the cross-section, this is the sediment layer, the water table shown with the symbol here.

73
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,870
This is an important symbol, a triangle with some bars under it.

74
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,040
That's the height of the water. We use that a lot in groundwater, especially.

75
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,260
Many plumes are elevated in temperature.

76
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:07,860
So, for example, if you take your wastewater discharge, it's going to be warmer than ambient typically.

77
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:13,410
Okay. And water that's warm will rise. And so it kind of comes to the surface.

78
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,310
And so it's not mixed uniformly in the vertical direction either.

79
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:30,790
Okay. This is called the near field zone where we don't have complete mixing in the vertical or the horizontal.

80
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,890
Okay. The near field zone is really important. Why?

81
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,390
Your little fish swimming around you because it has, like, the most content.

82
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:50,330
Exactly. Okay, so if you're a little fish swimming around, you get into this area.

83
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:55,790
Bad news. Okay. And so we really care about these near field zones.

84
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,930
And in fact, Michigan has water quality criteria just for themselves.

85
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,860
Cause you can go to find the near fields. Yeah.

86
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,960
Close to discharge. We're going to have incomplete mixing.

87
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:18,020
That's the near field so far from the discharge.

88
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:22,070
But downstream, as depicted here, it's going to be well-mixed.

89
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:29,270
So I can't give you I can't say it's 100 meters because it's going to depend on the situation.

90
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:47,510
So we've known about this stuff for a long time. The most outstanding example I can remember is Boston.

91
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:56,180
I mean, if you guys have been to Boston Harbor, Boston Bay, Deer Point is the wastewater discharge for the whole region.

92
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,840
It used to just be a primary treatment plant. You know what that means?

93
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:08,840
Basically would settle out the big chunks, pieces of wood, stones and stuff that came down in an arrest would just be dumped into the harbor.

94
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,140
Okay. Causing, you know, a lot of pollution.

95
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:24,860
So what they did was they put an outfall pipe, I forget, four or five miles out, but that still had a great big near field zone.

96
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:32,990
So then what they did was they put the pipe down, but then they put jets like every 100 meters along the pipe to sort of dilute it more.

97
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:40,280
Okay. So that's just an example to try to spread the pollution out, to reduce the maximum concentration.

98
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:50,020
Now, of course, they have secondary and tertiary treatment. So the amount of damage, the amount of sewage dunkers is much lower.

99
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,280
Question. Okay.

100
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:01,400
So as I mentioned, Michigan has water quality standards just for the mixing zone.

101
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,540
And the text of the Rule 82 is here.

102
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:16,100
And it basically says that exposure and mixing zones shall not cause deleterious effects to aquatic life or wildlife.

103
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:27,550
And then at the bottom of this text, the area of mixing zone shall be minimized.

104
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:35,590
You know, in all my reading of Michigan legislation, this is the first time I ever saw, shall I to say.

105
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:42,700
And so to this end, mixing devices or devices for rapid mixing, dilution and dispersion are encouraged.

106
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:51,220
And the idea of sort of event or a discharge along a pipe is an example of a device like that.

107
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:10,270
Okay. Good. Okay.

108
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:23,420
So the example in that last picture was a point source discharges at a single identifiable point.

109
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:38,120
This applies to lots of things like industrial operations, often sewage outfalls, and we typically express the discharge rate in mass per time units.

110
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,850
Okay, so many pounds per day or tons per day.

111
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:52,160
Now non-point sources or distributed sources are very important to understand how they work.

112
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:09,770
This is typically said to discuss nutrients that runoff from land and suburban areas and agricultural land sometimes called a line source.

113
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:16,580
What's really best called non-point source. These tend to be very dynamic.

114
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:25,640
I mean, if you have a rainfall event and you get overland flow, you get a lot of stuff dumped in all of a sudden tends not to be steady state.

115
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:33,350
That's quite variable. Another type of distributed source is from the air.

116
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,020
And basically we'll talk more about this in the air unit.

117
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,260
But contaminants in the air will settle into surfaces.

118
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:52,969
The gravitational forces, the particles are going to sink and then depositional forces that even if the it's a gas,

119
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:58,460
it will contact the surface and then be absorbed into the the terrain or the water.

120
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,620
And we have things.

121
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:16,160
Uh. External, internal and volumetric sources are really not that important for us.

122
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:23,180
Okay. So here's an example. Again, you know, agricultural land or run off.

123
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:36,510
Here we have a deposition into the air and so forth in the Great Lakes region.

124
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:41,820
And I meant to bring in a map showing the catchment basins of the Great Lakes.

125
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:50,970
It's really quite interesting. Agricultural runoff is a big issue and it can result in eutrophication.

126
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:59,370
Basically the excess amount of nutrients or fertilizers causing excess growth of

127
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:07,680
bacteria and the retention of these types of sources we model in a similar sort of way.

128
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:15,450
Again, here's my reactor volume. I have a flow coming into the river flow coming out of the defined concentration.

129
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,350
You're going to have the discharges coming in along the bank of the stream.

130
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:28,140
The way I discuss the discharge rate now is defined differently.

131
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:40,200
I have basically the amount of coming in from the side, and that is going to depend on the distance as well as the intensity.

132
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,970
And sometimes I divide this by the cross-sectional river area.

133
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:56,980
And realistically, you should just recognize that, you know, a small amount has jumped in all along.

134
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,960
So that's the key point. Okay.

135
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,299
I give some math.

136
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:11,870
I'm not too crazy about the math, but the result that I care about for you to understand is how the concentration builds up in that segment.

137
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:19,670
Therefore, I have the same amount being dumped in at each point,

138
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:29,150
and I make the assumption that it's conservative and then make assumption that the river volume is the same.

139
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:34,880
The river's flow is the same. Then for every increment I go downstream.

140
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:40,160
The concentration increases during the week. So that makes sense.

141
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:48,479
So we're starting off at some level soon more maybe for the first kilometer,

142
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:56,250
we put in one kilometer, one kilogram per day, second kilometer, one kilogram per day and so forth.

143
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,880
And so which is going to double for double distance and so forth.

144
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:09,420
The key idea here is conservative contaminant and nothing else changes.

145
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,560
The flows are the same, the river volume is the same, so forth.

146
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:29,120
And when I get to the end, let's say, of the discharge from the end of my agricultural area, no additional inputs are coming in.

147
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:40,910
So then I question my flat now. Okay, this is a crazy model because reality is not so simple.

148
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,660
In fact, most of the time we're concerned with nitrogen and phosphorus.

149
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,520
These are nutrients. These are not conservative. Okay?

150
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:56,450
They are used to metabolize carbon and so they're used up.

151
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:08,660
Okay. But under this very simple situation, we can actually represent the concentration and location X is the initial concentration times,

152
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:14,570
the source overview ratio, which is defined with the prior terms.

153
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:18,410
Yeah. Could I ask about the units really quick?

154
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,100
Mm hmm. I do.

155
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:30,020
And this one? Yeah, I guess, like four years cubed and then it's end mass.

156
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:35,570
Yeah. M is mass. L is length. So length to land cubed is a volume.

157
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:40,750
Sorry. Yeah. Sorry. It could be any volumetric you.

158
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,730
Thanks for the source. I'm sorry. Yeah. The source source is like pollution.

159
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:51,860
Right? Right. And then. So for each increment that goes downstream source, we're.

160
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,550
The concentration of the source is increasing. Exactly.

161
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,540
And I'm going to show you a completely different way to think about this as well. Okay.

162
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,780
Which is I think I always enjoyed this other approach.

163
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:13,970
So here, instead of assuming that the contaminant is discharged all along, let's just say it's occurring in three locations.

164
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,170
Okay. And I take the equivalent amount of sewage or whatever,

165
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,090
and I split into thirds and I put the first, third here, second, third and the third, third there.

166
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,160
And then I make the assumption fully mixed, all that kind of good stuff.

167
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:33,710
And so I have a flow starting off with zero. I get the discharge from the first source pops up.

168
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,150
Nothing happens to the second source, but the third source pops up.

169
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:43,340
Okay. So this is kind of like a incremental or piecemeal approach.

170
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:53,870
And instead of having three sources, let's say I did ten or 100 or thousand, when I get to a large enough number, I'll get this line back.

171
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:03,680
Makes sense. So we know the exact solution.

172
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:09,040
The blue line. The red line is an approximation as the number of sources goes to infinity.

173
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:30,570
It should be the same line. The reason I do this is because I can take the model that I didn't explain to you live when you were watching the video.

174
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:42,660
The reactor model had my flow coming in initially being discharged going into the second reactor, third reactor and so forth.

175
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:50,940
Okay. And I can basically concatenate or put those reactors together and then model really complex processes in the river.

176
00:21:54,630 --> 00:22:04,380
This approach in some ways is better because I know how to handle chemistry in here and other things, deposition and so forth.

177
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:18,820
We'll come back to this, but. This is starting to be a building block of a realistic model.

178
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:29,020
Okay. For the so-called internal or distributed sources.

179
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:35,920
Instead of having a discharge along the side, it would be along an area, typically the top.

180
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,960
The units are a little bit different.

181
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:47,890
If I'm talking about deposition from the air, I might be talking about grams per meter squared per second day or something like that.

182
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:55,120
Okay, otherwise it's modeled the same way this the source term has a different unit.

183
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:09,610
Okay. Those are all some examples. And then we got to talk about something that's more realistic.

184
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:15,580
Okay. The idea that something is conservative is a very strong assumption.

185
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:23,800
Let's consider something that's not conservative. Mathematically, we have our governing equation.

186
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:31,210
The change in concentration, perspective, distance, times, the river flow is equal to the source term.

187
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:37,120
That's the conservative part. Adding on this minus KC is a first order reaction.

188
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:45,340
This is an approximation, but often very good. If I saw this in a general case, this is the solution I get.

189
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,060
You need this for the homework. Okay.

190
00:23:49,330 --> 00:24:02,090
And I'm going to walk you through all of this. So now we have our golf course going from here to here, discharging into the stream.

191
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:08,880
All the good nitrogen and phosphorus that runs off the concentration doesn't build up linearly.

192
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:14,550
Instead, it has this approach to an exponential in levels off.

193
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:22,080
This is really the key point of this hour's lecture.

194
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:28,080
Why does that happen? Why does it level off?

195
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:42,230
What's going on? I'll explain a couple of different ways, but I do want your input.

196
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:48,080
Okay. Initially we put in a certain amount of concentration built up relatively high.

197
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,210
A certain amount of that is going into K at minus KC rate.

198
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,030
The higher the concentration, the higher the decay.

199
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:06,770
And okay, so as the concentration builds up, more, more and more decays at some point when it starts to level off,

200
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,790
as much is going to decay as I'm putting into it into that segment.

201
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:17,670
And at that point, it levels off. Does that makes sense?

202
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:24,030
You went up and won? Yeah, I go over it a lot more times because I want you to get it.

203
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:32,970
Let's say I'm putting in a kilogram per kilometer of nitrogen concentration is going to boost.

204
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,500
But let's say my K is point one.

205
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:42,630
So 10% of that nitrogen in that segment will also decay.

206
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:53,370
So at the end of this, roughly speaking, one kilometer segment, I'll have an additional point nine kilograms of oxygen of nitrogen in the system.

207
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:58,710
Okay. Let's say I go down ten kilometers.

208
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,540
The concentration now is about ten times higher.

209
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:10,740
I put in another kilogram because the concentration is ten times higher.

210
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:16,980
Instead of losing 0.1 of one kilogram, I'm going to lose 0.1 of ten kilograms.

211
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,140
So I'm going to lose almost a four kilogram and it starts to level off.

212
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:35,700
Let me give you another example. This one is dumb.

213
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:39,910
I burned myself on a toaster on the weekend. Okay.

214
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:40,750
It's really stupid.

215
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:48,130
I mean, I know how, you know, you heat metal that stays warm and stuff like that and it just reads to try to make a little bandage.

216
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,490
But many of you have a frying pan at home, right?

217
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:57,820
And you fry food, right? Or whatever it may be that.

218
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:03,760
What do you call the main part of the pan? 200 degrees.

219
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,910
300 degrees. Right. And you grab the handle. Right.

220
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,950
Let's say it's a metal handle that metal handles cooler.

221
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,080
Right? Better be right.

222
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:24,640
Why is it cooler? Because it's further away from the site.

223
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:33,570
Yeah. And. There was less concentration.

224
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,190
Yeah. I mean, it's the temperatures all we're dealing with.

225
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:44,100
So you're getting a certain heat flow from the pan down to the handle.

226
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:52,530
Right. And if you didn't have any loss of heat, then hand handle would eventually be the same temperature as the rest of the pan.

227
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,580
But the handle is radiating off the temperature to the air.

228
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:08,730
Okay. So the further you go down the handle, it is kind of like further going down here, the more is being radiated off.

229
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:13,770
And at some point you reach a steady state. Same comes in as it goes off.

230
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:20,880
So the temperature won't change. And then as you go further down, you know you're going to lose more heat.

231
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,810
So there's a heat analogy to the mass analogy.

232
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:30,540
We can talk about heat flux or content mass flux. I mean, almost the same way mathematically.

233
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:36,930
Is it because there's more water at the rear, but we're less pissed off than like in the beginning with Spurs?

234
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:41,090
No, not in this case, because we're assuming that the flow is the same.

235
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:57,640
Yeah. Wait, so you wanted the concentration being added and part of the concentration being removed from,

236
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,960
like, the decay and then subtracting those that would be.

237
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:08,940
Exactly. Yeah. So it's kind of like the binary aerosol model in the same way because we added stuff in and we lost stuff as well.

238
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:13,080
Okay. When those two balance, then there's no change.

239
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,940
I'm going to give you another example of dissolved oxygen in a minute. Okay.

240
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:27,270
But this is the sort of concept of at any point here, the concentration that resolves is a balance between what's going in and what's being lost.

241
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:33,590
So whole mass balance idea that.

242
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:43,319
So this particular case approached steady state because the source went on for a very long

243
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:48,660
time and at some point what I'm dumping in is exactly the same as what's coming out.

244
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:52,770
So, I mean, balance, this is again, an assumption.

245
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:58,110
In most cases, we have finite sources. So the source is only this long.

246
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,660
We have the same approach to a steady state concentration, but we never reach it.

247
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:10,140
There's still a flow going on. And then at the end of the discharge, we have the decay coming down.

248
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:21,180
And again, the virus role model had the same sort of thing. This is now in space by aerosol models over time.

249
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,829
The steady state level is defined with the parameters.

250
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:30,990
If we put them into the correct units of s, hoover, k k is the two k constant.

251
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:36,630
You may or may not get a steady state depending on how long the source is.

252
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,600
Again, we'd like to be at steady state because it makes it easy to analyze.

253
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:45,060
But, you know, the physical situation dictates what actually happens.

254
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:56,110
Okay. So this is a situation for a finite, non-conservative source.

255
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:05,740
We're good with this. All right. So let's apply some of these concepts to a1d river model.

256
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:13,630
Typically what we have is a river which is broken into sections we call sections reaches.

257
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,530
Each reach has its own hydrologic features.

258
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:33,340
Typically, we assume the same flow and reach the same channel wind temperature and amount of algae or roughness coefficient velocity turbulence.

259
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,920
If things change, we set up a new range.

260
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:50,300
This is really convenient because we could say in this reach we use a model and it's got consistent parameters, so it's relatively easy to deal with.

261
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,770
And I forgot to mention each reach may have sourced from multiple sources.

262
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:08,180
As an example in a classic textbook type of thing.

263
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:14,719
Here we have a bay, we have a river, we have a tidal, Embayment River, continuous.

264
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,460
It's actually going to be flowing down this way.

265
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,060
But of course, due to tides, we may have back and forth in some of these reaches and back and forth with May,

266
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:28,880
we can break that up into our reaches as shown here.

267
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:39,050
And again, we'd want to characterize all those hydro, physical, chemical, biological parameters for each one of those reaches.

268
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:53,570
This list is just some of the things that was important up to this point.

269
00:32:53,580 --> 00:33:04,550
And I think we've talked about those and more to move on to week's question.

270
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:16,320
So before we do that, this kind of reach development has been done for most of the rivers in the country

271
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,430
because we have to come up with the T models to total maximum daily loads.

272
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:28,200
And so a river like here on river might have 100 or so reaches and it's been characterized in models like that.

273
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:43,740
Yeah. Within each reach as they like it, the margin for the depth could be like 60 to 80.

274
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:50,310
It was really not that large. But the 1665, the river might change.

275
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:54,370
No, absolutely everything can change as a function of time. Okay.

276
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:58,650
And so that's one of the really neat things about these models, is that they're dynamic.

277
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:04,080
They're not steady state. So coming up with all the parameters that you need for a single reach,

278
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:10,440
including sort of seasonal adjustments, it's a massive task and lots of uncertainty as well.

279
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:17,600
Look lake models for small leak water.

280
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:22,020
Why can't we use this whole mixing zone approach?

281
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:30,830
Just model it as a fully stored reactor. We understand how the math of this works really well as shown here.

282
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:35,300
I know how to get a calculator solution shown here.

283
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:42,110
And I could represent the steady state solution or solution as a function of time.

284
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:46,190
Just by plugging in. Chugging with that equation. No problem.

285
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:52,670
Okay. And we'll do that. And one of the homeworks, I think from before.

286
00:34:53,090 --> 00:35:05,850
It's a small leak model. The assumptions to this are that and this is what I want you to learn.

287
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:10,230
Okay? We know the volume.

288
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,680
The dimensions doesn't change. We know the flows in.

289
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:23,489
We know the reaction rate to see previous columns to see is constant.

290
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,810
Q Is constant for this model. Okay.

291
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,620
And we assume with this little propeller that it's fully mixed.

292
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,670
Okay. So those are the strong assumptions that go into this whole.

293
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,200
We a couple of things. Even though I'm trying to de-emphasize some of the math, it's really hard to.

294
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:06,270
TDI is defined as the detention time in the lake, the volume over the float.

295
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:15,210
If the volume is cubic a thousand cubic meters and flow coming in is ten cubic meters per second.

296
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:22,979
By those we get 100 seconds as the detention time in awake contract example.

297
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:39,890
But just to understand how the two work. The term looks kind of like the key term that we saw in the prior model, and it includes the key term,

298
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:46,780
which would be the term or the I'm sorry, the detention time when we really went over to.

299
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:51,620
Sorry. Okay. So just the parameter rise.

300
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:56,480
This Lake Michigan has a detention time of 99.1 years.

301
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:03,650
More or less. The flow coming out of that goes into Lake Huron, which is much smaller as detention time still quite long.

302
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:08,240
22.6 years. Okay. The flows are shown here.

303
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:14,360
Can I use this model, small weight model for Lake Michigan?

304
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:19,730
No chance. These are not small lakes. These are gigantic lakes.

305
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,230
Okay. So I can't do that. Okay. Completely wrong.

306
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:29,420
It's not applicable to large lakes. So we have to think about how lakes look.

307
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,580
Even moderate sized lakes tend to be vertically stratified.

308
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:46,750
We have a vertical profile here above the thermocline, which is a zone where the temperature changes rapidly.

309
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,680
We have a linear and a hyper linear.

310
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:58,300
And you guys, if you go wading into a river or a lake or on the shore, you go from these warm temperatures, very cold temperatures.

311
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:03,250
Okay. And it's thermally stratified. So that change is quite rapid.

312
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:11,170
What that structure does is really minimize the amount of mixing between the upper and lower compartments.

313
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:20,740
Okay. If you have a particle, a dead diatom or something, it's just going to think that we'll move through the equilibrium.

314
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:30,910
But for example, oxygen which is dissolved in the water, may be prevented from moving just because there's not much flow or much current vertically.

315
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:39,940
So this is a vertical stratification, and we may need to analyze this these two compartments separately.

316
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:45,880
This picture also shows the sediment compartment, which, of course, can be very important as well.

317
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:57,069
Horizontal structure is also important. And if you take a large lake here's we're using a cookie cutter or pie cutter approach.

318
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:04,450
We have four different sections. Each has its own flow, turbulence, so forth.

319
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:12,970
And then I have an upper and lower compartment, and then I have flows between adjacent compartments as well as the ones that are above or below.

320
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:19,150
So here I'm taking a leak and I stratified it into eight segments or compartments.

321
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:25,000
I can't use my fully mixed model anymore for this. Okay.

322
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:32,200
I could use eight of them. Each one of these representing its own would flows to the other that it connects to.

323
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,340
So there's no analytical solution to this. It's too complicated. I have to do something fancier on the computer.

324
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:52,010
Even if I only have one inflow and one outflow, I still need to represent all the complexity in this model.

325
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,940
So in the Great Lakes and other large lakes,

326
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:11,280
much of the surface current is determined by the winds occurring in the winds over large areas can really very a.

327
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:24,240
We spent a lot of last summer actually looking at winds mostly in our neck of the woods over here a little bit here.

328
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:27,750
Really complicated. Okay.

329
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:31,020
I mean, we have high pressure. Low pressure is a measure of the scale.

330
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:35,160
But then we have land, sea interface that influences how things occur.

331
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:43,590
And so it's really quite complicated. In the Great Lakes area, we do have a lot of forecasting in numerical models.

332
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:53,040
Take those observations and really home down and you can get a very precise prediction at wherever you want.

333
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,820
This was an example of lake sort of circulation works in Lake Michigan.

334
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:20,120
You guys don't work. That's too bad. You know, it's a shame.

335
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:27,379
It's a cool circulation pattern showing you how dynamic the surface currents change rapidly.

336
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:32,150
They change over time. I'm not quite sure what the work of the work.

337
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:42,290
Maybe a few years worth of her.

338
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,650
But. It should be embedded in here.

339
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:02,490
Do. Look my office right here.

340
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:13,860
Anyway, this is actually really interesting because the typical circulation pattern from it can be reversed.

341
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:25,290
And there are a number of cases where, for example, Chicago, which would be down here somewhere, has its water intake above the sewage discharge.

342
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,520
And if that reverses, then you're going to be bringing sewage into the water intake.

343
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:33,300
Okay. And so this is obviously a big problem.

344
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:37,950
And the dynamics here are really interesting.

345
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:44,940
I don't know if there's. Anyway, you try one more thing.

346
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:54,330
I don't think this is on the Web. And see.

347
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:17,360
Footage of the surprise appearance from. Okay.

348
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:23,390
Last topic for the first part today is talking about dissolved oxygen.

349
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:31,100
Michigan, like I think most or all other states, has water quality standards just for dissolved oxygen.

350
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:34,740
Michigan standards are not the same as other states.

351
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:40,770
These are state standards, seven milligrams per liter in the upper half of the hyperkalemia.

352
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:47,850
That's the bottom part. Okay. And seven milligrams per liter throughout the AP linear.

353
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:54,320
Okay. Why do we care about the dissolved oxygen?

354
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:03,769
He's a different species. Absolutely. I mean, you need to breathe, right?

355
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:07,760
And fish need to breathe and so forth. So it's really quite critical.

356
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:19,280
The standards go on in cold lakes. Seven, again, four other lakes, including smaller inland lakes, five milligrams.

357
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:33,530
Okay. So that's sort of the goal, 5 to 7. EPA has been concerned and a lot of other people about dissolved oxygen for many years.

358
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:39,710
This is sort of a picture of sources of sinks or a mass balance and the picture of where the.

359
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:49,020
You can have a point and one point sources that affect the body.

360
00:44:51,560 --> 00:45:01,770
That's a dead fish, I guess, upside down. You can have sinks on the body, too, to take gradations that way and absorption.

361
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:10,110
Essentially what we're going to do is model oxygen as a mass using a mass balance approach.

362
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:21,450
Typically, we talk about biological oxygen and as the amount of oxygen that's consumed by microorganisms when metabolizing carbon,

363
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:30,180
okay, we're organic matter water quality folks have been measuring body for many years.

364
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:37,780
They define the ultimate body as that determined by taking a liter of water,

365
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:44,130
putting in a sealed container for five days, measuring the amount of oxygen,

366
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:51,600
letting it go for 15 more days and at 20 degrees C and measuring the amount of oxygen consumed,

367
00:45:52,440 --> 00:46:02,640
the amount that is the difference between the saturated oxygen level and the actual oxygen level is known as the dog or dissolved oxygen deficit.

368
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,200
So water at what, 15 degrees C can hold?

369
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:14,550
What about ten milligrams per liter of oxygen? Something like that.

370
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:23,190
Okay. And if you have a deficit of five, then you're just at five milligrams per liter.

371
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:30,940
So the dissolved oxygen demand where I'm sorry, dissolved oxygen concentrations,

372
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:36,010
the difference between the saturated level and then the amount consumed by respiration.

373
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:42,850
So you lose oxygen from there. And then if you have rearranged and you're putting oxygen back in, you add that piece.

374
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:51,250
So it's a simple mass balance right there. So we set this up mathematically as a function of time.

375
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:55,960
We multiply the oxygen concentration by the volume.

376
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:06,490
This gives us a mass up here because A V times C or A concentrations of volume and it's basically the amount that we generate from re aeration.

377
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:12,460
What's rich and what's rearranging oxygen.

378
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:19,180
Yeah. Putting oxygen in from a surface or just a direct transfer from the air to the water.

379
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,680
We put it in by photosynthesis. We lose it by respiration.

380
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:29,170
We lose it when we react with carbonaceous materials that demand oxygen to oxidize.

381
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:36,010
Same thing for nitrogen. The sediment may suck up some oxygen as well.

382
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:43,089
And then we can have transport of oxygen from a tributary or other source, and that can be positive or negative.

383
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:52,390
But it's coming in or leaving the system. Okay.

384
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:58,570
So we have a body model. I'm going to walk you through this and we'll take a break.

385
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:08,590
The body model says typically that we have l is our oxygen demand, a certain amount of oxygen that's required for wastewater.

386
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:13,060
This can be quite large. It could be 50 milligrams per liter.

387
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:21,220
Okay. That's going to decay exponentially using a first order reaction rate as shown here.

388
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:28,390
And typically the oxygenation rate constants are fractions of days 0.12.8.

389
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:34,240
So we can solve this, we get the exponential decay.

390
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:41,830
And basically we have the time as shown here for the biological oxygen demand to essentially disappear.

391
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:51,730
Okay. It's just being used. The reiteration rate is really variable.

392
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:58,090
Here's a case of, you know, the surface being covered with algae and flying.

393
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:02,830
Not much contact with the air. Directly rearranging is going to be very slow.

394
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:08,020
Here's a case, you know, bubbling through all these rocks, lots of turnover,

395
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:13,660
lots of contact area between the water in the air, rearranging rates going to be very high.

396
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:22,630
This is an interesting equation for reparation because it's the first time we've seen a gradient here.

397
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:30,500
It is complicated. So here we have the amount of oxygen taken up for time is a key to rearranging rate.

398
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:39,160
Constant times. The difference between the dissolved oxygen water dissolved oxygen level in the water in the saturated level.

399
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:46,420
So if you have very little oxygen in the water, then this difference is large.

400
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:57,760
Rearranging will be effective. As your concentration builds up to approach the dissolved oxygen saturation level, rearrangement rates go to zero.

401
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:10,020
So already saturated. Note the large range of key too, depending on the character of the stream.

402
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,020
All right. Now what?

403
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:28,890
Streeter Phelps did a long time ago was they put together these two sets of equations, the dissolved oxygen deficit and the oxygen balance.

404
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:34,980
And again, no one took you through the math, but it's these two differential equations.

405
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:41,460
They solve them, and the results that they got are depicted in this picture.

406
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:49,430
And basically upstream we have dissolved oxygen levels that are very high.

407
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:57,080
We have a discharge, lot of oxygen consuming material being dumped in waste.

408
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:03,109
And so we have the red line representing the dissolved of the body.

409
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:07,190
I'm sorry, the amount of biological oxygen demand is very high.

410
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:11,810
As this is consuming oxygen, the oxygen level falls.

411
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:17,930
Okay, that oxygen level falling is called oxygen sag.

412
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:24,650
And in this zone, we call it composition zone, where we're decomposing some of the body.

413
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:31,040
We have a real degradation in the water quality. So we get what we call trash fish living here.

414
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:38,150
And then we can approach a septic region where we don't have much oxygen at all.

415
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:48,290
Certainly we're not meeting the water quality standard in this picture, which we want it to be five or seven in terms of pool of dissolved oxygen.

416
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:59,630
Okay. As we move further downstream, we have now more is consumed most of the body.

417
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:04,140
So the body is no longer trying to suck the oxygen out.

418
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:09,680
And we have relocation from the surface primarily and maybe some photosynthesis,

419
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:14,420
which is starting to produce enough oxygen so that levels start to go back up.

420
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:20,570
And so we have a recovery in this zone here.

421
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:25,670
And then ultimately, we approach more or less conditions that we started with.

422
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:34,770
This is the so-called oxygen SAG curve. Right.

423
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:48,420
And it's a result of the balance between oxygen consuming sources, primarily the body that's pumped in and oxygen producing or transfer sources,

424
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:53,640
primarily regulation from a surface and maybe some photosynthesis.

425
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:04,520
Okay. How are we doing?

426
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:19,400
So if you guys walk past our wastewater treatment plant, which is on Carpenter Road near the Huron River, you know, where I 23 crosses.

427
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,730
You can actually walk back there.

428
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:31,570
You'll see this kind of area where it's kind of muddy and there's not a whole lot of diversity of fish or aquatic life even.

429
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:38,050
And you're looking pretty much at 97 years old, but it's certainly not a high quality region.

430
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:42,730
Okay. And as you go further downstream, things start to pick up.

431
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:59,580
Okay. Let's take a break. 5 minutes, and on your way in, I'll put out two things for you to pick up.

432
00:54:01,920 --> 00:55:59,070
If I thought. They should be different, right?

433
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:19,800
Yeah. So the question is to make sure I'm understanding this correctly.

434
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:28,380
Sure. So I believe means that you have high consumption of oxygen and that's why the oxygen decreases.

435
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:43,440
Right. Right. So, for example, if you took the waste coming from a wastewater treatment plant, the body of that could be like 50 milligrams per liter.

436
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:45,000
Mm hmm. Okay.

437
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:58,020
And what that means is it's going to take 50 liters to dilute that, to provide enough oxygen to actually take that carbon and change it into CO2.

438
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:03,180
Okay, great. That's an astounding amount of waste. That's very normal.

439
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:09,360
And. Regret this, right?

440
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:18,720
The newspaper clippings? Yeah. Yeah.

441
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:27,120
The other reason that's a good question is because, I mean, if you take a liter of water and it's only got milligrams of oxygen, it's not much at all.

442
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:33,860
You know, there is 20%. Right. But our water is nine milligrams per liter.

443
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:49,720
Right. That's nothing. Yeah. So what would you say?

444
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:55,930
That's the Rio de Janeiro scene is happening because of the reiteration.

445
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:02,050
It's getting concerned. We talk about being divided properly.

446
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:11,890
Okay. And so, yeah, I mean, it's decreasing, but it's mainly decreasing because it's being reenacted in the terrible.

447
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:24,310
And it needs oxygen to do that. So that we have time for you.

448
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:31,160
Do you? That means high consumption, which leads to low levels of oxygen.

449
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:40,520
So we're supposed to splurge. Let me put it another way.

450
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:45,740
The oxygen level will come up if we're putting in more oxygen and we're consuming.

451
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:58,100
Right. Okay. And that can happen by lots of waste taking out the waste so we don't consume that much oxygen or adding oxygen.

452
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:07,190
And so one of the things that you'll see in many little ponds is the water being sprayed out and little water fountain.

453
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:10,120
Yeah. All right. Why are they doing that? Or maybe it looks pretty.

454
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:16,280
But basically, you know, when they put the water in droplets, there's not the surface area.

455
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:22,010
And so oxygen goes into a field. By the time they drop, it lands, it's saturated with oxygen.

456
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:31,780
So that's one or. I'm not familiar with any place doing it here,

457
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:39,430
but sometimes they'll be blowers that in fact bubble air into the bottom of a lake or pond to do the same sort of thing.

458
01:01:26,530 --> 01:02:16,460
The. No.

459
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:28,300
Okay. Move towards the back. What I thought might be good is to look at the groups of broken units appears.

460
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:33,650
And I think we have a few people absent. Okay.

461
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:43,500
You're with Sarah. Okay. And the first Caesar came for Victoria and Catherine.

462
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:47,970
And if you guys wanted to get together, that might be good.

463
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:55,080
Okay. And we can just have a discussion about the first part of the work, which is the New York Times article that I copied for you there.

464
01:02:56,490 --> 01:03:04,770
And if you don't know each other, this might be a good time just to meet as well and sort of work out logistics for doing the homework.

465
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:10,680
So that listing is on the assignment one.

466
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:25,440
So Anna marie is with Liana and Diane is with Julianna and Taylor is with Patrick and Daniella is with Andrew and Ian is with Bernard.

467
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:30,450
Are we doing that now? Yeah. Let's do that now for just a sec.

468
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:40,190
For a few minutes. Patrick, not everybody is here with me.

469
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:47,510
Yeah, when you're with Anna marie.

470
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:53,430
Well, yeah, and I don't think she's here.

471
01:03:55,500 --> 01:04:03,890
So you're on your own right now? Oh, yeah. Sense for him.

472
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:09,200
Yeah. Yeah, you know.

473
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:15,320
Oh, but you did. Yeah. So you're a pair. You're enjoying the day, huh?

474
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:26,920
Yeah, he is. That's beautiful. And you threw out with anybody, huh?

475
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:31,729
Oh, that's weird. Well, why don't you get together anyway?

476
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:41,720
So. I mean, basically this is a grouping between the IHS and systems.

477
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:51,610
Okay. So I don't know what to tell you, but join up in whatever.

478
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:55,380
It's just for discussion. Okay. You didn't have your.

479
01:04:56,510 --> 01:05:05,190
Oh, she's coming. Yeah. So on the weekend, environmental impact statements made New York Times.

480
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:12,210
Okay. And that's the article that I gave you. And so it's an unusual one.

481
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:18,000
And read the article, and then let's have a discussion about it.

482
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:24,990
Because I'm sorry, but your name's not on there.

483
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:28,200
Yeah. You're not on canvas.

484
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:33,330
How could that be? I say I'm okay.

485
01:05:45,740 --> 01:06:00,950
Weird. Yeah.

486
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:18,950
Zuzu. But you. It's really weird.

487
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:24,640
You know, I looked at it this morning and you weren't there. So that's.

488
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:29,650
That's really strange. Okay. My fault. Maybe I didn't get to the second page or something like that, but.

489
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:34,090
Okay. So why don't you. Are you three all or what?

490
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:40,300
When she was here and you're all your bosses, right? Of course.

491
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:44,280
Okay. And how about you? Where are you? Yeah, that's right.

492
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:49,540
Yeah. So why don't you just the two of you pair up and to beat her up and keep us from.

493
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:57,850
I'm sorry I didn't. I shouldn't have missed you. I don't know what happened.

494
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:45,310
Senators want to spend about 10 minutes on this exercise here. Take a look at this article and.

495
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:53,150
The questions for this are on the number one on the homework.

496
01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:02,650
So just maybe, you should be glad you don't have to read this whole report.

497
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:10,150
And that's 900 pages, plus two sets of appendices just as big.

498
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:15,370
And I was asked to review portions of this.

499
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:18,490
I did a little bit, but not very much.

500
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:24,430
I mean, this is a massive problem right now. I don't know if any of you have been in New York recently, but it's like gridlock.

501
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:30,670
Okay, everybody coming back to drive and you know, nobody's getting anywhere at all.

502
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:44,360
And what do you think of this idea? The governor of New Jersey.

503
01:10:45,650 --> 01:10:50,870
Murphy doesn't like it. The MTA loves it.

504
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:57,440
Right? Won lots of money. Lots of money and $1,000,000,000, maybe a year.

505
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:08,299
MTA loves it. Maybe buy some new stuff and get the trains rolling again with the MTA.

506
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:15,410
Be responsible for construction of what the roads or the subways and like we like and able to use that money to update some of the infrastructure.

507
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:19,150
Yeah. Not the roads, but the subways and the busses and trains.

508
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:20,570
Yeah. Yeah.

509
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:27,560
And what the article says, they have a two and a half or so billion dollar deficit every year because people don't want to ride the subway,

510
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:32,330
you know, not crime, but COVID, but whatever.

511
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:37,670
But, I mean, look at these streets. You're not going anywhere right now.

512
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:44,780
I think it's really interesting that article mentioned like if told tolls would cause harm to the environment.

513
01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:51,280
Just like how you know. Yeah. How is that going to happen? Why?

514
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:59,170
Since I like total shopping. Certain places if you have to pay a.

515
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:08,480
So the harm is that you bypass somehow Manhattan and you go somewhere else, right?

516
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:17,370
Is that what you think they mean? You know, I wasn't sure about that.

517
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:25,500
What's the downside of this? Should be good for equity, right?

518
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:31,770
People can use the poor. People can use the metro and get the places better.

519
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:46,880
I'm not like super familiar with the public transportation, like in terms of like New York, New Jersey.

520
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:51,940
But. But because the issue is that people in Jersey.

521
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:59,780
Right. Would be getting the high tolls and anybody who from New Jersey to Manhattan or Connecticut coming into the city.

522
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:05,480
Yeah. So for them, like the whole reason that they want to live in Manhattan.

523
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:16,220
Right. So if they're not going to pay these tolls and they and the public transit doesn't matter to them because they don't have access to it all.

524
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:20,360
But they can take public transit into New York City to. Yeah, that's right.

525
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:26,059
So, I mean, here's the sort of area in that little red bit.

526
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:30,020
In the middle is just the area that would have tolls. Okay.

527
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:39,110
Is there the only public transportation that goes into New York City or would it would it like put people in or.

528
01:13:39,110 --> 01:13:47,950
What's amazing to think of is that New York City accounts for half of the ridership of public transit in the country every day.

529
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:53,210
I mean, it's millions per day. Is it efficient?

530
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:59,440
You know, I mean, there's rails that reach out to New Jersey, Long Island, to Connecticut.

531
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:07,850
Amtrak goes up and down the East Coast. You know, then you have the metro, the subway itself within New York City.

532
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:14,600
I forget how many hundreds of miles of lines and in the busses going lots of places and so forth.

533
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:21,190
People. We're so big.

534
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:30,100
That's a great question. You look at the table of contents.

535
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:38,660
That's just the figures. It's just the tables.

536
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:44,480
Okay, so here and this is only an assessment.

537
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:49,100
This is like the preliminary stage for an EIA. Yes. Okay.

538
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:55,700
Which is also pretty amazing, too. Okay.

539
01:14:55,820 --> 01:15:02,180
So project setting project purpose project need alternatives analysis framework.

540
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:15,110
They review the transportation options, bicycle, regional transportation, the highways and intersections of transit options, parking.

541
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:23,780
Because you can't do that without parking, bicycles, social conditions, neighborhood character, public policy, economic conditions.

542
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:26,910
Because, I mean, what's the toll that they're talking about? 50 bucks, right?

543
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:31,040
It was a variable. Yeah. Yeah. Not cheap.

544
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:38,410
Is some of this just like standard wording that goes into every environmental impact assessment?

545
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:46,149
Or is it like if it's all done to every project, it's they've got to cover certain amounts of this.

546
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:49,570
But this is pretty detailed for sure.

547
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:52,750
Environment, cultural, they have to do that.

548
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,260
For quality they have to do. Energy.

549
01:15:56,260 --> 01:16:00,910
Noise, natural resources they have to do. Environmental consequences.

550
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:05,290
Asbestos. I didn't get this far into construction.

551
01:16:05,830 --> 01:16:09,820
Summary Environmental justice. Okay, they've done this.

552
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:18,100
Do you think they made it this detail because they didn't want it to be denied? It's as comprehensive as possible.

553
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:21,880
Absolutely. They leave something off. They're going to get hammered for that, you know.

554
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:31,090
But I mean, you know, it's a legitimate concern, right? I mean, most of these things, because if you say you're going to do something like this,

555
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:36,040
then you need to figure out how people are going to get from point A to point B or how they're going to afford it,

556
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:49,440
or do they have options and things like this? And then when was this made?

557
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:57,190
Oh, a month or two ago. This must have taken a while to put together.

558
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:03,290
Obviously, I wonder how long it took, whether it was like a year or a couple years.

559
01:17:03,530 --> 01:17:04,970
I think it's about two years and making.

560
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:16,610
And these are like wonderful documents that if you don't have to make them yourself, look, you know, I mean, here's you know,

561
01:17:16,610 --> 01:17:20,240
they're just and this one is really detailed where they're going to be doing the tolling,

562
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:26,090
you know, I mean, they're going to allow trucks to go up and down the West Side Highway.

563
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:31,610
But if they go into the central business district, then they have to pay because there's absolute gridlock right here.

564
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:44,200
Okay. And I guess it's all done with cameras and whatnot, you know, so it's all pretty automated.

565
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:50,600
Yeah. I'm assuming there are other cities in the U.S.,

566
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:59,430
but many other cities like abroad or here in Europe that have implemented some sort of Internet traffic control.

567
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:08,210
How was that worked out? Yeah. You know, I asked a planner and I don't think anyone's done it with variable pricing like this.

568
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,739
They certainly do have other areas that are restricted. For example,

569
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:19,219
I know a number of cities where you can't go into the central business district unless you are the

570
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:24,320
lowest emitting vehicle and you can't take your old clunker in there because of too much pollution.

571
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:29,540
And then parking is just another thing to, you know, you just can't park.

572
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:39,430
So what are some of the downsides of this? Why want everybody?

573
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:48,969
Well, commuters from New Jersey probably don't want. Right. Because I mean, you know, some of the salaries in New York are fabulous.

574
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:53,830
And they can find parking. They have a parking garage. You know, that's where they park.

575
01:18:55,070 --> 01:19:02,450
Like one of my brothers used to do that. He still does do that, you know, work and Bankers Row or Wall Street or whatever.

576
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:06,760
So he doesn't care what it costs. He just cares about how much time it takes.

577
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:18,790
So I feel like there's just a bunch of the commercial trucks. Like since you're you're just so dense, there's so many businesses.

578
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:25,000
So they need a good cleaning supplies. So these trucks coming in and dropping, but they would be exempted.

579
01:19:25,930 --> 01:19:29,830
Yeah, but you actually raise a really good point. What about the three truck?

580
01:19:30,670 --> 01:19:37,870
Okay. And this is where, you know, you've got the Holland Tunnel.

581
01:19:37,870 --> 01:19:46,390
And I used to drive I used to live in New Jersey, drive across the Holland Tunnel, go across the Queens Expressway and go up to Boston or whatever.

582
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,610
Okay. Now, I won't be able to do that.

583
01:19:49,750 --> 01:20:01,030
So instead I'd have to go around New York or up here and maybe lint and my trip and then possibly cause pollution impacts in Queens or other places.

584
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:06,550
Okay. Which, you know, didn't used to have that traffic. So why would you have to go around?

585
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:11,860
Because I can't drive through Manhattan anymore.

586
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:18,490
Okay. So I have to bypass this area. And you only can't drive through it because there's a toll there now.

587
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:21,760
Right. So if they impose this toll. Oh, they're trying to.

588
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:27,100
Yeah. Unless I put my $50, you know, pay $50, and then I guess I could do it.

589
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:36,050
Yeah. The valuation that people would rather drive around and take public transportation.

590
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:43,910
I bet that's in the report. I didn't look for the. Many people would.

591
01:20:44,420 --> 01:21:02,860
Absolutely. I mean, you know, people think that they undervalue their time and so they will spend a couple of hours to save 50 bucks for sure.

592
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:13,000
But then what are you spending on gas? Yeah, but they're in their car.

593
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:18,190
I mean, you're right. They may not consider comprehensively the impacts.

594
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:26,920
Well, you know, what's the alternative?

595
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:30,280
If you don't want to do this is what you always ask.

596
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:41,740
An environmental assessment or you is how can we improve traffic flow in Manhattan in order to get redesigns of the streets?

597
01:21:42,190 --> 01:21:49,179
I feel like you're working with a limited and limited area, but I don't even know what the right question is,

598
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:55,450
to be honest, because do you want to improve traffic flow or do you just want to get people for me to be okay?

599
01:21:55,450 --> 01:22:03,700
So this is just the this is just the EU, right? So they're not doing any alternatives other than that with no action on and then this as well.

600
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:11,349
And so is basically New Jersey governor is what they're getting at is that there are other alternatives

601
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:17,290
out there and that's why they think that it should be put in place to explore those alternatives.

602
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:23,210
This is what I want you to get into. Yeah, there's clearly other alternatives.

603
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:27,460
I mean, they can define the congestion pricing zone differently.

604
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:32,950
They can change the rates. They could do all kinds of things in the long term.

605
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:38,920
Okay. Um, you know, this is the kind of short term thing that we could do pretty quickly.

606
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:47,160
Not your typical EIA. Yes. Okay.

607
01:22:47,690 --> 01:22:54,770
And I mean, I just bring it to you just because it raises these really difficult questions, you know, like, what's the purpose of this?

608
01:22:54,980 --> 01:23:03,710
Who's going to pay, who's going to benefit? And just the magnitude of the effort for this assessment is, I think, impressive.

609
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:08,959
Okay. And, you know, I this is a 200 megabyte PDF, right?

610
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:13,250
And it's only one of them. And, you know, you can take a look at it,

611
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:26,510
but the idea here is that we're moving into realms which are really different from sort of the Kalamazoo River cleanup,

612
01:23:27,230 --> 01:23:34,010
you know, which I also have as part of your homework, but into something which is really behavioral based in many ways and human based.

613
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:42,590
And it's important also for sure. And it's not clear what the best set of tools is to address these problems because they're so complex.

614
01:23:43,130 --> 01:23:58,290
But, I mean, we need a structure in. I mean, transit stuff is in fact, really interesting because you build something, it lasts for 50 or 75 years.

615
01:23:58,770 --> 01:24:04,649
So you have a massive impact, you know, on both the here and now and then way down the road as well.

616
01:24:04,650 --> 01:24:14,230
So it really makes sense to figure these things out. On the other hand, things change pretty rapidly, too.

617
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:21,500
So, I don't know. I didn't go through all the graphics, which is the most interesting to look at.

618
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:24,520
But you can see there's quite a few here.

619
01:24:25,650 --> 01:24:31,650
One of the things that I didn't find is called an origin destination network.

620
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:40,190
Do you guys know about those? So this is where people are living or coming from to where they're going.

621
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:48,420
Okay. And it's sort of a major thing you need to be able to figure out what are the transportation needs.

622
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:54,240
Without origin demand matrix, you're just guessing what's going on.

623
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:57,990
And imagine doing that for, like, a city like New York.

624
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:06,960
Really complicated. This is also interesting modeling of toll rates.

625
01:25:07,410 --> 01:25:13,590
How much is it going to take so that you change your behavior and you don't drive into New York?

626
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:17,700
You know, my brother's a former stockbroker.

627
01:25:17,970 --> 01:25:22,620
I don't know. Hundreds for many people, much less money.

628
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:28,430
You know. That's another thing.

629
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:47,130
Anyway, if we were just kind of different and interesting, what I looked at was the environmental impacts, in particular the air pollution impacts.

630
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:52,740
They were not profound. I mean, you're displacing traffic, basically.

631
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:58,640
You're not really making a huge impact even when you push more traffic on to another wave.

632
01:25:59,130 --> 01:26:05,040
It still wasn't that big a difference for that rate. Certainly not much of a difference in greenhouse gases.

633
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:10,020
The difference is really in what happens in Manhattan. You know that area.

634
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:17,380
For New York. I feel like it's such a unique location because they're right on the coast.

635
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:22,750
And yet your super deaths in concrete. And so that heat island effect, does that even happen?

636
01:26:22,990 --> 01:26:27,490
They didn't do it. They didn't even do all that. All they did was to look at well, they did a little bit of it.

637
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:30,990
We look at the emissions, the change in emissions. Okay.

638
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:37,420
In terms of pollutants. And that's the key indicator. And if that's a small change and nothing else is going to change that much.

639
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:43,320
But these New York had an issue where contaminants get trapped within the city.

640
01:26:43,330 --> 01:26:47,559
Or does it blow away? Yes and no.

641
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:50,560
I mean, it's there's some reasonably brisk winds.

642
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:54,219
There is an urban heat island effect with recirculating winds.

643
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:58,480
And we'll talk about that. But it's most days it's not that significant.

644
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:05,710
Some days it's very significant. Okay. So there is a fair amount of pollution in New York City as well.

645
01:27:08,110 --> 01:27:11,140
Good questions, too. We'll talk more about that when we talk about air quality.

646
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:23,690
Okay. Big numbers here. All right.

647
01:27:23,690 --> 01:27:29,569
Anyway, you guys have met, in most cases, your partners, your team members.

648
01:27:29,570 --> 01:27:37,879
And, you know, there's a couple of simple questions here that deal with this.

649
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:42,230
It's mostly a thought piece for you. Okay. Just how you answer these questions.

650
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:46,190
Is this also wound care? It is. Yeah. Yeah.

651
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:50,300
There's word document there. And I suggest you download that and put your answers in between.

652
01:27:50,810 --> 01:27:57,300
That'd be great. Yeah, on the homework. Let me know if you have difficulty finding it.

653
01:27:57,320 --> 01:28:04,880
It should be easy to find on the homework. What you have to work out the dynamics with your team member by the time.

654
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:09,650
Appreciate the degree of sickness, but do try to answer the questions.

655
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:18,260
Okay. And, you know, I'm suggesting sort of short paragraphs, no more than five or six pages for this one.

656
01:28:19,010 --> 01:28:22,430
But, you know, you can put in tables and figures and more. That's just fine.

657
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:26,810
Okay. I'm assuming we just turn in one or.

658
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:31,510
Yes. That's all you need to do. Okay.

659
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:38,080
So in the article that mentioning how the New Jersey governor is reaching out to President Biden.

660
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:43,690
But can the president accelerate or do they have any.

661
01:28:44,230 --> 01:28:56,680
Know? Absolutely. They can tell the lead agency here their feeling and in fact, make make it known the way they want to go on this.

662
01:28:56,680 --> 01:29:01,720
Because this if the feds are the lead agency and they are in this case, they call the shots.

663
01:29:03,610 --> 01:29:07,030
So there is a lot of politics and certainly in a case like this.

664
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:22,750
So they did do a regional travel demand model in here and their options for avoiding the CBD total switch to another mode.

665
01:29:23,770 --> 01:29:29,490
Choose a different path. Don't make the trip brilliant.

666
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:41,350
So, you know, the interesting thing is that if you study traffic and traffic demand, your roads can accommodate traffic.

667
01:29:41,350 --> 01:29:43,120
It just gets crowded, more crowded.

668
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:51,430
And then at some point it's just like gridlock and then things just collapse and you just have to be 10% below that point and stuff will flow.

669
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:57,940
So really all they have to do is reduce the small amount of traffic, ten or 20% and things will flow.

670
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:06,820
So, you know, there is some good logic in experience doing this time of day shifting is another possibility,

671
01:30:07,150 --> 01:30:14,770
but that's what this would automatically encourage because the tools that are higher during peak times would displace demand to other times.

672
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,650
I'm going to get off track with this. So let's get back.

673
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:31,220
We have another 20 or so minutes. I want to talk about some more water quality stuff.

674
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:39,969
Okay. But everybody good with their partners.

675
01:30:39,970 --> 01:30:43,720
And except for the three of you, I think. Okay, we'll figure that out.

676
01:30:43,810 --> 01:30:50,740
Did you come? You're going to have to join another team because we have an odd number of people.

677
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:55,780
So do you want me to stick you on another team or do you want to do it yourself?

678
01:30:57,670 --> 01:31:01,810
You can do that. You want me to do it? And unless you want to do it by yourself.

679
01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:08,650
No. Okay. All right. Okay.

680
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:21,940
So back to water quality stuff. Another example of a mass balance model is a really important one that deals with the water column in the sediment.

681
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:28,090
And this is super important in the Great Lakes. It's really important in other regions as well.

682
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:35,290
We have transfers between the water column and the sediment that occur via settling.

683
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:46,210
So particles in the water, if they have a greater density than water, will sink and be incorporated into the sediment.

684
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:54,730
So you have dead algae, you have bacteria, all kinds of, you know, all the different creatures.

685
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:59,380
They will eventually sink and become incorporated into the sediment at the same time.

686
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:03,190
We can have releases from the sediment into the water column above.

687
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:07,680
This can occur for, you know, nitrogen or phosphorus.

688
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:13,510
It could occur for PCBs or whatever. It can occur due to dissolution and release.

689
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:19,930
It can occur because worms and other creatures will stir up the sediment and bring it back up.

690
01:32:20,980 --> 01:32:27,790
And so we have to deal with the balance in the water column of what's coming in from inflows,

691
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:36,010
what's coming in from release, from the sediment, what's lost due to the sediment and what's lost is the outflow as well.

692
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:42,940
So you can think of a mass balance for that. The sediment itself also has a mass balance.

693
01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:47,950
We have stuff coming in, stuff going, and then we have what we call deep burial.

694
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:53,920
And basically, once you're a meter or more down in the sediment, it's never coming out.

695
01:32:55,010 --> 01:32:57,670
You know, for all practical purposes, and we call that deep burial.

696
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:13,390
So now this is a two compartment model water column and the sediments sort up here, and this model is set up for Lake Washington in Seattle.

697
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:29,050
And I have the parameters shown here and this is a relatively large lake with a concern about phosphorus.

698
01:33:29,830 --> 01:33:38,080
And phosphorus is often the limiting nutrient. And the idea here is just that, you know,

699
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:47,230
we have a mathematical equation to deal with the water column and the sediment and this is a differential equation.

700
01:33:47,570 --> 01:33:51,100
DCT And we have the inflow.

701
01:33:51,670 --> 01:33:55,680
What's coming from the sediment since is the concentration of the sediment.

702
01:33:57,160 --> 01:34:03,100
And so this equation through this series is coupled to this equation.

703
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:12,820
And similarly, what comes into the sediment depends on the concentration in the water above with that K term because that drops down.

704
01:34:13,930 --> 01:34:21,079
So we have two coupled differential equations here, which is kind of complicated for us to solve,

705
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:25,120
but American, we can solve it without too much of trouble at all.

706
01:34:26,770 --> 01:34:35,620
So again, my main point here is that those two equations deal with the mass balance in the water column in

707
01:34:35,620 --> 01:34:40,990
the second equation deals with the mass balance in the sediment and that's represented here.

708
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:49,350
You skipped the skip. Okay.

709
01:34:50,130 --> 01:34:59,430
I don't actually demo this model in the notes, but let me just give you a thought example here.

710
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:08,970
What happens if the phosphorus load in the lake is really high and we have a lot of algae?

711
01:35:09,570 --> 01:35:17,490
Okay. And we say, let's cut off the non-point and the point sources.

712
01:35:18,330 --> 01:35:23,820
So we lower the phosphorus level and then the algae will come back.

713
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:29,400
And then what we call the sticky disc depth, which is the measure of the transparency of the water.

714
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:35,400
You know what a sucky disc is? It's kind of a disc about this big with black and white sections,

715
01:35:35,820 --> 01:35:40,889
and I drop it in and when I no longer can see it, it's a measure of how clear the water is.

716
01:35:40,890 --> 01:35:47,250
And that distance could be, you know, a meter or ten meters, depending on how clear the water is.

717
01:35:48,270 --> 01:36:00,460
Okay. It's a measure of suspended solids. So if I cut off the flows coming in, then you might think, Oh, I've solved the problem.

718
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:07,720
But typically what happens in a lake like Lake Washington is you have a lot of releases from the settlement.

719
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:23,200
And if I go back to the parameters here, the water concentration of phosphorous is about 15 in the sediment, it's order of magnitude or more higher.

720
01:36:24,910 --> 01:36:28,870
And I just have a huge reservoir of phosphorus in the sediment.

721
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:38,830
So what that means is if I cut off the inflows, I still have the releases from the sediment and my pollution problem doesn't go away.

722
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:42,400
Okay. Because of that second part.

723
01:36:43,630 --> 01:36:52,360
And so that's really the lesson from these kinds of applications is that you have to really look holistically to get a sense of what's going on.

724
01:36:53,530 --> 01:37:02,920
And if so, what is the lake mode and what's cut off the sediment release from sediment would still happen.

725
01:37:03,310 --> 01:37:12,040
Would that be like a reverse exponential growth, I guess, or like an exponential decay since there isn't more coming in?

726
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:16,360
But what's there is still being built ultimately, yes.

727
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:19,660
Because there's still losses, because water is leaving the system.

728
01:37:20,110 --> 01:37:26,680
But the fact is that the sediment can contain hundreds of times the amount of phosphorus that's in the water column.

729
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:37,510
And so it can be a problem for a very, very long time. And so the story with Lake Washington is they in fact, reduced inflows,

730
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:42,130
but they're phosphorus prompt and go away because they still have it in the sediment.

731
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:50,050
Ultimately, stuff that settles down will cover up that phosphorus in the cement, which will go into deep burial.

732
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:55,720
And yes, ultimately it will go away. But they might have to wait a long, long time.

733
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:12,160
A very different example of a two compartment model is your body okay where you might have, for example, some light exposure?

734
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:17,290
And where's most of the lead stored in your body, in your bone?

735
01:38:17,290 --> 01:38:20,620
But where do we measure lead exposure in blood.

736
01:38:20,890 --> 01:38:32,800
So if I Kelly, get the lit out of you, it's still going to come back into your blood by lost through the bone, into the blood.

737
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:40,180
Okay, so the bone represents the volume, the the reservoir of of lead, if that helps.

738
01:38:41,110 --> 01:38:50,180
And that would be modeled by exactly the same sort of two compartment model that you would have before you sort of have this holding pattern for it,

739
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:54,670
like right there in the bone. Okay.

740
01:39:03,210 --> 01:39:07,630
There's a couple of other terms that I just do want to mention a little.

741
01:39:07,710 --> 01:39:18,660
Again, I'm not trying to emphasize this too much, but we have linear differential equations because we don't have any higher order terms.

742
01:39:19,170 --> 01:39:28,410
We have this notion of superposition which allows us to look at separate sources or separate factors if they are linear.

743
01:39:29,070 --> 01:39:36,960
In the examples that I want to give is, for example, a golf course discharging phosphorus from, say, here to here.

744
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:41,820
And so that builds up the concentration as we fall before.

745
01:39:42,450 --> 01:39:46,950
And then we have a point source like a wastewater discharge with phosphorus right here.

746
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,620
And that builds up from this red line.

747
01:39:50,430 --> 01:39:57,600
And then the idea of superposition is I can add those two together in my total phosphorus concentration is the black white.

748
01:39:59,190 --> 01:40:04,440
Okay. So I can add separate sources together if they're linear.

749
01:40:07,450 --> 01:40:13,240
Okay next concept is figure in the fusion for remember back from your high school physics.

750
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:17,770
You have this conjecture where you have, say,

751
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:27,100
a compartment separated from another compartment with a gas A and a gas B, and I remove that barrier, that wall.

752
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:35,470
And then just the thinking in the fusion will mean that the is A and B are uniformly distributed.

753
01:40:37,660 --> 01:40:41,530
This is due to thermal motion.

754
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:45,580
It's not due to a bulk flow. There's no bulk flow.

755
01:40:46,090 --> 01:40:51,520
It's just due to the fact that anything above absolute zero has some vibrational energy.

756
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:58,060
Some velocity. Diffusion can be really important for mass transfer.

757
01:40:58,780 --> 01:41:03,370
Diffusion rate. How fast this occurs depend on temperature.

758
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:09,820
No diffusion at absolute zero. The size of the diffusing particle.

759
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:18,610
If you guys are following kind of the hydrogen energy, hydrogen being so small, it diffuses through things quickly.

760
01:41:19,150 --> 01:41:23,050
So it's hard to contain in the viscosity.

761
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:31,540
And so when a gas we kind of have the billiard ball theory that one molecule hits another, ricochets off.

762
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:37,840
Diffusion is relatively rapid. We had Vanderbilt bonds and liquids and solids.

763
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:44,230
We have other types of bonds. Diffusion still occurs even in a solid but just a really slow rate.

764
01:41:48,190 --> 01:41:54,160
I doubt these will work. But anyway, these are just showing.

765
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:57,760
We're supposed to show how these things.

766
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:05,830
Excuse me. Nothing works here. Are these diffused?

767
01:42:07,540 --> 01:42:14,170
And this, in fact, was Einstein's thesis talking about diffusion.

768
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:21,100
And he figured out that the figure in a Brownian motion, the distance traveled,

769
01:42:21,310 --> 01:42:27,040
would be two times the diffusion coefficient, times times that quantity to the square root.

770
01:42:28,090 --> 01:42:36,970
And he then figured out how to express diffusion rates as a function of gas constants and temperatures and other things.

771
01:42:39,110 --> 01:42:45,620
For us, fighting and diffusion can sometimes be really important and fix first.

772
01:42:45,620 --> 01:42:53,420
Love is the fluff is the negative of the diffusion coefficient times, the concentration gradient.

773
01:42:54,170 --> 01:43:00,680
The diffusion coefficient has these terms or dimensions of length squared over time.

774
01:43:01,340 --> 01:43:15,230
Concentration gradient is the mass over the last cubed times one over L And so we end up with flux being mass per time, per length squared.

775
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:24,710
I want to give you some examples. I think I'm going to run out of time today.

776
01:43:25,670 --> 01:43:32,900
But typically in air we have diffusion coefficients on the order of ten to the minus one centimeter squared per second,

777
01:43:33,470 --> 01:43:42,860
about two orders of magnitude lower in water and much, much lower in sediment and much, much, much lower in solids.

778
01:43:43,010 --> 01:43:54,380
Ten to the -10%. If you think about this and we use Einstein as result in there using that formula,

779
01:43:55,460 --> 01:44:05,360
a molecule diffused about 0.6 centimeters per second, relatively fast in water, less than a millimeter.

780
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:10,070
And in sediment, we're talking about the number of microns.

781
01:44:11,450 --> 01:44:17,870
So diffusion seems relatively fast but important.

782
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:26,839
You know, these work, but they're not very useful to remember.

783
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:36,450
One doesn't. I don't think there's time to go through this example.

784
01:44:36,810 --> 01:44:47,850
But the the idea, though, is that due to diffusion, material will transfer through a media.

785
01:44:48,210 --> 01:44:52,590
But again, it's a molecular concentration gradient approach.

786
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:58,920
It's not turbulence, it's not eddies. And it's very low compared to those processes.

787
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:05,220
In this particular example, we might have an oil spill at the zero.

788
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:08,390
The water drifts downstream in two days.

789
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:11,730
It's spread out. What accounts for that spreading out?

790
01:45:13,170 --> 01:45:17,130
Is it diffusion? Not really.

791
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:21,030
Okay. Diffusion, again, is a molecular scale process.

792
01:45:21,510 --> 01:45:30,780
What that means is it's important that very fine scales, like moving through cells, moving through your stranded cornea, your outer skin surface.

793
01:45:31,170 --> 01:45:37,650
It's not so important where you have eddies and a lot of turbulence in the environment.

794
01:45:38,430 --> 01:45:53,280
And so that's really the difference between sort of a situation where you have large scale advection or bulk motion which causes dispersion.

795
01:45:56,640 --> 01:46:11,070
And just jump in here. And what I wanted to mention in close today is that diffusion rate or dispersion

796
01:46:11,610 --> 01:46:17,160
from solid molecular diffusion V is very small but still spans the range.

797
01:46:17,670 --> 01:46:27,510
And then what we call this passivity is called, and this is a result of currents and eddies that kind of look like dispersion.

798
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:37,530
But they are dispersion. They look like diffusion. I mean, but they occur at much larger scales and in lakes and other open water systems that any

799
01:46:37,530 --> 01:46:43,470
diffusion or any dispersion is orders of magnitude greater in the molecular scale process.

800
01:46:46,810 --> 01:46:51,460
I'm going to have to come back to this. Okay. But anyway, to give you a start on it.

801
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:58,270
Please contact your team member and figure out what you're going to do next week.

802
01:46:58,360 --> 01:47:01,720
We have class now, so see you in two weeks.

803
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:09,210
Okay. No.
