1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:25,020
CHRIS Yeah, I like the Democrats he gave us about, you know, oh, I was in charge of pointing a finger,

2
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:31,610
maybe, you know, it was like, you know, so many things that are so cool.

3
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,110
We're going to do a lot of video to look at it.

4
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,059
I didn't realize Brian was going to show that to me. I thought I was just going to use it for his ongoing cause.

5
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:49,200
The money was like, You're famous o something on Instagram, but it's all right.

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,589
Show me. Do this. You know, I laugh from the very first day back is suboptimal for all people involved.

7
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,319
So welcome back. Happy New Year. Literally fairly new year. I'm parents onavo.

8
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,560
I am an associate professor in nutritional sciences.

9
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:14,250
I think we have about half of folks in nutrition. Can you understand if you're nutrition person if you are my EPI people and HPC.

10
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:22,580
Anyone else. Not to single out, but representation from 50% of the School of Public Health.

11
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,660
I'm delighted to have this many people in the room and this many people from different departments, this department.

12
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:41,160
As you know, this is a elective course. This is my fourth time teaching in this class and it is exciting to see the interest in this topic.

13
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:47,030
It is a topic that I feel really passionately about and is the focus of a lot of my research.

14
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:54,559
And so you'll see throughout the course some of the work that I do and will have an opportunity

15
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,310
to engage a little bit with some research and process over the course of the semester.

16
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,659
I'll do a brief introduction to sort of why why me sort of my background,

17
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:11,660
but I won't spend too much time on that because I would say most of the time on kind of what is this course about?

18
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,610
What's it going to look like for you all over the next 13 weeks so that you all can make an

19
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:22,159
informed decision about whether or not you come back next week and then at the end of class,

20
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,370
we'll do a little bit of new content, a little bit of introduction to what is with bias.

21
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:34,549
And we'll talk a bit about terminology, which is a useful framework for moving forward in this course.

22
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:42,050
The semester is how we're going to talk about weight bodies. As I'm chatting, I'm going to have you all do nametags.

23
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:46,040
If you've taken a class with me, you know you for this.

24
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,690
This is your first test hot dog, not hamburger.

25
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,519
Okay. Because I'm going to stack these at the end of each class is sort of how I quasi take attendance.

26
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,389
So I'll pick your preferred color field.

27
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,550
It has. I'm not hamburger and this can move around slowly. Only have two patterns, so it has to go relatively slowly.

28
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,680
First name is fine. I'm going to have you all record intro videos.

29
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,999
We have an opportunity to share full names, nicknames, pronouns and other things so you can leave just your first name on there.

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,270
You can also include we don't have guest speakers, so it's so I will be something for you keeping track of your nicknames and pronouns.

31
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:29,290
So first name on there is just fine if that feels okay for everyone else.

32
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,430
All right. So again, so I'm Kendra and I'm a reservation by training.

33
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,649
I started my career working as a dietitian with folks that had eating disorders.

34
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:45,350
That was always my interest. When I was training to be a dietitian to work with eating disorders,

35
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:55,850
I was really lucky as an undergraduate student to be exposed to the health at every size movement, which we're going to talk about in this class.

36
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:04,490
But I was an undergrad in the nineties, and so to be able to know about health in every size in the nineties was sort of shocking and unusual.

37
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:15,740
And so I was sort of not interested in working in weight management spaces, which is a place where a lot of dietitians did work and do work.

38
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:26,230
So luckily kind of got exposed to this content early and yet I lost my way as a dietitian.

39
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:34,969
My very first job, I was working at Boston Children's Hospital doing eating disorder treatment, but it wasn't a full time job.

40
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:40,910
So I got sort of put in some other clinics, including a weight management clinic, which I had assumed I would never do.

41
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:47,270
And then I had sort of a a the thought that, well, if someone has to be working in weight management,

42
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:53,600
it should be someone that has a health every size lens or someone who's thinking about issues related to body image.

43
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:00,470
And so I did that work for some number of years and I share that just because I think it's really

44
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,460
important to acknowledge when you have worked in a space where you feel like you've done harm.

45
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:10,940
And a lot of what brought me to weight bias is lessons that I learned in doing that work and experiences that that I had.

46
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:21,620
So I was working in a weight management clinic as working an eating disorder program, and the cognitive dissonance got the better of me I expected.

47
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,759
This class of all will experience cognitive dissonance if that is something you a concept

48
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,630
you're familiar with yet I will talk you through it as we work through the semester.

49
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,370
But what I noticed was what we recommended for folks in the Eating Disorder clinic

50
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,300
was at odds with what we were recommending in the weight management program.

51
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,900
What we said was what it meant to be healthy were different things.

52
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:51,490
So it's sort of different standards of health that we apply to people based on their body size.

53
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,250
And that to me felt wrong, right? That was the feeling of cognitive dissonance.

54
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,700
Like these things can't both be true. I can't be talking about both sides of my mouth.

55
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:05,750
I can't be fat struggling like this. And that's what brought me to do my doctoral degree is that I wanted to understand

56
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:14,750
how we can integrate our health messaging so that it is not widely disparities that.

57
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,120
It's sort of not different based on your identity. Right. You can imagine some issues with equity.

58
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,090
If we say this is health for you and this is health for you. And so that's what got me to do a degree in public health.

59
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:32,440
And I have mostly identified as an eating disorder researcher and prevention researcher.

60
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:42,280
And the more eating disorder prevention work I do, the more I realize that weight bias is at the core of preventing eating disorders.

61
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:47,230
And the more I sort of shifted my research program to exclusively eating disorder prevention

62
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:56,440
to somewhere in between weight bias interventions and eating disorder prevention work.

63
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:01,000
So that's me. You call me Kendra and my clients, are she her?

64
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:08,500
You can call me Dr. Sonia Pill if you're feeling fancy. I answer to those combinations of things.

65
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,550
Don't call me Mrs. anything. I had a Christmas.

66
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,040
I'm going to go off on a tangent. I got a Christmas card this year.

67
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,349
Address to Mrs. Macklem. I'm a married person.

68
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:23,770
I've been married for like a year, so I lost my professional degree, my first name on my last name and the Christmas card.

69
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,610
And don't do any of those things beyond that. You can call me what you want.

70
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:36,129
All right, welcome. You're here. So what are we going to do in this course?

71
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:43,630
So this course is designed to expose you all to the pervasiveness of weight bias and think about how common it is,

72
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,410
where it comes up and the consequences of it,

73
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:54,850
and specifically the consequences related to health and health equity, because this is good for us, for public health.

74
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:56,830
We'll talk a lot about weight,

75
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:05,920
inclusivity as a paradigm or an alternative paradigm to what we tend to use within public health, which is white normative.

76
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:16,590
Weight normative paradigm is one where we think about weight as a determinant of health and weight as a characteristic for intervention.

77
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,590
Weight inclusive approaches do not do that. As we talking about what that might look like,

78
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:29,110
if you were to practice public health or practice clinically from a weight inclusive lens throughout the course,

79
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:34,600
I will center in all the ways I can think of the perspectives of people with lived

80
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:40,479
experience I think is important to sort of just take a note of my personality.

81
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,020
I am a person who is straight sized, who has been privileged.

82
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:48,340
I'm not the messenger or the best messenger for issues of weight bias.

83
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:55,600
I'm so aware of that. I'm also a gender white woman, and so I inhabit almost no marginalized identities.

84
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,100
So I'm imperfect in so many ways as the instructor for this course.

85
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:08,200
And because of that, I think really critically about how to center people in fat bodies.

86
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,569
We'll talk about the word fat in a few minutes, particularly those with intersex, marginalized identities.

87
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:18,220
And we will I will do that through the readings, through listening to podcasts or some videos.

88
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:26,620
But just to sort of acknowledge that as I try to lead this course, that those voices will be injected in any way that I can think of.

89
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:32,740
And I'm always open for feedback on how I'm able to to do that.

90
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:42,370
And by bringing in those voices, the goal here is to think about weight and issues of weight, bias and size diversity as social justice issues.

91
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:53,850
I put asterisks to remind me to go back to the canvas site so that you all two can orient what we're doing within canvas.

92
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:59,900
Everything in this course is happening. That's happening is outlined in canvas.

93
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:04,340
We have a course schedule, the course syllabus. All of the readings and videos are link to there.

94
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:12,030
But this is sort of a general summary of sort of how we will march through the topic of weight, bias and health over this semester.

95
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:19,560
We're going to talk about terminology today. Next week we'll talk about weight bias in health care and public health.

96
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,360
Then we'll move on to other spaces in which we see weight bias come up.

97
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:30,600
We'll talk about the consequences of weight bias. We'll spend one week on weight science.

98
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:38,370
And what weight science is, is how do we interpret the literature about the relationship between weight and health.

99
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,990
But people talk about time in a big square quotes the obesity epidemic.

100
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:55,770
How do we interpret that or make sense of that relative to what we're doing in this class and trying to teach us all to be more critical consumers

101
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:05,130
of that literature and also to remain scientifically curious about what's happening in the weight bias space and within the weight science space.

102
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,230
We'll talk about weight, inclusivity,

103
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:12,360
specifically the health that every size movement because it is the largest movement within the weight inclusive space,

104
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,839
but by no means the only one and an imperfect one.

105
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,010
And we'll talk about that. We'll talk about social justice in fat activism.

106
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:25,200
We'll talk about the intersection of anti fatness with other marginalization.

107
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:31,140
We'll talk about interventions. What do we know about how we can reduce weight bias?

108
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:42,240
And then we'll spend the last two weeks talking about public policy, law and advocacy within the topics of size, diversity and weight discrimination.

109
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,140
And then go here to the campus sites. I should probably show you in the way that you guys see it.

110
00:11:51,120 --> 00:12:00,030
So each week I will have the topic, the dates and whatever readings that you need to do link to there.

111
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,590
Anything that is due in terms of assignments should be shown there.

112
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,870
Hopefully this is comprehensive.

113
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:15,210
I've obsessively looked at this quite a lot, but if you ever have questions about what am I supposed to be doing, just let me know.

114
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:21,870
I will end each session with Here's what I'm expecting for next week, but I want to make sure that you all remain oriented throughout the semester.

115
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,790
I will lecture a bit.

116
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:42,280
For most sessions I will lecture ideally for 40 minutes or less at the start of class to introduce the topic.

117
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:49,070
We will have discussions. Everyone will be part of a group presentation, which actually I want to tell you about today.

118
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:55,410
We have two sessions that are no lecture and the full class is dedicated to it in class activity.

119
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:03,610
So the class is intended to be interactive and me talking less than I do in other courses.

120
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,950
So if you have taken other courses with me, I'm really going to try to talk but is hard for me, but I will try.

121
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:17,890
The lecture slides are going to be one grand Google slide deck, so I will update them.

122
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:25,060
I will add slides each week so you can always go here. It's at the top of the canvas site and follow along in the in the slide deck.

123
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:34,430
Since I said I'm going to talk glass, I'm going to stop talking questions that folks have before I keep yammering.

124
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:50,590
So far so good. Okay. So the expectations I have for you, the first is to come to class prepared.

125
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,700
Each week there are readings, there are a handful of videos, I think four or five.

126
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:03,850
I'm trying to think through all of them videos that are designed to prepare you for class.

127
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,350
This class action going to give skip ahead here to the engage discussion.

128
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,649
Critical thinking this class more than any other class.

129
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,070
I teach it again for folks who have taken another class with me before.

130
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,390
This is taught at a at a sort of high graduate level.

131
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,020
I am not here to teach you how to think like me.

132
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,930
I'm here to teach you to think about this topic,

133
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:34,419
particularly given that the way that we'll talk about body size, this class is so different from other classes.

134
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:41,409
I'm really hoping to prepare you to be in your own world after this class and work in

135
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,530
the spaces you're going to work and interact with people who you're interact with,

136
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:50,350
with fully formed ideas or partially formed ideas or ability to articulate your thoughts on this topic.

137
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,369
So I'm going to ask you to talk more and think more about this, to really prepare you for that.

138
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:04,240
So the expectation is, is that you come ready to talk and have hard conversations and sit with confusing topics.

139
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:10,209
And so because of that, the readings are carefully selected but are not minimal.

140
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:17,200
Write the articles each week. There's at least one. Usually it's a review article that can take a while to get through, plus or minus a video.

141
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,480
So again, I'm asking you to really participate, to sit with this topic, to discuss.

142
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:28,240
So be prepared to get things wrong. You can't imagine the number of missteps I've made in this work,

143
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:32,319
and I've grown in my thinking, in my learning and my ability to dialog with these things.

144
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,420
And I want to create here a space that enables you to do that with others that

145
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,840
are sort of similarly kind of struggling or thinking through these issues.

146
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:48,160
And because of that, the learning environment that we create here becomes critically important, that we're allowed to mess up,

147
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,500
we're allowed to say words that maybe we didn't get it quite right the first time, that we are collegial,

148
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,040
respectful, and that as we're having these conversations,

149
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:03,010
that we retain some degree of confidentiality in terms of the way that we engage with each

150
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:08,530
other as we're learning to use different terms and to think through complicated topics.

151
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:19,060
I would like you all to be here in person. I think that's how we develop as a class best and we can discuss best.

152
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:28,959
I don't want you to be here if it is at the expense of your health and safety or the health and safety of others in this classroom.

153
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,910
So if you cannot get here, you cannot get here.

154
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:38,530
I'm the parent of a small person, so there's a really good chance I will have a kid with influenza at some point this semester.

155
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:43,090
And I will tell you, you are not coming. So I understand that those types of things happen.

156
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,500
So come here if you can. If you're not able to come, please let me know that you're not going to be here.

157
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,090
I am told that I'm being reported by this owl.

158
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:57,670
So they are offering in this particular room an automatic recording option, which I'm taking them up on.

159
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:06,009
The owl is like staring at me, so I feel like that that's actually true. So you can live webcast through Panopto.

160
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:10,150
I have typically done Zoom, but I'm doing Panopto this semester, so if you were at home you could not join.

161
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,130
You can click on the Panopto recording the Panopto link on campus and join live.

162
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:19,900
You can't talk, you can't interact, which if you're not feeling well or you can't be here, is probably fine.

163
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:29,200
But you can listen live and then immediately after class it'll be posted so you can always join that way.

164
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:37,090
There are two sessions where we are doing in-class activities that are part of the points for this class.

165
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:45,970
So I'll have you mark those on your calendar of my classes to really try to get to if you can again, if you are sick, symptomatic of a thing.

166
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:51,220
The weather are so scary that you don't feel like you can drive, still don't come and we'll figure out an alternative assignment.

167
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,630
But those would be the two that I would push you if you are able to to to physically be here.

168
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:08,140
So the court requirements in the next week, I'm going to painfully ask you all to record an introductory video so I can get to know you.

169
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,989
This is a small class. I will know your names.

170
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:15,780
I know many of your faces and names already, but I'd like to know a bit about you, sort of why you take this class.

171
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:22,730
So in the next week. To do that so we could receive assignments.

172
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:28,069
It's a quick description of what the expectation is here.

173
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,639
It's going to look a little bit like a hostage video. I can't help but this is sort of how it is.

174
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:37,610
So like have your phone to say what your name is, what your preferred nickname is,

175
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,959
if you have one, if you're comfortable sharing your pronouns, please share them.

176
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,300
If you are not, I will. There's no need ever, no need for me ever to use pronouns this semester.

177
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,310
So that is something you're not required to share.

178
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:57,170
I'd like to know your program in a year, why you took this course and a question you have related to the course content.

179
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:03,740
Because I will obviously watch all these intro videos and address those questions as we go along.

180
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,229
And then something interesting about yourself.

181
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:11,480
I used to be a camp counselor and I could not help myself from having these prompts to like share something interesting about yourself.

182
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:18,319
If you are also taking my nutrition counseling class this semester, too bad you're doing two of these.

183
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,130
So have two facts ready to go. Okay, but it's three points.

184
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,630
So videos should be less than 5 minutes. Most people's are less than a minute and a half.

185
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:32,810
This is not too much content, but you're welcome to to chat along for 5 minutes and then post this as a

186
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:40,040
discussion I'm asking you to embed rather than attach your video in your post.

187
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:46,939
This is how you do that. If you attach it, it means that everyone has to download it in order to watch it.

188
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:52,280
So it means your video is downloaded on everyone's computer until the end of time or until that computer is done.

189
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,609
So don't do that to anyone, so make sure you embed it in that way.

190
00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:01,219
We can watch the video and not save it forever.

191
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,550
I got a memory questions on the intro video activity.

192
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,770
And the 3% your grade. It is three points if you do it.

193
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,860
And please, if you can do it by this time next week.

194
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:18,339
That way I know pronunciations of your names I know pronounce.

195
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,930
I know those kind of essential details. So the sooner I have that, the.

196
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,669
The better. You'll write three reflections there.

197
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:36,240
Pretty brief at 400, 500 ish words, three reflections over the course of the semester on what are sort of controversial topics.

198
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,770
One of them is trying to think about the three reflections.

199
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:46,560
Two of them are controversial. One of them is not just to get your thoughts on three topics related to weight bias.

200
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:56,819
So I will give you advance warning of those reflections. He will do it in class activity that is focused on a special topic in weight bias.

201
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:02,340
And what I mean by special topic is a topic with particular clinical or public health relevance.

202
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,350
So you will share your preference on your preferred topic within that domain.

203
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,040
You will be able to pick from one of four topics.

204
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:19,139
Those are elective surgeries. You may know that we keep elective surgeries where people based on their body size.

205
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:24,390
So that is sorry, I cannot help but be biased about things. I'm going to be cooler in my language.

206
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,570
There are weight limits for a lot of procedures.

207
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:36,240
So that is what are the topics you can select covered, which has lots of really important implications related to weight bias,

208
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,590
fertility or infertility treatment and eating disorders.

209
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:47,790
So you'll select one of those four topics and we will do an in-class activity and groups where we will present out on that topic.

210
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:54,280
There's going to be an assignment in class activity related to a weight bullying research project.

211
00:21:54,610 --> 00:22:02,110
So I have recently collected some data from young people about bullying in schools, and I was about to analyze this data and I thought,

212
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:05,170
Oh, wait, I have a whole class of people who are actually interested in weight bias.

213
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,940
So we're going to sit with the data and do some analysis of the data together, and then we can think through sort of where to go with that.

214
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:20,320
So we'll do some of that in this class. We'll do a podcast discussion in groups.

215
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:27,490
I actually might spend a few minutes talking about that now since I'm going to have you sign up for things related to that sort of.

216
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:33,410
At the end of today's session at a visit finish things up there.

217
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:37,460
We have one guest speaker who joins for part of a class session.

218
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,730
I will ask you to prepare a discussion question for him so that will be 2%.

219
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:54,500
And then your final assignment as class is an open letter, which is essentially a letter to an entity, a company, a celebrity, a Dean CEO,

220
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:05,239
talking about how their service or their product or their facility is is making missteps in the face of weight bias or is doing particularly well.

221
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:11,660
So you're going to write a letter about sharing your grievances or sharing your accolades for what they're doing.

222
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:18,380
And the goal of this activity is really to be culminating to be able to articulate your concerns in a space related to weight bias,

223
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,629
provide some compelling evidence why this person should care about your concerns.

224
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:28,690
And that's going to be the final activity in this class. Questions on this.

225
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:32,260
And I'm going to go talk a little bit more deeply about the podcast discussion.

226
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:42,860
No quizzes, no pay? No. Test type thing that does not in this class is not really what it's after to those types of assignments.

227
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:50,210
Okay. So I want to talk just a bit about the podcast discussions. You guys can be you all should be thinking about.

228
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,230
What you might want to do for this.

229
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:04,950
So as I mentioned, I'm going to be lecturing for the first part of most class sessions, the second half of most class sessions.

230
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:09,209
I will turn it over to a group of you all, probably two or three people.

231
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:16,740
I'm seeing the numbers kind of change in this class, so we'll get sort of final numbers probably relatively soon.

232
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,930
But let's imagine probably in groups of three,

233
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:27,300
you are going to sit together and pick a podcast episode that is focused on an issue related to weight bias,

234
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,470
fat acceptance or liberation health at every size, something in that domain.

235
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:37,620
Ideally, the podcast hosts or the guests themselves have experienced weight, stigma,

236
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:46,570
or have other marginalized identities where they have experiences with stigma and are talking about their own personal experience.

237
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:51,750
That I am not putting sort of an expectation related to every guest has to look this particular way.

238
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:59,130
The goal is, is to bring in voices that are under represented in this classroom and other underrepresented in the academic literature.

239
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:06,959
So going to pick a podcast episode and you're going to present what you learned in this

240
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:15,060
episode to the class and then anchor it into the scientific literature related to weight bias.

241
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:21,329
So what that will look like is you'll talk about again, who was the guest, who was the host, who is who is the authorities?

242
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,899
Who are the experts? What type of expertise do they have?

243
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:31,260
And it may be training, it may be lived experience, but what sort of what are they bringing to the topic?

244
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:38,040
And then you are providing kind of an insight like what is a takeaway message?

245
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,420
What is an experience that person had, what is something that they shared that sort of really resonated with you?

246
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,870
Each person, they can pick her pick sort of a different take home message,

247
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,419
and then you want to anchor that message or that finding or that experience.

248
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,920
And what does the literature say about that?

249
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:58,829
Is there a literature that does or does not support this in the way by space, if it doesn't exist in the way by space?

250
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:06,270
Are there other scientific studies or other papers that talk about sort of a similar experience in folks

251
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:11,700
with other marginalized identities or just trying to kind of anchor what we talk about in this class,

252
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:21,209
what you hear about within sort of the greater literature on weight bias and then sort of summarize, what did you what did you learn?

253
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:25,470
What are the key findings? How did this podcast shape your perspective on the topic?

254
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:32,549
And then you will finish with a couple discussion questions based on what you presented, right?

255
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:38,220
So trying to lead the discussion in the class relative to what you learned in this podcast.

256
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:49,480
Here are a few of my favorite podcasts related to weight bias and related issues.

257
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:57,130
Are there podcasts that folks listen to that I should put on this list or you that you think is missing?

258
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,670
Sorry. This text is a little bit small here. The top nine eight.

259
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:07,899
I don't know. I can't cut that fast. Are podcasts where you have Infinity episodes to pick from the last three hour episodes

260
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:12,430
of a podcast that's not specifically focused on fat liberation or weight bias,

261
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,700
but those episodes are particularly good. So I just listed a specific episode there.

262
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,870
Anything that folks want to. Part.

263
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,879
This is always a sort of a running list and this is sort of open source.

264
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:35,080
So feel free to jump in and add your recommend or send them to me, send your recommendations to me.

265
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:44,590
So I put that on there. I wanted to talk about that assignment only because I want folks to start signing up for what date

266
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:48,310
they want to present so that you all can be thinking about How does this semester look for me?

267
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,390
So just know that that's going to be the expectation.

268
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:58,510
The expectation is you'll come together, the couple other people, you will pick an episode of a podcast,

269
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,770
you will have some sort of introductory stuff you'll do as a group,

270
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:07,450
and then individually you each will pick an article that you want to present related to the topic,

271
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:15,460
and then they'll come together with discussion questions. So it's not a full group activity at some group, some individual, some, some group stuff.

272
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:23,220
Questions on that. All right.

273
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:27,220
I think those are the course logistics that I wanted to cover.

274
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:31,120
Question Mark, before I jump into new material then.

275
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,740
Yeah. Sorry. Sorry if you just mentioned this for each week.

276
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,220
Yeah. Does our presentation have to correlate with the topic?

277
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,270
I love this question. Sort of. It's a it's a really good question.

278
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:51,010
So actually, let me jump ahead and show you what it's going to look like when you do sign up for the topic.

279
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,770
So I didn't to give you this guy.

280
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,969
Yep. So ideally, if you are presenting a particular week,

281
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:10,220
if it can feel slightly connected to the content that we're covering, that would be optimal, right?

282
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:18,710
If it could be sort of like for example, last year, the week where we did weight, inclusivity, help at every size,

283
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:23,990
the presentation was sort of specifically related to a controversy that happened to the

284
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:30,130
help in every size move and movement and a conversation that was sort of specific to that.

285
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:37,280
It was like a little bit of perfect timing that it worked out and that was great because it was sort of a really seamless class session.

286
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:41,280
Some topics like policy law.

287
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:47,840
Maybe there's a podcast where someone is talking specifically about how a policy affected them or policy they're advocating for.

288
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:55,460
Maybe that exists, but that probably is not a topic of many podcasts that one might be harder to make that connection.

289
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:04,850
So what I what I would say is if you are signing up for your week, I would look at one a week that works for you in your life.

290
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,110
Right? Like this is a week in my academic calendar that works good. I'm definitely not traveling.

291
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:13,579
This is like will physically work for me as sort of one consideration.

292
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:19,610
The other consideration is the topic of that week feels interesting to me, so I might be excited to try to find a podcast that relates to it.

293
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:25,160
There is no hard requirement that it's perfectly related, but like try if you can make that connection.

294
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:33,570
Thank you for asking the question. And you all can fill this in any time, ideally before class.

295
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:40,830
Next week I'm going to have you rank first, second and third. There are times where there is like an influx of everyone wants the same date.

296
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:46,380
And if that happens, sometimes you end up with your third choice. So really make sure that all three of the dates work for you.

297
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:52,110
If I can't order your third choice, I would contact you directly and say like, here is kind of the issue.

298
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,060
Could you potentially do another one of these dates?

299
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,940
So just make sure all three choices do work for you before you submit this one per person or one for group.

300
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,330
One per group.

301
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:09,870
So each week we will have one. I mean, like for the four weeks you want one person or like us all per person, I will make groups.

302
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:16,470
Oh, yes. I'm sorry. That is an important piece of information that I assumed would somehow be assumed.

303
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,750
So, yes. So you. I will put your groups together. Okay.

304
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:28,360
Resist the temptation of finding your favorite people and say, Let's all sign up for this way to take you down.

305
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:35,320
Separate you on their questions, on logistics.

306
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:46,140
The syllabus stuff is a lot. I will again at the end of each class session say this is what the expectation is for next week.

307
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,400
There are very few things that you're working on many weeks in advance.

308
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:55,290
The exception is one of the exceptions is this presentation,

309
00:31:55,290 --> 00:32:03,209
which is why I want these groups graded as early as possible since people have schedules that are hard to coordinate.

310
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:07,650
So I want the group activity to be something that we figure out sooner rather than later.

311
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:14,940
And then that last assignment, the open letter, is something you'll probably be working on in the few weeks ahead of the last class session.

312
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:20,250
Most everything else is read this this week. Watch this video next week or before next week.

313
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:28,310
And so you don't have to do too much anticipating ahead of time. All right, so we learned some stuff.

314
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:33,310
This is exciting times.

315
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:45,080
Okay. Now, I've been signed out of my counsel laws, so if something.

316
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,440
All right. So probably this should be my first line is what is weight bias?

317
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:57,970
So if you're in the wrong place, you could be like, actually, that's not what I was learning about, but this is what weight bias is.

318
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:05,860
I have worked on generating a succinct definition since I started teaching this class, and this is a succinct as I have been able to do.

319
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,500
Weight bias is negative or cerebral.

320
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:20,800
I can even read it negative or stereotypical beliefs or attitudes about and social devaluation and marginalization of people in larger bodies.

321
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,940
I welcome edits to this. We can get this down to maybe two lines,

322
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:35,979
but it's having attitudes or stereotypes about people nurture bodies or mistreatment of people in larger bodies in the literature.

323
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:42,310
And you will encounter this in all the papers you read in this class. We use a lot of terms interchangeably.

324
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:47,079
There are reasons why we might use one or the other or prefer one over the other,

325
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:54,889
but be prepared to see weight bias weight stigma anti fat bias fat stigma fatphobia weight stigma.

326
00:33:54,890 --> 00:34:02,260
On here twice these are often used interchangeably without sort of a distinct reason, right?

327
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:10,380
Some people again just have preferred terms. There are times where a distinction may be made between weight bias and weight stake.

328
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,070
Muscle introduced that here, but in general we use these terms interchangeably.

329
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:18,540
Sometimes weight bias will be used to refer to that top line.

330
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:22,170
The attitudes, beliefs, stereotypes that we have.

331
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:28,560
Right? The things that we assume about people nurture bodies that might be specifically our church was weight bias,

332
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:35,190
whereas weight stigma is the enactment of that bias or the manifestation of that weight bias.

333
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:40,940
So that's something you may encounter. But again, more often than not, these terms are interchangeable.

334
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:45,270
That treatment, bad beliefs, systemic oppression of people in larger bodies.

335
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:51,070
Is it ever for people in smaller bodies? I love this question.

336
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,380
I will answer it. I have a slide that's called What about skinny shaming?

337
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:57,950
I used to have it as this slide right after this, and I decided to move it down.

338
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:06,590
And so now I'm thinking next time I'll come back to the question. So we say stereotypical beliefs or attitudes.

339
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,760
What do we mean? So here is my like wimpy word cloud of what the literature tells us.

340
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:16,750
There are studies upon studies of assumptions that people make about people in large bodies.

341
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:24,690
These are studies done among clinicians, doctors, dietitians, teachers, students of sort of what beliefs,

342
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:31,830
what assumptions do they make about people in larger bodies related to their health, their health behaviors, their character and their work ethic?

343
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,820
And this is what comes up time and time again in a series of terrible words,

344
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:41,670
really negative attributions and assumptions that people make about people larger bodies.

345
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,870
Lazy is probably the one that comes up most often in these studies.

346
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,799
Unmotivated, unhappy, unhealthy, unattractive. Weak willed. Again.

347
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,440
Assumptions about character, work ethic and health.

348
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,640
So if those are if we're thinking about the bias versus the enactment of that bias, how does this play out?

349
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:09,110
Like how does it sort of what does weight stigma look like? It comes in many different forms.

350
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:15,950
I have, for the purposes of slide for this class, have put them into four different categories.

351
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:24,920
This is just sort of my creation of categories. I think there is a lot of other ways that we see weight stigma come up.

352
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,629
And this is again, maybe not the best distinction,

353
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:33,380
but I want to start priming to think about different ways and different domains where you may notice weight stigma.

354
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:40,250
So I think most classically and most studied are the most overt, violent forms of weight stigma.

355
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,050
This is bullying, this is teasing, this is name calling.

356
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:53,780
This is bad social media behaviors like mean comments that are directed at people in larger bodies.

357
00:36:54,230 --> 00:37:01,730
And if you spend much time in social media comments, in accounts, a fat liberationist or simply a highway to people,

358
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:09,409
it is I mean, it's so egregious and so direct, but it's not sort of general negative comments about people, larger bodies.

359
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:15,560
It's sort of specific comments to a person about their worth, their value, their health, those types of things.

360
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:27,990
We also see weight bias and weight stigma come through in social relationships.

361
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:40,499
So the first picture is sort of depicting social ostracism, the extent to which heavier kids are less likely to be preferred as partners,

362
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:46,409
as friends, are less likely to sort of be invited to sit at the table, much like that type of stuff.

363
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:49,620
Is this weight bias by exclusion or ostracism?

364
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:55,650
You see similar things play out in online spaces and in romantic relationships.

365
00:37:55,650 --> 00:38:01,350
This is my like picture of probably a sham dating app.

366
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:08,370
You see higher weight folks less likely to be matched, sort of have less success in these types of dating relationships,

367
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:12,510
but dating relationships or romantic partnerships writ large.

368
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:25,870
Structural weight. Stigma is a gigantic category and that I am incorporating into this both structural physical spaces,

369
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:36,050
but also structural forms of stigma that are baked into policies and procedures in terms of physical spaces.

370
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:41,830
This is a picture of an airplane bathroom which are just so hostile to people.

371
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:46,839
In fact, bodies, particularly people with bodies with disabilities right there,

372
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,890
physical spaces that simply do not accommodate people with their bodies.

373
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:59,650
But we see this. I mean, airplanes, I think, are such a classic example because of airplane seats and because of sizes of.

374
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:05,320
What is the word I'm looking for? Read my mind on seatbelts. Thank you, seatbelts.

375
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:13,180
But we see this in-stadium seating, I think full to teach this class in a room that doesn't have attached seats.

376
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:23,100
That's the most an accommodating seat type, but yet we only have seats with armrests as far as I can tell in here.

377
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:26,570
Right. So that saying that in order to be in this class, you have to fit into the seats.

378
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,409
So it's the way that when we first got here,

379
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:36,790
this first row was pushed way back to make it really difficult for people in larger bodies to be able to sort of move through the physical space.

380
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:41,830
It's the way that stores only carry sizes for people in particular bodies.

381
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,620
So I always like to sort of use the airplane example of sort of how hostile airplanes are to fat people.

382
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:54,970
But what if you get to a destination, they've lost your luggage. Can you and your destination find your size of clothing in a store in that area?

383
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,930
In this country, as many problems as we have with weight bias,

384
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:03,280
we often have stores that accommodate a wide range of sizes, a fairly wide range of sizes.

385
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,930
That's not true in all of the world.

386
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,470
So these are things that we thinking about the way that our physical environments tell us that bodies are the default.

387
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:17,679
In terms of policy, I have highlighted our it's rare that the Michigan is red.

388
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,520
I should actually change the color. But you'll notice I've highlighted the state of Michigan.

389
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,469
This is the only state in the country where it is illegal to discriminate against

390
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:30,580
someone on the basis of housing and employment because of their body size.

391
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:40,540
We are the only state that you cannot do that in every other state. It is perfectly legal not to hire someone because of their body size by Michigan.

392
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,370
It's a really good question. We will talk about sort of the history of it.

393
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:53,019
It feels sort of random and there wasn't like a person who was like a fat liberationist, like at the table, day one that sort of added in.

394
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:59,080
It just got added pretty early in our civil rights laws on the laundry list of protected identities.

395
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:05,620
And there, again, there doesn't seem to be a great reason why Michigan seemed to include in other places didn't.

396
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,469
The unfortunate news is that it's not been used quite a lot.

397
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:19,810
It's super difficult to prove, to prove. And there are loopholes in this law that sort of complicates it.

398
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:28,240
And yet at least it has a model that it can be included as a protected identity.

399
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:34,150
And there are other states like Massachusetts and some others that are trying to get it added.

400
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:41,889
So it seems like sort of step one because in in reducing legal discrimination,

401
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:49,480
because a lot of things stemmed from civil rights laws like school bully policies will often use the same list of protected identities.

402
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:59,230
And so in most places, weight is not on the list of identities in school bully laws, even though it's the most common reason for youth bullying.

403
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:03,460
So it's it's imperfect, exciting that we have it, but sort of a step in the right direction.

404
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:16,520
And the last. Categories, microaggressions, which is like a really generic kind of broad term, but it is sort of sort of the soup that we swim in.

405
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:24,859
I think diet culture is a microaggression the way that we assume that complimenting someone because they look thin or they look like they lost weight,

406
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,950
the idea that this is an acceptable thing to do, again,

407
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:35,329
this is suggesting that thinness is inherently good or better and that is is sort of weight bias at the core.

408
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,370
But this is common, right?

409
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:44,410
This is sort of kind of in school public health, the assumption that weight loss and thinness is good and weight gain and fatness is bad.

410
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:48,020
That is the thing we hear so much in a school like this.

411
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:53,420
And I don't mean to pick this one person to sort of completely throw her under the bus,

412
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:59,329
but she had two particularly terrible tweets that highlighted two different elements

413
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:04,100
of weight related microaggressions that I felt sort of useful to highlight.

414
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,579
If, like, this is what we mean when we talk about microaggressions, these are pretty nasty.

415
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:15,440
So maybe they are rise to a different level. But the first one is I love when formerly Pretty Girls Get Fat makes my day that much better, right?

416
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,889
This is then supremacy in action. This is that if you are fatter,

417
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:27,620
I am inherently better than you and I can judge you that awkward moment when you're not going to comment on their incorrect use of your butt.

418
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:34,100
The awkward moment when you're in the elevator with a fat guy who should really be taking the steps again as if in person she can be in the elevator.

419
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:40,310
A fat person should not be doing that. They don't have rights or access to things because of their body size.

420
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:45,290
So it's these kind of assumptions that she shouldn't be wearing that because her because of her body size,

421
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:50,329
she shouldn't this like this that the idea that there's sort of a different set of rules or behaviors,

422
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:59,150
there's a different set of respect and compassion for people that is contingent on the way that their bodies look.

423
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:09,220
Thoughts on this. Not next week, but the following week.

424
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:20,650
If I'm remembering right, your first reflection will be to talk about some examples of weight bias that you have seen or you have encountered,

425
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:27,250
mostly to get you thinking about the different ways and the different spaces that weight bias comes up.

426
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:34,479
Next week we'll be talking about weight bias in the context of health care and public health, so you can be thinking of examples from those domains.

427
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:41,070
It's not specific to domain, but you just have an opportunity to be kind of always thinking and looking about.

428
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:47,709
And that's sort of where it comes up in really obvious and maybe more subtle ways that the goal of that activity.

429
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:48,670
So over the next couple of weeks,

430
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:59,590
you can be thinking about that and you'll be writing up where you saw it and what you might think is the appropriate way to react to it.

431
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:03,129
Like what? What might we do to respond in the moment?

432
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:12,710
Or what could we enact to prevent that from happening in the first place? So in general, I forgot to mention I will typically.

433
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,470
Break at the half.

434
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:25,910
Have a 10 to 15 minutes to break so that the group that's presenting can sort of pull up their slides and rest a second before they present.

435
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:34,850
I suspect we are less than 15 minutes out to the end, so I will keep going through.

436
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:41,570
You can leave at any time. Don't feel like you need a break to step out and to do any of the things.

437
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:47,240
But in terms of the class structure, I'll just keep going since we're getting close to the end.

438
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:56,510
So internalized weight bias. So we talked about ways that weight bias is enacted.

439
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:05,329
Weight bias can also be internalized and any type of exposure to weight bias going to increase the chance that we are internalizing weight bias,

440
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:09,650
right? The more that we see it around us, the more likely we are to internalize it.

441
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:15,530
So this type of internalization can happen in a way that people in larger bodies

442
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:20,000
believe negative stereotypes about themselves and that they deserve mistreatment.

443
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:23,959
The more you see it, the more you think those folks are right about me, right?

444
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:29,280
Or I, if I did lose weight, I would get X, Y or Z, right?

445
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,400
That's what internalized weight bias can look like.

446
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:40,190
Weight bias is a like two other types of impressions in some ways and really different in other ways.

447
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,290
And we'll sort of think through that over the course of the semester one way.

448
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:51,239
One of the ways in which it is unique and it's somewhat, again, a perfectly different but unique somewhat,

449
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:57,750
is that many other stigmatized groups again, not all, but many will demonstrate in-group favoritism.

450
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:05,190
Right. If you have a religion, for example, where you are oppressed because of that,

451
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:10,650
you often have community with people of the same religion might feel pride.

452
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:19,110
Again, you have sort of a strong identity of group membership. That type of identity or membership is often not true of people in larger bodies.

453
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:24,780
The exception there again are fat, liberationist and people who have found community within places like health at every size.

454
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:33,660
But very often heavier individuals demonstrate weight, bias, internalization and internalization of negative messages about fatness.

455
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:41,740
When you internalize weight bias, this can lead to feelings of incompetence, self-hatred and devaluation.

456
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:46,120
So we'll talk about in this class that experiencing weight stigma probably not a surprise.

457
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,660
It's not like a spoiler alert. EXPRESS a weight stigma is not good for health.

458
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:55,569
Right? This is not predict greatness in terms of health. When you internalize it, it seems to be even worse.

459
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:59,080
Right. If you are mistreated and you believe that you deserve that mistreatment,

460
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:04,660
that is a particularly pernicious combination and a way to experience stigma.

461
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:11,620
What about skinny shaming? The important question of the day, are we to talk about skinny shaming in this class?

462
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:15,340
No, this is the only slide. Does skinny shaming exist?

463
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:20,740
Absolutely right. People can be teased or bullied because of their thin bodies.

464
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:25,360
Any time you are teased or bullied because of the way that your body looks, that is bad for you.

465
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:29,049
Right. It is always bad to be teased and bullied.

466
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:33,380
It can make you individually feel terrible. So it does exist,

467
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:39,200
but it's not the same as the type of weight based oppression we're in to talk about this class and

468
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:44,749
that that is experienced by individuals in larger bodies because there is no systemic equivalent.

469
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:50,959
And what I mean by that is thin bodies are the default, thin bodies are celebrated in this country.

470
00:48:50,960 --> 00:49:00,560
So you are not sort of withheld good treatments. You have just have less access to kind of goods and resources because of your thin body.

471
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:04,370
So if skinny shaming exists, it can be really hurtful.

472
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:08,870
But it is not the type of weight bias we'd be talking about in this class.

473
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:14,030
This is probably the only time I will quote Self magazine in this kind in this class.

474
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:20,510
But I thought this is a really nice way to characterize why we think about skinny shaming so differently.

475
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:28,069
So fat stigma like sexism and racism is another oppressive cultural institutional system, one that degrades people of size.

476
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:34,160
The advantage of people who live in more socially acceptable bodies, so thin bodies, even very thin bodies,

477
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:40,610
have a degree of social acceptability or people may idealize or prize those bodies.

478
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:44,360
And so that's how why we think about them differently in the context of this class.

479
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:52,260
Russians on that. More on fitness.

480
00:49:53,070 --> 00:50:02,580
We all talk about where weight bias comes from a bit more later in the class, but just as an introduction for the purpose of day one of this class,

481
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:13,590
one of the reasons or one of sort of the the sources or sort of the origins of weight bias comes from our body ideals.

482
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:21,479
What we've decided as a society and by we, it is not a global view because only certain people are included in those decisions,

483
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:30,270
but it's it's who is generally idealized in our society and in most societies, but particularly in our Western society.

484
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:36,160
Fitness and leanness is idealized. These did not come out of nowhere.

485
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:43,600
Again, when I said we we knew exactly who we were talking about. Our body ideals are very much Eurocentric.

486
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:49,420
They are rooted in Puritanism and the transatlantic slave trade.

487
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:53,700
Right. Who was that? Who was sort of the ideal body and who was othered?

488
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:58,570
The the way that our bodies looked at our body size,

489
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:07,460
those concerns and that type of sorting happened long before we had concerns related to weight and health.

490
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:10,980
Right. Our weight by is not because. Oh, we just want everyone to be healthy. Absolutely not.

491
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:21,640
This is a way of of creating a systems of superiority and thinness and leanness is what we are currently in,

492
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:26,470
what currently is idealized as our as our ideal.

493
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:33,090
So again, these are longstanding and there has been some variability about sort of how said is the ideal thin, but it's always been lean.

494
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:42,700
It's always been thin in this country. By the early 19th century, fatness was deemed evidence of a more immorality and racial inferiority.

495
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:52,370
If you are interested. In this particular concept and the kind of anti-black origins of our body ideals,

496
00:51:52,760 --> 00:52:01,670
I'll point out to different scholars and thought leaders Sabrina Strings and John Harrison, who have written excellent books on this topic.

497
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,790
You'll hear more about some of their work later on in this class. But that's sort of where weight bias comes from, right?

498
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:17,180
As a society, there is an ideal that has been imposed on us that in order to have the a body that is revered, it must be thin, it must be lean.

499
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:21,830
It should also be weights and gender conforming and other things that come along with this.

500
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:30,350
But in the context of body size, leanness and thinness has been prioritized and they layer on that the notion of personal responsibility.

501
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:38,120
So the notion of personal responsibility is a born from lessons from affirmation theory, right?

502
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:44,560
That weight is controllable. We assume it's controllable if you are not controlling it, that's your fault, right?

503
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:51,830
That this is on you. And again, individualism is a product is a characteristic of white supremacy culture.

504
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:56,540
But this idea that you can control your weight and therefore you should be doing it if you're not, you are a failure.

505
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:04,850
That is this issue of personal responsibility. And we cosign this like crazy public health, right?

506
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:10,969
We send messages of you should eat this and that, and if you don't do this, that's on you, right?

507
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:13,640
The consequences is yours. We did everything we could, right?

508
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,990
This idea that you that weight is perfectly controllable and health is perfectly controllable,

509
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:23,780
that is just a product of or is a function of weight bias.

510
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:29,530
And again, when you have these messages of personal responsibility, if someone, again, is not doing what they're supposed to do,

511
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:39,770
they're not controlling it the way that they should, then it really justifies bias as stigma, as a success or as a acceptable societal response.

512
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:48,590
You could control this if you want to. Therefore, you are more deserving of stigma than someone who has an identity that is not controllable.

513
00:53:51,620 --> 00:54:01,419
Questions on. So why are we talking about wi fi and public health?

514
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:10,030
Maybe this should actually be the first slide. This is why I teach this class the way bias has implications across disciplines.

515
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:14,200
I think the importance of wi fi and public health is that it's widespread and structural.

516
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:17,920
We are in the business of things are widespread and structural in public health.

517
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:22,390
It is harmful specifically. It's harmful to health. It contributes to health disparities.

518
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:30,700
It is a social justice issue and we are part of the problem. So next week, we'll talk about some some public health messaging that is way biased.

519
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:35,470
We are using messages of personal responsibility all the time in public health.

520
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:41,530
And so that's why it's critical that we're talking about it here. All right.

521
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,890
So I want to end with talking about terminology.

522
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:52,360
So if you had a chance to read the article by Angela Meadows, you have a little bit of an intro to the debate on terminology.

523
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:56,390
If you didn't get a chance to do it before today, I know today is the 4th of January.

524
00:54:57,110 --> 00:55:04,010
You can read it before next week. It's actually pretty brief, but it's it's sort of a nice conversation about the debate with terminology.

525
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:11,990
So we'll start by acknowledging that differences in preferred terminology to describe body size and weight exist even among people, larger bodies.

526
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:16,819
Right. It's not like there is one term everyone loves. There's no disagreement.

527
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:27,530
So let's just use that one term. Unfortunately, maybe not surprisingly, the most preferred terms within people's lived experience.

528
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:34,580
Right. If we're thinking about who should we ask about preferred terminology, asking people with those identities seems like a good place to start.

529
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:41,450
The terminology preferred by people with lived experience often do not align with what we use in public health,

530
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:45,050
what government agencies use, what researchers and clinicians use.

531
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:51,890
They tend to favor a person first language when it comes to obesity or folks familiar with person first language.

532
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:56,389
I talk about the article. So person with overweight, person with obesity.

533
00:55:56,390 --> 00:56:00,200
Man with obesity. Grammatically, it's weird, but that's fine. I can get over grammar.

534
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,080
There are concerns about that.

535
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:12,380
Construction is that we only use people first construction when we're talking about attributes that we consider illnesses or undesirable.

536
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:17,329
Right. And so there's a judgment there in. Right. We don't call people a person with blind.

537
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:23,710
Right. Because like whatever. It's just the color of your hair. We only use it when it feels like something that is taboo or an illness.

538
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:35,630
And the idea behind person first language was that it's sort of the it prevents you from idea of identifying person by their illness.

539
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:40,580
Everyone, most folks appropriately, folks, the valuation community,

540
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:45,260
don't think about their fatness as an illness and they think about it central to their identity.

541
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:52,430
Right. And so when someone that has no lived experience with embodiment says, this is how I prefer to call you.

542
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:58,730
I think that this thing is a disease, and I would like to tack it on to the end of your identity because it is separate from you.

543
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:03,260
It's something that you kind of should get rid of. That is the concern there with people first language.

544
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:11,540
When you publish in a scientific journal, often they request or you require or require you to use that terminology.

545
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:15,949
We can talk about ways around that, but you're going to see people first language all the time in public health.

546
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:19,850
And it's useful to know that a lot of people in larger bodies do not prefer that.

547
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:26,790
So the term that is most aligned with the preferences of the fat liberation social justice movement is the word fat.

548
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:36,510
The term fat may be something that you cringe when you hear it because there it is, a word that carries a lot of trauma and baggage for people.

549
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:40,470
It has historically been used as a derogatory term, as a slur.

550
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:43,560
It is used in a very unkind way.

551
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:53,730
The use of this term and the preference for this term within the fat liberation movement is using this term as a as an act of reclamation.

552
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:57,410
Right. Like this term has been used so negatively against me,

553
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:04,590
I will take this term back and think about it not as a inherently bad quality, just as a neutral quality.

554
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:12,240
Right? Just as you can be short or tall, you can be fat or thin, but these could be morally neutral terms.

555
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:19,379
The reclamation of this term is, I think, really similar to what we see in the queer community.

556
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:23,280
The term queer used to be really thought of as a slur, as a pejorative term,

557
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:30,040
and that word is very much reclaimed and very much preferred among many folks.

558
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:35,880
Older queer folks may hate it more because that is a term that they have not always thought of as a reclaimed term.

559
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:41,459
But that is sort of a kind of the probably closest analogy is this is a term that I could self-identify.

560
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:46,350
You can't hurt me with this term essentially, because it's like how I self-identify. Yeah, I can have a dead body, I believe, at that body.

561
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:54,150
Again, I wouldn't assume that all people in larger bodies prefer the term [INAUDIBLE] because again, the trauma that comes with that word.

562
00:58:54,540 --> 00:59:04,800
So I would never make that assumption. We always let people in an individual context declare their own preferred terminology.

563
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:12,870
I do. In a group settings, in scientific settings, I will use the term fat against a challenge people write.

564
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:17,219
If people are bristling at this term, like, Ooh, I don't like the word fat, it's useful to think about why, what?

565
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:23,950
What assumptions are you making? Why don't you like that term? What are biases or beliefs you have about fatness that make that term bad?

566
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:28,049
Let's unpack that. So I think it's a it's a it's a fun word. Maybe that's not exactly right.

567
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:31,230
We describe it's a fun word to sort of sort of challenge people with.

568
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:36,030
But again, individuals may have more or less comfort with that word in particular.

569
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:46,980
So here is a sort of a grid I've made to sort of acknowledge that we have not a lot of overlap in terms of preferences with terminology.

570
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:52,440
So the ABC field, they use people first language.

571
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,889
They say this is the standard for addressing people with chronic diseases is to

572
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:59,280
put the chronic disease after them to avoid labeling people with their illness.

573
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:04,890
That people say, stop telling me that my body is an illness. Here again, fat is a preferred term.

574
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:11,610
You may also see within that activism spaces or weight bias or wrong way by scholars.

575
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:15,390
You may see people use larger body, higher weight, person of size.

576
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:21,180
The words are very much disliked. And by words, I mean obesity, overweight.

577
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:27,899
I will rarely use those words in this class I do today as sort of a kind of a descriptor of what we're talking about,

578
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:34,870
terms of terminology, because I look to people's lived experience and default to their preferred terms.

579
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:41,300
The times what I will use overweight or obese will be when I'm referring to a scale or like

580
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:46,320
that's the title of the scale or a center where that's the title of that the the center.

581
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:54,210
But in general, I try to avoid those words because they are experienced as just mental and pathologizing.

582
01:00:56,750 --> 01:01:01,579
It's also important to note that there is a literature out there that asks about

583
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:05,330
preferred terminology among people who are seeking treatment for their weight.

584
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,360
So people are going to weight management, going to bariatric surgery.

585
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:17,210
Unfortunately, a lot of folks in this group will say, well, this is what people say, people with obesity.

586
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:21,560
They like these words, recognizing that this is a very biased subsample.

587
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:27,690
Right. Of all the people with larger bodies, that this is sort of a kind of a more inclusive group.

588
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:34,670
But in studies where you ask people who are going to to try to lose weight, again,

589
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:38,300
these are folks who are also probably internalizing weight bias quite a lot.

590
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:41,900
They also don't like the word obese.

591
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:50,700
They tend to like weight or BMI. In this this group, they also tend not to like the word fat because they're not using it as a reclaimed term.

592
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,690
Right. They're thinking about it as an identity. They're trying to escape.

593
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:59,750
And so that's why you see some discomfort with the word fat in this group is because their patients are not necessarily liking it,

594
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:04,730
because these folks are not going in for weight management. Somebody said, sorry, I was just a little like puppetry there.

595
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:11,639
All right, so what do we do? Do we have any common ground? Here's what I think of in terms of common ground.

596
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:16,740
And then I'm going to be interested to hear what you all think about terminology we can be using in this class.

597
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:23,100
When you're working with individuals or individual communities, asked about preferred terminology, that's always the right choice.

598
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:29,420
It is particularly the right choice when you're working with people who inhabit identities that you do not yourself inhabit.

599
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:35,190
Always the right choice. Never, ever, ever, ever use the term morbid obesity.

600
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:39,300
No one thinks this is the right term. It is antiquated offensive by all.

601
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:47,010
It is not in the DSM anymore, not the DSM. It was never in the DSM, but not in ICD nine, ICD ten, ICD 11.

602
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:53,750
This is not a term that exists for people who are trying to document various body sizes.

603
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,409
There are as class one, class two, class three, class four distinctions in obesity.

604
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:08,700
But no, no more morbid obesity. I will often use in my own scientific communication higher weight, lower weight, larger body, smaller body.

605
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:13,120
Even though journals may like the words.

606
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:15,090
Everyone knows that. I mean, when I use that.

607
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:23,850
And so if you're at your communicating a place where fat is not acceptable and you're not comfortable using the word obese,

608
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:29,010
and again, I'm not telling you that is a thing you have to be uncomfortable with. But if that's where you are, that happens to be where I am.

609
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:31,890
This is what I use and it works fine. People know exactly what I mean.

610
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:43,000
Other words that perpetuate stereotypes that I'm also going to challenge folks to think about is what we're using as comparator groups.

611
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:50,020
And we'll talk a little bit more about options to describe these folks on the next slide.

612
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:59,770
But when we pathologize people, larger bodies, we are also saying that people in fitter bodies are inherently healthier normal.

613
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:06,820
That is also reinforcing weight bias and is making assumptions based on people's body size that we can't and shouldn't make.

614
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:18,130
We can and should avoid drawing assumptions about people and their lived experience and life experience based on their body size.

615
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:21,680
So I'll see in articles as person suffers from obesity.

616
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,780
How do know their suffering? Like why is struggling with ABC?

617
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,410
What are they struggling with? How do you know? Right.

618
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:32,350
We can't make this assumption that if your body is large that you're automatically struggling with your weight or suffering.

619
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:36,639
So those words can be gone. Obesity paradox.

620
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:45,430
Is that a concept folks are familiar with? We're going to talk about it in the Weight Science Lecture.

621
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:52,000
The obesity paradox is a term that's used describe actually a range of heterogeneous studies,

622
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,460
but essentially any study that shows that weight, high weight is not bad for you.

623
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:07,690
They label that the obesity paradox may be just weight is actually is not a monolith.

624
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:12,399
Right. We can't assume every weight is bad for all outcomes and this way it's good for all outcomes.

625
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:17,980
Right. There are some things where you will see a protective association with health, with high weight and such.

626
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,829
You will see a protective association with low weight.

627
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:26,760
And so trying to assume that anything that doesn't fit that paradigm of if you're thin, you're good, if you're fat, you're bad.

628
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:32,829
We call it a paradox. That's actually not a paradox. That's just reality and sort of this type of term that assumes that you only

629
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:37,630
can find one type of findings is another term we can remove from our lexicon.

630
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:48,150
So in terms of how just to sort of be aware of other terminology to consider within fat liberation communities.

631
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:55,640
Again, fat is the preferred term. You will also see people self describe themselves on the spectrum in terms of how fat they are.

632
01:05:55,910 --> 01:06:05,620
Small fat, mid fat, large fat. Super fat. Or if. You it's it's probably not a useful exercise to say what are the cut offs here.

633
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:08,720
Again, we're not trying to categorize people into BMI categories. Right.

634
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:13,100
But just to acknowledge that there is quite a lot of variability within the fat spectrum.

635
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:17,239
And folks here with small fats have a lot of thin privilege.

636
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:20,660
Right. You do not need to be thin and thin to have thin privilege.

637
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:23,750
Right. The closer you are to thinness, the more privilege you have.

638
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:30,020
And so to recognize when we are centering people's lived experience, are we only ever centering these folks?

639
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,490
And if we do that, who are who are we leaving out?

640
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:39,680
So just acknowledging that there is a spectrum here and that probably in the podcast that you listen to, these types of descriptors may come up.

641
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,680
So be aware that they exist. Small, fat stuff that's large.

642
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:47,780
As I mentioned that the term healthy weight and normal weight,

643
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:54,739
we should be sort of checking those because it's again making assumptions about people's health based on their body size thin.

644
01:06:54,740 --> 01:07:01,670
Again, as the preferred term. There are folks that have thin privilege are often uncomfortable self-identifying as thin.

645
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:06,440
I can share that. That has always been sort of a weird thing for me to say, to say like, Hey everyone,

646
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:13,940
nice thin because and that's not a way that people might describe me and yet I have thin privilege, right?

647
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:20,690
And to not claim that you have thin privilege because you're white, your weight is that super, super thin is weight bias.

648
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:27,139
Right. And we have to if we have privilege because of our body size and if you can shop at a conventional store and find your clothes,

649
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:30,890
if you've never had to ask for a lap extender belt, you have that privilege.

650
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:36,049
Right? So it is preferable to use the term then when self-identifying your privileges,

651
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:39,830
even if you're struggling with sort of the notion of how thin is my body and who actually counts us,

652
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:43,280
then you might also hear the term straight size,

653
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:50,450
which is fine and use actually quite a lot in declaration communities as as a comparison to plus size.

654
01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:58,430
Right again are you someone who can go to a grown or a grocery store or go to a clothing store and easily find your size?

655
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:04,880
You can also use lower weight, smaller bodied and the dreaded mid-size who is familiar with the concept of midsize.

656
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:11,150
All right because of landed that mid-sized tick tock. So that's right here.

657
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:17,270
Right. The people who are street signs but are probably behind the street sized size.

658
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:21,469
And so sometimes trashy stores don't sell your exact size.

659
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:25,580
So you really struggle with identifying this thin because you're almost fat but not quite fat.

660
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:34,879
That's another term that's out there. Folks in the pet liberation community tend to dislike those folks as a movement, not as a human,

661
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:39,440
but as a movement, because, again, it's trying to sort of move who gets to consider themselves oppressed.

662
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:48,140
And the more we sort of include smaller people in the in the umbrella of that, the less attention these folks get.

663
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:54,290
It's not to say that there are not sort of unique issues, sort of the closer you are to this right,

664
01:08:54,410 --> 01:09:01,370
you're experiencing more weight bias, maybe more social ostracism, more difficulty in dating or those types of things.

665
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:05,030
The closer you get to this, again, less clothing options, the closer you get to this.

666
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,309
But that's what sort of the term mid-size is.

667
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:13,639
And that's sort of a tricky space to think about what to do with people who have sort of less than privilege,

668
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:21,380
that very thin people, but who shouldn't be centered in fat liberation or sort of conversations about we bias.

669
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:30,680
Questions on that. All right.

670
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:40,210
Talk to me. So what we're trying to land at is how we want to use terminology in this course.

671
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:44,380
And I recognize that some of the concepts I've introduced are new.

672
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:50,430
Maybe the first time you're were sort of hearing about the concerns related to the words and the term facts.

673
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:55,720
And so I don't expect us to walk out of here with everyone feeling like I know exactly what words I'm using forever and ever.

674
01:09:56,380 --> 01:10:03,700
But I want to ask if people have reactions to the conversation or the information I just shared about terminology.

675
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:12,290
Any thoughts about, like all things being equal, which we should prefer, words that we should definitely avoid as a class.

676
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:16,580
Too soon to make those decisions. Your first thought was interesting too.

677
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:19,640
Like in the reading. Like I had never considered that.

678
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:23,360
Like because you hear about obesity being a disease,

679
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:31,070
but that wasn't necessarily like fully and unanimously agreed upon and like how that can actually be harmful to some people.

680
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:37,760
It's and I can understand how those terms could be harmful and how they may not see that as a disease.

681
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,120
That's just like who they are. Yeah. And it was very much not the consensus.

682
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:46,910
Right. The working group that was tasked with deciding whether or not obesity should become a disease recommended against it.

683
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:49,520
And yet here it is added as a disease.

684
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:56,540
And there are reasons for it, a lot of financial reasons why certain people benefit from having it listed as a disease,

685
01:10:56,540 --> 01:11:00,740
mostly of pharmaceutical companies, people who are billing for weight management services.

686
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:06,380
But the interest of all of that people were not considered in that decision.

687
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:12,489
And get some folks that everybody's happy, right. Because they get more access to weight management treatment.

688
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:21,399
Right. So there are people in larger bodies who want their weight treated who are wanting to lose weight again.

689
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:28,690
They have really high levels of weight buys and fertilization, and yet they are people whose experience, whose perspectives are valid.

690
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:30,970
And so that's sort of a tricky place to land of.

691
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:35,530
If some folks are actually wanting treatment, how are we advocating for that community more generally?

692
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:48,379
Other thoughts? I was just curious about when the terminology like fat liberation, like hit the scene, as it were,

693
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:55,590
and also how like older terms, like body positivity interact and how they're perceived today.

694
01:11:55,970 --> 01:11:59,760
Yeah. So these are good questions which we will like for sure get to.

695
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:00,900
I'm trying to think how much they go into.

696
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:10,399
So the question is sort of when did we decide to use the term fat liberation and how do we make sense of that

697
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:17,870
movement with the body positivity movement and the Fat Activism Lecture is sort of completely dedicated to this.

698
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:22,459
So I will just sort of give maybe a brief piece of information.

699
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:27,590
So folks who identified as fat liberationist have been around for a really, really long time.

700
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:33,649
There was I'm totally blank on the year, I think it was in the late sixties.

701
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:40,310
I have a slide on this where there was actually a fat in in Central Park where people who self-identified as fat,

702
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:47,360
who were advocating for their own rights, it was like again, part of sort of the second wave of feminism type movement.

703
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:52,670
So those folks have been around for a long time, but that movement has grown,

704
01:12:53,930 --> 01:13:01,850
has just grown in size as people have become more aware of issues related to terminology.

705
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:08,110
I think this idea of like fat being a slur folks have held onto for a really long time and the movement has begun,

706
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:12,379
has gotten a lot more organized since then.

707
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:18,860
And it's specifically become more organized because fat people are leading the movement more.

708
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:28,100
The original organization that was dedicated to fat acceptance was started by white men who were thin,

709
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:36,860
who had fat wives, and saw that their wives were being mistreated and so started the organization on their behalf.

710
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:41,420
And you can imagine the problems that ensued because of that.

711
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:45,799
But the more that we have people in leadership positions within fat advocacy organizations

712
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:49,190
who are fat and who again are inhabiting many other marginalized identities,

713
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:53,040
the more clarity there has been in terms of messaging,

714
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:59,450
in terms of terminology, I'm trying to remember when fat studies as a scientific discipline emerged,

715
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:05,000
I believe it was in, I want to say 86, but in five lecture you can remind me that I was wrong.

716
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:08,000
But there has been that movement from sort of the sixties, the eighties,

717
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:14,750
and it was around the eighties where body positivity sort of skyrocketed and it sort of stemmed from the fat liberation movement.

718
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:19,670
It was designed to be packaged as like a more palatable version of fat liberation.

719
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:25,280
And what ended up happening is these folks got centered, right?

720
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:33,229
It's okay to be positive if you're not that fat, but if you're also have an hourglass figure and are also beautiful, these other conventional ways.

721
01:14:33,230 --> 01:14:42,080
And so body positivity, while good in its initial intentions, the people that benefited from most were pretty not fat white women.

722
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:50,360
And so there was like excitement initially is like this is how we're going to sort of get the masses interested in issues of weight stigma,

723
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:54,590
and it ended up serving the people who were least marginalized within the movement.

724
01:14:54,890 --> 01:15:00,920
And so there was a bit of sort of rejection of that movement specifically within fat liberation communities,

725
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:04,970
because it is not it has become about sort of appearance.

726
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:11,720
It's been sort of more parents focused and not focused on sort of fat oppression.

727
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:19,280
I think that's sort of answered your question. So yeah, so it's been sort of a movement in the making for a long time.

728
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:26,359
That sort of, I think, coalesced together with more sort of clear distinction of where does body positivity?

729
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:30,080
It's sort of better than nothing because it's often where many people are first introduced,

730
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:33,170
introduced to notions that ultimately lead them to fat liberation.

731
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:37,790
But it's insufficient because it is, again, not advocating for the most oppressed within the movement.

732
01:15:40,730 --> 01:15:50,750
Other thoughts on terminology. I would feel ready to say, like, let's never say this word.

733
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:54,350
I'm always use this word or do we need to use on it a little bit longer?

734
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:08,479
Yeah. I feel like at least based on what we've talked about in the reading and thus far in the lecture,

735
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:14,480
I feel like describing people as higher weight or lower weight is kind of the most appropriate,

736
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:19,730
like neutral, like, yeah, no one's really happy, but like, no, it's really mad.

737
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:25,980
Kind of wishy washy option. Yeah. How can we [INAUDIBLE] off the fewest number of people?

738
01:16:26,010 --> 01:16:32,159
Right. Unfortunately, that like matches like my Midwestern sensibility in a way that,

739
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:36,320
like, probably doesn't challenge me enough, but it's a good place to start, right? That's where I often land.

740
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:39,810
I sort of throw out the occasional fat to get people excited.

741
01:16:40,110 --> 01:16:44,000
I mean, I speak in sort of scientific places a lot, and that gets people riled up.

742
01:16:44,010 --> 01:16:47,159
The number of people that will email me, you know, you're not supposed to use that word.

743
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:50,720
It's like, I think your answer. Right.

744
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:57,150
So, so good to sort of practice sort of a range of terminology.

745
01:16:57,150 --> 01:17:00,990
But a really safe place is to talk about higher weight, lower weight.

746
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:08,400
And in some respects, to sort of acknowledge that weight bias, just like body size, exists on a spectrum.

747
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:16,650
Right. Small fats are experiencing a lot less weight bias than people who identify as super fats.

748
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:21,030
And so to use a term that feels a little bit more continuous rather than binary

749
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:28,010
can be can be useful in sort of communicating that other thoughts that I have.

750
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:34,499
No, no, you know, obesity and the other word, overweight, a reference it didn't remember.

751
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:38,309
Those words exist. They're gone. Is it from like the BMI leg?

752
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:46,590
Is that where it started? Yeah. So those terms have always mostly been linked to BMI cutoffs.

753
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:52,049
There was a time where those terms in kids, actually in adults, too, were linked to skin folds.

754
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:56,250
But that was like actually a very brief period of time. It's always been based on BMI.

755
01:17:56,250 --> 01:18:04,860
We're talk about in this class the limitations of BMI, how inherently problematic it is given kind of its origins and how it's applied.

756
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:16,409
But overweight and obesity are not a diagnoses that are based on a wide range of parameters that can be individualized.

757
01:18:16,410 --> 01:18:21,210
It is simply based on a calculation of height and weight.

758
01:18:22,370 --> 01:18:27,469
So I think that's one of the I mean, one of many concerns of like, let's stop categorizing bodies for a lot of reasons.

759
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:34,580
But I think one of the major concerns is that it provides such little nuance or such little ability to adapt

760
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:40,820
for information that you might have related to people's health or genetics or muscularity or other things.

761
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:47,090
And also, it's a tool to pathologize people, right, to put people in that you're not okay and you are okay.

762
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:57,890
Buckets Yeah. So I feel like historically with in the past couple of hundred years there's just been like an always like a total erasure of like that.

763
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:02,990
Whereas like we just don't like, we always think about like people being fat now.

764
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:07,490
But before, for some reason, the past couple of hundred years, it wasn't a thing.

765
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:18,799
Is there a reason for that? Or like a time period where that started to become like quote unquote an issue and yeah, so a lot of fat erasure.

766
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:25,990
So in every, every context in time and space or have always been fat people, right?

767
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:32,480
There is no amount of public health intervention that would eradicate fat people.

768
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:36,950
In fact, that existed, that would be eugenics. Let's not go down that path.

769
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:45,620
But the sort of fat panic that happened, particularly in this country, started late eighties.

770
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:55,999
And it was around at the time that we did have a shift in the distribution of BMI on a population level, but pretty small, right?

771
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,800
So like all of the population shifts that we've had, it's sort of the mean BMI.

772
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:07,850
The population level goes up a little bit. And when that happens, the number of people that sort of fall off the cliff of BMI, 30 and 25 go up.

773
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:16,639
And that was sort of the first time that we were documenting that from an epidemiologic standpoint.

774
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:24,230
Right. That's where we sort of NHANES National Data was saying that our people this category is more let's panic about it.

775
01:20:24,230 --> 01:20:31,750
But like we didn't have the ships were actually not as dramatic as you would think given the amount of coverage that was happening.

776
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:40,880
It was just a time where sort of epidemiology and epidemiologic reporting sort of caught up with us and we decided we felt panic about that.

777
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:47,600
I think it's actually hard to come up with a good reason, like why the eighties, why the early nineties.

778
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:54,889
There are people who could profit off of offering weight loss medications and weight loss surgery.

779
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:59,150
There was some innovation happening around that time, so that might be part of the reason.

780
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:10,730
But it's a great question because this has always existed. So I know, you know, to, like, ask about someone's, like, preference and their terminology.

781
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:14,630
How would you bring that up in the most appropriate way?

782
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:20,780
Yes. So this is particularly relevant to clinical context.

783
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:31,370
And my general recommendation in clinical context is probably never talk about weight, but if you are going to,

784
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:39,020
you feel like it's necessary providing really open ended, really neutral questions like how is this weight for you?

785
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:42,290
Rather than saying, Do you worry about your weight is this way?

786
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:45,560
How have you lost weight? Gain weight like how is this way for you? People can say it's normal.

787
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,299
I'm worried about it. I'm not worried about it.

788
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:52,490
I don't think about it like there's you're not sort of leading people to talk about weight in a specific way.

789
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:59,449
They can also say, you know, people have a wide range of preferences that of terms they like to use in their talk about their bodies.

790
01:21:59,450 --> 01:22:04,969
Are there particular terms you want me to use or want me to stay away from? Would it be okay if we are even talking about your weight?

791
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:10,580
So just like asking permission, asking about preferences is sort of as nonchalantly as possible.

792
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:15,230
Again, it's harder to do in mixed groups. When we talk.

793
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:20,540
When I talk to mix groups, I will often introduce the terms that I'm using.

794
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:24,869
I will often share my position ality and talk about my privileges related to body size.

795
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:28,790
Say I'm going to use these terms today in our talk. These are the terms I'm not going to use.

796
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:34,909
And here is why just sort of put people on the same page as they are.

797
01:22:34,910 --> 01:22:38,540
There any objections or terms that you're hoping that I don't use as I move ahead?

798
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:43,490
So just trying to like get permission and check checking with people if you're talking in mixed company.

799
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:50,380
So I was a bit confused about the earlier point about the BMI.

800
01:22:50,410 --> 01:23:00,630
Yes. So are you saying that? Let's say, for looking at the total percentage of people classified as obese or overweight.

801
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,709
Yeah. And those percentages increase.

802
01:23:02,710 --> 01:23:12,530
But if we actually look at the data, it's something like a bunch of people that were 24.5 and BMI became like 25.5, so moved into the category.

803
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:17,230
So yeah, this far changes a lot, but in reality it's like kind of enough.

804
01:23:17,230 --> 01:23:20,020
It's like small population shifts. That's exactly right.

805
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:29,440
And there are some years and during the Weight Science Lecture, we can go through these numbers if it sort of feels useful.

806
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:33,970
There are some years where that sort of tail in the extreme of extreme, I mean,

807
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:44,230
the folks in the fattest bodies where that's increased more than other sections did relative to like was it just this says

808
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:50,950
there are some amount of the fattest folks got more fat than you would expect if that's like a nasty way to describe that.

809
01:23:51,190 --> 01:23:58,900
But in general, it's just been kind of a slow shift where more people are sort of going over the sort of threshold of 30.0 and 25.0.

810
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:09,510
Are there other countries that are trying to do work in like we bias like prevention or like getting

811
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:16,140
it on the discrimination level or stuff like that to see like in the US or the American region.

812
01:24:16,230 --> 01:24:19,610
Yeah. Who's doing this work the best. So we're going to that will be what we talk about.

813
01:24:19,630 --> 01:24:28,290
The last week of this class I was gets like intervention and policy last I would say no one has made a super good job of that.

814
01:24:28,290 --> 01:24:38,070
The one exception is Iceland. They have quite a lot happening in the context of their civil rights law, the equivalent of it.

815
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:43,739
They are they have a lot of initiatives relative to weight bias. That's probably only I mean,

816
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:52,380
that's sort of the place I would sort of look to as sort of the kind of the most forward thinking in terms of weight bias, the focus of that.

817
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:57,649
Or to pause on conversations with caught with terminology.

818
01:24:57,650 --> 01:25:04,010
And we'll circle back to it next week as we think about how we talk in this

819
01:25:04,010 --> 01:25:09,680
class and what you include in your brightness and reflections and presentation.

820
01:25:12,130 --> 01:25:15,570
All right. I lied. I took much longer than I thought. I have a tendency of doing that.

821
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:21,910
Okay. Readings. If you didn't do the reading and terminology from this week, please go ahead and do that.

822
01:25:22,810 --> 01:25:26,090
The other read you have for next week is a reading by Sean Fallon.

823
01:25:26,110 --> 01:25:33,640
It's a really, really nice review paper talking about weight bias in the context of health care settings.

824
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:39,070
I feel like there was another meeting I missed remembering how I did.

825
01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:42,879
I added something third guys there.

826
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,610
It's a reading related to public health.

827
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:56,950
It's it's kind of like a infographic looking document, a really succinct and a summary of literature on public health, weight, inclusivity.

828
01:25:57,220 --> 01:26:03,790
There are some points in here that are pretty straight forward, some that are pretty controversial,

829
01:26:03,790 --> 01:26:11,919
but it's sort of a useful read related to why we should be thinking about weight bias with the public health.

830
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:14,670
So hopefully there should be a fast thing to read through.

831
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:21,730
There's actually two readings, one on weight by the medical studies, one on weight bias within public health.

832
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:26,140
Reminder to record that video and upload it as a discussion.

833
01:26:26,830 --> 01:26:29,950
And then if you feel like you know your schedule,

834
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:34,960
you know that you're gonna stay in this class and you feel like I can probably pick where I might want to present.

835
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:46,030
Submit your preferred group presentation date there in the Google one questions.

836
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:56,160
All right. One final thing that I want to note. I mentioned that this has been automatically recorded.

837
01:26:56,170 --> 01:27:02,770
Just know that if you're coming in and chatting and as a living and chatting, this is recording from 1 to 3.

838
01:27:02,770 --> 01:27:06,850
So just be mindful of the fact that side conversations can sometimes get picked up by this.

839
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:10,899
Usually with Zoom, I like new things,

840
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:20,640
but that is not something that I think I can do with our language in regards to such gossip at your own risk, like questions and stuff that.

841
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:24,060
All right. Sorry for keeping you so long. I will see you all, hopefully next week.

842
01:27:24,090 --> 01:27:27,980
If you'll leave your name tags there, I will collect them and preserve them.

843
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:35,110
That looks like I'm scared.

844
01:27:36,990 --> 01:27:49,990
Scary. It's like. Like, you know what's on my house left out there for you few here.

845
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:55,270
So we really want to give them something we know.

846
01:27:55,570 --> 01:28:11,200
But I want to just look at what we're trying to figure out, which is some critical way.

847
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:15,070
I guess you and I had a hearing.

848
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:26,370
I haven't even notice your Instagram page. Yeah, yeah. I get the feeling like both interpretations.

849
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:35,589
So, I mean, I think it's tricky for technologist to describe yourself like that, but you can also offer a lie.

850
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:39,129
You know, I don't think of it as bad as inherently bad. Just like Georgetown.

851
01:28:39,130 --> 01:28:51,120
Like school gives me a real geography. You can use those analogies to say that like in this world, this seems like it's going to be different.

852
01:28:54,490 --> 01:28:58,880
How I think about it, large parts of it. Yeah, yeah.

853
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:11,950
But today we don't have the correct side to stop talking.

854
01:29:11,950 --> 01:29:20,080
Like, that's the only reason I knew it's not to be right up here.

855
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:24,160
Yeah, that's out there. I just.

856
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:32,950
I don't know. I just. I guess. Yeah. For them to not make it even on Twitter.

857
01:29:34,810 --> 01:29:48,190
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

858
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:55,120
Definitely kind of goes against time personally, I guess.

859
01:29:56,620 --> 01:30:08,110
Where you at? Yeah, of course. Yeah. And the way you I out how to the kind of.

860
01:30:09,490 --> 01:30:13,090
Walk through, like the path of life.

861
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:19,110
Yes. It's you know, it's like that feeling of when you hear something that you don't agree with.

862
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:24,180
You get that. PANG Yeah. And then like how to kind of deal with that.

863
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:28,350
Yeah. So the pang is reactance of like to argue to push against that.

864
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:36,780
Yeah. And I guess the invitation is to take reactance and throw it into cognitive dissonance.

865
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:40,950
Like I'm hearing this, I believe this and to remain curious about it.

866
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:47,279
And I mean, I will disclose like I did my own dissertation on obesity.

867
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:52,220
I worked in the weight management clinic. I have been in a very similar place as you.

868
01:30:52,230 --> 01:30:57,629
And it's not to say that I've view and looked at me and so evolved now, like it's not that I have lived in the right spot.

869
01:30:57,630 --> 01:31:03,390
You're in the wrong spot. That is not the assumption is is to realize that you can have really firm beliefs

870
01:31:04,410 --> 01:31:11,069
and to be open to things that contradict it and then take it all and reevaluate.

871
01:31:11,070 --> 01:31:14,639
And where you come out at the end of this class may be no different.

872
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:18,420
It may be radically different. And all of those are acceptable in the context of this class.

873
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:23,990
Like when I say I am trying to teach people to think, not think like me, I mean that for my soul, right?

874
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:33,750
If you feel like I'm moved by the content in this context, you can still do well in this class.

875
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:44,040
You are still welcome in this course and you are welcome to present opposing views and encourages way.

876
01:31:44,310 --> 01:31:47,880
Got it. Okay, I'll just keep that in mind. Okay. Yes.

877
01:31:48,330 --> 01:31:58,620
Also, we just had a I was just wondering what you thought about like, um, differences in, like, basic rights in other country.

878
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:02,069
Yes. As relative to, like because the world is not the US.

879
01:32:02,070 --> 01:32:04,090
Oh yeah, yeah. We're much better than other places. Yeah. Yeah.

880
01:32:04,150 --> 01:32:09,570
Well, I think the U.S., I don't think is terribly different from other developed Western insurance, I don't think.

881
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:15,490
But like I just came back from a so I went back to Korea for the first time in a long time.

882
01:32:15,490 --> 01:32:19,350
Yeah. Like there over the summer. Yeah. And then I went back recently.

883
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:22,620
Yes. Still very jetlagged, especially like a 14 hour flight.

884
01:32:22,820 --> 01:32:31,620
Yeah. It's, it's a long time. Yeah. And I just generally notice that it definitely I don't have the stats but as like a general.

885
01:32:31,620 --> 01:32:34,799
Yeah. Visual check it very different other than the fact. Yes.

886
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:40,220
There's a lot more Asians. I guess that's true. You can't you can't argue that I've heard that for him.

887
01:32:40,290 --> 01:32:42,029
Right. And so on average we're bigger.

888
01:32:42,030 --> 01:32:48,270
So this sort of movement and we also have many more super fast rate like that sort of high, really high weight demographic.

889
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:52,410
That is something even though all the world has some amount of shift,

890
01:32:52,410 --> 01:33:02,280
that is something that is uniquely developed but but also something that we observed in the US probably first relative to many other places,

891
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:05,820
perhaps Mexico and some other spots also. But that is true.

892
01:33:05,850 --> 01:33:13,049
Yeah. To say that we are not fatter on average in other places is like not epidemiologically correct.

893
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:16,170
So that is absolutely true. And then the question is like, what do we do with that?

894
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:23,729
Right? Like what assumptions we make related to health and what actions do we take related to accommodations?

895
01:33:23,730 --> 01:33:27,890
Right. Like like it or not, our population is fatter and yet we are not making space more accommodating.

896
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:33,900
So it's like thinking about given that our distribution has shifted in this way, what conclusions do we draw?

897
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:38,430
What actions do we take? Yeah, but that's completely true. Okay then.

898
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:41,640
Thank you. Yes, sir. There.

899
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:47,360
I wanted to introduce myself. Yes, I'm sorry, but it's started at 130 and that worries me.

900
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:51,870
Yeah, so that's okay. But I'm Melissa.

901
01:33:51,870 --> 01:33:55,490
Alison. Nice to meet you. Melissa okay, we have another listen. That's good. Melissa Yeah.

902
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:59,909
Yeah. So I just want to introduce myself and it's first day.

903
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:03,840
Yeah, no, just the first class on the fourth is really tricky.

904
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:10,979
I know that. And I don't know if you were here when I mentioned that the class is recorded in webcast through Panopto.

905
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:14,070
And so whatever you miss, you can watch. I'm kind of okay.

906
01:34:15,030 --> 01:35:49,650
Yeah, I know what to look for also. And.

907
01:36:01,110 --> 01:36:01,800
That's.
