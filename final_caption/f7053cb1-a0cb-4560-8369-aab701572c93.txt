00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,110
Hello. Welcome to today's lecture

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,940
on numerical summaries of data.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,100
Today, we're going to talk
about how to summarize

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,550
the location or the
evidence in your data.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,690
Now, imagine that you
have a large dataset

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,635
on family medical
expenditures in your state,

7
00:00:23,635 --> 00:00:26,030
and you are asked to
pick only one number as

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,275
a good representation of

9
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:29,180
all of the numbers
in your dataset.

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,430
What would that one number be?

11
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,575
Often, it's the middle value,

12
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,800
or the central trend.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,650
So in this module,

14
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,445
we'll discuss two statistics,

15
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:41,810
which are the mean
and the median,

16
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,150
that are often used in
reports and articles to

17
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:48,880
summarize all of the data
that were actually collected.

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,610
So today's learning
objectives include,

19
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,240
first understanding
what the sample mean

20
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,410
and the sample median are,

21
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,420
and discussing how to compute

22
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,590
the sample mean and the sample
median from a set of data.

23
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,764
We'll then introduce the
concept of skewness,

24
00:01:02,764 --> 00:01:04,640
and then discuss how
the sample mean and

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,114
the sample median are
related to skewness,

26
00:01:07,114 --> 00:01:09,680
and then comprehend the
limitations of using

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,510
sample means and medians when
we have categorical data.

28
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,610
Now, the sample mean is simply

29
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,840
the sum of all of

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,435
the values for a variable
in your data set,

31
00:01:20,435 --> 00:01:23,375
divided by the number
of observations

32
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,830
or number of people in the data

33
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,720
set who contributed values.

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,910
So if we have a number of

35
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,135
observations represented
by the letter n,

36
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:34,220
we then label our data points

37
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,365
as X_1 for the first person,

38
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:37,835
X_2 for the second,

39
00:01:37,835 --> 00:01:41,215
and so forth up to X_n
for the last person.

40
00:01:41,215 --> 00:01:44,300
So again, mathematically,
we take all of

41
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,000
the n values from
the n individuals,

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,085
and we divide the sum by

43
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:51,710
the number of
individuals n. Often,

44
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,150
we use shorthand notation for

45
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,765
the sum through the
Greek letter Sigma.

46
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:57,795
Again, Sigma means sum.

47
00:01:57,795 --> 00:02:01,820
The i equals 1 to n indicates
that we take each X,

48
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,995
from the first one
to the last one,

49
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:07,640
we add them up, and then
we divide by the value n,

50
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,500
which is the number
of individuals.

51
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,025
So all of these formulas are
all doing the same thing.

52
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:16,070
We typically represent
the sample mean

53
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,395
by X with a bar over it.

54
00:02:18,395 --> 00:02:20,615
So often, we'll talk about X bar,

55
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:23,230
implicitly meaning
the sample mean.

56
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,520
Now, for example, suppose I ask

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,280
seven people to count how many
texts they sent yesterday,

58
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,520
and they gave me the
following responses.

59
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,830
The first person on the
left said he said 34 texts,

60
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,510
up to the last
person on the right

61
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,500
said she sent 27 texts.

62
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,330
What is the sample mean of
these seven observations?

63
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,090
I simply add up the responses
and divide by seven,

64
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,855
giving me a mean of 28 texts.

65
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:54,185
Now, if I made the request
of seven more people,

66
00:02:54,185 --> 00:02:56,330
and suppose I got responses

67
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,665
that were different from
these seven individuals.

68
00:02:58,665 --> 00:03:01,665
Their data, the first person
on the left said 50 texts,

69
00:03:01,665 --> 00:03:05,005
and the person on the
right said 17 texts.

70
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:06,860
I could compute the mean of

71
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,960
this new sample of
seven individuals,

72
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,705
by adding up their responses
and dividing by seven.

73
00:03:11,705 --> 00:03:15,185
Now, I have a mean
of 28 texts as well.

74
00:03:15,185 --> 00:03:18,710
So we can see that two distinctly
different sets of data

75
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,720
can both produce a sample mean

76
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,760
that is equal to each other.

77
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,720
However, I then pose
the question to you,

78
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,270
does the mean better summarize
one of these sets of data?

79
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:33,055
If so, why do you believe
that is the case?

80
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:35,930
The answer is that
the sample mean is

81
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,370
a better representation for

82
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,390
the first dataset than it
is for the second dataset.

83
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,130
Because in the first dataset,

84
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,995
we see observations that
are fairly close to 28.

85
00:03:45,995 --> 00:03:48,500
28 is a good representation for

86
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,245
a typical person in this dataset.

87
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:53,960
In contrast, dataset 2 has

88
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,929
individuals where one person
only sent three texts,

89
00:03:56,929 --> 00:04:00,395
and another individual
sent exactly 62 texts.

90
00:04:00,395 --> 00:04:03,680
The range in these individuals
is much more vast,

91
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,660
and therefore may 28 not be

92
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,370
a good representation for

93
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,155
a typical person in this dataset.

94
00:04:10,155 --> 00:04:13,220
Therefore, we have
another numerical summary

95
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,650
that may be a better
representation of the middle,

96
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,435
known as the sample median.

97
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:20,030
Now, I represent some
data here by squares.

98
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,130
The number of squares
is the actual value.

99
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,425
So on the left, we
see a value of one,

100
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:26,285
followed by two, and then two,

101
00:04:26,285 --> 00:04:28,280
and then three, and so forth.

102
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,379
We've ordered these values
from smallest to largest,

103
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:35,450
and the sample median
is the value that sits

104
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,600
exactly in the middle
of the ordered values.

105
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,510
The median is also known
as the 50th percentile,

106
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,070
because 50 percent of

107
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,190
the data values are
below that number,

108
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,245
and 50 percent of the data
values are above that number.

109
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:49,610
So in this set of data,

110
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,130
the sample median is five.

111
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,080
Now, returning to the two sets of

112
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,840
data I collected earlier,

113
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,860
I again, take the values
in the first dataset,

114
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,435
order them from smallest,

115
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:02,640
19 up to largest, 40,

116
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,015
and the value exactly
in the middle

117
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:07,700
is the fourth value, which is 27.

118
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,795
So the left dataset
has a median of 27.

119
00:05:10,795 --> 00:05:13,035
In contrast, if I
order the values

120
00:05:13,035 --> 00:05:15,700
in the second data set
from smallest to largest,

121
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,530
the fourth largest
value is now 17,

122
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,965
so that the second data
set has a median of 17.

123
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:23,840
So although two datasets can

124
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,720
produce the same sample mean,

125
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,435
they each have very
different sample medians.

126
00:05:29,435 --> 00:05:31,370
This difference relates to

127
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,175
a concept known as
skewness in a set of data.

128
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:36,620
I have two panels
here on the left,

129
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,090
I have a representation of what I

130
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,950
call left or negative skew.

131
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,945
The red curve represents

132
00:05:41,945 --> 00:05:43,280
how many observations take

133
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,025
values from lowest on the left,

134
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:48,970
on the x-axis to
highest on the right.

135
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,625
Again, on the left panel,

136
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,240
you see that a preponderance
of values tend to

137
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,360
be at larger values to
the right of the x-axis.

138
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,995
In this case, the median is
to the right of the mean.

139
00:05:59,995 --> 00:06:01,700
Because the mean is computed

140
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,889
directly from the
values in the dataset,

141
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:05,270
the mean is impacted by

142
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,645
the very small values towards
the left of this dataset.

143
00:06:08,645 --> 00:06:11,720
Therefore, the mean is pulled
toward these small numbers,

144
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,780
away from the median.

145
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,910
In contrast, on the right,

146
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,330
I have an example of data that

147
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,255
have right or positive skew.

148
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:21,260
Again, the red curve represents

149
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,880
how many observations occur at

150
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,920
each value along the x-axis.

151
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,990
We see here that
these data contain

152
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,105
a preponderance of small values.

153
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:31,940
Only a small percentage
of individuals have

154
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,940
very large values on the
right, on the x-axis.

155
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,670
In this case, those
very large values

156
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,680
when added to all the other data,

157
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,275
pull the mean to the
right of the median.

158
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:44,660
So again, left skew
is represented

159
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,015
by a mean that is to
the left of the median,

160
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:48,860
and right skew is represented by

161
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,985
a mean that is to the right
of the sample median.

162
00:06:51,985 --> 00:06:54,620
Now, here's an example of a
histogram that appeared in

163
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,440
a publication in the American
Journal of Public Health,

164
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,020
demonstrating the blood lead
levels that were measured

165
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,265
in Detroit children who
were under the age of six.

166
00:07:03,265 --> 00:07:05,395
Now, from the actual data,

167
00:07:05,395 --> 00:07:07,490
it was reported that the mean of

168
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,015
the blood lead level
values was 7.12.

169
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:14,645
So using the histogram
on the left, I ask you,

170
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:16,670
what is a reasonable value for

171
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,415
the median blood lead
level in these data?

172
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:22,500
Now, unless we have the exact
values from the dataset,

173
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,670
we cannot answer precisely
what the median is.

174
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,710
However, we can at least say,

175
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,414
because we have left to
skewness in this histogram,

176
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:35,975
that the mean must be to
the right of the median,

177
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:42,495
so that the median must
be less than 7.12.

178
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,500
Again, we can try and
approximate the median,

179
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,110
by taking the histogram
starting from the left,

180
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,390
and adding up the heights
of the bars until

181
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,880
we get a sum that is 50 percent.

182
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,740
Because again, the
median represents

183
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,415
the value where 50 percent
of the values are below,

184
00:07:57,415 --> 00:07:58,785
and 50 are above.

185
00:07:58,785 --> 00:08:02,990
That number would certainly
be less than 7.12.

186
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,760
Now, when the data have

187
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,040
an even number of
total observations,

188
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,900
the median must be computed as

189
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,585
the average of the two
numbers in the middle.

190
00:08:11,585 --> 00:08:13,670
If you recall, in my
previous examples,

191
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,030
we had seven individuals,

192
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,690
so that the median was
the fourth largest value.

193
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,550
If I took out one person,

194
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,940
and only had six
values to choose from,

195
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,955
and I order them from
smallest to largest,

196
00:08:23,955 --> 00:08:25,550
we see that there is no value

197
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,595
that is exactly in the middle.

198
00:08:27,595 --> 00:08:29,210
So therefore, we take the third

199
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,650
and the fourth observations here,

200
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,105
and we take the average.

201
00:08:32,105 --> 00:08:35,450
The average of 26 and 27 is 26.5,

202
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,230
and that is the median
for this set of data.

203
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,840
Now, means and medians are best

204
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,075
used with continuous data,

205
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:45,980
but we can also use means and

206
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,155
medians with categorical data.

207
00:08:48,155 --> 00:08:50,800
I have an example here
of a 100 smokers,

208
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,640
and for each smoker, we measured

209
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,935
the periodontal health
of that individual.

210
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,580
It was either in the
category of being healthy,

211
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,790
gingivitis, which
is mild bleeding,

212
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,895
mild periodontitis, which
is more severe bleeding,

213
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:05,110
or mod or just
severe periodontitis

214
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,595
which actually requires
medical intervention.

215
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:09,710
In the total of 100 subjects,

216
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,225
we had 10 who were healthy,

217
00:09:11,225 --> 00:09:14,170
23 with gingivitis, and so forth.

218
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,690
Now, because these categories
have a natural ordering,

219
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,940
we can put numerical
values on each category,

220
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,195
and we've chosen to
indicate healthy as 1,

221
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:25,150
gingivitis as 2, mild
periodontitis as 3,

222
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,065
and mod or severe
periodontitis as 4.

223
00:09:28,065 --> 00:09:30,500
We can then compute a mean and

224
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,425
a median using these
values of 1, 2, 3, and 4.

225
00:09:33,425 --> 00:09:36,350
The mean is simply
adding up 1 10 times,

226
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,390
2, 23 times, 3,

227
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,575
30 times, and 4, 37 times,

228
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:43,760
and dividing that sum by 100,

229
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,695
giving me a mean of 2.9.

230
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:48,350
I can also order these
values of 1, 2, 3,

231
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,210
and 4 across the 100 people,

232
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,380
and we define that
the median is 2.5.

233
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,025
Now, although we've
computed these numbers,

234
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:58,640
they really lack
biologic interpretation

235
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,490
because there is no real value of

236
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,949
2.9 used to describe

237
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:07,370
the mean periodontal health
of these individuals.

238
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,340
So although the mean and
the median are often

239
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,400
reported in publications
with categorical data,

240
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,040
you should look at these
values with skepticism,

241
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,345
because they require values
to be given to each category,

242
00:10:20,345 --> 00:10:22,955
and those values are arbitrary.

243
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,420
We used 1, 2, 3,

244
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,105
and 4, but we could
have used 10, 20,

245
00:10:27,105 --> 00:10:28,695
30, and 40 for example,

246
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:29,925
for the four categories,

247
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:32,250
and gotten a different
mean and median.

248
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,010
So now that we've covered how to

249
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,140
summarize the center of our data,

250
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,930
we'd like to be able to
describe how spread out each of

251
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,545
the individual data points
are from this middle value.

252
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:45,650
Because if our data are spread
out far from the middle,

253
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,810
this will lead us to be
more skeptical about

254
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,217
the decisions that we
might make from our data.
