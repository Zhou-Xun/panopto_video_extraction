1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,880
Okay. Hi, everybody. Think this is everybody who's showing up today?

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,320
I got a couple of emails this morning. I'm sick, etc., etc.

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:18,239
It's that time of year. Just again, a few admin announcements.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,950
Again, your introduction plus more robust outline for your commentary is due this Sunday.

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,440
I also peeked into your final quiz, which isn't due until the 11th.

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,219
Hypothetically, you could take it after today.

7
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,959
If you want it, you'd be able to answer all of the questions for your final quiz.

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,490
So like if you want to like knock out the quiz, knock out the outline.

9
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:50,160
Basically, the only thing you have left in the semester is the commentary.

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,690
And I think I made that do finals week. Yes, I did.

11
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,590
Okay. Huh? Yes, that's cause.

12
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:07,680
But yes, yes. But whatever the last day of of finals week, which I believe is the.

13
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:18,630
15. I cannot accept anything later than the 18th because the registrar cuts us off from grading.

14
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,380
So if you're like super late in turning in your commentary, then you have to take an incomplete.

15
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,130
So just keep that in mind to try to please finish that.

16
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,240
Any questions for me regarding the commentary?

17
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:49,750
Okay. All right. So we're going to finish the last few slides of where we left off on Tuesday, where we were talking.

18
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,260
I run out of. It's out of battery.

19
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,050
Okay. But you know what?

20
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:06,750
I'm actually a little bit excited about that because do you all get the sense of accomplishment when you, like, finish a pen and it's like out of ink?

21
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,620
Okay. So, like, that's the say I have like this giant battery collection in my office.

22
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,940
So I'm like, yes, this battery's dead.

23
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,720
All right. I'll just I'll just click through this. Okay.

24
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,920
Let me put it this time. Battery. Okay.

25
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,040
So last week, on Tuesday, we were talking about, like, you know,

26
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,310
the implications of when the Trump administration tried to pull out of the World Health Organization.

27
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:43,980
And so there is still, again, some efforts for international cooperation in terms of tackling infectious diseases.

28
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:50,880
So this figure here actually came from a study that was published in 2020.

29
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:57,630
So in regards to what they say is needed for international cooperation, for tackling infectious diseases,

30
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:06,690
massive and widespread testing for both when someone has infection and immunity when available in terms of adequate supply of testing kits,

31
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,100
personal protective equipment and access to emerging resources.

32
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,959
You'll remember, I don't know if you were able to order it if you live in a temporary address,

33
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:21,210
but for a time we were able to order rapid test kits to be sent to your house.

34
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:29,430
I still have about six at my house, but the government sees that free program back in September actually,

35
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,630
and then pooling resources instead of bidding wars.

36
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,250
So bidding wars was something that we definitely saw early in the pandemic.

37
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:45,150
Of course, hospital systems needed things like respiratory protection and 95.

38
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,470
But like the same thing where you see people even hoarding toilet paper.

39
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,829
That was why. Right. And then now, like, people had access toilet paper.

40
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,590
So they were like trying. They died. Some people donate to shelters.

41
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:12,629
Some people are still hoarding it. My mom is a major hoarder just because of like war trauma and like coming to America with just like one suitcase.

42
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:21,720
So for a very long time in my and in my house in California, I had my sister's much older than me.

43
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:28,320
So I only grew up in that house and that bedroom essentially stayed as a shrine to myself for like ten years,

44
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:35,350
where it's everything in there remains untouched. And except for like one time a year, I come visit home.

45
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:40,320
Right? But I've slowly been donating things. And then my sister came home and she stays in that bedroom when I'm not there.

46
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:47,010
And she was like, I know where all the paper products from the shortages went.

47
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:53,670
And she took a picture of my childhood bedroom in California and like floor to ceiling,

48
00:04:53,970 --> 00:05:01,530
just boxes of tissues and, like, rolls and rolls and rolls of toilet paper.

49
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,220
So. My mom was one of those people.

50
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:12,930
But, you know, even with ventilators in particular, people were starting to like have bidding wars on ventilators.

51
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:21,639
I don't know if you remember, the Trump administration was giving this guy a contract of like several million dollars to create respirators.

52
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:33,700
And he lived in the state of New York. And I found out that he doesn't even know how to make respirators, let alone have like like a beta model of it.

53
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,130
And they didn't even vet this is wild.

54
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:44,500
And then disease surveillance and control like we talked about infirmary, information sharing and adopting new technologies like tracing apps.

55
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,610
Now, on Tuesday,

56
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:53,110
we talked about kind of what the implications of that might be in a place in the United States where it's less acceptable to be tracking people,

57
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,170
although like tracking people happens all the time.

58
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,299
So I just saw a meme actually,

59
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:09,610
right before I came to you down here from my office that like Spotify has managed to make tracking your data seem really like fun and cool.

60
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,319
I just opened my Spotify wrapped and for like the third year in a row,

61
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:22,780
it's super boring because like 8 hours a day I listen to this playlist that's like video game,

62
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:32,530
lo fi chill and so like my Spotify raptor's just like a bunch of artists who I like, don't even know the name of.

63
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:38,050
And then, like, the only person on like my top five that is like recognizable is Megan Thee Stallion.

64
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:44,830
But like, Spotify is tracking your stuff like all the time, like on your apps, like location services.

65
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:53,049
If you notice now if you have an iPhone, if you like, update your iOS or whatever and you open a new app, they'll be like, Can we track you?

66
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,700
And you can say like only when using the app never or always.

67
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,040
So this one in particular, this study comes from a manuscript.

68
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:09,400
Quantifying SARS-CoV-2 transmission suggests epidemic control with digital contact tracing.

69
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,810
And this here was using Bluetooth.

70
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,930
Okay, so just say so.

71
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:25,719
Everybody here is connected to a Bluetooth. And so they were able to surveil people through their phones where Subject A reported

72
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:33,280
that they had a COVID 19 infection with no symptoms and they live with subject B,

73
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,560
but knowing where Subject A has been,

74
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:44,170
they've also been on the train with C and D and they been on A were at work with all these other people and then they came back home.

75
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,960
So that's the first day, right?

76
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:54,400
We've come, we've been able to like effectively contact trace all the people that they were with in a ten foot radius of just based on Bluetooth.

77
00:07:54,730 --> 00:08:02,620
By the second day, this person wakes up with a fever, reports symptoms, request a home test and tests positive.

78
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:14,140
So as a result B, C, D, E, F and g get an instant text, an automated test request to self isolate for 14 days and then H and I,

79
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,950
which were less so within their aerosol spray proximity.

80
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:27,600
We're advised to social distance. So I feel like that's what, you know, the iPhone COVID alerts and like the Michigan MDH,

81
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:38,110
DHS we're trying to achieve but it was never like to this level or robust because obviously like not everybody was enrolled in the program.

82
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:46,720
What do you all think? How many of you, B, would be willing to like give up your data and information for something like this?

83
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:56,080
Only page in the air. Everybody else. What are your reservations that they can check?

84
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,410
Yeah. What are your.

85
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:07,780
What are your reservations? I guess for me, I just don't know where it stops.

86
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,200
You know, it's very Black Mirror kind of thing.

87
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,760
It feels black. Yeah.

88
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:22,750
And we don't yet really have any more ethical discussions about it, because does it get to a point where you move what you can do?

89
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,880
Yeah. Anybody restricting your mobility feels like.

90
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,479
I don't know. It's. But I is that's the same language that people used when they were like, I can't go into Walgreens without a mask, you know?

91
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:44,120
And so. Hmm. I mean, I feel a and maybe some other people can feel and reflect when I'm talking and then maybe share.

92
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,919
I feel the same way as you page like I'm not doing anything exciting.

93
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:54,440
Like, you know, for the most part, people can see me like sitting at my house or like sitting at work and then like,

94
00:09:54,830 --> 00:10:00,590
I stop, like, candy crush, but like, you know, and then like scrolling through TikTok and like Instagram and whatever.

95
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:05,720
But it's like, I'm not particularly doing anything very exciting.

96
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:13,970
My I allow my sister and my best friend to track me in case in the event that I'm taken or kidnaped somewhere.

97
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:19,459
But I think that in the United States, there's a lot of reservations, obviously,

98
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:26,420
because like our data is collected more so for like capitalism through like Amazon and, you know,

99
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,249
Facebook and whatever or like for the whole election thing with the Facebook

100
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:35,629
and Zuckerberg rather than like in a country maybe like Singapore for example,

101
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:42,140
where they purely users for like public safety. Um, other thoughts from people about maybe why they.

102
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:48,170
Yes, Lexi, I guess I just have questions like about how accurately the distance and stuff because

103
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,499
I know like sometimes towers might not like touch certain signals or something,

104
00:10:52,500 --> 00:11:02,450
but yeah, yeah, that's true. You have to have at least enough like LTE, 4G, 5G, even like mobility to do this.

105
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:09,620
So like definitely in rural places where they don't even have wireless access, I'm not entirely sure that it's possible,

106
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:17,389
but like for those that do have tracking services, it gets very specific in terms of longitude and latitude.

107
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:21,350
So my best friend and I, she lives in Oklahoma and I live here.

108
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:25,430
But in over the weekend we were at the same wedding in Omaha.

109
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:34,100
And when she opened like location tracking services because we couldn't find the bride and she was like looking she was in her hotel room.

110
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:40,339
But but like the location tracking services, it shows me like literally,

111
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:45,560
like right next to her when usually like you look at the U.S. map and what like, right.

112
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,460
So, yes. KING You mentioned that they're using Bluetooth.

113
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:56,980
Yes. Um, I think with Bluetooth, it's very proximity based within like ten feet or so.

114
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:02,200
Yeah. It's also like I pretty sure you don't need wi fi for it.

115
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,630
Okay? You just use them anywhere.

116
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,960
I can't use them on a plane. You have to what?

117
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,130
You have to connect to the planes wi fi first like Delta or American.

118
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:22,630
But yes, with Bluetooth, like if you have like headphones and I walk away from like my phone, it disconnects itself.

119
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:29,520
But I think that's like what they're using to, like, guesstimate, like how close?

120
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,280
Yeah. Okay. Okay. That makes sense to me.

121
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,570
Ha ha ha. So I forget what country this was conducted in.

122
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:48,489
I want to say China, but. Anyway. And then international cooperation for tackling infectious diseases.

123
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:53,500
So continuing to advance biomedical technology and research for treatment and vaccines.

124
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,010
There's still a ton of disparities in this.

125
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:02,379
We saw this in terms of COVID 19 vaccine distribution, where after, you know,

126
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:08,200
people were getting their initial first dose here in the United States and even their second dose people just weren't getting them.

127
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:13,659
So they were literally like throwing vials away because Pfizer in particular had to be cast

128
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,980
for a certain temperature and was only viable for a certain amount of time before it expired.

129
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:27,819
So I know they donated a bunch to like Canada and, you know, Mexico, but like we had countries in Africa and Asia,

130
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:34,630
for example, where people really wanted Pfizer or Moderna rather than Novavax or the other vaccine.

131
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:45,610
And the pharmaceutical companies were charging like charging them like surge prices, essentially, which is unethical.

132
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:53,350
But capitalism, again, like, you know, if you're trying to get like a Uber Lyft at a really like busy time, like they'll charge surcharge you, right?

133
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,020
So rather than like giving these vaccines to these countries where we know we have

134
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:04,030
the mutual aid resources to like just send this on a plane refrigerated overseas,

135
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:12,850
they just kept throwing them away. And then, you know, again, investment in prevention is super key.

136
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:18,000
So we'll do a short breakout discussion.

137
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:27,579
So again, while many issues that we've talked about, not just in this week's lecture, but in the class in general are large and deeply rooted.

138
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:32,530
I know they may seem unsurmountable, insurmountable, but change can happen.

139
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:37,210
So my question that I want you to discuss in your like small groups is,

140
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:44,500
number one, what can we do as public health practitioners to regain public trust?

141
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:56,590
And number two, what strategies is the U.S. currently not using in infectious disease response that you feel like we could be using?

142
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:02,050
Okay. So I'll let you break out in your groups, chat about these two questions.

143
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:08,410
Designate a person to report back. And then when I hear conversations dying down, we'll regroup.

144
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:17,180
All right. Yeah. Okay.

145
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:40,900
And I think it's because I think we're just starting to trust the communities that really didn't do.

146
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:48,240
Wasn't really rebuilt. And I don't know what to make of the fact it was just just wasn't.

147
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:56,050
Yeah. I mean, I you know what I mean?

148
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:05,750
If it had for three, nine months and had the three cities around me, but they had like the fence and everything, but it would do what I think.

149
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,390
I think there is a. Like a quarter of the money that for a long run.

150
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,129
Yeah. Yeah, right. Yeah. So I already got it.

151
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:21,650
Nice it. But I think, you know, I definitely agree with that.

152
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:36,200
Yeah, I think too, like the one thing I really would like to review that I think is to be like, yeah, maybe this isn't yet $3 million at least.

153
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,720
And so I don't know if there is that one thing that's.

154
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:48,649
Yeah, yeah, exactly. People are communicating naturally, but they don't want to understand.

155
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:57,410
They're trying to get. You know, they could have tried to explain that, especially like there was like a limited understanding of what that was like,

156
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:04,610
about like, you know, the ability of Hollywood to go in and say, I mean, you know, lost those relationships with like, I keep your like.

157
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,659
I think some of that is because I like to say that there's more and more interesting around certain information control.

158
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:20,210
It's very convenient. And then the government is that really if you their own business and that.

159
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:34,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

160
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:45,700
Because they it's a very good thing joke I think.

161
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:56,660
Previously and generationally also.

162
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:09,740
And working in such things. In an interview on Islamic trends along with links to.

163
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,710
Don't worry about it. I don't think I did it.

164
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:28,190
Just like I would like it to be a little exhilarating.

165
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,400
As far as I know, the answer is going to make you.

166
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:40,190
I mean, and you know, I think, you know, it's like, why?

167
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:46,030
So this is the first time in 31 missions.

168
00:18:46,360 --> 00:19:02,870
I think it was it goes back to, oh, I can't use the word exposure and exposure to things go through N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A.,

169
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:23,549
N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A.

170
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,540
Yeah, I guess I can't say there is more.

171
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:39,470
I think I know, but I do. But then there is this.

172
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,520
Yeah. But only know the thing.

173
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,560
Yeah. I don't know. I just want people to believe on both sides.

174
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,370
And then I get these pictures like, you know, vision or something like that, she says.

175
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:02,930
Or at least I think it's like. Exactly.

176
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,890
Yeah. Well, it's really not really the truth and things like that.

177
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:18,110
I mean, I think you can sometimes there are of that involved with having a certain social.

178
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:24,050
I was going to say that I think I hear a lot of people that work for them.

179
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:34,820
They're also working for other reasons. For example, part of the jobs that I do like, oh, is that self-employed.

180
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:46,860
And now they have some of or you know, early on in my business before like like two years ago,

181
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:54,160
I'm like ultimately, honestly, I'm like, everybody should have access, especially at night.

182
00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:01,810
You're asking how they do it, you know, like it's great, like anti-Semitism.

183
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:12,010
I mean, this isn't always. Yeah, having some of the others are not exactly, you know, I think.

184
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:18,050
I just kind of like some of that because some things like not really.

185
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:22,070
Peters Like, like personal information, like the violence.

186
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,680
I don't I don't know much about it, but I know, like, I think they want to do something.

187
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:34,790
And I just think the messenger part of that is something like that.

188
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:47,729
Yeah. Like since birth control, if you haven't heard.

189
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:56,060
But I think there's been 1000 people that have signed on to.

190
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,510
These are really, really silly.

191
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:05,700
Like he'd be about one more minute. Like, misery is like, you know.

192
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:13,680
Yeah. Like that's a feeling, like having or even, like, you know, I don't know.

193
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:18,170
I think there's like you've got, like, he's different, like a village.

194
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:27,690
This is not a bad fact. Was that to say, you know, I didn't feel that for so long that there's so much more to that.

195
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:35,190
Yeah. Yeah. Like, you know, like I.

196
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,170
I think they should do that like this.

197
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:47,219
Why not proceed to the degree that you feel like the words you know, you want to receive?

198
00:22:47,220 --> 00:23:02,280
But I don't think I think it's appropriate to this is like kind of the public health kind of and and like he's going in.

199
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:14,890
Truthfully, because of school, I was trying to teach and I was able to go with the people where, you know,

200
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:27,190
I don't know, I can I don't want to be like this, but I feel like you don't even have that choice at all.

201
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:34,420
And they all want to stay in touch with them.

202
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:46,540
And so they just want to make sure that we can handle it, which is why I asked her, what is it that you wanted to do?

203
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,660
Oh, yeah, definitely.

204
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,200
Definitely. Oh, okay.

205
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:11,290
Let's bring let's dive into that.

206
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,970
Yeah, that's regroup. Yeah.

207
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:27,580
All right. Yeah, I'm just. I heard a lot of, uh, projects, projective conversations, going to jobs ads and made a reporter.

208
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,060
Do a real fast. Do real fast. Okay.

209
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:36,500
So let's start out with question number one.

210
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:46,310
Nose goes. So what can we do as public health practitioners to regain public trust?

211
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:51,740
How about we start this group here? Which I'll talk about.

212
00:24:52,070 --> 00:25:00,080
I heard a lot of talk in. If you feel sorry.

213
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:11,720
One of the main things that we discuss is that to make reliable information accessible to everyone,

214
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:21,200
we discussed something along the lines of how certain scientific journals or even,

215
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:34,460
uh, newspapers which people consider to report or report accurate information are not really accessible to everyone because you have to pay for them.

216
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:41,450
So I think that is one thing that they kind of touched upon.

217
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:54,230
That's one way that people definitely have to gain public trust, the information that is accessible.

218
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:04,160
So are you are you talking about something like The Washington Post, for example, or are you talking about something like, you know, The Lancet?

219
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:12,350
I feel a little bit of both. Like scientific research as well as I've.

220
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:22,749
As well as getting his papers. Sure. Sure. So what were how how do you tackle, like, people who only want their news from,

221
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:30,160
like, one source, like Fox News or like, I only read like New York Times.

222
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:35,549
What do you. But you had think maybe.

223
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:39,650
Think about that. I'll come back to you. Okay. How about this group in the middle?

224
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,120
What for? Number one? Okay.

225
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:48,680
So the first one was something similar to the film last week where we talked about the CDC and like rebuilding trust for that.

226
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:54,210
So just being upfront about your past mistakes and some of the things that you could have done better.

227
00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:04,140
Like at the beginning of the pandemic creates sample, but then also like actively communicated desire to build that trust again with the community.

228
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:09,060
And then I think another thing we talked a little bit about social media, um,

229
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:17,100
very easy to understand and communication and how that can also be very difficult to communicate.

230
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:25,740
But we talked about just having a bigger social media presence, especially among younger people as well as like older people like on Facebook.

231
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:35,309
And then maybe working with the social media companies to to dispel misinformation early on because at least at the beginning of the pandemic,

232
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:39,030
for example, there wasn't that regulation of misinformation.

233
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:48,120
But now you see, like those labels on tweets and posts that say, like, this information is like misleading for this reason.

234
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,170
Yes. Although that's going away now. Yeah, it it is.

235
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,800
Yes, but thanks, Ellen. But you know. Yeah, yeah.

236
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:02,969
It seems now like I feel like communication has to evolve with the social media platform, right.

237
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:06,690
Because like when I was in college, like Facebook was the main thing.

238
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,739
But now I feel like it's generally like older adults.

239
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,010
Like people I think like yeah, like you.

240
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:20,219
Just like how your odds like posting like random stuff on it or like people's political rantings or whatever.

241
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:27,720
Whereas now folks are maybe doing more like younger folks or maybe doing like Tik Tok, even like Instagram reels.

242
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,290
The joke is like those are like tiktoks from like months ago, right?

243
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:37,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. How about this group over here? Um, we also talked a lot about, like.

244
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:43,350
Integrating the social media stuff and. Celebrities.

245
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:50,810
Related information as well. We also talked about stakeholders and communities and building relationships that.

246
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:57,060
Maybe it'll be like more understandable or tangible, like a smaller level than just like this easy.

247
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,960
Like a huge things, like using those partnerships as well. Yeah, yeah.

248
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:07,889
Definitely more so like rather than I know it's quicker to do like blanket public health statements.

249
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:12,690
But for I was contracting with Nike and they were trying to reach construction workers

250
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:17,040
to try to get them the vaccine because he had some of the lowest vaccination rates.

251
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:24,110
And so what they got was they got like heads of like unions or like construction union leaders, too.

252
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:31,499
And they made a lot of videos with these people who like they respect in their industry to advocate for that.

253
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:39,239
And then also setting up like mobile clinic sites at construction sites just because people work like weird schedules.

254
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:46,500
So by the time they get off work like you traditional like Walgreens, Rite Aid, whatever is closed so they can't get their vaccine like that.

255
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:55,440
So yeah, yeah. Great. Back to this group about the like what if a person only gets their information from one source?

256
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:06,770
Can we do anything about that? Yes.

257
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:11,300
Kelly, what is the key? I feel like that's, like, so hard to do with, like, the older population.

258
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:18,260
Yeah. Yeah. My conservative grandma who watches Fox News and, like, I don't know if she'll ever change.

259
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:26,719
It's just hard. But we're getting there. Yeah, I know some people who are, like, have, like, gone on, like, blocked that channel for their,

260
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,330
like, older family members that they have like a cable package or something like that.

261
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:40,579
But I think that would be a challenge for sure because it or or they might read their local newspaper as another means.

262
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:48,100
But depending on where you live, the local newspaper may have a a bias or a lean to it as well.

263
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:52,490
And even the radio, depending on what what channels you listen to.

264
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,790
Yeah. Okay. So what about the second question?

265
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:02,210
What strategies is the U.S. currently not using for infectious disease response that you think we could be?

266
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:06,410
How about we start here? Did you all get to this question? Yes.

267
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:10,380
I'm trying to remember what we said. Okay. You want me to come back? Okay.

268
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:13,700
How about here? Yeah.

269
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:21,830
We touched on this question and mainly talked about just funding public health more and creating.

270
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:30,580
It kind of bleeds into our first response where creating more communication and communication in layman's terms to um,

271
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:38,510
but I don't know if that's something that we're not doing because we talked about how as the pandemic evolved, the images got better.

272
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:45,710
And right now when you look at like the droplet image, I mean, that's, that's been perfected, like that's a very digestible image and.

273
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:52,730
But we also talked about having funding education more where people,

274
00:31:52,940 --> 00:32:00,590
public health practitioners can come to a workplace, could come to schools and talk directly to people about it.

275
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:11,180
So I think you talked about an experience where maybe you have an NHS, but you went to the workers and they had a ton of questions about, Yeah,

276
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:19,940
I've heard this, I've heard that it's just a place where people can kind of digest all these other pieces of information that they've heard.

277
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:26,690
And yeah, if you could just somehow do that and maybe that's like a Zoom call with like a CDC representative,

278
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:30,680
you know, at your for each town or each neighborhood.

279
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:37,339
Yeah. Yeah. So that was when I spoke to United Auto Workers and what they did also,

280
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:44,569
they set up booths at workplaces where like a subject matter expert would sit there and

281
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:50,470
people could just like one on one can talk about their concerns about the coal business,

282
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:55,130
specifically the COVID vaccine, talk about their concerns specific to the COVID vaccine,

283
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:59,840
because that was like and it was like an internal person for the most part,

284
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:06,110
because people felt comfortable and safer to ask those questions privately, kind of, rather than like in a group.

285
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:12,530
So if you think about like, you know, a Catholic confessional where you like a booth and tell a priest, you know, your stuff.

286
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:17,840
So yeah, but that's not a white widespread model that's used.

287
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:25,270
Hello? Here. This group. Did you get to the second question there?

288
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,959
My son. There's a third question. Oh, on the slides.

289
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,470
Yeah, sorry, I deleted the second one. Okay.

290
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:44,849
Yes. Well, back to this group you were talking about, like the widespread use of apps like the previous example,

291
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:48,300
but we don't know how useful that would be in the US for.

292
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,070
I like enough people who want to do it for it to be effective.

293
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:59,230
We also kind of like trying to make things like politicized.

294
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:06,150
Like, I don't know if there's like anything that's like broadly where it's not like leaning left or right, but.

295
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:12,690
Yeah. Mm hmm. I don't know. I feel like a lot of things are politicized these days.

296
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,800
Some things are universally loved. Drugs.

297
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,350
It's like everybody kind of tunes into that, stuff like that.

298
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:25,290
Mm hmm. Definitely like more so messaging from public figures.

299
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:34,409
I feel like they use that less so now. Like back in the day, like for example, with the polio vaccine, like they used Elvis, for example, or like FDR.

300
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:45,100
We talked about that. Right. But, you know, now so celebrities inject their opinion on things and a phone number,

301
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:53,430
I don't know if you remember how Nicki Minaj had that post about her cousin's friend who got the COVID vaccine.

302
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,050
It's like an ad save for work tweet, but that like caused a whole thing.

303
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:04,590
And I think she's from Barbados. So the president of Barbados had to come out because he's like a huge pig.

304
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:11,520
Like the barbs are huge, right? So like that the president of Barbados had to come out and be like,

305
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:19,140
please do not take like public health information from like Nicki Minaj on top of it to like

306
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,969
we can like have celebrities that like are saying like maybe like accurate information,

307
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:28,799
but you can also have anyone else say whatever they want. It's like, yeah, a double edged sword.

308
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,190
I know. Even like sources who I love had like a tweet, like anti-vax tweet, and I was like, Oh, go, what are you doing?

309
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:39,419
I love your music. Don't do this to me. Right? Yeah.

310
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,649
Sorry. This group, I ended up deleting the second question because we kind of talked about that in previous weeks,

311
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:49,280
but did you still want to share what she discussed for it afterwards?

312
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:54,860
So this would be closer to the second question.

313
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:59,940
Sure. Sure. Um, we talked about how the US.

314
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:10,260
Is really failing in basic science education in the U.S. through 12 education, which is.

315
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:15,190
What the majority of the general public will have retained.

316
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:24,160
And even like when I was growing up, this was always common knowledge that they were really bad at math and science.

317
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:29,070
But now the pandemic has passed. We've been able to see the real world.

318
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:42,010
Impact of a populous who does not understand very basic scientific concepts and things like that, and every facet like anti-vax.

319
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:49,770
Vaccine hesitancy and all of these things. So this is definitely very long term.

320
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,830
Improving the emphasis and quality of our scientific application for head.

321
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:02,430
Mostly the younger generation. The kids are still in school.

322
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,490
I think that would be very impactful. Yeah.

323
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:10,980
Yeah. Yeah, I think I think you I agree with that.

324
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:19,139
Uh, those sentiments with the federalism, though, each state is like more or less left up to their own devices.

325
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,719
So in order to implement something like that,

326
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:33,900
that would require an overhaul from the Department of Education in terms of setting new national standards for what is the expectation.

327
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:39,510
So like, for example, in the United States, we have the occupational safety and health regulation, right?

328
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:43,860
So you can either have a federal OSHA plan or you can have a state OSHA plan.

329
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:47,010
Now, if you follow the federal guidelines, fine.

330
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,380
That's like federal guidelines are meeting the bare minimum, which is like a C grade for worker health.

331
00:37:52,770 --> 00:38:00,300
But if you have a state plan, it has to be generally as strict or stricter than federal guidelines.

332
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:08,459
So we do have some national standards for like things like, you know, regardless of the person,

333
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:17,700
I mean, where it stayed there for all y'all had to learn algebra, geometry, pre calc, etc.

334
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:30,359
Right. But for public education in particular, like things really vary like history for example, or social sciences or language classes.

335
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:37,950
So it would require them to integrate the need for public health education into like K-through-12 education,

336
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:43,710
because even for things like sex ed, people can still waive out of that for for religious reasons.

337
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,810
Or interestingly, like it also differs when people go to private school as well.

338
00:38:51,140 --> 00:39:02,180
So I know somebody who sent their child to private school and it was a very like laissez faire approach to education where they were like,

339
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:07,610
let this child learn how to read when they are ready to read.

340
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:13,220
And as a result, their child did not start learning to read until fourth grade.

341
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:21,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whereas when I went, I went to public school all my life because my parents did not have money to pay private tuition.

342
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,710
I started reading like in kindergarten, preschool. Kindergarten, right.

343
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,919
But there are private schools in particular, like charter schools,

344
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:34,460
which is becoming a more popular model, very much like let you know when the vibes are right.

345
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:39,290
Energy. Oh, yes, yes. Montessori is in particular.

346
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,120
So it is. Yeah. Did you not you were you not aware of this.

347
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:49,420
Oh. Reading is really difficult to learn. So it's not the vital role that call.

348
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:56,460
Yeah, I remember like how many of you as kids because I went to public school in California.

349
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:03,110
Like when you read, you go. I used to have we used to call up one on one to our teacher and read a passage in time.

350
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:06,200
Like how many words per minute you read? Did you all do that?

351
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,160
I see some head nods. Yeah, yeah. Yes. So different in India.

352
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:18,260
Yeah, I don't think they did. Okay. I mean, we'll talk about everything even from City.

353
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:25,160
Really? We didn't go with waves. Yeah. Yeah, well, I mean, this child is now caught up at her grade level.

354
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:29,690
Their grade level, but it's very different. But I think, you know, like that acknowledgment, again,

355
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:34,249
like this feeds into what we think about the realm of infectious disease and emergency response.

356
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,260
It's not just like this aspect we're focusing on.

357
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:45,530
We are focusing on also have to think about like the way Americans in particular are in culture rated in this like individualistic society that

358
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:53,330
we have in particular where we know we have like one of the most expensive and worst health care systems in the world for how much we spend.

359
00:40:53,690 --> 00:41:01,250
But also on education, we're like really far behind and but we think we're doing great, right?

360
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:06,649
For the most part. If you ask, like a general American citizen on the street, like,

361
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:10,490
how do you think America is doing in terms of their education compared to other countries?

362
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:18,860
You know, there's these like biases peop guys these people have or even like racism towards like non westernized country.

363
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:27,950
And I've seen like so many not oh like at least a half a dozen take dogs where like international students from like Nigeria or like Ethiopia,

364
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:34,909
like come here and they're like crashing their like the top of their class because they learn this stuff like five,

365
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:38,840
six years ago compared to when we have to learn it here in the United States or even

366
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,830
like Chinese international students will talk about like how they and from Korea,

367
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:51,290
Japan, we'll talk about how easy our math classes are. You know, with my dad in particular, he when he moved to the United States,

368
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:57,619
he was like in his late twenties and decided to get a degree in engineering because that

369
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:03,230
was the only like degree that didn't really require you to speak English proficiently.

370
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:07,010
So English was really like the only thing he had to catch up on.

371
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:10,970
But everything else was like, he's crazy. It's with you.

372
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:19,670
Yes. PAGE Yeah, I'm, I see a lot of like general knowledge trivia and it's in the covers everyone's fighting over, like, we should know this.

373
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,700
No, we should have, like, what is general knowledge? What is it?

374
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,719
And it's like really interesting. Yeah. Or even like those quiz shows where they, like,

375
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,879
interview people in the street and you might see them like interviewing people from Europe, for example.

376
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:40,760
Like they have a wide breadth of knowledge, not just about their country, but also about other countries as well, which is very interesting.

377
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:50,989
But I think it'll take a be a big, big shift here in the United States in terms of like overhauling Department of Education,

378
00:42:50,990 --> 00:43:00,920
what we prioritize as a country, in terms of like what we need to know as especially as the world becomes more and more globalized.

379
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:11,090
Right. So, yeah, yeah, I know. I know some folks where like their kids in school now are learning like Chinese very early Spanish,

380
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:16,600
for example, just because of the globalization and any who.

381
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:20,600
Okay. Any final thoughts and questions before we move on to the next part?

382
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:30,560
All righty. So primary prevention approaches, so hopefully y'all at one point or another in your public health career.

383
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,120
I've talked about the differences between primary, secondary and tertiary prevention.

384
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,440
Now, this is generally thought about when we're talking about diseases.

385
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:44,030
So like take something for example, like diabetes, right?

386
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:48,469
A primary prevention. Measure would be a healthy diet, exercise,

387
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:54,620
etc. Secondary prevention would be like prediabetes screening and then tertiary means that

388
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:58,099
you've already gotten the disease or illness and now we're trying to treat it right.

389
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:03,710
So that might be like metformin, getting on some medications, monitoring your blood glucose level.

390
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:07,070
Sometimes folks might need insulin for type two diabetes.

391
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:14,360
So when we're thinking about this in terms of infectious disease, emergency response at the primary level,

392
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:23,570
these are approaches that are taken before the outbreak or emergency has occurred to avoid preventable injury, illness or death.

393
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:33,170
Whole population initiatives. Now, generally, when we're thinking about primary prevention from primary up to tertiary one are at the primary level.

394
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:37,370
You can target more so population initiatives or the community.

395
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:42,140
But once you're getting down to the tertiary level, you can really only target the individual.

396
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:46,010
Now, what is secondary prevention look like for this realm?

397
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:50,870
It's immediate response that takes place after the outbreak or emergency has occurred.

398
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:57,530
So these are short term consequences where we're trying to change the tried trajectory of those already affected.

399
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:07,310
So those who have been affected by a hurricane, for example, how do we try to solve those problems really quickly so we don't have things like,

400
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:16,790
you know, perpetual like chronic flooding and flood remediation that hasn't been resolved, that is led to like mold growth throughout the whole house.

401
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:24,200
Right. And then tertiary are long term responses that are ongoing, sustained or addressing systemic issues.

402
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:31,400
So some of the very basic ways we stop diseases before they manifest is health promotion things.

403
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:36,650
We talk about the semester, social determinants of health, information on behavioral medical health,

404
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:44,240
nutritional food, supplementation, oral dental hygiene, education, and then vaccine and prophylaxis exposure.

405
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:51,820
One thing that's interesting is that in terms of medical insurance, when you have like not student insurance and then, you know,

406
00:45:52,070 --> 00:46:00,350
like a regular job, I don't understand why they count the mouth and the eyes as separate insurance, then health insurance as a whole.

407
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:03,440
But they do. Dental and vision are separate.

408
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:14,030
And if you talk to many dentists in particular, the mouth is a gateway to a lot of infectious diseases in terms of because it was one of the

409
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:20,830
main portals of entry and one of the main portals of exposure besides the eyes and the nose.

410
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:25,820
Right. But it's like your biggest open orifice that you have in your body.

411
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:33,169
And so having things like poor dental hygiene, for example, gingivitis, cavities,

412
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:42,200
bacteria that kind of like in this entry way can make you more susceptible to infectious diseases.

413
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:49,459
So that is something that they they try to focus on. So in a lot of like communities that are are lower income,

414
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:55,180
you'll generally see like mobile dental clinics or vans, particularly targeting like children.

415
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,830
My aunt is a pediatric dentist in Irvine and they generally do a mobile clinic and like

416
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:07,070
other like low income areas of so-called to provide free dental services for children.

417
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:10,550
But this is still something that is severely overlooked.

418
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,940
And then we've talked about funding, in particular lack of funding.

419
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:24,709
I don't know if y'all at one point in your lives or another will end up doing some policy related work from some of the career interviews you did.

420
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:33,650
It sounds like some of the folks you interviewed have either by choice or just by like the nature of what they do have been involved in policy work,

421
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:41,299
but definitely advocating for funding. But bit by bit by doing that, we actually have to collect evaluation measures,

422
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:53,870
which is a whole other conversation and then a pandemic response team and or an infectious disease network that are funded and working all the time,

423
00:47:53,870 --> 00:48:01,850
even when there is not an outbreak. So currently some states and institutions have pandemic response teams or rapid response teams.

424
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:07,610
The federal government outside of the US Public Health Service, which you know from Commander Garza,

425
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:15,350
you learned as many different things and then the national disaster response medical system from, you know, Dr. BIDDINGER as lecturer.

426
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:20,120
They also do a ton of things. They don't just focus on infectious diseases and pandemics.

427
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:30,589
We did have a pandemic response team that was mounted during the Obama administration as a result of the 2019 influenza outbreak,

428
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:33,890
and then it was dismantled during the Trump administration.

429
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:41,870
So currently the federal government is trying to build one again, but we still do not have a national pandemic response team.

430
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:51,420
And then because this is my. Area of work, catching people in the workplace to address these issues of behaviors.

431
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:56,770
So this group talked about trying to catch people at school. A lot of us are out of school now.

432
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:05,050
So the other logical place to me where we can try to catch people at work and influence their behaviors is at the workplace.

433
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:10,020
So most adults spend a third of their lives at work.

434
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:18,910
You spend another third asleep and really the only last third being able to like, enjoy life and do what you want to do.

435
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:27,690
But in every workplace, generally, training and exercise is part of the job, whether you're like a sandwich artist at Subway, right?

436
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:36,050
You have to get trained on like food safety and handling and refrigeration, cashiers and doing your job here.

437
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:43,300
Even at the University of Michigan. You know, we have to do trainings on like sexual misconduct, mandatory reporting.

438
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:51,280
If you work in a lab, you have to do trainings on lab safety of you've had to do like your peers training human subjects, right?

439
00:49:51,670 --> 00:50:02,860
So why don't we add some training on basic public health principles, hand hygiene, even though this is a school of public health?

440
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:10,600
Oh, my gosh. The people that matter who still don't do hand hygiene correctly is remarkable to me.

441
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:15,280
And in the women's bathroom, on the sixth floor at least, we have at least like three signs.

442
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,780
And how long you need to wash your hands for cough etiquette.

443
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,760
I still see people coughing just like the open, right?

444
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,540
Proper masking and PPE use the importance of vaccination.

445
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:37,300
Now, what the university tried to do was mandate vaccines, which they did.

446
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:44,800
But I don't necessarily think they did a great job at educating folks on why the vaccine was important.

447
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:53,440
If y'all remember, we would get these lengthy emails from Schlissel or like the the chief medical officer whose name I forget,

448
00:50:53,830 --> 00:51:04,659
and there would be COVID briefings, but I don't ever recall seeing like a, like an infographic, like a very digestible infographic or a short,

449
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:10,090
like mandatory training, even like ten, 15 minutes that everybody had to do.

450
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:15,820
They just set up these emails which people usually just like delete or like not even open, right?

451
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:22,510
And then they were like, okay, boom, you're required to get the first to report, first to vaccines, report it.

452
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:27,549
And if not, like you're in trouble and then the booster as well.

453
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:29,320
And then we had the screenings and all that.

454
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:41,709
Some people got fired at the end of 2021, but the importance of vaccination was not really emphasized, I feel here at the university.

455
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:49,630
Okay. And then healthy behaviors, you know, they have some signage in this building that's like take the stairs,

456
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:53,470
hey, like exercise and like save electricity.

457
00:51:53,710 --> 00:52:00,490
Right? And then now so they're trying to more so address mental health and substance use disorders.

458
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:07,240
But these are very short webinars that are generally half an hour.

459
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:14,950
Have it have that. How many of you participated in like one of these unhealthy things that are like the yoga or the mindfulness?

460
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:20,830
Nobody. Yeah. Yeah. So this is something that we talk about.

461
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,430
These these kinds of things don't work. They're like a Band-Aid, right?

462
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:31,000
Like me doing like a 30 minute yoga sesh is not going to address the chronic stress that I have in my life.

463
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:38,440
So in the other class that I teach in the afternoon, psychosocial factors of environmental and occupational health,

464
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:47,530
we talk more so about like total worker health interventions that are implemented at workplaces that take place over a period of,

465
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:55,930
you know, several months to half a year to even a year where they're specifically trying to target substance use disorders,

466
00:52:55,930 --> 00:53:05,470
for example, and how the workplace is the perfect place where you're already they're spending your time doing all these things.

467
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:14,589
But of course, in order for this to happen, the workplace has to value this but also implement it, right?

468
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:20,170
We're not just doing like a quick communication. We're not just doing something like virtue signaling.

469
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:25,870
So as a very like find a basic example that parallels this.

470
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:31,150
This is not infectious disease related, but how many of you all know the company?

471
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:34,420
L.L. Bean I think almost everybody.

472
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:41,170
L.L. Bean is based in Maine, and they mostly make like cold weather, outdoor gear.

473
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:44,410
So if you think about like the traditional like duck snow boot.

474
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:51,210
It's very like L.L.Bean. They make great coats for cold snow below freezing.

475
00:53:51,990 --> 00:54:01,110
So L.L.Bean is one of those companies where people go there and they work generally for life because they treat their employees so well.

476
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:07,920
And the median age for that, you know, company is like five forties, fifties.

477
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:13,890
And so with these workers in particular, with them being older and having to do a lot of manual tasks,

478
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:16,890
they were very prone to musculoskeletal disorders.

479
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:26,550
So what L.L. Bean did was they implemented an intervention targeting cardiovascular health and muscle strengthening,

480
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:37,860
where employees were paid to essentially work out at the workplace doing these cardiovascular exercises.

481
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:45,480
They got paid breaks and paid stretching breaks in addition to this, in addition to like working out,

482
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:53,040
like if I got paid to like go use go over to the CCRC for an hour, I would totally do it right.

483
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:59,340
And then they also incorporated like robotic technologies to take off some of the

484
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:04,230
burden for like tasks that they didn't necessarily need the workers to do anymore.

485
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:08,010
And they did this for like at least six months.

486
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:12,270
And they found that generally people's cardiovascular health did increase.

487
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:20,130
Right. So, I mean, we have stuff here like hand sanitizing stations and we have like these wipes everywhere.

488
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:28,680
But these are what we consider like more passive measures rather than proactive primary prevention measures.

489
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:39,960
We talked about some other avenues to reach people like social media, for example, or media in general.

490
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:44,640
Do you think there are what other avenues do you think there are to reach folks?

491
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:52,670
This is just an open ended question. You don't have to give me an answer right now, but just think about it.

492
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,670
To me, the workplace makes sense. This K through 12 makes sense, right?

493
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:03,810
But where other potential places where we can try to reach people with some primary prevention measures.

494
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:11,880
The last thing I want to talk about today is state, local, tribal and territorial planning.

495
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:20,759
So if you all recall with SGLT2 capabilities in particular of their primary responsibilities within this realm,

496
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:26,129
our assessment of current strengths and weaknesses. Community Preparedness and recovery.

497
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:35,280
Emergency Operations. Public health information and warning for fatality management, information sharing and then mass care.

498
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:42,150
They also do things at this level that are like countermeasures for dispensing.

499
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:47,370
Like I talked about have taken place and some like anthrax, bioterrorism exercises.

500
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:52,950
Non-pharmaceutical interventions, lab testing, surveillance, occupational safety and health.

501
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,230
And then volunteer measurements.

502
00:56:55,500 --> 00:57:01,950
So the non-pharmaceutical interventions in particular are generally what we think about as our public health measures.

503
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:13,800
Now, the Strategic National Stockpile or the SARS, we've talked about this briefly in other lectures that as the nurse is.

504
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:23,100
In a secure location and its location is not disclosed for national security, health reasons.

505
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:32,730
Now, we also have to protect PPE stockpiles, and those are located in multiple locations throughout the United States.

506
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:37,680
Based on region, the SARS is one location.

507
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,580
And so what has the SARS been used for in particular?

508
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:54,870
The SARS actually was not established until 1999, so it has been deployed multiple times since 1999, 2001,

509
00:57:54,870 --> 00:58:05,070
during the World Trade Center and anthrax attacks where they stockpiled antibiotics in particular in case there is widespread anthrax release.

510
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:15,870
It was deployed in 2005 for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita again, and eight for Ike and Gustav and then 29 for H1N1.

511
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:24,180
We see it frequently for hurricanes. It was deployed in 2014 when there were widespread botulism outbreaks.

512
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:30,120
This is mostly due to people canning their foods improperly and giving themselves botulism.

513
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:34,490
It happens infrequently, but it does happen.

514
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:44,520
So like, for example, in my hometown in Sacramento a couple of years ago, this woman got botulism from eating nachos that she got from a gas station.

515
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:52,080
Because if you see nacho cheese in those like big aluminum cans that they sell, like at Sam's Club.

516
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:57,420
Improper canning can lead to botulism botulism toxin from forming.

517
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:01,739
And then they deployed the CNS again for Zika virus hurricanes.

518
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:05,520
And then, of course, of course, COVID 19 and COVID 19.

519
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:15,479
And unaccompanied children. Unaccompanied children means children who are now essentially orphans because one or both of their parents have died,

520
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:19,500
or people who would be their immediate family have passed away from COVID.

521
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:26,910
So the role of the stockpile essentially is to supplement, sell medical supplies and equipment.

522
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:35,940
This is intended to only be a short term solution or a stopgap buffer when immediate supply is unavailable due to shortages or,

523
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:44,910
for example, production ceases or halts. And they ideally check on the S.A. periodically for material integrity and expiration date.

524
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:52,530
So for PPE, they stock n95s disposable black gloves, masks, surgical shields, surgical gowns, coveralls, gloves.

525
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:56,370
And then we have those federal medical stations as well.

526
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:57,209
So, General,

527
00:59:57,210 --> 01:00:06,990
the federal federal medical stations can be deployed with MDA masks and they usually have 50 to 250 primary or critical care patient beds,

528
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:15,750
at least a three day medical supply of pharmaceuticals and 15000 to 40000 feet of operating space when needed.

529
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:22,709
So federal medical stations aren't just like boxes and boxes of supplies and vaccines and medications.

530
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:27,900
They also come with like mobile units that essentially can be popped up more or less.

531
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:35,380
Okay. So for COVID 19, of course, the S.A. provided PPE,

532
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:45,250
but they also provided COVID 19 supplies with ancillary and mixing kits that supported up to 2 million doses and booster doses of COVID.

533
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,860
They held a lot of ventilators as well, high flow, nasal cannulation.

534
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:54,790
And then they also provide training resources.

535
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:08,330
Right now. Territorial considerations right here in the United States.

536
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:16,450
We have American Samoa, different than regular Samoa, Guam, Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands,

537
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:21,620
U.S. Virgin Islands, and then the freely associated states, Federated States of Micronesia.

538
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:29,510
And then we also have Puerto Rico. Right. Sorry I didn't put Puerto Rico on there because we previously talked about Puerto Rico.

539
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:39,140
But if you'll recall, the territories in particular, they do contribute to the national congressional budget, like for things like FEMA.

540
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:44,900
But because they don't have voting rights in particular, generally in emergencies,

541
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:50,570
they're kind of in this like limbo in terms of federal aid and emergency response.

542
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:58,760
So going forward, because of things that have happened in Puerto Rico, past and present for hurricanes,

543
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:05,510
they're starting to have more considerations for inclusion of territories and freely associated states.

544
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:11,580
So, for example, they did receive the COVID 19 economic stimulus.

545
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:19,750
So if you'll recall, I think we got like 1200 dollars and then $600.

546
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:27,170
It seems like a blur now. But we got stimulus checks in in in chunks.

547
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:30,520
So the territories did actually receive that. Okay.

548
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:35,639
But we're trying there's more conversations about equity for these populations.

549
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:40,250
Since many of these territories are like black indigenous persons of color's,

550
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:48,139
they do have a greater level of health disparities compared to the United States in terms of like chronic disease exposures,

551
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:57,020
type two diabetes, heart disease. They do have longer standing challenges with deferred repairs to hospital facilities and provider shortages.

552
01:02:57,260 --> 01:03:04,490
So, for example, when everything was knocked out in Puerto Rico, people the closest place they could go for high level care was Florida.

553
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:12,500
Some people in Guam can't even get access to certain levels of care in Guam and have to come to the states for that.

554
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:15,470
And they're impacted by natural disasters.

555
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:22,790
And then testing limitations, but also underreporting in terms of the level of surveillance that they can have,

556
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:27,260
but the robustness in which that data is actually collected.

557
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:33,290
So in particular, like if you look at the public health service,

558
01:03:33,290 --> 01:03:38,869
like with Commander Garza talking about like these goodwill missions they do in peace

559
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:44,030
times where they take like the large ship to like countries in South America as well.

560
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:48,350
They're trying to do that as well in the U.S. territories.

561
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:53,600
Now, tribal considerations, the Indian Health Services.

562
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:57,890
This is an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services,

563
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:02,780
but they're responsible for providing federal health services to American Indians

564
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:10,280
and Alaska Natives who belong to 574 federally recognized tribes in 37 states.

565
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:20,360
Now, in order to receive health services from the Indian health services, you have to be recognized as a Native American.

566
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:24,170
And this does actually require an application process.

567
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:29,840
So I've live now in Nebraska, in Omaha, where there is a large indigenous population.

568
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:35,600
Indiana, where I live there less so. Michigan does have a large indigenous population.

569
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:43,970
But like if you do like a 23 in me or whatever and you're like 5% Native American, remember that whole thing with Elizabeth Warren?

570
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:50,779
That was that was a whole thing. Okay. Just because you do that does not make you recognized as Native American.

571
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:57,230
You actually have to go through this application process where you trace your lineage back to a certain tribe.

572
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:03,590
And by doing that, that does entitle you then to Indian health services benefits.

573
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:09,740
But there are significant disparities in equities and health care services and health outcomes pre-pandemic.

574
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:18,650
I think as we've talked about in this class of briefly and more so maybe in my other class in terms of like indigenous populations,

575
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:25,309
depriving them of resources, stripping them of natural resources that make them reliant on federal aid,

576
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:28,820
which has made them more susceptible to getting Type two diabetes,

577
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:36,980
higher susceptibility of alcoholism, higher smoking rates, depression and suicide in particular.

578
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,620
And then Indian health services in particular.

579
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:47,330
If you happen to work in health care, a lot of times this is considered like a medical desert or low resource area.

580
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:55,340
So you might be deployed to do like a residency or serve time on like native tribal lands.

581
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:59,080
Right. To to to address the health care shortages there.

582
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:04,990
But they do have some level of autonomy so far.

583
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:13,130
Yes, Berlin. So for if you qualify for Indian health services or the health care through Indian health services that don't,

584
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:16,480
does that disqualify you for Medicaid and Medicare?

585
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:25,299
Yes, I believe so. But you can still go to like if you don't want to use Indian health services,

586
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:30,580
you can still partake in regular health care, but it just costs a lot more.

587
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:41,409
Yeah. Yeah. And with the whole, like Roe versus Wade debate, when Roe versus Wade got, you know, rolled back,

588
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:50,590
I saw some conversations about like in the Indian health services, setting up abortion clinics and native lands.

589
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:54,680
But then that would have they talked about how like, you know,

590
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:59,559
there were some debates about how that would open up a whole other can of worms because more or less right now,

591
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:05,410
like these Indian health services are able to function autonomously and do what they want to do.

592
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:15,760
But if they got involved in the abortion rights, like the U.S. government would try to then go back and further dig their hands into that.

593
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:21,729
And then also that puts an additional burden again on these native and indigenous communities who in

594
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:28,030
this study back in 2008 surveillance of infectious diseases among American Indians and Alaska Natives,

595
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:34,719
they found public health surveillance networks to be suboptimal across facility and disease types.

596
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,260
And there's a lack of feedback on surveillance activities.

597
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:47,860
So generally, because historically, for many reasons, there's a lack of trust between tribal authorities and state and local governments.

598
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:58,929
So even if you have an outbreak, for example, of e-coli or listeria or giardia, that happens on tribal or territorial lands, you know,

599
01:07:58,930 --> 01:08:05,830
the ideal situation would be they would report that outbreak to the state government so that it could be included in the surveillance data.

600
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:12,309
But because they don't trust the US government, they don't report it and maintain their own surveillance data.

601
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:17,740
That may be separate to that the state or they don't collect that surveillance data at all.

602
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:22,510
And there's also gaps in coordination of activities.

603
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,880
Yes. Any any thoughts or comments on the tribal considerations before?

604
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:40,480
I will say. A couple of my friends when we were at the University of Nebraska participated in.

605
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:48,040
Like a summer exchange program that was focused on cancer epidemiology.

606
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:51,580
It only exists in a couple of of schools of public health.

607
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:53,560
So University of Nebraska was one of them.

608
01:08:53,890 --> 01:08:59,110
I think I talked about this class where a couple of my friends who were in AP went to Tanzania for the summer.

609
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:02,380
Was at this class. My memory is very short.

610
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:06,129
A couple of my my my friends did internships.

611
01:09:06,130 --> 01:09:08,650
Their capstone was we're going to Tanzania for this summer.

612
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:20,800
Looking at AP data on cervical cancer in Tanzania, then in the United States, you actually get sent to Native American tribes.

613
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:28,330
So one group was actually sent up here to Michigan, to northern Michigan to look at their cancer incidences as well,

614
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:37,750
because they consider the disparities to be comparable on tribal lands as it is in like Tanzania, for example.

615
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:44,530
They also sent someone to Saudi Arabia. So there is still like a lot of.

616
01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:55,610
Lack of resources again, just because of health disparities and and racism within these tribal considerations.

617
01:09:57,740 --> 01:10:03,150
Okay. Now, what about occupational control and prevention in occupational training?

618
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:06,780
Okay. Going back to the workplace again, 90000 hours.

619
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:12,200
But over the course of your human life here now we'll see these infectious

620
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:18,350
disease trainings either directly or indirectly related to infectious diseases.

621
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:27,860
Most places prior to COVID 19, it was more common for health care and long term health care facilities,

622
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:32,210
meaning like nursing homes, assisted living to have these control plans.

623
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:37,640
Now, more so in a post-COVID world, we are seeing these.

624
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:49,820
So these are specific to worksites based on conditions, facility assessments, and these are generally overseen by health and safety regulations.

625
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:55,040
So in here in the School of Public Health, our person is a new person.

626
01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:00,949
April Pearsall, she might you might get emails from her about like pop up vaccine clinics will likely

627
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:06,470
have like a schedule power outage going on or like it's really cold and tower to you,

628
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:16,040
which it was that was. So people's offices were like 55 degrees last week because we don't have insulation in our offices, but that's a holiday.

629
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:20,000
But generally now we're seeing more so detailed plans.

630
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:25,970
And one group in particular that I want to talk about is unions.

631
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:33,170
Unions actually play potentially can play a huge role in public health response.

632
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:41,270
Unfortunately, though, union membership has declined significantly in the last 100 years,

633
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:49,640
whereas a few out of all the workers here in the United States, only 10% of folks are in unions.

634
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:54,890
And you mentally find unionized workers here in the state of Michigan,

635
01:11:55,220 --> 01:12:00,620
in the northeastern states like Massachusetts, surprisingly, Hawaii, for example.

636
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:08,300
And unions exist to help workers with their rights and collective bargaining.

637
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:17,900
And when I say sometimes their contentious relationship with management that you and place like always a contentious relationship with management.

638
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:24,770
So we see right now there's strikes going on throughout the University of California system where,

639
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:30,050
you know, students and faculty alike are striking because of their wages.

640
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:37,370
Here at the University of Michigan couple of months ago that the nurses were striking grad students who are unionized.

641
01:12:37,370 --> 01:12:41,900
We've had multiple grad student union strikes in particular.

642
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:49,490
And unions generally function again to kind of whistle blow and be like, hey,

643
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,720
we're not being paid enough or, hey, our working conditions are really crappy.

644
01:12:54,620 --> 01:13:00,840
And so we as a collective then are saying we're not going to work unless you meet our conditions.

645
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:12,169
Right. But legislation and money spent trying to union bust is so significant because they know

646
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:18,020
that they are effective in making workers safer and getting them like living wage,

647
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:21,140
that it affects their bottom line. Okay.

648
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:30,889
So many states have passed what we call right to work laws and Indiana was one of them.

649
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:37,100
I believe Kentucky is another part of being in a union means that you have to pay union dues.

650
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:45,800
And so that either comes out of your paycheck every month, a little bit like with your health insurance, or you pay that fee once a year.

651
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:55,130
And because a lot of folks don't understand the way that unions function or they've been fed so much anti-union rhetoric,

652
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:01,520
you know, to certain people that extra $20 a month out of their paycheck really makes a difference.

653
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:05,750
So in these states that are right to work, which are generally more conservative,

654
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:10,580
they now give people in workplaces that would traditionally be unionized,

655
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:15,350
like a manufacturing facility, for example, or a auto manufacturing facility,

656
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:22,340
rather than being where everybody is automatically opted in to the union, people have to opt in.

657
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:29,870
And so your right to work means you have the option to opt out of the union and not pay the dues.

658
01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:37,400
But what does that mean then, where half of your union is or half of your workplace is unionized and the other half isn't?

659
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:42,499
If half of the workplace strikes, the employers are like, Who cares?

660
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:46,580
We don't need to give you what you want, which you're asking for because we still have.

661
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:54,350
I've half of these workers doing their thing right. Whereas if the entire workplaces unionize, if everybody stops working.

662
01:14:55,680 --> 01:15:00,509
The like. The employers are kind of like out of luck until they do that.

663
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:09,749
Right. So generally workers in unions across the board do receive higher wages and they're more likely to self-report injuries,

664
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:13,800
illnesses and follow through on worker's compensation claims.

665
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:20,610
And they're more invested in educating and supplementing workers knowledge of workplace training.

666
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:27,900
So they're more likely, like the workplace may be doing the bare minimum in terms of what training is required.

667
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:35,280
The unions will come in and supplement that with additional training and education sessions on things like respiratory protection,

668
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:40,079
for example, like with UAW aged COVID 19 vaccines, right?

669
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:49,470
They had like multi-day workshops on COVID, and they can definitely be an asset in infectious disease prevention and control in the workplace.

670
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:58,680
So since COVID 19, lots of bad things have happened, but lots of good things have happened as well.

671
01:15:59,010 --> 01:16:07,709
Where we're seeing now more so the rise of pro-union sentiment again, where like Starbucks, for example,

672
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:12,360
as we've seen Starbucks try to unionize with Starbucks will go that and do is

673
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:16,650
after these workplaces unionize they'll shut down those Starbucks locations.

674
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:24,419
So we as the workers have the power to continue.

675
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:27,749
Like Jen, I would say millennials and Gen Z in particular,

676
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:32,250
now that we're in the workplace and and outnumbering a lot of the older generations

677
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:38,579
have the power to push more towards unionization because people back in the forties,

678
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:42,899
fifties and sixties, like almost everybody would be in a union.

679
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:45,900
But union busting has gotten really, really powerful.

680
01:16:46,110 --> 01:16:49,440
They've tried to do this at Amazon House warehouses as well,

681
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:58,500
where they'll they'll as part of people's onboarding process now spend a lot of time talking about why you shouldn't be part of the union.

682
01:16:58,830 --> 01:17:06,360
Or if they hear about people organizing, they'll retaliate against the workers known for like leading that union organizing.

683
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:10,950
So a lot of this unionization has to happen outside of the workplace.

684
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:17,819
They'll monitor people's text or monitors people's emails, but so people have to try to go about it and all these kinds of channels.

685
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:21,899
It's quite interesting. But unions in particular,

686
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:27,990
I'm a highly strong advocate for in terms of bettering workplace safety conditions

687
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:32,460
and in particular can be an advocate for infectious disease prevention.

688
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:41,730
So with that, I will stop there for today and we will pick up next week.

689
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:47,840
But again, just a reminder about your assignments and it.
