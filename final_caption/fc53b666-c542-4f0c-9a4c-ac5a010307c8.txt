00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Aging Part two, health of the elderly in the first segment of this lecture,

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
we examine changes in the age structure of the U.S. population and the potential impact of such changes on public health.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In this segment, we'll focus on health among the elderly and how this may be changing over time.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It should be no surprise that people over 65 have a greater chronic disease burden than younger people,

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
regardless of how the term chronic disease is defined.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The majority of the elderly have one or more chronic diseases and one and a majority even have two or more chronic diseases.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Common examples include heart disease, diabetes and mental illnesses such as depression.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Some chronic diseases can be well managed, resulting in minimal impact on function or disability,

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,000
such as control of high blood pressure or high cholesterol. In other words, the morbidity is low in some cases.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:16,000
In contrast, as people age, some chronic diseases contribute to significant impairment or increased morbidity such as arthritis,

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:28,000
dementia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Not only is chronic disease common among the elderly, but multiple,

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
multiple national surveys have demonstrated that the prevalence or rate of chronic disease has been increasing.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It is particularly notable that the prevalence of elderly persons with multiple chronic diseases has been increasing.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
As has been discussed in previous lectures and readings, life expectancy has increased substantially since the beginning of the 20th century.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And this is usually viewed as a major public health success.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But merely focusing on life expectancy fails to address issues related to the quality of a longer life.

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
As described in the previous slides, chronic disease is very common among the elderly and has been increasing.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And now people are living longer. So what has been the overall impact on the quality of life?

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Are people living longer but also living longer with chronic, debilitating conditions?

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So the average quality of life has deteriorated? Or has the increase in life expectancy also been accompanied by a reduction in the degree

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and or duration of morbidity associated with chronic conditions that accumulate with age?

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
In other words, has the health or quality of life of the elderly been improving or not as life expectancy has increased?

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
These questions are important since the answers will have an impact on the ability

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
of Medicare and other social programs to address the needs of an aging population.

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
In order to address these questions.

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We need to define three terms or phrases compression of mortality, compression of morbidity and failure of success.

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Let's begin with the phrase compression of mortality. This graph displays the percent of people surviving or projected to survive to a

28
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
given age for different birth cohorts in the United States over the 20th century.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
One common feature of these curves is that they all reach zero at around 100 years of age or so.

30
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The point is that the data would suggest that while life expectancy at birth has increased.

31
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The biological limit of human life has probably not changed much.

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Very few people live to 100, and essentially no one lives beyond 110.

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,000
For those born in nineteen hundred and nineteen 02, infant mortality was high and about 10 percent of people died in the first year of life.

34
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The subsequent shape of the curve is not flat. It is downward sloping throughout the lifespan and relatively few people born in nineteen hundred.

35
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Only about 30 percent reached the age of 70 or beyond.

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
With each subsequent birth cohort, the curve moves up and to the right.

37
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So, for example, more than 70 percent of those born in 2000 are expected to survive the 70 years of age.

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Notably, the initial 40 or 50 years of the curves for the later cohorts are all relatively flat.

39
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And then there is a sharp decline. In other words, a greater and greater fraction of deaths are occurring among the elderly.

40
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Another way of saying this is that mortality has become compressed in the later years of life.

41
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This rectangular ization of the survival curve is what is meant by the term compression of mortality.

42
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Now, let's focus on the term compression of morbidity.

43
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The illustration displays four hypothetical scenarios of the pattern of morbidity over the average life span.

44
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's consider the first scenario and the illustration or the present morbidity.

45
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This first curve assumes a present day life expectancy at birth is 76 years and that,

46
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
on average than morbidity of chronic conditions has onset at around age 55.

47
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And then morbidity increases until death 21 years later.

48
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:46,000
In other words, the typical person can expect to live with increasing morbidity and disability from chronic conditions for about twenty one years.

49
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Now let's focus on the second scenario or life extension in this hypothetical situation.

50
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Life expectancy at birth has increased four years from 76 to 80 years, but the onset of morbidity has remained unchanged.

51
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Hence, on average, though, people live longer.

52
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The typical person can expect to live with increasing morbidity from chronic disease for twenty five years rather than twenty one years.

53
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:21,000
the entire increase in life expectancy may be considered to be a relatively poor quality due to prolonged morbidity from chronic disease.

54
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This scenario illustrates a public health success in terms of increased life expectancy,

55
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
but a public health failure in terms of greater, greater disability, more prolonged morbidity and lower quality of life.

56
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
This scenario illustrates the term failure of success. The third scenario illustrates a shift to the right.

57
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
In this case, life expectancy at birth has increased five years from 76 to 81 years.

58
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But the onset of morbidity has also shifted five years from 55 to 60 years.

59
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So in this scenario, the typical person can expect to live longer and the duration of morbidity from chronic disease.

60
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Twenty one years would be unchanged in the first scenario.

61
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The overall quality of life would be unchanged from the first scenario.

62
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Finally, we have the last scenario or compression of morbidity in this scenario.

63
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Life expectancy at birth has increased two years from seventy six to seventy eight years.

64
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But the typical onset of morbidity from chronic conditions has increased 10 years to 65 years of age.

65
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
In other words, the increase in life expectancy has been accompanied by an even greater increase in the average age of onset of morbidity,

66
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
with the overall effect being that the average duration of morbidity and disability has been shortened compared to the first scenario.

67
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
This increase in life expectancy, accompanied by a shortening of the duration of morbidity,

68
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
is termed compression of morbidity from a public health perspective.

69
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Compressional morbidity would be a highly desirable outcome.

70
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The question is what has actually happened in the United States over the last half century or so?

71
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Have we experienced a compression of morbidity? Or have we had a failure of success?

72
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
At the beginning of this lecture segment,

73
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,000
we saw that the rate or prevalence of chronic disease among the elderly has been increasing in recent decades.

74
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yet at the same time, multiple national surveys have documented a sustained decline in the rate of disability or morbidity among the elderly.

75
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This may sound like a contradiction, but it is not for a variety of reasons.

76
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Chronic diseases among the elderly today are less likely to be disabling and therefore people with chronic disease are less likely to occur.

77
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Clinically significant morbidity compared to decades ago. For example, the prevalence of diabetes has been increasing among the elderly,

78
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
yet with better management of cholesterol, blood pressure and blood sugar levels.

79
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The risk of many of the major morbid consequences of diabetes such as heart disease,

80
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:14,000
stroke, peripheral vascular disease and chronic kidney disease have been reduced.

81
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Life expectancy has increased over the last century or more.

82
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The evidence over the last few decades indicates that despite an increase in chronic disease prevalence among the elderly,

83
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
the United States has experienced the compression of morbidity rather than a failure of success.

84
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
If one assumes that smoking rates continue to decline and if the obesity epidemic is reduced,

85
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
this trend of compression of morbidity is projected to continue into the future.

86
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:55,991
This compression of morbidity will have major consequences for the future sustainability of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
