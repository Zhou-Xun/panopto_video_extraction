1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:07,290
Okay. So we'll get started. So today is our second lecture on glucose oxidation.

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,280
I've heard, like all of us on Wednesday, we're going to switch to the penthouse.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:21,510
So there was a little bit of the note today about office stress and there's been a lot more releases on what they really want,

4
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,500
enzyme that actually matters.

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:37,040
So before we get to class today, I want to call your attention to this new I science and make an update to one of the optional activities so far.

6
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,830
So today we're going to have our first research presentation. So if you have any of those.

7
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,750
So before today, we were only letting people do peer reviews on research presentations.

8
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,060
But the problem with that is only have one and there's actually nobody signed up for another one.

9
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,990
So we're going to switch it so that if you want and again, all of these things are optional.

10
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:03,240
If you want to do peer reviews, the foods of the day comes is really important is that then you can.

11
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,790
So peer reviews are basically you read that you watch the presentation and then

12
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,060
there's a structured rubric that we use by the sort of effective peer review.

13
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,160
So if you want to do that, you can you can get up to 50 points. So you cannot attend five times.

14
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,810
If you do that this semester, we grade them and give you feedback on your peer reviews too.

15
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,569
If you want to do that, you can. So you can do that.

16
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,560
Starting today, we're going to have two presentations today of you to the day and a research presentation.

17
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,490
But before you do that, there is a peer review training module and that is also worth like five points or something.

18
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,629
So do that activity first and then we'll grade we'll try to grade those really quickly

19
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,460
this week so we can give you feedback on sort of how we set our expectations for your day.

20
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,570
So if you want to do that, then you can just look for the peer review training module first.

21
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:55,980
Do that first and then you can go ahead and view reviews of the presentations starting today.

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:04,390
That makes sense. All right. All right. So with that being said, we're going to start if you want to go with our view of the day today.

23
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:16,250
Treating me like I'm cool.

24
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,550
Okay. Hi, guys. I'm Elizabeth. I'm going to be presenting on Rice today, and I.

25
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:28,520
We're going to talk a little bit about oxidative stress. So we might be leading into Wednesday's lecture more than I had in just a minute.

26
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:36,830
So really quickly, we're going to go over the brief history of rice types of rice differences between white and brown rice, some of the healthy.

27
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,330
And we're also going to talk about germinated brown rice and how it relates to the ETSI

28
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:48,830
electron transport chain and then give you some ideas to enjoy it so really quickly.

29
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:57,710
I'm sure most of us have tried rice in our lives. It's very common in originated it goes back as 2500 BCE and it was used for trade

30
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:04,010
and then also to feed as food and it was originated in China spread kind of

31
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,540
through the trade system to Sri Lanka and then to Greece and then quasi from

32
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,400
the middle Mediterranean over to the Western Hemisphere was through excuse me,

33
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:22,700
in the Western world as the European settlers. And so there are two main species grown over a recessive era and then a result.

34
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:28,700
LAMB We're reading the word wolves. I was to see what was the difference between the two.

35
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,570
Is that a resource that can be grown almost anywhere?

36
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,790
And the second is more successfully grown in uplands land found in high rainfall areas.

37
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:44,510
And so a little more specific for the success of that range, we're going to focus mainly on a resource.

38
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,300
So moving forward, just because it's more common.

39
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:55,790
So very briefly, the types of rice, it depends on length of grain and then also whether or not there's bran and germ included.

40
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,670
So the mean length of grain are short, medium, long,

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,020
and then the amount of bran and germ left in that grain is kind of what differentiates between brown, white, brown rice and white rice.

42
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,730
And so why does this matter?

43
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:14,930
Kind of alters the method that you use, the cooking that you would use it for, the type of taste, and then also some of the nutritional value.

44
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,890
So I thought this graphic really well represented the differences and kind of like what short grain would be used for versus long.

45
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:30,589
I think you guys can see it up there. So sushi would be more short grain, white, green furlong grain would be more like brown rice.

46
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,350
Jasmine And then like rice balls.

47
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:43,320
So looking at the nutritional differences in these types of rice, I compared brown, white and then a branded one I found on the USDA website.

48
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:53,280
And basically we see here the main takeaways is that overall, brown rice is higher nutrient value than white rice and then the Brown branded rice.

49
00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:00,960
It doesn't say like the if it was white or white, it would be white or brown rice for the Rigo brand.

50
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,270
What like looking at the nutritional value, you would probably guess that would be more likely to be white rice than brown.

51
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:14,880
And so when you look at the nutrient breakdown kind of comparable across carbs, protein, lipids, with brown rice having a little bit more,

52
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:23,040
the main difference is kind of the numbers of magnesium, phosphorus and potassium in those bottom three down here.

53
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,480
So it's almost fourfold in the brown rice compared to white, which is kind of key.

54
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,500
And so with that in mind, moving forward, when I'm about to talk about the health claims,

55
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,770
we're going to be looking in terms of brown rice, whole claims, not white.

56
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:44,009
So excuse me. So brown rice has been long studied for a lot of its kind of health benefits and nutritional value.

57
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:49,170
And so a lot of research has gone into the studies of looking at how it manages diabetes,

58
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:55,050
AIDS, digestion, it provides antioxidants and depressant effects, reduce cholesterol.

59
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:01,440
All these are really, really well studied. And so what I wanted to focus on, which was new to me, was having neuroprotective effects.

60
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,520
I don't know about you guys. I never really heard about that as a benefit of rice.

61
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,050
So I wanted to look a little bit more into that. And then just a little aside about white rice.

62
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:17,159
White rice has fewer fat, but it has more niacin, which is good for digestive health, neuro health,

63
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,360
and that works in your nervous system and then your skin don't want to forget about it.

64
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,240
So the study that I came across that looked at brown rice having neuroprotective effects.

65
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,069
We're going to talk about germinated brown rice because that's really what was studied.

66
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:38,460
And so the difference really between dirty brown rice and just regular brown rice is that the germinated has sprouted.

67
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:45,240
So usually to make it you like let it sit in water, you drain it, you repeat that process until sprouts kind of come off that grain.

68
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,979
It takes 2 to 3 days if you're going to do it at your house. Luckily, you can buy in stores.

69
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:55,080
It's known as just sprouted brown rice. So I just wanted to kind of give that background before jumping in here.

70
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,520
Based on this graph, we see that. Okay.

71
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,890
So researchers, researchers took neuroblastoma cells and kind of gave them hydrogen peroxide.

72
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,180
Hydrogen peroxide is known to like kill cells and like, it's very toxic, basically.

73
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:19,200
And so what they did is that they then had a PR, which is the brown rice germinated and then just GABA concentrations,

74
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:27,000
which is an enzyme that I'm sure we'll talk about it later on in later lectures.

75
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:33,870
And then basically this graph is showing that red charred to be higher than the brown

76
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:40,799
rice or GABA in terms of increased cell viability when exposed to hydrogen peroxide.

77
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,280
And so this can be kind of tied to a protective effect against Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

78
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:56,430
And so what we're going to talk about now is kind of how the germinated brown rice is affected or is related to the ETSI cycle.

79
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:06,270
And this kind of ties to our reading that we have for today where in that final step of the transport system, oxygen gets our final electron into H2O.

80
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:15,300
When that doesn't go correctly, we're left with oxygen and hydrogen superoxide, which is a real reactive compound leading to cell death.

81
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,190
And so we already have sort enzymes to protect us from that buildup.

82
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:27,270
But when that process is kind of overwhelmed, it can lead to neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.

83
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,410
And so basically kind of tying the earlier study to the etsi.

84
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:39,239
ETSI we know that we can have the lead bromide is protective factor in mitigating the stress of

85
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:46,290
that hydrogen superoxide and the oxidative stress that can lead to neurodegenerative disease.

86
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:52,800
And I think finally we have to think about ways to enjoy it and protect ourselves from some of these diseases.

87
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,709
So we've got the sprouted vine raised, brown rice pilaf, we've got brown rice with baby spinach and mushrooms.

88
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:02,970
You get some extra vegetables and then stuff. Peppers is a personal favorite of mine.

89
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,790
And so those are just some really easy ways to incorporate this green into your diet if you aren't already familiar with it.

90
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:22,530
And at this point, I'd like to open up to any questions. Where do like wild rice varieties?

91
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:27,090
Like it was like short, medium, long and like brown versus white.

92
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,950
Yeah, that's a good question. So far in terms of I'm going to answer the brown versus white first.

93
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:39,809
Just because it's a little easier is that brown is kind of to what I've seen more of the like immediate one that you'd find in the grass.

94
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:45,690
And then the way you get to more white is by taking out the germ and the brand that gives it that color.

95
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:53,490
So it's more processed. You can fortify the white rice to give it some more nutrition value, but I mean, that's up to the provider.

96
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:59,070
And then in terms of the long, short medium, I didn't really get into the details of that one looking,

97
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:11,580
but that's a good question and something I can follow up with. Who often.

98
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,380
So one night in Sean, there was fire. So can you comment a little bit about what fibers like the crosses or is it very low?

99
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,920
Yeah. So I'm going to take a. So what I thought was interesting, which I had sort of called out earlier,

100
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,080
is that when I was looking at the foundations of the brown and white rice versus that we go,

101
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:36,010
they only had the carb listed and not the fiber aspect, but then the branded one had the dietary fiber called out separately.

102
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,100
I wasn't totally sure why on the methodology of that.

103
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:48,549
But also, I mean, as we know, kind of like the more wholegrain, the more fiber we're going to have, just as like the way that it is.

104
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:54,760
And so I think that's I mean, that the fiber part I did not get into as much in some of those research,

105
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,929
especially the neuroprotective, because I focus more on like the germinated.

106
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:10,950
But yeah. I love the question, but they want to add something because actually that was my topic during my thesis of my masters.

107
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:19,109
So although we say that rice brown rice is more recommended because it has more fibers, but my thesis was about aflatoxins and rice.

108
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:24,150
If you get into this because usually aflatoxins are far more and brown rice because they are

109
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:29,850
they do have the outer layer that usually have the fungi that grow and produce aflatoxin.

110
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:37,530
So though they are more healthy and they contain more fibers and nutrients, but they are more prone to have environmental toxins like aflatoxin.

111
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:43,919
So that's like a dilemma here. That's that's really cool. I didn't see that, but that's like very interesting.

112
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,399
So yeah, I thought the neuroprotective effects of something that was like so neat and so I clearly

113
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,350
there's a lot about rice and some of those grains that is not in the mainstream discussion.

114
00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:08,950
So I'm just thinking. Okay.

115
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:15,610
So like I said, so today we're going to talk about the tax code and you're going to break it up into sort of three different parts,

116
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,380
sort of roughly addressing these sort of instructions.

117
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:25,060
But I want to start, you kind of reiterate, the way I think about these things is trying to connect concepts.

118
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:31,520
So I put a bunch of concepts if you remember from some of to go directly to modular energy balance.

119
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,280
So you want to spend about 10 minutes, ten, 15 minutes on this, right?

120
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:42,210
So some of these things, I think almost all of these, I believe we are mentioned in the reading part,

121
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:49,419
but in the 23 2014 slide and I want you to try to connect as many of these concepts together you can.

122
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,480
So same thing, work with your people around you if you want help.

123
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,720
And then when you submit it, you don't need to have everything on your map.

124
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,410
But if you want anything clarified, just circle and cool or arrow or something.

125
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:06,399
So that would be great. If we can give you another thing I want to mention is as we do more of these content maps will be of next week,

126
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,840
you know, the previous I'm actually intentionally taking out terms too.

127
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:18,010
So if there's something on here that if you're like, Oh, the way I would connect antioxidants to these rocks,

128
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,339
I dismutase I need another term in the middle there or whatever. That's my intent.

129
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:27,370
Right? So here this is isn't a comprehensive list. You should be all things to it to make things go on to where to start.

130
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:33,400
Just take two things familiar with you and try to connect those two things first and then I'll circling around.

131
00:13:33,480 --> 00:14:29,500
If you have like a sample spend about 300 people and okay can see happens if you've ever been out of the house.

132
00:14:30,280 --> 00:15:12,459
So I don't know what it was in 1949, which was a kind of.

133
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:24,810
Danny So you see something like, Oh, and see like that.

134
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:40,120
That's something I'm going to do right now.

135
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:50,650
It's an interesting story because I was just like, Oh my God, that is true.

136
00:15:50,650 --> 00:16:14,570
Sometimes it's very that for your husband, that meeting, because at the time I was just wondering, you know,

137
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:34,030
I don't think that it makes sense to do so by regulating, oh, hey, why don't you go directly to a place I want to ask you.

138
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:43,900
I think it was like I didn't really realize.

139
00:16:44,150 --> 00:17:01,980
It was like you're like any of this would have been kind of planning to get to something out.

140
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:18,260
So, like, if. So my buddy something from Sweden and I was like, Yeah, okay.

141
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:24,510
No, no, no. I think that would be interesting.

142
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:59,320
I think the problem is he was going to run a lot and you get a lot of things that have nothing to do with, you know,

143
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:08,760
you just I feel like it just keeps going like this because because this is something

144
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:17,870
that has to be disclosed right before people have been trying to break out.

145
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,450
You have pyruvate and you're going to make that's what it is.

146
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:32,930
But I think there is a lot of good stuff down to earth reasoning about policies and age and that there is a huge amount about it in the world.

147
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,480
Yeah. Okay.

148
00:18:39,140 --> 00:19:10,130
So I'm just trying to make you think for me that's causing significant amounts of difference.

149
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:24,980
I don't really know what's going to work and towards regulation, which is kind of like I mean,

150
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:41,090
I guess like it sounds like the idea for a criminal, you have to act like, you know, like seasonal and others maybe.

151
00:19:41,140 --> 00:20:08,420
And then we can handle so much about what's I think that's part of narratives in the present of, oh, you know, it's so horrible.

152
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,820
You should look directly.

153
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:19,790
You can control to control those who like to.

154
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:25,070
You guys definitely do like to be super obviously.

155
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:39,150
But is that so I think was recently like, oh yes, it's something or something that you want to relax or historical that might pose a threat to.

156
00:20:39,950 --> 00:21:18,710
And then yeah, right now this new term landscape is not is putting yourself in this memory like why do you need these chemicals in your head?

157
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:29,660
If you look at they used to think that way even if you just stuff like.

158
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:36,330
Yeah. So for me it's like it's okay.

159
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:44,550
It's an emergency. Oh, but I look okay.

160
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:51,770
What have we done? I mean, we should have gone.

161
00:21:52,100 --> 00:22:03,570
Oh, yeah, that things were happening here. I was like, you know, so we can do something like that.

162
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:15,330
We can. Yeah. No, that's right. There's 100 words in your question, and one of the regular ones is we need which ones?

163
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:34,890
Each piece of the thing that we put on TV into something that contributes to make me.

164
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:48,200
Well, I believe in breaking it down. And let me tell you what, I was just like, looking out.

165
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,990
Like what I was, like, really interesting to the last minute.

166
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:58,500
Yeah, I literally remember. Yeah, of course.

167
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:09,270
It seems like within hours, you know, he's out there talking about my life.

168
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:16,010
I didn't do this for you. Make some businesses that are doing things.

169
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:34,290
What are you doing? So I decided, oh, you know, there's there's a whole you know, they will spend about two more minutes on this.

170
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:50,429
And I'm wondering about that. You see, of course, you know, the decision to quit my job was not that I'm taking on this very much.

171
00:23:50,430 --> 00:24:02,850
We've been since we were thinking more like, what doesn't, right?

172
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:28,350
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I wish I could say just because isn't there was a lot of time as to why would you want to take some time of your revenue.

173
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,530
So there's so many.

174
00:24:35,850 --> 00:25:06,220
Yeah, that's not that's the part I was not very well was that I would really like to move out of the house so that what exactly are you waiting for.

175
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:16,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

176
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:31,940
I just to, you know, there's going to be, you know, it's just like doing things differently and stuff like that.

177
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:39,180
And I've always liked that tactic.

178
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,900
So is going to think about looking past with nothing.

179
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,030
And it's also interesting where like your arms. Yeah.

180
00:25:49,830 --> 00:26:14,850
And there's so much fatty acids going from the top down because there's a lot of thank you thank you very much

181
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:27,690
to be helpful just a I was okay so I think at least two thirds of these are I'll mention today as we go on.

182
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:35,790
So again this is part of the goal of these content maps is for you to sort of be a little bit hopefully not too much challenged in terms of like,

183
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:39,270
wait a sec, I'm pretty sure that wasn't in the notes I've never heard of or even bought something.

184
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,950
So when it comes up that can sort of trigger, you could be like, Oh, that's what we heard from 14 over 18.

185
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,190
It's like I said, put in an effort to submit it if you want the points.

186
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:58,140
But if you want us to clarify, you sort of all I'm confused about this in particular, I like to give you feedback on some of our our covers.

187
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:03,880
We thought, okay, so apparently what we're talking about today is everything that's.

188
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:09,990
Going to happen to pyruvate after glycolysis last pass we talked about how glucose galactose interruptus ethanol from of.

189
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:16,020
Now we're going to talk about what happens to that pyruvate. You'll notice at this point it doesn't matter if it came from glucose,

190
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:23,430
galactose or right now the common unit of chemical exchange is in fact the heart rate.

191
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:26,579
So it turns out there's going to be a few different decisions that are getting made.

192
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:31,950
And as I said last place, when I say the cell is making a decision, what I almost always mean,

193
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:40,290
probably will probably always mean is that there's some enzyme and its activity is going to dictate which river that metabolite can pull down.

194
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,750
So it turns out pyruvate has a bunch of different options it could become depending on the conditions of the cell.

195
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,530
And if you take a step back, you can imagine this makes a lot of sense.

196
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:56,189
You had consumed glucose. What you end up doing with that glucose is going to vary depending on the cellular and the conditions are right.

197
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:59,910
Maybe you want to turn into lipid. If you want to turn it to energy, maybe you want to turn into amino acids.

198
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,810
These are all potential options that the partake,

199
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:10,650
become and various enzymes notably here private dehydrogenase is going to help that Ahmed make the correct decision about which which river to down.

200
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:15,300
So it's just a bit of a summary. So one thing that pyruvate can become is a central point.

201
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:22,290
So in some ways or of another important molecule, it's produced by an enzyme called RGGI documents, which we'll talk about a lot in a minute.

202
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:27,090
Once the acetylcholine is established, it's now got a bunch of decisions it can make.

203
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,580
It could become energy through the TCA cycle.

204
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,879
It could become a lipid through a process called the novel Lipid Genesis, or it could become a ketone body if the lipids are absent.

205
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,540
And I'll explain what I mean by these three temperaments wise.

206
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:48,989
However, if the pyruvate doesn't become a stroke away, which is usually the case under anaerobic conditions, it ends up becoming lactate.

207
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,020
And then the lactate has its own sort of its own sort of pathway.

208
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:58,410
So just to kind of highlight this, we're right now in this decision point here, you see there's a few different places pyruvate can go.

209
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:04,139
And then there's another decision point here in a subtle way. So even though these are two sort of consecutive steps, they're really,

210
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,830
really critical steps for understanding what's going to happen to sort of that precursor

211
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,489
molecule and are you going to be lipid or even in terms of energy and glucose,

212
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:18,310
all of these are sort of on the table. And then to kind of reorient youth where we are pyruvate here.

213
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:25,740
So don't go away. The normal looking genesis is this process here in Brown and then this orangish process here is key to Genesis.

214
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:33,269
And again, we'll talk about this as we get to it. So we'll start with the sort of the somewhat easier decision, what happens in the absence of oxygen.

215
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:39,750
As I said, if you don't believe me that anaerobic metabolism is inefficient, try going for a run.

216
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:44,010
Right? And so this is catalyzed by an enzyme called lactate hydrogen.

217
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:51,419
So I mentioned this last class. Getting to pyruvate gives you a net plus seven gtpase but just the one step of converting to higher rates,

218
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:57,420
which is to get to pyruvate to one of glucose to two lactate molecules is actually quite energy dependent.

219
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:04,830
Right? So you actually burn by ATP by equivalence in the form of of energy to get lactate generated.

220
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,380
So what lactate does is a couple of different things.

221
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:13,319
So one common thing that's been known since about the 1940s and fifties was something called the Korey Cycle,

222
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,180
which is named after Gary Corry, which is the first female Nobel laureate in physiology.

223
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,660
And she found this process where lactate can be produced in the muscle,

224
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:27,750
get recirculated back to glucose in the liver through gluconeogenesis, which we'll talk about in three classes.

225
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,330
And then that glucose can be recirculated back to like that causes.

226
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:36,269
So what that means is that even though you can't fully use that lactate, you can kind of keep regenerate it.

227
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,470
So you keep having glucose available, right?

228
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:46,200
So even though you're child, even though you are exercising, for example, and aerobically, you're still able to replenish your glucose levels.

229
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:51,870
This is energetically inefficient. That process. You start with lactate, you end with lactate, you burn for you to use in the process, right?

230
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:57,059
So this works. This is a good way to keep normal glycemia but it is very, very inefficient.

231
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:02,140
And to go back to what we talk about, energy expenditure, class inefficiency means negative energy balance, right?

232
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:07,410
So this would be an inefficient process. If you really want to decrease negative energy balance, this is something you could you could do.

233
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:12,120
All right. So that is perfect. So this is a long detail in the notes there.

234
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,680
In the notes. So please don't try and write all this down.

235
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:18,270
But this is the calculation by which if you go through glycolysis, you end up with seven ATP.

236
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:23,100
But if you go through the TCA electron transport chain, you generate 32 ATP.

237
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:27,680
And the reason there's a little tilde here is this sort of depends a little bit on the efficiency of your mitochondria.

238
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:33,000
So it's not an exact number as we'll talk about because the mitochondrial efficiency can vary from cell to cell.

239
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:40,680
You get this 32 from this map here. So let me just report, if it is over two and a half itps, you generate one empty one and a half.

240
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:51,780
You saw all this up, you get to 32, 32 is 16 times greater than two, which is why breeding is super helpful if you're trying to burn glucose.

241
00:31:52,950 --> 00:32:02,339
Where does this all happen? This all happened in the mitochondria. So there is a great graph activity with the podcast, which is name.

242
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,889
I can't remember right now that. Talks about sort of mitochondrial biogenesis.

243
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:09,610
So adding mitochondria to our cells, which have been fairly early,

244
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:16,930
elusive or not that long ago in sort of overall terms, was actually really, really important.

245
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:20,799
So by the symbiotic relationship of mitochondria getting into a cell which formed a

246
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:26,190
eukaryotic cell that allowed every cell to increase its energy capacity by about six fold.

247
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:31,690
So before that, all they could do was undergo glycolysis, but then after that they can undergo all sorts of other.

248
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,110
So they can take glucose, they can get way, way more ATP from it.

249
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,910
Now, also, cells are able to catalyze amino acids and fatty acids.

250
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,329
These cannot be catalyzed with a few very minor exceptions.

251
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:46,590
We'll talk about in year two three without the presence of mitochondria. Right.

252
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:52,390
So if you want to use fat for energy, you need mitochondria. If you want to use all of the energy and glucose, you need to use mitochondria.

253
00:32:52,390 --> 00:33:00,070
If you want to burn amino acids, you need. But all of these exclusively happen within the double membrane transported mitochondria.

254
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:05,139
Now the first step by which pyruvate gets into the mitochondria involves a particular transporter.

255
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:08,950
This pyruvate transporter, it's a co transporter with the protons.

256
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:13,450
This was actually only discovered about 15 years ago. So before that, when you they got in there somehow.

257
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:19,989
But we had no idea what the identity of this transporter is. As of now, there's no evidence that the transporter is regulated in any important manner.

258
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:25,870
There's no good evidence. It's hormones or conditions or diet or whatever can change the levels of this transporter.

259
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:29,739
But again, we haven't been studying it for nearly as long as, for example, CPT one,

260
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:35,770
which is the fatty acid transport which we know a lot about and is the key regulatory center for pasteurization.

261
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:41,260
But right now the best that we can think of is pyruvate gets into the mitochondria through this transporter.

262
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,979
And then the most important decision it's going to make right here is hydrate.

263
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:48,850
The hydrogen is this stands for priority dehydrogenase complex.

264
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:57,910
Interesting okay so you probably one is targets and I realize that it's like the suffix for mitochondria.

265
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,690
So mitochondria is like I said, it's a pretty complicated organelle.

266
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:07,540
It's got all these involving layers, it's got all these molecules that are attached to it.

267
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,809
It's really important, it's really detailed.

268
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:13,510
Most of the metabolism actually occurs on the inside of the mitochondria.

269
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:18,870
CO2 gets into the mitochondria, and then all of the rest of the enzyme we're going to talk about today are all all right in there.

270
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,549
Now, it turns out that number of mitochondria and this is like a little bit controversial,

271
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,840
but I think it's reasonably established to generally be not modified.

272
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,559
Now, what we don't know is when you talk about modifying mitochondria,

273
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:35,230
are you changing the number of mitochondria in a cell or are you changing the types of cells that have mitochondria that pass?

274
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:40,180
A little bit dubious. But there's a lot of evidence from longitudinal studies that if people train the number

275
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:44,379
of cells in their muscle that have mitochondria can be modified and can increase.

276
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,450
And so this is just sort of a summary of what that might look like,

277
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,820
is that during an appropriate training event, you would now be able to have more mitochondria.

278
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:57,639
Again, having more mitochondria muscle is good if you're trying to get as much energy from your fuel as possible.

279
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,510
That's useful for some activities such as long distance running,

280
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,140
virtually not that useful for some activities such as sprinting or weightlifting, right?

281
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:09,579
Where you just need fast twitch muscles. You don't actually need to you're not going to run out of of much of the fuel.

282
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:13,510
You're plenty of time to rebuild. Okay.

283
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:23,570
So one of these things that can happen when you have these long term changes is sort of a general concept I want to want to kind of highlight here.

284
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:30,250
This is this idea of transcriptional regulation. So many of you just may be familiar to you, but I can't go over that a little bit.

285
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:37,420
So there are certain transcriptional regulators. So the way I think about that is the transcriptional regulator is going to make a whole new approach.

286
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:44,890
Right. This is, as it turns out, it going to be extremely energetically expensive and relatively slow and just flat on your side.

287
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:45,490
You know,

288
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:58,990
I think I think here it's almost is on the of looking at this is a sort of more permanent but slower and more expensive type of modification.

289
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:04,629
Right. This is really different than the stuff we're talking about with the allosteric regulation of PBC, which can happen like that.

290
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:11,980
Right? Your activity goes up, your left turns off your and he goes up your terms that have been sort of appeasement at the level of public.

291
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:17,740
These take a lot longer. And a lot of these changes are controlled by things called transcription factors.

292
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:25,180
So these are specific proteins that respond to some sort of signal and then they go and they drive the transcriptional generation of new genes.

293
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:30,160
So it transcribes into Monday that morning, it's then turned into the protein.

294
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:35,799
And then after that process is done, now you have more proteins that can do whatever the thing that it was supposed to be doing, right?

295
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,890
So this is one type of regulation. It would be down here, right?

296
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:42,370
So it would be sort of expensive but more permanent.

297
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:47,050
Right. So we're talking about training, adaptation, which could take weeks or months to occur.

298
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:51,820
We're talking about sort of very energetically expensive, but also quite permanent changes.

299
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,670
Right. If you stop exercising for like a day, these changes aren't going to go away.

300
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:59,850
This is in contrast to PFOA, which is a very high speed but impermanent affect.

301
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:04,780
Right. So you respond insulin right now and two weeks from now you don't really care whether you are responding to insulin.

302
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:12,400
Yeah, right. So that's the difference between the two. So there's a few important ones that are relevant to both glycolysis and the TCA cycle.

303
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:17,110
So I'm going to start with the bottom two. What is the the global sensing of carbohydrates?

304
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:22,360
It turns out there's a transcription factor called the carbohydrate response element, binding protein scattering.

305
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:27,790
And it detects when you have a lot of carbohydrates in a cell and it responds by doing a bunch of stuff.

306
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:33,940
One of the things it does is it makes more pyruvate kinds, which was one of the last really big steps in carbohydrates.

307
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:39,130
We'll talk about this more with lipids because most of what the HRT does is promote lipid synthesis enzymes.

308
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:43,690
Another thing that can happen is you have chronic glucocorticoid cortisol.

309
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,810
Those are both symptoms of having very low carbohydrates.

310
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:52,689
So you can think of that as like the opposite of BP. In those cases, you get downregulation or something like a lot of genes.

311
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:56,440
In this case, the most relevant one that's down regulated is Google.

312
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,219
So that's another reason. And there's lots of these transcription factors.

313
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,280
We'll talk probably about at least about half a dozen over the course of the course.

314
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:08,920
But remember, the key thing is if it's transcriptional, it's relatively slow but also relatively permanent.

315
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:13,419
Right? So it's like sort of like making a decision like I have a family and I've got to go a

316
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,550
bunch of places and me and my wife have one car and we're going to buy another car.

317
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:20,050
Spread does turns out when you work, that's not a decision we're going to make quickly.

318
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:23,220
But it's a decision that's probably the last that's for however long that car left. Right.

319
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,880
So that's an example of that kind of decision.

320
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:29,710
Whereas a transcriptional decision might be like, well, let's just carpool with the neighbor right now because that can be new right now.

321
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:36,850
The last one that I'm going to mention here is something called hypoxia. So hypoxia is the constant state of low oxygen tension.

322
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,830
Right? So you can adapt to that. Both cells and bodies can adapt to low oxygen amounts.

323
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,489
And one of the things you might imagine that would happen if you have low oxygen is you

324
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:51,070
would want now to promote glycolysis and you would want to alleviate the TCA cycle,

325
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:55,870
right? Because you're not going to have oxygen at the end of the TCA cycle, so you're not going to have anything to do with that oxygen.

326
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:58,870
Right. So you want to promote things like glycolysis Huckabee down,

327
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:02,700
regulate things like fatty acid oxidation or glucose oxidation because you're not going to bother him.

328
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:12,459
Right? So hypoxia is induces a transcription factor called hip, which is that someone can really name the hypoxia induced factor, right?

329
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:16,090
That's what it stands for and it responds to level of hypoxia in the body.

330
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:19,470
And this can happen, like I said, in the whole body level or can happen locally.

331
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:26,440
So for example, if somebody has a heart attack where a certain part of the heart is starved of oxygen, briefly, there'll be hypoxia in that one place.

332
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:33,590
The rest of the heart might be okay, but that one little part will have hypoxia and we'll have to do that hypoxia and I'll switch to using my call in.

333
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:42,240
Is that to say things like when you see weightlifters in particular where they find a muscle to kind of like slow that blood flow to stress it,

334
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,960
which obviously the blood would have oxygen. And it is at the same kind of thing where you're talking about locally doing it.

335
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,040
Yeah, I forgot the name for that.

336
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:54,009
But that is a common new thing in weightlifting where somebody will like right after they do a rep the like restrict the muscle.

337
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:59,620
And the idea is to induce hypoxia because going back to here, remember something like weightlifting,

338
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:04,140
you actually don't want to have very much like or oxygen if you want to maximize it like little.

339
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:11,950
So that's the theory behind that is actually a very good transition to today is first research dog groups use maybe.

340
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:17,770
The way they just did that, I guess. Who is going to tell us about hypoxia and exercise adaptations?

341
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:26,940
I mean, you can talk about it. Okay. Hi, everyone.

342
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:33,140
It's your parents. And today I will talk about hypoxic exercise and type one.

343
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,430
That sense?

344
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:49,730
So first, what is a hypoxic exercise? So just like the word, it is exercised in the environment with oxygen lower than normal levels.

345
00:40:50,150 --> 00:41:00,440
So there is two ways to achieve these goals, like entertaining or stimulation of low oxygen environments, such as hypoxic chamber and oxygen mask.

346
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:05,450
So you can look at this picture is example of Cheney in a hypoxic chamber.

347
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:17,030
So to simulate the high altitude as high cell density and there are several of the advantages of this kind of exercise.

348
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:23,660
It can improve indoor endurance and increase explosive power and promotes restoration.

349
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:29,730
And I also find training in a hypoxic environment improve the ability of human wide muscles,

350
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:39,860
fibers to take up oxygen in front of that and its promotes vasodilation which can allowing the light to carry more organized organic phosphate.

351
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:47,210
So today I will mainly talk about this article called The Effects of Highly Intensity,

352
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:56,150
Physical Exercise and Hypoxia on glycemia angiogenic biomarkers and cardiorespiratory function in patients with type one diabetes.

353
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:04,879
And the purpose of this article is to assess the effect of normal variable hypoxia and exercise on the serum contusions,

354
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,320
off growth factors and glycemia in patients with Type one diabetes.

355
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:17,670
I think there might be like an auto advance. What? No, I think it's.

356
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:29,790
I think it's something with the PowerPoint. First, let us see the measures they chose for the 14 patients suffering from diabetes for two years.

357
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:38,730
And they said a control group who is 14 has individuals and their first conduct has nontoxic and toxic rest.

358
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,079
These people's and then they conduct normalcy and capacity.

359
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:48,010
Incremental incremental exercise test on these people and the cardio.

360
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:52,890
Oh. The carburetor.

361
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,990
Oh. Let me see if I can.

362
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:14,579
I can fix that. You know,

363
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:25,500
I think it's because of the heat and the cardiorespiratory variables and glycemia angiogenic and hematological indices were measured and

364
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:36,810
how they achieve the goals of hypoxia by the attitudes change hypoxic systems weight corresponding to a height of about 2500 meters.

365
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:48,390
The exercise tests were performed on a sign for two at a time and for the rest to test the patient and how to control individuals for 40 minutes.

366
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:56,970
And the exercise test started with a 3 minutes warm up and the intensity was then increased every 3 minutes.

367
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:07,840
So next we will look into the data. So first, a significant effect of hypoxia and physical exercise.

368
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:16,240
Blood glucose concentration can be seen in the tables where you compare these two bars of the on the toxic and hypoxic.

369
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:28,750
And the figure one is just for the patients with diabetes and conclude that normal the control group and we can also see the

370
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:39,400
significantly lower glucose glucose levels at maximal exercise intensity of the hypoxic exercise compound in the moxie exercise.

371
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:45,370
And after 5 minutes and to 24 hours recovery period,

372
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:56,020
the difference is still existing and we also can observe a tendency towards lower fasting glycemia on day two after graded exercise

373
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:05,500
compared to day one and the next table is the cardiopulmonary indicator in hypoxia and nausea for both of these two groups.

374
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:15,340
And first, the peak peak oxygen consumption of the O2 is a criteria measure for aerobic capacity.

375
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:25,389
So the figure showed good exercise tolerance in patients with type one diabetes and a tendency towards increased VO2 max.

376
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:34,960
And the significantly higher minutes of pulmonary vaccinations were observed in both groups responsible to exercise and hypoxia.

377
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:43,500
And significantly lower oxy Hamilton situation was observed after both exercise protocols.

378
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:47,670
And so there's a post p02 max and PCL to max.

379
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:54,540
And that glucose concentration were lower in control groups compared to patients with type one

380
00:45:54,540 --> 00:46:03,150
diabetes at baseline and or because it was significantly lower at lower after hypoxic exercise.

381
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:09,270
And finally, we look into the angiogenic factors, factors in both of the groups.

382
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:18,000
First, significantly lower TGF interest level in hypoxia compared to a normal uptake.

383
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:31,980
Conditions were observed in the diabetic type one diabetes subjects and hypoxic exercise had significant effects on SERA as well about concentrations,

384
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:37,290
and IBD has a significant impact on the post exercise.

385
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,620
While Alpha and I will talk later about why this is as well.

386
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,130
Alpha and other in contrast, is so important.

387
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:58,929
And a tendency toward higher VEGF levels what was observed after normal exercise that compared to hypoxia,

388
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:10,360
exercise and impulse in both conditions significantly lower serum IGF one concentrations were observed in type one diabetes patients,

389
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:20,890
and there was a tendency toward higher levels of exercise in hypoxic exercise compared to a normal exercise in both groups.

390
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,150
So here is a key findings of these articles.

391
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:31,450
So first, hypoxic exercise is the greatest and a safe way to alleviate Type one diabetes.

392
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:38,620
Latency decreases the blood glucose concentrations more effectively compared to normal exercise,

393
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:49,630
and it improves short term glycemic control as well as rodents post exercise hypoglycemic events, at least for two days.

394
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,180
And the seventh funding is hypoxic.

395
00:47:52,180 --> 00:48:02,650
Exercise can bend the regulation of angiogenic pathways and possible stabilization of angiogenesis in physically active type one diabetic patients.

396
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:13,160
In diabetes patients, we can see a high as well as an animal and a lower serum IGF one concentrations.

397
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:22,220
So this in fact US may modify angiogenesis processes so may cause these orders in the diabetes patients.

398
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:31,010
And evaluations of TGF beta is a valuable tool for the adaptive assays that mediate complications.

399
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:42,049
So the data shows that hypoxia exercise can prevent these disorders because we see that the archrival

400
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:51,920
was lowered and the serum IGF one is increased and the TGF is lowered and here is a possible mechanism.

401
00:48:52,190 --> 00:49:05,509
So in the patient's exposure to have the environment so they have a reduction in mitochondrial respiration and which stimulates the anaerobic Greco,

402
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:18,470
they take pathways and they produce a little lactate as SD And so we can see the higher levels and the lower levels in the data.

403
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:30,820
And it also can. Increase or bust direct president attention was increased NGOs NGOs independent director capacity higher production of in

404
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:42,490
and those see and oh and as expression so both of these factors can produce a lower will cause a broken glucose level.

405
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:48,909
So but this has worked is not been proven so we just can see it maybe the

406
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:55,330
possible use of like lead and class related processes in patients ways that one.

407
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,960
And here is the overall conclusion.

408
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:08,650
The short time hypoxia combined with graded exercise can make several primary and applies to type one diabetes patients.

409
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:17,559
First is increases cardio cardiorespiratory adaptations and is more except effective control of low

410
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:25,480
cost homeostasis compared to the classic exercise and its control that diabetes complications.

411
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:32,530
So the overall conclusion is hypoxia combined with exercise reduce glycemia and may induce

412
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:37,840
a significant benefits in the prevention of diabetes cardiovascular complications.

413
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:44,050
On my reverse, refer to these and thank you.

414
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:56,739
Is there any. If there are no questions.

415
00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:02,200
And I also I'll find some shot comes of this hypoxic exercise.

416
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:10,000
So we can't always use this tool to deal with things that maybe have one diabetes.

417
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:14,170
I find that as an individual, May has no tolerance to altitude,

418
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:22,390
so it can related to an increase in breathlessness and outside of anemia and a loss of muscle mass.

419
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:33,910
So I think more research should be taken out of the question of what type of exercise, where they do they go through for the chromosome size.

420
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:38,140
Yes, I mentioned before.

421
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:43,980
And they're all on the ergometer. Yes, I don't.

422
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:57,140
So I see the conclusions that hypoxia can do some benefits in the prevention of diabetes, cardio vascular complications.

423
00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:04,840
So I feel like I have overlays who have questions of people who live in quite a has quite short life.

424
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:09,980
Right. And most of them will suffer from cardiovascular disease.

425
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:14,320
All part of the take a lot because I used to working in plateaus.

426
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:21,889
So I feel like these two have a little bit conflict between pre one's diabetes,

427
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:28,230
cardiovascular complication and the how high level of cardiovascular disease.

428
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:32,900
I don't know the reason. Yes, I think they're have different mechanism.

429
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:38,540
So for this diabetes, they just have the tendency to lower the glucose levels.

430
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,650
So some about the risk factor in that.

431
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:51,080
Zone as for the people on the laser so they maybe have a little tolerance to the altitude so.

432
00:52:53,360 --> 00:53:06,860
You know, because I see a low oxygen levels can come in to increase muscle capillary density.

433
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:10,550
So maybe it's because it's not sure.

434
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:14,299
Well, the heart uses a lot of oxygen, right?

435
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,870
And it's like sort of an obligate oxidizer of mostly fatty acids.

436
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:22,250
So anything that impairs the ability of the heart to. I think that's what your point is.

437
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:22,420
Right.

438
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:27,350
So if you're in a hypoxic environment, the heart is always going to work a little bit worse, which is probably why heart failure is more common.

439
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:47,400
Thank you. Okay.

440
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,880
All right. So my question overall is here.

441
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:59,010
So this decision about whether or not you're going to you're going to undergo further oxidation or pyruvate is really determined by arginine.

442
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:08,640
So the way I sort of think about this is imagine this being bottom lock part B dehydrogenase step, which again is PHC on the side, right?

443
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:12,100
Not having to shut everything out towards lactate and Alan Right.

444
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:17,340
You sort of can't get into the tissues, right? So that's why you get lactic acid build over pages.

445
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,900
So mediation of course is a super, super important enzyme.

446
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:25,860
So it's also an incredibly complicated enzyme. This is sort of what the structure of it looks like.

447
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:31,890
It's got all these different subunits that are sort of passing some parts of the reaction to each other for the whole reaction to occur.

448
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,469
It's got a whole bunch of cofactors and substrates.

449
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:41,610
So what I mean by that is proteins are made of amino acids, but quite often they need other groups attach them to help with with catalysis.

450
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:49,360
And so there's a bunch of these for example here during the reaction you need to enter converting and I'm sorry in any tuning.

451
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:52,720
Yeah that made into an appendage according to Coy.

452
00:54:53,040 --> 00:55:00,410
So all of these are cofactor for the target dehydrogenase complex and it turns out a lot of these are all one are derived from whiteners.

453
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:05,670
So not only are they cofactors, but there are cofactors that we obligate we have to consume through our diet.

454
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:15,120
These include B1, B2, B3. And so one of the most well-studied vitamins is B1, also known as thiamin.

455
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:24,839
So it is one of these cofactors in the form of only pyrophosphate right here, and it is essential for a whole bunch of processes.

456
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:29,530
But the most important thing it's important for is maintaining the function of Sandpiper Androgen.

457
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:35,850
Right. As you can imagine, if you didn't have sufficient amount of thiamin, your heartbeat dehydrogenase would not work as effectively,

458
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:42,720
and that is known in disease status as either beriberi or more, of course, incontinence.

459
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:47,880
Those are the two names for what turns out to be effectively a very similar disease.

460
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:50,670
So the causes are a little bit different between the two.

461
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:58,290
So beriberi was largely caused by a dietary thiamin deficiency and this was first discovered during when food started becoming refined and processed.

462
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:05,460
People were unintentionally removing things like the wheat germ from brown rice and

463
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,569
unintentionally inducing thymine division because it was only part of the Whole Foods.

464
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:16,049
So that's what Mary Berry is now working. Cortical syndrome is functionally the same, but driven by a different mechanism.

465
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:24,360
So this was largely identified in chronic alcoholics, largely in Russia, and that's because chronic alcoholism can impair thiamin uptake.

466
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:31,950
Right. So you might be getting plenty of dietary thiamin from your diet, but your gut can no longer transport it because of the central nutrient.

467
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:36,080
You can't get it from your gut and therefore systemically you have a timing deficiency, right?

468
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:39,960
So in both cases you end up with a thymine deficiency is sort of what is the rationale for it.

469
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:47,280
Now there are several symptoms to both working course cough and very varied include lactic acid pathway build up and high Oakwood cardiac failure,

470
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,489
which is sort of like the heart not being able to pump as effectively exercise intolerance

471
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:55,110
or really exhaustion and then some neurodegenerative things such as confusion,

472
00:56:55,110 --> 00:57:00,540
numbness and reflexes, you know, with a little hammer thinking you put on your your your, your, your elbow, whatever.

473
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:03,839
So those are all things long term, especially for one thing. Of course.

474
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:07,620
Of course, because again, this is associated with long term alcoholism.

475
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:09,220
You can get your degeneration prime.

476
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:14,550
So that's the main phenotype associated with that and that's associated with all sorts of neurodegenerative diseases.

477
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:19,020
So what I want you guys to do is get together to groups and I want you to try to

478
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:23,639
connect what we learned already about feeding age and from glucose metabolism,

479
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:28,799
lactate, pyruvate, and how this might result in some of these things, such as exercise,

480
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:33,660
intolerance, numbness and neurodegeneration and what you pass through that.

481
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:38,610
I want you to try to figure out, excuse me how you would treat these effects if somebody came across and you figured out,

482
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:42,449
well, I think this person either has very, very or tachycardia cough.

483
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:47,700
How would I treat them? Would I treat them the same? Would there be a difference between so again, a severe trigger first.

484
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:55,690
So just to prove it and then we'll spend about ten, 15 minutes talking through and again, I'll circling around in case you guys have any questions.

485
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:11,600
Yeah. Yeah. Fact, I can't.

486
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:25,440
I just want you to see my deficiencies, not to be.

487
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:31,330
I think these French professors should be afraid.

488
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:37,100
Oh, yeah. I always try to stop it.

489
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:42,290
Everyone seems to be coming at me.

490
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:53,650
So I was supposed to use my.

491
00:58:56,050 --> 00:59:07,320
I think he's just put our initials. I don't mean like 15 minutes coming up with what some people did.

492
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:20,060
I am glad I am off and impressed by the footage. But also quite often it's like second because like this is you not part of the process.

493
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:24,820
I mean, I think it's going to be late, of course, if we go here.

494
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:43,500
I have to always cover more because what's your take on behind closed doors like there's a breakdown in M.O. so far is about baseball.

495
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:46,210
I think it's something I don't know.

496
00:59:46,840 --> 01:00:13,470
But you can reasonably expect that something like this is going to determine whether or not there's somebody else.

497
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:28,650
Oh, that's frightening. That very similar to what I told my husband before.

498
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:49,379
I must admit, I just didn't think it was going to get them to do anything because, you know, we are talking about somebody.

499
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:55,500
Okay. Well, I guess we could say maybe the best word, the street.

500
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,200
Okay. I believe it.

501
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:18,450
Now, it's the last one of the last five or 6 hours and 48 hours because I was trying to find out about black despising clubs like it was because,

502
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:25,950
like you said, it was specifically what he was supposed to do with these complex things.

503
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:36,240
There's this stuff was there and stuff like that.

504
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:42,270
I'm sorry. I don't know that that makes it doesn't really matter.

505
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:57,560
But I think it's interesting to see what is going on.

506
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:07,490
So. I think so, yeah.

507
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:29,470
I mean around the time, you know, so I think he's trying to say it, but I feel I don't know that,

508
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:41,550
you know, it's kind of like literally what the what they tell you.

509
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:51,690
Yeah. I don't know. Oh, I think just something like that, you know, just what was that like?

510
01:02:51,830 --> 01:03:03,600
You know, you get that you would have a lot of, you know, so I think you know.

511
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,070
So, yeah.

512
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:30,900
But you're saying that that is one thing about the city, the number of people that you know you just think it's it's you don't all the by product.

513
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:43,820
Yeah so I think you can feel so then if you don't have an H you're not doing any vitamin B, things like that.

514
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:50,490
Whereas in person they are you can see where people are in the city.

515
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:59,020
That's when you're not going. In September of that year.

516
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:12,130
I think you were getting this type of foreign language so that I could get transferred to another state exercise.

517
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:19,640
Say it is as a carrier like any age category and all of that.

518
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:39,760
So if you're not using the location, you're not allowed to go in with an inside job at any time.

519
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:51,040
There's a reason to worry about that. It's the use of drugs, which mostly is in Scientology.

520
01:04:51,730 --> 01:05:04,290
Let's see what I'm saying.

521
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:16,830
And I'm not going to make sense why you would like to do something.

522
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:22,490
Yeah, you had. So you but, you know, some exercises.

523
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:31,600
Right. So I want to know what it takes to offer to take control.

524
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:37,030
So I guess this is probably pretty good. Only one consideration.

525
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:49,110
The other considerations that you made about, even though you're like a that's not really around.

526
01:05:49,210 --> 01:06:02,060
What were you talking about? The only thing I think you should probably start like, you know, and then I think I mean,

527
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:13,920
is that it's important that you just have to get past this week and realize you're my only example.

528
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:22,780
Again, like I think it would be like you need to know how to survive.

529
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:33,890
I'm sorry. I think that's like overall to me.

530
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:41,990
I think I would, you know.

531
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:48,000
I know. Yeah, I.

532
01:06:49,500 --> 01:07:05,379
I know. I just. Like I said, I was trying to argue about what the government is going to look like.

533
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:16,270
Did you get the, you know, the Society for Performance Entertainment Films and spend two more minutes on this?

534
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:20,020
Well, I never do know just everything. Oh, yeah.

535
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:45,940
You never me how to treat everybody. I think it's just don't do anything about it, but it's obviously clinical trials like that's a positive program.

536
01:07:47,540 --> 01:08:03,810
And like, really, I'm not going to tell you how to clean the muscles.

537
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:29,530
You get to do something that's not something like, okay, so in the case of energy or something like that, I just you're right.

538
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:33,309
You know, that's the thing.

539
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:37,130
Let's put it. I guess that's just what it would be on again.

540
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:41,210
Yeah. All right.

541
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:54,290
I mean, don't you want to know if you like this kind of stuff?

542
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:58,860
But that's what I mean. I feel like you're going to do.

543
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:07,540
It's like, oh, my God, how are the results like?

544
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:12,150
It's like the girls are huge.

545
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:19,250
I don't think so.

546
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:36,710
I know your mom and I have to excuse me because I was a waiter.

547
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:43,730
Okay. So I'm going to move on to the last few slides here.

548
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,160
I guess a couple general things.

549
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:54,110
I've heard this kind of come around a couple times to come up tomorrow in class two for many, many alcohol related disease states.

550
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:57,709
The obvious solution is to tell a person, stop drinking, that's fine,

551
01:09:57,710 --> 01:10:00,830
probably would work, but we have to have a little bit of caution around that, right.

552
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:07,069
Like we talked about how hard it is to lose weight. You're a chronic alcoholic. Stopping drinking is also not right, so that probably would work.

553
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:14,510
But I would like you to kind of come up with a backup plan under the presumption that that may not work out depending on how addicted that person is.

554
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:19,400
Okay. So I'm going to go ahead. You're going to go this I'm going to skip through like a whole bunch of slides.

555
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:24,980
But there's a couple of things that I sort of wanted to go through and make sure we hit on in the last sentence.

556
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:30,050
Okay. So once you get through primary dehydrogenase, you've got a subtle way and a subtle is kind of another,

557
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:34,460
as I said, another decision point and a sort of waking goal often become a whole bunch of different things.

558
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:38,540
So again, we're talking about this decision at some point you walk into the TCA sucks.

559
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,510
But I just wanted to point out there are subtle ways we can become a bunch of different

560
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:45,379
things and you can imagine a different scenario where that a subtle quote is being derived,

561
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:50,150
say, from fatty acid oxidation or maybe consumption of a lot of chemicals.

562
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:56,420
But you don't have energy demand and you want to divert that a subtle point into something else, maybe a more other story form.

563
01:10:56,430 --> 01:10:59,870
So the way it works is the key factor for whether acetylcholine is going to get

564
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:04,790
oxidized is actually the presence of this molecule right here called oxide,

565
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:06,739
low acetate or O a.

566
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:13,790
And so it turns out if you plenty of books are low acetate and you need energy, you're going to the to right to go through that cycle.

567
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:21,530
You'll make up too many of the H and too many BPH if you have alcohol acetate but you do not need energy, you will not go through the TCA cycle.

568
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:25,460
As we'll talk about in a moment, the TCA cycle will be stopped if you have a buildup of energy.

569
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,020
So now you're going to divert it towards lipids, right?

570
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:33,889
So that's why if you consume a lot of calories from glucose, you don't just get a lot of glycogen.

571
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:37,520
Eventually that turns into fat. And of course, we'll talk about this a little bit, too.

572
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:43,340
If you do not have oxide of acetate, you're going to have what are known as ketone lines, right?

573
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,890
So this is what happens when accelerated is absent.

574
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:52,160
And ironically, not ironically, this actually only, only really seems to matter in a couple of tissues for our purposes.

575
01:11:52,160 --> 01:12:01,190
The most important one is the liver. And that's because if there's also acetate for the way to react with, there's nothing for that reaction to occur.

576
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:05,659
Right? So even if you want it to go in this direction, you're don't have enough of that, that particular intermediate.

577
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:08,930
And that's what would happen if you had substantial counterpart doses.

578
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:14,790
So Caterpillar ulcers and anaplasmosis are what happens when you have more or less things in the TCA side.

579
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:20,120
So this is I want to spend a minute on this because this can be a bit confusing with the TCA cycle.

580
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:26,689
You start with like sallow acetate, you go through the cycle, you make all these things and you finish with alcohol acetate, right?

581
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:31,310
This is not like glycolysis. You start glycolysis with glucose and you end up with not glucose.

582
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:36,500
Right? That's kind of the point since this is the cycle you start and you finish with the same number of things,

583
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:41,420
that means the number of any of these intermediates, if you just go through a reaction process comes in,

584
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:47,149
goes around, you end up you're not using up any of these molecules right in the way that if you go through glycolysis,

585
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:50,300
you're going to use up one six plus phosphate.

586
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:55,310
So that means you can either add to or remove from the TCA cycle.

587
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:57,840
That's what causes and a process in caterpillars.

588
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:04,730
If you start yanking things out of the TCA cycle for whatever reason, now there's less molecules in the TCA cycle.

589
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:07,430
So one common example of this is amino acid biogenesis.

590
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:13,790
So Luxardo has it the same way from the previous slide is actually the precursor for aspartame and respiratory.

591
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:17,620
So if you need written disparaging, you're going to pull this out of the TCA cycle.

592
01:13:18,050 --> 01:13:22,670
This is now Caterpillar, right? Right. Because now you have one less thing in the TCA cycle, right?

593
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:26,500
If you have less things in the TCR cycle, the reaction might start to occur, right?

594
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:30,770
This is also true for fatty acid biosynthesis where you pull up citrate, which is right here,

595
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:35,530
citric when it gets pulled out to make fatty acids, is also extremely catastrophic.

596
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:41,300
Right? So in those two cases, you would end up with the absence of alcohol acetate, right?

597
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:45,050
So if you end up with not enough of a loss to take because of too much kind of fluorosis.

598
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:48,950
Now, even if you once you've got a subtle go away for energy, you wouldn't be able to.

599
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:54,799
So the analogy I make for this is sort of train station, right? So think of the TCA cycle as a bunch of trains, right.

600
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:59,660
If you. Want the trains to run faster. Or if you want to get from point A to point B.

601
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:04,250
What you're doing here is you're putting more trains on the track, right? So that the trains are running faster.

602
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,590
But if you're undergoing anaplasmosis,

603
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:11,270
you're putting more trains on the tracks and your wait time is slower and you can get from point A to point B faster.

604
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:17,330
On the other hand, for example, if you try to take an hour transit after like 7:00 at night, you'll notice there are like no busses, right?

605
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:22,130
That's because they're taking all the trains off the track or in this case, the busses, so that the process is going to be really slow.

606
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:25,310
So that's one whole layer of regulation of the TSA.

607
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:28,740
Now, it may occur because you really needed to make some discouraging.

608
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:34,520
Right. So it's not always backed up. Right. Maybe the cells decided the demand for spare change is higher than the demand for energy.

609
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:39,060
And that's why you're undergoing this this kind of process. Okay.

610
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:43,820
If you're to have a plurality such that you have a lot of acetylcholine coming in

611
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:47,760
and this could be from glucose or in this diagram it's coming from fatty acids.

612
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:54,330
And you don't have enough oxide, low acetate, which is right here, because maybe you're pulling all that excited listeria to make amino acids.

613
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:59,370
What you end up doing is diverting the acetic away to something that are called ketone bodies.

614
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:04,110
Right. Acetone, acetic acid and beta hydroxybutyrate, those are shown over here.

615
01:15:04,410 --> 01:15:07,980
Right. So this is a diversion process because the acetylcholine can't be oxidized.

616
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:12,059
If you're breaking down fatty acids, probably no point to make more fatty acids.

617
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:17,040
Chances are you have enough fatty acids in the first plate, right? So that a subtle way gets diverted is ketone bodies.

618
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:21,310
And then he told bodies can be used by other tissues as fuel instead of a subtle quick.

619
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:26,550
Because we can't just transport a subtle way out of the cell. It's got to get transport in the process of the chemical body.

620
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:32,400
So you might have heard of this in the context of diabetic ketoacidosis or in the context of ketogenic diet.

621
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:39,390
In both cases, that's what's happening, right? In both cases, either because of diabetic ketoacidosis or because somebody is on a ketogenic diet,

622
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:46,319
the flux of fatty acids coming in is exceeding the amount of solid acetate that's available in both of those two cases.

623
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:50,730
The reason that happens is because you're drawing out the of swallow acetate to make glucose.

624
01:15:50,970 --> 01:15:56,430
So I'll start with the ketogenic diet. A ketogenic diet is a diet that you're consuming less than 25 grams of glucose per day.

625
01:15:56,460 --> 01:16:02,220
So that's very low, which means your body, which still needs glucose, needs to make glucose through gluconeogenesis.

626
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:08,280
So every time it does that, it's pulling out of the TCA cycle, it's pulling Gonzalo acetate out to make glucose.

627
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:12,600
So it's an extremely catapult, chronic reaction because maintaining blood glucose is really important,

628
01:16:13,530 --> 01:16:18,630
but because that's happening now, they also want states not to be able to react with the stock away from the fatty acids.

629
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:21,330
Ketogenic diet also involves really high fat diets.

630
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:28,620
So therefore you get a buildup of these ketone and that's that's why they're in ketoacidosis in type one diabetes or type two diabetes.

631
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:32,640
That's a similar kind of process as we'll talk about in two classes.

632
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:35,100
Insulin suppresses gluconeogenesis.

633
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:41,550
So if you don't have insulin action either because you don't have insulin because you're type one or you don't need insulin action as you're type two,

634
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:44,580
you're again going to have unrestrained can go to your genitals.

635
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:49,890
As it turns out, you're also going to have unrestrained lipolysis, which is also suppressed by consent, right?

636
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:55,620
So in both cases, what's happening is a caterpillar erotic reaction coupled by a supply of fatty acids.

637
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:58,800
And in both cases, you get a buildup of ketone bodies.

638
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:04,440
All right. And this is just shown here with a study where they looked at fasting in a way that we would never be allowed to do these days,

639
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:09,300
where they fasted men for like up to 40 days. And you can see the first thing that happened is their glucose dropped.

640
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:13,290
But then after it dropped, it was able to stay stable because you were saving the glucose,

641
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:16,860
fatty acids elevated and he took bodies really, really dramatically.

642
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:22,620
All right. So this can happen with both the ketogenic diet, which is just a little diet for carbohydrates or just starvation,

643
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:25,620
which is functionally also a loss of dietary carbohydrate.

644
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:33,210
And these are the structures of the three key analyzes, ironically, only one of which is actually a ketone.

645
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:39,030
Okay. So I'm going to skip ahead to one other thing that I want to sort of mention here in this discussion,

646
01:17:39,690 --> 01:17:42,809
because the last thing I want to mention is this idea of efficiency.

647
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:47,250
So we talked about efficiency sort of at the beginning in terms of how much energy can you get out of it.

648
01:17:48,150 --> 01:17:52,860
And then we talked about efficiency a little bit in terms of hypoxia,

649
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:58,500
and that's why we have more glucose disposal because you're burning glucose in a sort of inefficient manner because my box here.

650
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:04,610
But there's a third way that we can have inefficiency. And that's why intentional uncoupling of the electron transport chains.

651
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:09,810
So we all have these proteins that are called uncoupling proteins, this uncoupling protein, number one.

652
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:16,470
So as we undergo the electron transport chain, we generate this proton gradient where there's a lot of protons right here,

653
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:25,790
you see one intentionally just relieves that proton gradient, so just lets the proton back into the mitochondria without coupling it to ATP it.

654
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:30,900
So normally that proton gradient would drive ATP synthase, but if you have an elevation of UCP one,

655
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:35,129
you now are just alleviating that without generating ATP, right?

656
01:18:35,130 --> 01:18:40,740
So again, that's inefficiency, right? And this is what happens in brown fat and thermogenesis.

657
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:44,550
So for example, if you sat and you put your feet in a bucket of water for like half an hour,

658
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:47,010
you would start shivering and eventually would start generating heat.

659
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:51,420
This is how that heat is generated from certain cell types called brown adipocytes.

660
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:59,010
And if you look at a scan of somebody who was did that exact thing, they were put in a room where they had to hold their lower limbs in cold.

661
01:18:59,190 --> 01:19:05,849
You can see there's activation of these particles sort of around the inner scapular region and around the back, which are called brown fat depots.

662
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:09,240
So these depots are different than regular depots, which we call weight pattern folks,

663
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:15,540
and that their intentional role is to generate heat and they generate heat because they have a lot of this uncoupling protein.

664
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:20,010
And by how well it's uncoupling protein, it can basically burn through all that energy.

665
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:23,250
But instead of making ATP, it just releases that heat, right?

666
01:19:23,310 --> 01:19:27,690
So it's a very inefficient process, which is a way to increase energy expenditure.

667
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:32,340
So this has been a lot of people think this is really, really going to be potentially therapeutic,

668
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:37,950
useful because you could just give it to somebody give a pill that activated brown adipose tissue and that would induce.

669
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:42,380
Energy expenditure and thermogenesis. But you are all smart enough to know that will never work.

670
01:19:42,830 --> 01:19:46,520
Because what'll happen is you'll increase your energy expenditure and you'll just adapt

671
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,910
by eating more food because that's what happens when people increase their energies.

672
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:52,940
So even though there's a lot of drug companies that are interested in this,

673
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:59,750
I have extremely little faith that this is going to work unless it's coupled with dietary control, which is sort of polymorphisms.

674
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:06,890
Okay, so that's all I have for the TCA cycle. Again, I appreciate that these two lectures were sort of the most biochemical complicated lectures.

675
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:10,100
They are the two most biochemically complicated lectures of the entire year.

676
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:13,790
So don't worry, it does not get worse from here. We're all going. We're already on the downhill.

677
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:18,600
This is, I think, like all of us. But and again, we have two weeks until the midterms.

678
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:23,210
So like I said, five with you this come find us. These are all we're going to have on the panel.
