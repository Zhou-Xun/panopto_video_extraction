1
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:15,410
Yeah. 34. The only thing that.

2
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:47,600
Everybody. So a couple of things before we get started today.

3
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:56,990
One, was everybody able to sign up? I saw six sign ups yesterday, last evening for a date, but we're still doing their presentation.

4
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,040
Everybody all right? I'll create a schedule based on that.

5
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:07,040
Now, you know, post on the website and, you know, go to the rest of the semester.

6
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,730
I want to direct your attention to some things that I've put on the canvass site.

7
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:21,530
Okay. See that? So if you notice here,

8
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:30,500
there's a quiz coming up in September 16th and it'll cover the information that we're went over in the innate and adaptive immunity lectures,

9
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,370
and I will post that in Canada.

10
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:43,850
So it will be done through the canvas quiz portion of the of the website canvas quizzes.

11
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:52,880
So you'll see pretty soon a flag on that in the lower hand, right hand corner over here that there's a quiz coming up.

12
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:00,650
The next thing is a reference textbook I mentioned on the first day of class about a reference text,

13
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,629
and I was trying to get the connection through the library and that was kind of wonky.

14
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:14,930
That was really good. And then I found out that because I'm part of some group in terms of things that they give you,

15
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:21,440
being a part of a group of researchers that I could download this textbook for free and I did that.

16
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,040
So this is the ninth edition of the Jane Wade's Immunobiology book.

17
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,660
It's very detailed,

18
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:36,950
and it can serve as a reference for information that can back up some of the things we're talking about in this class and that's here.

19
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,360
So you can download that and have your own copy here. Okay.

20
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,360
It's the ninth edition. The newest addition that came out recently was the 10th edition.

21
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:53,360
But we can download for free. It's not that out of date it's published 2018, so still a very good resource.

22
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:00,170
Okay, anything else before we get started today? All right.

23
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:09,410
So I want this to be interactive. And I have I have questions that you should be able to answer.

24
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,160
I'm going to give a brief introduction to this paper.

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,550
Resistance like molecule provides vitamin dependent anti-microbial protection in the skin.

26
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:28,160
It was published recently in the journal Cell Host Microbe and it is very extensive and is very

27
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:35,360
serves as a great model in terms of how you test the hypothesis using different model systems.

28
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:42,830
So let's just go over some of the basics, the background information before we jump into the paper now.

29
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:50,870
So this is an illustration of the microbiota in the surface of the skin.

30
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,520
And you can see you have all kinds of different organisms.

31
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:04,610
You have bacteria, you have fungi, and you have some viruses that are floating around and not only on the surface of the skin,

32
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:15,079
but within the sweat glands, within the the hair shaft and within the sebaceous glands.

33
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:22,460
Here that plays a role in the growth of this hair in this particular cell.

34
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:32,240
So this is the the epithelial surface surfaces that are exposed to all of these organisms.

35
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,670
And they have they play of this plays a particularly important role in the

36
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,380
barrier the host defense the first barrier of host defense against infection.

37
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:53,240
So these organisms now have a profound impact on those innate immune responses on the surface of the skin.

38
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:01,010
And depending on your status, your age, your nutritional status,

39
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:08,270
your exposure to different types of organisms, it can affect your susceptibility to having an infection.

40
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:17,270
So it says in the very bottom caption here, talking about the microbiota, educating the innate immune system.

41
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:24,890
And we're going to see how this occurs in regard to the production of antimicrobial peptides.

42
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:34,940
Okay. So just as an introduction to what antimicrobial peptides are, these proteins are really fascinating.

43
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:44,090
There are three different groups that are mentioned in this paper, the capital of science, the s100 proteins and embedded defenses.

44
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:54,800
And these proteins now are secreted by different cell types.

45
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:02,180
And this is an example of, in the very first portion here, a catalyst site.

46
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:09,470
So the catalyst side is this helix shaped protein molecule looks like a spring.

47
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,860
You ought to look at its its structure.

48
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:24,010
And when you're exposed to infectious agents or an inflammatory insult, you get an upregulation of gene transcription.

49
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,170
And this story, it's retinal aid which gives you Realm Alpha.

50
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:38,380
And in this particular example, you have an upregulation of the gene that transcribes the Protein Catalyst site.

51
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:46,600
So along with this upregulation you get serine proteases that can process this particular protein,

52
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,770
giving you the mature peptide that's secreted in a cell.

53
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:56,500
And how does the antimicrobial peptide actually participate in host events?

54
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,530
Well, it has these positively and negatively charged cytokines.

55
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:11,230
And in this particular figure, you see that you have negatively charged side chains that are facing away.

56
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:18,160
So that's the whole hydrophobic side. And the hydrophilic side is is in blue here.

57
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:32,290
These are positively charged, hydrophilic and hydrophobic, and they align themselves within the lipid bilayer of microorganisms.

58
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,609
In the case that we're studying,

59
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:44,770
it's going to be Staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes and they form pores within the surface of the bacteria, causing them to lice.

60
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:51,070
Their intracellular components leak out and the cells, those bacteria die as a consequence.

61
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:58,360
There are other classes that are mentioned. The s100 proteins were a little bit different and they actually,

62
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:08,590
when they're upregulated by the same type of stimuli you get, you know, these are different classes of 100 proteins.

63
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:17,110
They form different structures that can actually attach themselves to one another and to the

64
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:24,010
surface of a microorganism and form these channels that are really effective in killing bacteria.

65
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:34,150
Okay. And this is all based on the charge of the different portions of the antimicrobial peptides and the surface charge of the bacteria.

66
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:47,220
And then finally there's another class of antimicrobial peptides that are on the beta dispensers, and this is the beta sheet example.

67
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,960
So they don't they don't have the same amount of the amino acids that form these structures,

68
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:05,790
but they're still able to associate with the membrane and the surface of bacteria and insert themselves into the bacterial membrane causing lysis.

69
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:16,740
So all of these can cause bacterial lysis when they're upregulated in response to vexatious or inflammatory stimuli.

70
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:24,180
You know, potentially these could cause inflammation to a host cell,

71
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:33,000
but your host cells express certain proteins that protect you against self antimicrobial lysis from from these types of peptides.

72
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:38,580
And that's another story for another day. But let's just focus on their antibacterial properties here.

73
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:50,950
Okay. So I threw out this definition here and you can see that slide and put it to the side so you can go back and refer to these different acronyms.

74
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:59,890
So I'm going to be going back and forth here now so that we are understanding what the figure captions might mean.

75
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:11,350
So the first question I have for you in this presentation is vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased susceptibility to skin infections.

76
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:18,100
What are the barriers against infections of the skin that might be affected by vitamin D status?

77
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:55,790
Anybody want to answer that question? So this is this ability to signal for the transcription of proteins that have these microbial properties.

78
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,350
Yeah. Yes. Yeah. That that's certainly part of it.

79
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:10,000
And that's what the focus of this particular paper was. So you have now the different barriers to infection here.

80
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,290
You have the the physical barrier, the epidermis. You have the commensal organisms.

81
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:20,440
You have fatty acids and antimicrobial peptides. And it's the antimicrobial peptides, which is the focus of this paper.

82
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:28,900
There are other studies that have looked at the type junctions that are formed between epithelial cells and the epithelial surface.

83
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:36,850
And vitamin E seems to be important in that as well. Okay.

84
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:52,620
So the next slide looks at the staph aureus applied to the surface of germ free mice, and they looked at the retina le gene.

85
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:57,250
This is the gene that is responsible for the protein,

86
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:06,370
the real output and the transcript level or abundance here is measured in this particular figure.

87
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,560
So, I mean, have you seen Heatmaps about before? Have you discussed Heatmaps?

88
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:24,010
So here's germ free mice. So there's a facility here at the university and another place, places where mice are housed in a clean facility.

89
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:29,110
Everything has been treated such that there are no microorganisms present.

90
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:37,510
So everything is the food is treated by irradiation and is kept in a sterile compartment.

91
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:48,100
The bedding, the housing is is treated in such a way that there is nothing there that can affect an inflammatory response.

92
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,330
And as you can imagine, it's expensive to maintain these facilities.

93
00:12:53,140 --> 00:13:01,660
And when you go in and out of these facilities to care for the mice, you have to wear a whole body PPE suit so that you don't infect the area.

94
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:11,110
So using this as kind of a way to determine whether or not the microbial surface or the microbes

95
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:19,870
affect the expression of a different genes responsible for this innate immune response in the skin.

96
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:29,800
They compared germ free mice with mice that had been infected now with the snap aureus.

97
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:38,400
And they took a sample of the skin and they looked for the abundance of transcripts.

98
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:46,150
And this is the message for these different proteins that they think are related to innate host effects.

99
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:51,100
And the top hit here that they're showing is this retinal aging.

100
00:13:51,670 --> 00:14:02,120
Okay. So it just as a reference when you're looking at these heatmaps red indicates an upregulation.

101
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,510
Green indicates a downregulation.

102
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:13,330
And the dark squares that don't have very much of a color would indicate that there's might be no difference from a reference sample.

103
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:24,630
Okay. So then they looked at the scan itself and they're looking here for a protein now.

104
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:34,020
So they've taken a section of the skin and they have probed it with antibodies that have a flaw for in this case, it's red.

105
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:45,180
And they're looking for the expression of protein running in the surface of the skin and the epidermis and then the sebaceous glands.

106
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:52,320
That's the again, the gland that is responsible for secreting things in the surface of the skin.

107
00:14:53,310 --> 00:15:06,720
And they find here that there's a high level of expression in the surface of the sebaceous glands and then the epidermis, and then this blues stain.

108
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,340
Here is the AP Derby is a nuclear stain.

109
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,960
So if you see these blue images, these blue dots, that's the nuclei of the cells.

110
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:21,210
What's typically gone done and when you're looking at immunofluorescence images

111
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:27,240
is they overlay that the dapi stain with some kind of a color indicator.

112
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:35,819
And here when you overlay and you can find the red, the cells are now and you can see that here, the nuclei of the cells,

113
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,830
of the sebaceous glands and in the epidermis and you see that,

114
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:47,010
oh they're expressed outside of the nucleus and the surface of the cells in both of these tissues.

115
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:56,100
And they also did the same experiment now with human skin.

116
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:02,909
And so they're looking at the same kind of a thing within the skin itself and with the and within the epidermis.

117
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:11,610
Now, and in this case, the human version of this antimicrobial peptide is this resistant molecule has a different name,

118
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:22,770
but it has the same kind of function in humans. Here's the dapi stain and here's the localization of of resistance within human skin.

119
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:37,860
And then finally, as proof, they do this technique called fluorescence in situ hybridization that all the way down here, so you can see it.

120
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:49,080
So they're showing the RNA, they're showing the protein, and they're showing this fluorescence in situ hybridization.

121
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:59,820
And basically they're locating the cells now that are producing this written a protein.

122
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:09,900
And you're looking here now at a transcript again for genes that are responsible for expressing the antimicrobial peptide.

123
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:13,470
So why did they do that? Why do you think they had to do this?

124
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:24,390
Well, this is protein. Isn't that enough proof? Do proteins stay put or do they migrate or they can move all over your tissues and cells?

125
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,700
They move around. Yeah.

126
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:35,940
So if you want to, if you want a definitive stain that can tell you, yes, it's these cells indeed that are producing eccentric peptides.

127
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:42,209
You do this, whereas it's in situ hybridization. It's I've not done it, but I've been told it.

128
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,740
It's very tricky technique. It's difficult, technically difficult to get that to work.

129
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:53,150
Okay. So any questions so far?

130
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,040
All right. Here's a question to you. So here's figure one.

131
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:09,920
Figure one. The authors mention the use of germ free con d and or r d, I should say, and comedy l mice.

132
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,300
Why were these animals selected in the experiments shown in Figure One,

133
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,190
and what was the impact of the different types of mice in the retinal expression?

134
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:26,100
Okay. Yeah.

135
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:35,280
Abby. I don't know if this is right, but I think they chose this with a different price to see it different,

136
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:43,889
starting from 30 minutes for the bacteria to grow and then to see what the reaction is to the production of the bacteria.

137
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:48,750
And what they found is that it doesn't matter the length of time of the same material,

138
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,810
you're still going to get the same or similar amounts of growth.

139
00:18:52,530 --> 00:19:01,230
So why do they use germ free versus they're looking here in the figure be germ free and then a staph aureus?

140
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:06,810
What what are they measuring there? You're like a.

141
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,750
It's like a baseline. Minister since you're starting to.

142
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:19,560
To obscure the background. Yeah, well, we're not we're not looking at bacterial growth here.

143
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:28,340
Yes, that's that's the question later. But what have what's the what's, um, what's on the gene expression?

144
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:37,440
Gene expression. Right. So the gene that transcribes the real matter is upregulated once you apply staph aureus on the germ free mice.

145
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,790
Yeah. Any question? I still don't get what you guys doing. Really?

146
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,340
Put that real numbers doing that. What's the significance?

147
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:52,320
Well, alpha is the antimicrobial peptide and retina le is a gene responsible for that about peptide.

148
00:19:52,350 --> 00:20:02,640
Okay. All right. So now they did the same experiment except that they have this.

149
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,300
This can't be D and kinda l and germ free mice.

150
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:12,470
So what what's going on here? Yeah.

151
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,600
So they started with the germ free mice and then they just some I mean,

152
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:24,020
just normal microbiological microbiome just three months or four days before date.

153
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:28,640
The conventional is just they were just foreign grown as.

154
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,970
It's the second year. So was. Yeah.

155
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:44,050
So they just took the mice and put them in a conventional facility for four days enough time to induce due to that retinal aging.

156
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,360
And all of these mice are in a controlled diet where there's sufficient amount of vitamin D in their diet.

157
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:57,790
That's part of their food pellet. And that's a lot of science behind the appropriate diet for mice to study.

158
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:02,320
Okay. So there's plenty of vitamin D that they can get from their food source,

159
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:09,129
but it isn't until that they're exposed to an environment where there's microbes around,

160
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,130
that they get this increase in the expression of this particular gene.

161
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,200
And then this is just conventional versus a germ free facility.

162
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:24,189
So here that notes four days conventional facility and then the expression of

163
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:31,150
retinal increases with exposure to staph aureus over here and commensal microbiota.

164
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:40,230
Okay. So here's Figure two.

165
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:46,200
The authors tested the ability of recombinant brown proteins to kill bacteria in vitro.

166
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:54,810
And the first question is, were realme, alpha and human realme equally effective in killing different types of bacteria?

167
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,280
Let's start here. Equally effective.

168
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:07,690
Yeah. So let me explain this graph. So they take streptococcus pyogenes and they grow to mid log phase.

169
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:12,360
So bacterial and you grow it up. In culture, it grows slowly.

170
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,870
And then all of a sudden it shoots up and then it plateaus.

171
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:27,630
And they took up a portion of this culture, and they exposed it to these different antimicrobial peptides at different concentrations.

172
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,970
So you can see at this concentration here we have about two and a half micron molar.

173
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:38,670
It wiped out everything. Okay. So that they're for streptococcus progeny.

174
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:44,160
Yeah. You know, they're working about the same in terms of their ability to kill that organism.

175
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,450
What about here? What's this?

176
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:59,210
Go ahead. So I don't think they were as equally the same for gram positive versus gram negative.

177
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:07,050
Yeah. Yeah. So here we have her alpha and here we have the human record antimicrobial peptide.

178
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:14,970
And we're seeing here that the percent SKUs remaining were a bit different.

179
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:25,680
And what's what's distracting me in this particular figure is the Y axis is a little bit different in the different portions of the figure.

180
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:33,990
So there's two things going on here. There's 100% to 0%, and this goes from 0 to 40, which is, okay,

181
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,280
if you gave me the same scale, it would be a lot easier for me to see these differences.

182
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:44,040
Anyhow, here's gram negative bacteria and here's gram positive bacteria.

183
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:52,260
Like I said, it's more effective for human form, but more effective than the mouse for killing gram positive bacteria.

184
00:23:53,040 --> 00:24:05,430
And there's differences here in the amount of the bacteria remaining in these everything and that's original is killed.

185
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:10,350
Secret enzyme itself is a bug that inhabits the gut of mice.

186
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:25,530
So we get 15% about here and this is like 25% remaining and then like 12, about 35% for the mouse strain and about 55%.

187
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:31,590
So there are some differences in terms of the effectiveness of the mouse version of the human antimicrobial peptide.

188
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:37,530
And then in the next portion of the figure, they talk about something else.

189
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:46,470
So that gets to the next question. Are the bacteria now defenseless against these antimicrobial peptides?

190
00:24:51,470 --> 00:25:05,490
And see here. So here's the same relationship percents that same bacteria remain.

191
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,050
And here's the dose response, real mouthful.

192
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:14,340
And they're in the human antimicrobial peptide.

193
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:22,080
And they're having they have two different types of bacteria here, the wild type.

194
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,830
And then something else, this delta CRT.

195
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:31,820
What's the difference there? Yeah.

196
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:36,560
And I think they also see our team as warriors.

197
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,370
Uh, doesn't have that as a team.

198
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,810
Yeah, the SEC's the top tier, so I'd have to point out later.

199
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,260
Yeah. There it is. Yes. Yeah.

200
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:55,640
So it's been knocked out, which makes them really susceptible to killing from this animal called the peptides.

201
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:03,140
So evolutionarily there's been competition between the host and the infected agent going on for.

202
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:15,800
Okay. We develop, um, host defense mechanisms against infection and they develop mechanisms against our host defense mechanisms to survive.

203
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:22,700
So it's like a survival of the fittest as competition between the host and the infected agent.

204
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:27,500
And this toxin now resists killing.

205
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:37,850
Okay, the last part of the figure, um, the last part of the figure looks at so yes.

206
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:45,050
So sets the toxin is required for persistence. And the last part of the what was the purpose of these experiments down here.

207
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:59,780
Die. Or at least what were they looking at here? Yeah.

208
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:10,140
Kind of like other internet groups. That type of thing is rolling out our business and can also make some for today.

209
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:20,750
Bacterial cell membranes? Yes. Like the D and E, they just meaning some kind of microbial, like with the membrane using different things.

210
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:28,230
Yeah. They just use this to measure how much time was released by it played a role of.

211
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:41,310
Right. And then also afterwards, I think they just measure some some other bugs and then some also some membrane improvements.

212
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,720
Oh, God. And then they just had those all planned it.

213
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:54,430
You can see that those in Permian they can get into that those microbes.

214
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:05,920
Yeah. So. So here you have a proof of concept that we're actually forming pores and lacing Olympic bilayer or allowing devices to occur.

215
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:13,910
So they created this artificial system. They have this lipid bilayer, and they add the antimicrobial peptide in zero and five.

216
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,239
And you're seeing an increase of this dye release.

217
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:24,020
Like you said, dye comes out, you get this color signal, and then they have this control, this gee, control, what was that?

218
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:32,510
You may remember the OG control ones controls are really important for all kinds of reasons, and particularly in this particular experiment.

219
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:46,640
So Dye is leaking out and then when you apply this OG compound, you get almost a 100% release of the dye in terms of this percent of max response.

220
00:28:48,530 --> 00:29:02,960
But that was. The detergent so detergents we use soap disrupts lipid by layers and it laced the bilayer and letting all the dye to leak out.

221
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:07,700
So that's like the 100% response.

222
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:13,640
So the next set of experiments, that's where they establish the max.

223
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,770
So that PSI release now is in relation to this positive control.

224
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:24,650
So they take different concentrations of alpha and they get this dye release.

225
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:31,879
So you can find from here, you know, what was the most of what was the current,

226
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:37,220
the least amount of concentration of the antimicrobial peptide to give you this response?

227
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:45,470
And then so this is done in an artificial system, and then they do it in real organisms here,

228
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:51,890
and they have a time curve on the x axis and they have concentrations corresponding to the different colors.

229
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:58,429
And they're looking at the release or the uptake of pretty iodide.

230
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:07,130
So when a cell is living, it won't take up this stain when it's killed by a disruption of the membrane.

231
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:11,120
The dye goes into the cell, it stains the nuclei, gives you a signal.

232
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:17,000
So higher concentration, you're getting more leakage of that stain into the cell.

233
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,000
And this is the time course in which this process occurs.

234
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:29,830
So the realm that these anti-microbial peptides, they kill bacteria,

235
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:37,870
different bacteria are susceptible to this mechanisms of killing the organism has a way of defending itself against this.

236
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:44,800
Let's get a response or this agent and it occurs by membrane lysis.

237
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:50,830
That's what we learn from this particular set of experiments. Okay.

238
00:30:54,070 --> 00:31:05,290
Here's some of those are more notes there. Okay. So then they get mice where they actually do not get off the gene for Bertinelli.

239
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:18,010
And so the mice can't produce real mouthful and so so the authors assess the impact of rum alpha deficiency on skin and take on microbiomes.

240
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:22,520
And what did they find? Yeah.

241
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:29,690
The people microbiomes were similar, but the skin microbiomes are different.

242
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:45,200
Yeah. So this is a product of lots of assessment of the transcripts, and they come up with differences based on the profile.

243
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:49,520
Many different transcripts shown here in a and this way they say, okay,

244
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:53,420
they draw these Venn diagrams and these these wildtype and these retinal eye

245
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,680
knockout mice are different in in these particular this particular message,

246
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:07,600
they compare male and female mice. And here they're looking at streptococcus relative abundance.

247
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:14,830
And this is after they attacked the mice.

248
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:24,910
And they're finding that the knockout mice shown here in blue have a higher abundance of streptococcus on their surface,

249
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:33,370
of their skin and staphylococcus. And here's the male mice and here's the female mice in the blue bars of the knockouts.

250
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:37,750
The purple bar, the magenta bar. What color would you say that is?

251
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:43,720
Is that magenta or maroon? Magenta agenda is kind of halfway in between the two.

252
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:50,050
All right. So that makes sense. It's only got one, Leo, and it's not going to produce as much, but it's still there.

253
00:32:51,550 --> 00:33:02,560
So there's a higher abundance when you knock out the retinal achievement and then that figure B, they're looking at getting ahead of myself.

254
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:09,730
Yeah. Figure B, they're looking at the different classes of organisms in the wild types and the knockouts.

255
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:19,450
And lo and behold, they find some, some differences in the different classes of organisms that inhabit the animals,

256
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,250
and they find something interesting.

257
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:34,780
But over here they find that there's almost zero relative retinal expression in the colon and then the of the knockout mice.

258
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:44,830
So in the skin you see a lot of it. But in the colon there's, there's, there's not very much in the terms of retinal expression there in the gut.

259
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:51,850
Um, but you know, you see some of these differences in the microbiome in the skin just shows you there's,

260
00:33:52,330 --> 00:34:01,960
there's the retina la and realme alpha expression and the skin produces a very different profile of micro-organisms in the skin.

261
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:09,310
But in places in the body where it's not produced, you don't see very you're not going to see very much of a difference.

262
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:19,440
Okay. So and the question number five, antimicrobial peptides play an important role in host events.

263
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:30,030
What was the impact of Realme eight deficiency following infection with in this case, it's streptococcus pyogenes the one that causes strep throat.

264
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:39,100
Remember that from the last lecture? So what did they find here?

265
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:59,110
Yeah. So in the figure A and C like it was just on the surface and that he was into their whole thing.

266
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:05,049
So they just inoculated those. So that's why I was interested on this.

267
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:12,670
My sort of wondering if they're deficient in the problem of, uh, protein, they're more susceptible to.

268
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:19,680
So yeah. So when they infected the mice in the surface of the skin,

269
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:28,260
they took a piece of the skin and ground it up and grew what they they had higher bacterial counts in that knockouts and.

270
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:34,560
And when they injected it under the skin, like you said here, they see the same thing.

271
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:44,160
So they take a different organism and figure B here and they find some differences.

272
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:53,140
What were the differences? It's going to get the parents strain of staph aureus and they do the same thing.

273
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,560
They affect the skin. And what do they find? Is there a difference?

274
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,070
Between these two and knock out in the wild type.

275
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,850
Not a significant difference. No, there's not a difference.

276
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:16,720
And they already went through this here, the experiment here,

277
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:27,510
where they show you that an apparent strain on the ability of the antimicrobial peptide to kill staph aureus was impaired somewhat.

278
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:27,860
Right.

279
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:38,000
So when you knock it out and you actually infect animals and you compare the knockouts in the wild type with that organism, there's not a difference.

280
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:45,020
It's not until they get the strain that can't produce the X that you see a difference.

281
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:51,080
Okay. So different organisms are resistant to this mechanism of killing.

282
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:03,170
Okay. So question six.

283
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:10,230
How did the authors demonstrate that Vitamin A was required or is required for aroma expression?

284
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:14,550
Figure. Figure five. A through F or.

285
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,960
Just just break it down. What's going on in Figure five?

286
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:36,290
A First of all, what is that? It's predicted that no receptor.

287
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:48,820
And so these are response elements. And then you have that this is within the human right and promoter.

288
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:53,830
Okay, so what's that? What's that telling you?

289
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:06,100
In a promoter region within a gene that's going to be activated so the gene can be activated by certain stimuli.

290
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:15,460
And stimuli in this case is vitamin A and it binds to the transcription factor that binds to this promoter region.

291
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:25,270
And these are the different regions of the promoter that can bind to that transcription factor.

292
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:32,840
It's activated by vitamin D that can upregulate different things that are responding to the vitamin name.

293
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,930
In this case, it's retina. Right, right.

294
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:46,760
And I'm sorry. So the next figure, they take these this sebaceous cell line, okay?

295
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:57,700
And we know that within the spacious gland, they express quite a bit of this retina and both human and mice, and they do a number of experiments.

296
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:07,510
So in this set of experiments and figure five B, they're looking at relative retina and expression,

297
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:14,259
and you have a control condition where they're looking at relative retina expression at just baseline.

298
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:23,170
So they just have these cells in culture, no treatment. And those are the that's the bar that they get, that's their relative expression.

299
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:27,820
Then they culture with a certain dose of retinol.

300
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:35,630
And what do you see? What does that do? This year it is do.

301
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:46,240
The most expression, an increase, the expression, but not significantly, it's not significant.

302
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:55,790
So there's some variability there between the control condition and the cells treated with just retinol.

303
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:05,890
And then they have something that is, uh, pro-inflammatory stimulus, interleukin one beta.

304
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,830
This is a pro-inflammatory cytokines.

305
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:17,620
And when you culture cells with a certain concentration of the cytokine, it's going to upregulate the innate immune response.

306
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:26,170
And one of the genes that's activated from this particular inflammatory stimuli is this expression.

307
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:32,560
So it goes up and then. But it's not significant again or yes, it is.

308
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:42,250
That's a start. Yes, it is significant. Hey, no retinol. And then then you had retinol in culture and then they see this four fold increase.

309
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:55,719
So here's what you see. The, the control condition, um, not significant increase retinol, um, a significant increase with interleukin one data.

310
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:01,300
When you combine the two, you get a four fold increase in the expression of that gene.

311
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:12,220
Then to show that the retinol was responsible for that increase and not something else.

312
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:18,790
They add this particular agent, BMS 493.

313
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:25,210
What does that do? Yeah.

314
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:34,210
It's just an everyday of the best moment for me and it just for the show because those are receptor dependent.

315
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:39,310
Yeah it's the receptive retina is a retinol receptor dependent effect.

316
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:45,280
So you blocked the receptor you blocked the upregulation of Britney with that particular inhibitor.

317
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:50,230
So proof of concept. Okay. Experimental method.

318
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:58,750
Proof of concept. Highly artificial. And then they do these experiments which are really cool and definitive.

319
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,660
What did they show here in this figure five? See what?

320
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:15,190
Yeah. Um, as a nice ah, like more vitamin E there's less expression of right now.

321
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:22,880
Yeah. So why did it take 13 weeks to completely tabulate this response?

322
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:29,930
What do you know about vitamin D? It's a. Fat soluble vitamin.

323
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:34,760
Yeah. So you have to be deficient or in this case, in mice 13 weeks to see this effect.

324
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:42,420
So if you are a vitamin, if you don't get enough vitamin A in your diet for a couple of weeks.

325
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:48,810
Yeah, it's probably going to drop your expression resonate a little bit but it for for this

326
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:56,700
purpose it took 13 weeks to get this type of response demonstrating lipid soluble vitamins.

327
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:02,790
And it takes a long period of time to show an effect of the deficiency on this particular response.

328
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:07,469
Okay, so that's the transcript that's written.

329
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:15,150
L'expression Right. And when you show a difference in the transcript, does it always mean that there's going to be a difference in the protein?

330
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:18,809
Now you're shaking your head. No, that's that's something.

331
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:25,530
So if you were to submit the paper without this, without this, what do you think the is going to say?

332
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:33,460
They're going to say, prove it. You know, other things can can affect that.

333
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:40,560
The expression of that real may well, however, besides this particular vitamin D deficiency.

334
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:50,340
It's possible that there's something else going on. Right. And so you do a Western blot where you take a bit of the cells, you grind it up,

335
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:56,280
you put it on the gel, you stain the gel with antibodies that can recognize from Alpha.

336
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:07,560
You compare the density of the bands to the density of how much protein you loaded on the gel, and you stain everything with bead actin.

337
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:14,340
And then you divide the density of this band to this beta actin.

338
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,440
And it gives you this ratio and it normalizes the amount of protein that you loaded on the gel.

339
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:27,000
And here it's it's pretty clear that when you quantitate this, you count the pixels,

340
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,450
you get a program and you count the pixels in each of these bands.

341
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:37,470
And there's a huge difference here. And then finally they show it.

342
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:44,850
And that's what's shown here. They're looking at the sebaceous glands now and they're controlling the vitamin deficient mice.

343
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,640
And again, the red corresponds to the retinal.

344
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:53,040
This is the the transcript level.

345
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:58,650
The dapi is the the blue and then green is the auto fluorescence.

346
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:07,049
And when they combine everything together and you have the deficient mice versus the control,

347
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:10,810
you see no red staining here and you see red staining here.

348
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:25,050
So they've done their proof of this effect of vitamin A in the diet now reducing this expression of this antimicrobial peptide.

349
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:34,560
Okay. Doing so in the human the human cell right here in the expression and expression and in mice with the alpha.

350
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:51,540
Okay. Then and then they do this expression, expression, profiling, where they do the treatments and the control and the vitamin A deficient diet,

351
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:58,080
and they collect all this RNA and they measure it and they create this heat map.

352
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:08,760
And lo and behold, like we saw in the beginning, the retinal, the expression is downregulated compared to the control.

353
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:14,970
They looked at all of these other in an appropriate set time. So they mentioned that s 100 peptides as well.

354
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:21,180
Okay. All right.

355
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,810
So in the experiments shown in Figure six.

356
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:36,650
Why was the relative expression of rent in L.A. and this RR be assessed?

357
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:48,010
So first of all, let's go and focus on the figure six saying they have the vehicle, an ISO.

358
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:53,620
What's what's ISO? Recent trend.

359
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:58,990
Yeah, I know. Where do you start?

360
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:06,750
Does anybody use Isotretinoin for any kind of a thing like this?

361
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:10,690
Yeah. Yes, it's an active medication.

362
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:18,700
You'll find it in those types of preparations. And in this particular figure, they're asking whether or not this.

363
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,020
In this case, it's an agonist,

364
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:37,480
for it binds to the response element that would help regulate Brett in L.A. And we get an increase in comparison to the vehicle.

365
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:41,530
So why did why why does it label the vehicle instead of control?

366
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:50,460
Because it doesn't have that active agent and it's just like the rest of the solution.

367
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,749
Yeah. So it's, it's a lipid soluble molecule.

368
00:47:54,750 --> 00:48:00,600
So you have to, when you culture the, the cells in this um, preparation,

369
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:08,280
you have to have a way to dilute the agent is something that will accommodate that lipid inside that

370
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:15,540
lipid solubility and you want to have the same conditions of the what you're diluting the sample.

371
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:25,980
And that's going to be a promise. That's the control condition. So, um, what's, what's rb what is that?

372
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,410
Yeah. That's our air. There you go. So the film ended on the.

373
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,700
I stepped out of the virtual exit. So.

374
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:53,520
So they just I think they just wanted to show that these small people so bravely, those who stepped to the role, right.

375
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,940
It upregulate the receptor for this vitamin A agonist or something.

376
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:09,420
It behaves like have the name. Okay. So and then they show this western blot and they have let's see.

377
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:27,810
One, two, three, four. Just vehicle and they have with ISO one, two, three, four, five and then they have the knockout cells here.

378
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:48,610
So what are they showing here? That's the one.

379
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:54,140
Things only gets worse when you give them back the legion that I saw.

380
00:49:54,990 --> 00:50:00,889
Yeah. So it's activating the the G for it.

381
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:05,690
For the, the message is expressed and it's translated into protein.

382
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:17,320
But if you don't have this retinal a gene that's responsible for the protein from alpha, that you don't get anything right.

383
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:23,330
And that's what's shown here. And they show all of the treatments that they use and then they quantitate it here.

384
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:31,280
So Quantitation is essentially you take this image and you put it into you copy and paste

385
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,020
that image into software that can tell you how many pixels are in these different bands.

386
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:41,750
And then it'll give you an arbitrary scale, 0 to 8.

387
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:51,080
And then you compare the two and you find that there are more pixels in the ISO treated cells after you divide by this control actin.

388
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:58,160
And that's the expression you get. And then here's the retinal way where you get nothing.

389
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:11,330
So pretty convincing. Okay, now the very last portion of this figure addresses the is more of the real life situation.

390
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:15,980
So what do they show here in Fig. six and F?

391
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:31,380
Yeah. They're returning to having a diet that's lacking in vitamin aid, but it's actually related to vitamin A versus just being.

392
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:38,840
Random effect. Kind of like it wasn't a previous one time that the diet is in impact.

393
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:42,460
Yeah. So they. So what's the. What's the.

394
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:46,040
So they have a control and the diet, the vitamin A deficient diet.

395
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:50,870
And then. So what's going on with the vitamin A division diet and ISO?

396
00:51:50,870 --> 00:52:01,510
What is what happened there? When you add the ISO, once again, you have an increase in the expression of the amount, right?

397
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:08,810
It's not significant in the control diet, but significant between that vitamin A deficiency.

398
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:16,530
Yeah. So I don't see how many dots are there in that magenta bar.

399
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:24,150
Your streak is really higher. Yeah. So there's only three.

400
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:29,040
So they could have done a couple more experiments to get that to be significant.

401
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:34,140
But I guess it was convincing enough for the reviewers to say, okay, let that slide.

402
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,920
Usually you'd want to see another one. Okay. All right.

403
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:48,420
So back to streptococcus pyogenes and an animal now that is on a control or a vitamin A deficient diet.

404
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:56,350
And this is looking at what? What's the output here?

405
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:03,070
What's on the Y axis? We're not bacteria.

406
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,640
Yeah. The amount of bacteria per milligram of tissue.

407
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:15,640
So vitamin a deficient diet, they take the mice with the streptococcus pyogenes and there's more than in the control diet.

408
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:34,150
And then they rescued that defect with the ISO, the vitamin E like molecule, and they show that it decreases the amount of bacteria in the skin.

409
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:40,090
And finally. So that's that's not the whole story, I don't think.

410
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:45,070
Yeah, I hope they do. One more. I'm sorry. One more. There is one more figure associated with that.

411
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:49,420
So that's pretty cool. And then they have this final.

412
00:53:50,060 --> 00:54:02,110
The final one. Yeah, this is the final one. So this looks at now not that vitamin A deficiency, but it addresses a different question.

413
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:08,380
And what question are they trying to address here to just vehicle and wild type mice with ISO?

414
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:18,290
Do you have to be vitamin deficient to benefit from the application of ISO?

415
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:32,469
No. Right. So this is why there's proof.

416
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:40,720
There's not only not only in this set of experiments, but there is proof there.

417
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:46,920
There there are clinical trials done to test something like that so that it can be prescribed for treatment for acne.

418
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:51,069
Right. So they're showing here that in Wildtype mice,

419
00:54:51,070 --> 00:55:02,050
they look at retinal expression in animals that were given an ISO and they compare that to the vehicle and they see this increase.

420
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:04,570
It's a huge increase. Look at that.

421
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:15,320
So you're starting with with vehicle around in terms of relative expression, you're around 30 and you get 60 with that with the treatment of.

422
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:20,180
So the huge increase. And with the knockouts.

423
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:24,590
They don't have that gene now.

424
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:32,050
You get nothing. And then they're looking at two different groups of mice.

425
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:38,680
Wild type one. Wild type two. They're infected with streptococcus pyogenes.

426
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:47,320
And they are assessing the number of bacteria now within the abscess and underneath the surface of the skin.

427
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:52,270
And they show the significant difference with the ISO treatment.

428
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:59,440
So very convincing that this works in an animal that is vitamin A, sufficient.

429
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:09,400
Okay. And then when you do the same set of experiments now with the knockout mice, you don't see a difference.

430
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:15,790
There's a lot more. There's a lot more variability here to do that. And here.

431
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:24,290
So. To sum up its environment.

432
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:30,650
They regulate skin immunity. They have this nice picture and this is like a another graphical abstract.

433
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:36,920
And then within the paper you saw, they had some bullet points to kind of summarize the findings of the paper.

434
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,640
And this does very nicely. So you have skin.

435
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:49,000
And here are here's the epithelial surface of the skin.

436
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:54,910
And you have the microbiota on the surface of the skin.

437
00:56:56,020 --> 00:57:06,400
And you have an upregulation of retinal a in the presence of vitamin A, in the absence of vitamin D, you're not going to see the same response.

438
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:15,880
And those cells produce alpha, the antimicrobial peptide that attaches to its surface.

439
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:19,930
It bores holes in the bacteria and kills it.

440
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:35,430
Okay. But if you have and this actually shapes that the microbiota, the presence of microorganisms in the surface of the skin.

441
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:39,570
But how about the gut? Does it have an effect on what's in the gut?

442
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:46,510
Now, why? They didn't see the expression, the color.

443
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:52,060
Yeah, the expression and the gun is different than in the skin, which is really interesting.

444
00:57:53,200 --> 00:58:04,630
So when when you are infected with an organism like Streptococcus Pyogenes, you have its limits, the extent of the infection.

445
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:11,010
So I thought, this is a good way to start off the semester.

446
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:16,160
This is a dense paper. This is about as dense as I would like to present in this class.

447
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:22,909
Many of you don't have a background in immunology, but this is this is a high level paper.

448
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:28,730
This is a this is a pretty cool journal and a difficult one to get paper in.

449
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:35,570
And there were seven figures and a zillion supplemental figures with this paper.

450
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:42,260
So there's it's a high bar to get a paper accepted into this particular journal.

451
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:50,350
So you don't have to present a paper that is this detailed and complex.

452
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,570
If you don't want to write, that's fine. If you want to, that's fine.

453
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:58,790
If you want to do something that's a bit simpler, that's fine, too.

454
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:09,030
The point of this is to engage, to think critically, and to learn from how experiments are conducted and how we reach conclusions based on that.

455
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:14,120
Interpreting the data. Right. Okay.

456
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:18,380
Yeah. So it's very random so far. The worst thing left.

457
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:28,939
So how do you choose a control? So it's like a gene that you are completely sure that it's not affected by retinol and yes, good question.

458
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:34,220
The control of the beta actin. Yeah, yeah, good question.

459
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:39,200
So beta actin is the cytoskeleton of the protein.

460
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:45,049
So you have to choose a protein that's not going to be affected by the infection.

461
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:55,910
Right. And this is in years ago, nobody thought that you could question these control proteins being active, but it turns out that you can't.

462
00:59:56,150 --> 01:00:00,080
Right. So you have to be careful in what you choose.

463
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:09,740
So if you choose a protein that could potentially be affected by the infection, it could be upregulated, right?

464
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:16,430
So as a way to serve as a control that could be can distort your findings.

465
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:20,720
So what's done nowadays? I don't have an image to show you.

466
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,710
You take the whole block, right.

467
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:33,139
And it looks like a smear and you just stain that block for protein and it gives you a smear.

468
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:37,130
It gives you dense blocks, it gives you faint blocks. You just get the whole thing.

469
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:47,660
And then I can show you this later and then you can take an image of the entire length of the gel for each sample.

470
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,780
So instead of just this one piece here,

471
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:59,569
so Realme can migrate a certain distance down the gel and so will be the actin instead of just cutting out portions of it.

472
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:01,969
So you get the whole thing that's not staining.

473
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:09,950
You just stated for total protein and you compare the amount of the total protein stain with each different lane,

474
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,750
and you use that as a control to normalize the density of your blocks.

475
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:22,729
That's kind of what's expected now, but you can still get away with using bad acting in some circumstances.

476
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:26,160
Okay. All right.

477
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:34,780
So any more questions about this?

478
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:40,490
I thought this was like, you know, the complete story.

479
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:51,610
You know, they had a hypothesis. They had a way of testing it. They had a very rigorous way to test the hypothesis using human cells and mouse models.

480
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:59,770
So this is kind of the bar that you have to reach to do this kind of get this kind of work published.

481
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:03,700
The mice, the skin, the cell serves as a model.

482
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:14,710
And the whole if you can show a similar response in human cells, that tells you that the same is true or probably true in humans.

483
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:20,590
And that's an important part of, you know, these types of experiments.

484
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:28,120
So do you think nutrition research reaches the same level?

485
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:34,030
And I'll give you a bunch of papers now in terms of its rigor, in terms of testing ideas and hypotheses.

486
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:45,340
Let me throw in examples for you for vitamin C and severity of illness from the common cold.

487
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:55,830
We to try to draw conclusions based on data that you might read in the popular press or in the scientific literature.

488
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:02,250
You're looking at me like I was going to be like, No way right now.

489
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:13,149
Are you asking if they are like if nutritional research is as in-depth as compared

490
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:20,290
to something else or just like its nutritional research in that it is the nutrition

491
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:26,259
research to back up the that what the popular idea is for take vitamin C supplements

492
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:32,020
for for to reduce the severity of symptoms associated with the common cold.

493
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:39,370
Do you think that reaches the same level of, I guess, rigor of testing hypothesis?

494
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:50,550
Right. Right. That's that has been a problem with nutrition research all through.

495
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:56,790
You'll hear claims from a study done with a group of people.

496
01:03:57,390 --> 01:04:02,490
And as we'll see, I give a lecture on vitamin C, I mean, not next week, the following week.

497
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:04,020
And I filled the schedule. See this?

498
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:13,440
You'll see where that data comes from and you'll be able to say, oh, okay, maybe this doesn't show very much of anything at all.

499
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:22,920
And so this is this is the problem with both the popular press and studies that don't

500
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:31,230
go into enough rigorous testing of a hypothesis in terms of their credibility.

501
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:43,919
So if your experiments are associative and superficial, you're not going to have the evidence that's strong enough to to make that recommendation,

502
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:51,120
such that when the average person tries that strategy, it's going to make a difference, that they might believe that it makes a difference.

503
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:57,270
So that the placebo effect is real. If you believe that it works, it will work a little bit.

504
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:01,020
So think of that as well here.

505
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:07,230
It's you're not going to see a placebo effect in a cell light or in a mouse because they don't know.

506
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:15,660
They don't know what's going on. So it's all it's very important to conclude a rigorous model for testing,

507
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:22,350
as well as a human sample and as we'll see a human population to to test these ideas.

508
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:29,010
Okay. All right. Any questions about what I've talked about so far?

509
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:34,230
I'm going to fill out the rest of the schedule for the semester. And the other thing.

510
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:41,310
Send me an email if you want to see. I've got dozens of studies that I presented over the years in this area.

511
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:47,730
Send me a request for a particular thing that you are very interested in.

512
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:57,000
It can be a micronutrient. It can be a difference in populations that are exposed to this, that and the other thing.

513
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:01,260
Send me things that you would like to see in this class.

514
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:05,390
Okay. All right, so I'll. I will, I will.

515
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:10,620
I will. I will contact you through a Google document saying what are some things?

516
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:14,770
Here's what we've done in the past. What would you like to see if it's not here in this list?

517
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:19,030
What would you like to learn about? Okay. All right.

518
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:23,350
So I will see all of you on Tuesday next week.

519
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:40,120
We're going to be talking about adaptive immunity. Okay. Thank you.

520
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:41,170
You're welcome.
