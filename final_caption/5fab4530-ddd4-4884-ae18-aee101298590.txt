1
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
hello, everyone! My zoom seems to have some technical problem.

2
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I will log out a login. Just give you one room in there.

3
00:07:42,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Sorry about that

4
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Okay, Sorry for the trouble. i'm back and this working now.

5
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay, I hope you all had a great and restful. We can this week, plus continue with the happy 7 o one.

6
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So on Friday we finished the the first, half of lecture 5, 8, which is normal distribution a central limit theorem with the project 5 A.

7
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But we didn't finish because there was one question about comedy in the vote.

8
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So today we're gonna finish company in the world and you can we'll finish 5, 8, and then and do 5 B.

9
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So you're gonna submit 5 8 are you gonna Do the post later quit, but the whole lecture 5 also 5 A. and the post left request will be due tomorrow morning as usual.

10
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Again. If you have questions, please let me know. otherwise. start this lecture.

11
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Any questions before we start

12
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Alright. So if you'll still recall on Friday, we'll talk about normal distribution the several rule of thumbs or normal distribution, which is a specific dial shape per and then build on top of that

13
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:16,000
we'll talk about central limit. theorem which says that the sample mean will approximately formal follow normal distribution, regardless of the population distribution.

14
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's striking pack for the normal distribution That's why normal distribution is very very crucial for many of the statistics.

15
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So today we continue building on top of this pack I started talking about different ways of the so essentially in this course, we're going to talk about 2 main ways of doing statistical inference.

16
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Most of the time you that's what you're gonna see in a literature. one is company interval which we don't know about today, but today we're gonna talk about the the basic concept company novel got it feels common for the population

17
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
meet, and then the next tomorrow we talk about how it has been again.

18
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's, you know, when you here those key value those kind of thing that's come from have all the passing. we, we have you have tomorrow gonna talk about testing population later on we gotta talk about of the all the testing for other

19
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:16,000
statistical qualities. Okay. So inference, Remember what is Statistical Inference Conference means.

20
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We use the sample and things we can calculate from the sample to say something to make some conclusions about the population.

21
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:31,000
This whole process called the inference, so all the inference will be not only qualitative, but rather quantitative.

22
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I saw both that's why we need to use this as well model.

23
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So let's revisit very quickly the sampleing distribution Is this hypothetical distribution?

24
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:52,000
When you, if you imagine you're repeating your experiment, many many times, then each time you got a random sample, you got random numbers from your random sample anything you to do with your random sample will be random therefore you're

25
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
including a statistic, including a company involved, including a pivot, including even including our inference, will be random right.

26
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This whole thing is random, and the the underlying distribution behind all the You know this randomly.

27
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's called component distribution which means any random quality. You compute from the random sample we know has its own sample integers.

28
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So we need to keep that in mind. So the sampleing distribution is this hypnotic of it.

29
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Distribution, or you canre kind of represented using a histogram of all the possible songhold.

30
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Sample means who the right on the study so here We're talking about the sampleing distribution of the San Homie.

31
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But there's also a so in particular, if we have a sample, we got a sample, we have 10.

32
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The question is, Is this value unusual? Are you really large?

33
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Are you really small or also level right? So how similar it it will be to other potential, independent, repeated studies that we will have run and would have.

34
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So basically, if we repeat it, sample many times and compute something mean for each. How far away are they from the 10?

35
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It turns out that we can say something we can say a lot about those assignment distributions.

36
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Okay. So this how Samuel distribution is hot sort of a theoremical.

37
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You really cannot see it realize being realized unless you really repeat yourself for many times.

38
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:29,000
However, although we don't really do that we can still say a lot about it right, even though we've only one study based on what we know about the run one study, we can say a lot about the we still don't know

39
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
that somebody We don't know it's mean we don't know It's standard Db.

40
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We don't know anything about it but we can say a lot about its property in particular. For example, the central limit theorem tells us the summary distribution will look like something right.

41
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We still don't know exactly where it is but we can say a lot of what i'm going to do.

42
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
We can say this mean is standard deviation with some parameters, unknown parameters that's the tricky thing so central limit theorem.

43
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Tell us thesembly distributed sample mean will be normal with me, and new standard deviation sigma over square root of.

44
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Have you still remember these 2 facts. Well, the problem is out here.

45
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
We still don't know new we still don't know Sigma, because those are parameter from the population.

46
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Right? So So this is the this mix of mysteries, right?

47
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:25,000
We know a lot about how many distributed, But we still don't know about who so perfectly in the dot so want to say something about.

48
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So I know it's kind of a you know logically our philosophical is sort of involved.

49
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So if you do have question, please let me know. This is quite important.

50
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:42,000
One on the concept

51
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Now let's look yeah. Give some example. right Suppose we have a sample size of 100, and this is from a population of unus short mothers.

52
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Hi Ben, you know, with random example, 100, and you should mothers, and the management is the weight of their newborn infants.

53
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Okay, Once we've managed 100 of these we happen to follow me.

54
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's this 2,350 grams right?

55
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And then we also we can compute the sample standard deviation of 570 grams.

56
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So we know that because this is from the sun, we also know the sample size.

57
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What we really want to know is the population. So we like to know the potential population right?

58
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:33,000
This birthway might come from, because this is 100 random song. So again, because we don't know but we can make assumptions.

59
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Let's assume the population. I mean is meal this number here. we just, we don't know it quite exist right in principle.

60
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
If you measure everybody in the population you will know it although we don't do it.

61
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
We'll assume it's new and also we can assume the public and standard deviation is Sigma.

62
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Remember, here we are now assuming the population has a normal distribution, but we can guess right like height on the way, but typically they follow roughly normal distribution.

63
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So we can guess the population is roughly normal, and based on sandrailman, theorem actually doesn't matter if it's slightly non-normal.

64
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Okay, we Don't really believe the population will be highly skilled right because you know how big of a of weight can you're born in from beat right?

65
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You couldn't be too big couldn't be too small there's a there's a ranging there, right?

66
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So you could have be highly skilled anyway. So the standard limit theorem should work. based on the standard limit theorem.

67
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
We can say a lot of other, some point distribution of the sample mean.

68
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
First of all, we know the sample distributed. The sample mean is either exactly or approximately normal. right.

69
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:42,000
If the population is exactly normal, that the some of the distribution in the sample mean is exactly normal, but those probably do not apply, but based on certain limit. theorem.

70
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:54,000
We know that even if the you know the population is not normal, because we have a relatively big sample, Remember, larger than 20 is is good enough usually for Santa Cruz.

71
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So we have some of that 100 We know the sample mean the sample will be approximately actually a very good approximation of normal very good.

72
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I mean visual, you you probably wouldn't have be able to tell.

73
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yeah, then the mean of the simulator is also new is the same as the population.

74
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But the problem here is that we know these 2 normal has the same mean, but we still don't know what Mu is right, because that's the quality of interest

75
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yeah, we also know the family distribution of the sample.

76
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Mean has a standard deviation, of course. sigma over square root of N.

77
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Here n is 100, because that's a sample sign so really it's Sigma over 10 and the single like the population standard deviation.

78
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Again. we don't know single. So when we know what the sound distribution of the sample mean? Look like we still don't know exactly where it is, and what's the you know how how fat it is right how bright it

79
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
is.

80
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Alright, there's no question i'll move on but if you do have questions, please interrupt me.

81
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So knowing this, you know we already can stay along nothing about it right? if you'll still recall there's a property of the normal distribution, saying that 95% of the sample or 95% of the random draws from that

82
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:26,000
distribution will lie within 2 standard division. Oh, from the meeting. right?

83
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So because this is something that you've been with the sample mean, which means that 95% of sample means, if you really do it many times, they will cover 2 standard deviation on either side of the of the mean of that

84
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:48,000
distribution, which means that if you repeat the experiment many, many times now, you would expect 95% of time to sample me.

85
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You draw from that random sample. we'll fall in this interval mu minus 2 sigma over square root.

86
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Then a new plus P. sigma over square, that because Myo is the mean of the sampling distribution and the single over scroll to end is that start the debt on the summit?

87
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
This is this: is really, really mu minus 2 standard deviation, right?

88
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So these are the fact from the what we know about normal distribution, because the based on Saturday met theorem we know normal determinant will approximate this very well.

89
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Therefore this will be very, very well. you know characterized by this 95%.

90
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Now we're gonna use a little bit algebra that's better with me.

91
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I can say the same thing. but you know, mathematical equation just make it more precise.

92
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But those are more, you know comfortable with this otherwise i'll explain, anyway.

93
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So xp right, Remember acts, Is your sample right?

94
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Numbers observation from the sample x part is the me it's the sample mean.

95
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But here we we use capital x that's not a sample mean to solve exactly random.

96
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So any capital letter actually means random number right? So although you can calculate it by in principle, executive by the number.

97
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:15,000
So here we say x greater or equal than this you don't mind those 2 sigma over n as square root of N. That's less what you call that new classical signal over and basically saying X bar for in this interval and

98
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
this probability means that the chance is happens when we talk about a chance.

99
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
We're really talking about, repeated experiments right we do it again again again, each time.

100
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:38,000
X bar may fall in this interval may not fall in this interval. but if you do like a 100 times of average 95% of time, it Will fall. you, therefore, we talk about this particular event which means x 4 4 in this

101
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
interval the probability of that event is 0 point 9 5 so that's not mathematical notation.

102
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Of probability, theory.

103
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:00,000
This is a so called the frequencies approach. Essentially, that means that if you repeated doing this, the first you see, this event happening is 95%.

104
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Okay, philosophically. it's it's kind of tricky but them on.

105
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Now I remember when I was a kid, you know, when I watch Tv I watch the weather forecast.

106
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
They say, Okay, tomorrow is gonna be raining it's gonna be sunny.

107
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's gonna be you know overcast or so on so forth, right?

108
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But nowadays they don't say that anymore, they say you know from P.

109
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
If you use any app, they say tomorrow, the raining probability is like 50%.

110
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Really It's kind of tricky to know what I mean 50% is there's a 50 chance it range 50 chance it Doesn't ran.

111
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You can think about it in flipping a court right that's highly rate. retail another way.

112
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But in reality tomorrow it's either rain or not when right so once tomorrow is here.

113
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It really makes no sense to talk about probability anymore, because it either happened not happening.

114
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So what we really they really talk about by 50% is a, you know, If they make this kind of a prediction a 100 times right, the £50 it will ring 50 times an hour.

115
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Right. Frequent is sort of the invitation you have to put that into contact.

116
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So just just understand this 95% probability as those raining probability. right?

117
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So, given this, some scenario there's 95% of chats will be, will be raining.

118
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So basically you almost know it will happen almost always except a few times doesn't matter.

119
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Okay, Now we're gonna do some algebraic manipulation.

120
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:38,000
So just just, you know. bear with me here. This is the event that X bar, which is a random quantity, fall in this interval, which is unknown, but fixed right.

121
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
This me and the sigma are numbers which we don't know but they are not random.

122
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:49,000
They come from the population. The population is already there there's nothing random with the population.

123
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So this interval is a but the unknown interval.

124
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
X X bar is a random quantity, but we observe it.

125
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You know one realization of it. So this is the same.

126
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:11,000
The probability sample me. The following is interval is 95%, which is the equation we copy from the previous slide. For Now let's rearrange it right for those of you are familiar with algebra.

127
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:20,000
We can subtract number Both sides of the inequality that you call it still apply, which means x bar minus mu, with fall.

128
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
In the interval negative 2 sigma over square root and 2 positive 2 Sigma over square. Go ahead.

129
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So basic, subtract me from both sides of the inequality.

130
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Right. Similarly, we can subtract X bar right, which means minus me, or will fire.

131
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
In this interval with 95% probability. and finally, we multiply by minus one.

132
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
When you modify minus one, found the both sides of the inequality, you need to pull up the sign.

133
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Basically saying mu is greater than this quantity you know flip the signs X bar minus and last time x bar plus.

134
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Let's see on this for so now it doesn't seem that we did a lot Actually, we did quite quite quite some right.

135
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So here is saying, X bar for an interval of mu plus minus 2 sigma over the head.

136
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Here is a new point interval X bar plus minus you know intuitively is the same.

137
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
X part is, if no further than 2 Sigma over square and away from you.

138
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Here is saying Mu is no for the 2 sigma over as far as the way from X Bar.

139
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Apparently they're talking about the same thing that's Why, these 2 events actually are the same event. No surprising we can get from here to here, because they are the same event.

140
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Of course they happen with the same probability on. the difference is here. here.

141
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
X bar is random, right? This is a random quality fall, you know, but unknown interval.

142
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Here Mu is safe here. He is a fixed quantity point in a random in battle Right?

143
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
This interval is random, because X bar is random

144
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Okay, the reason we do this it's because in reality once we have the data we we know.

145
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Expon we can measure x one. we want to say something about the meal.

146
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:28,000
We absolutely still don't know what Meal, is but we know me is not too far away from X Bar, and that's enough for us to say a lot about it.

147
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So this is a steel, a little bit tricky especially we don't know me. We also don't know sigma right?

148
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
How can I say anything to do with me or if we Don't know Sigma?

149
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
We know they are. This 2 number are close to each other but we actually don't know the distance, because we don't know Sigma.

150
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:50,000
We know we we know samples have we know n here we don't know Sigma, so what we do is that whenever we don't know something we approximate it.

151
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Right. So statistics is really about approximation we we don't know Sigma, but we know stigma the population standard deviation.

152
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
We also know the sample standard deviation, which is the Sx.

153
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
If you still, remember, will be close to signal we don't know how 5 is.

154
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Well, that should be sufficient. let's just plug in we don't know thinking about.

155
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:18,000
We use as access to half my signal. Okay, So which means that meal will fall in this interval.

156
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,000
X bar plus minus sx over square root. N: Not approximately 95% of chance there.

157
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
There are several layer approximation, right First of all, central limit.

158
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
The only approximation, you know, although a pretty good one.

159
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And second use asks to approximate Sigma, which, which is another layer approximation.

160
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:46,000
So now, with the last meal will be in this interval, roughly, 95% of chance and this interval is really something.

161
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:54,000
We can got a hand on, because once we have the data we can compute X Bar, we have computer assets. In this particular case.

162
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
We plug in. If you still recall as the x over square, the end is the so-called standard arrow to me.

163
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:11,000
That's the number we compute alright Well, basically here use sample mean minus 2 standard arrow of the mean, and then sample me and pause, Who's not an average me?

164
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:21,000
It turns out that this kind of you know equation right the estimate plus minus 2 standard arrow of the estimate? we'll be very much.

165
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Why did he use other kind of statistics as well?

166
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So this is the simplest example. but this principle pie everywhere.

167
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And then, because you can plug in the number right standard error, 2 standard apostles and arrows, and your computer standardized the standard Db: to divide by square root of sample size your sample that is 100 make it

168
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:46,000
very easy to compute. Now we got interval. so this interval is the interval we calculate from the sample in principle.

169
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It is a random quality. Well, with the data, we can have one realization of it.

170
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So what we can say, this actually we call this interval.

171
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
The 95% conflict in the local meeting.

172
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Because Mu will fall in this interval with high covenant, 95%.

173
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
The chest you could fall in, but the interpretation is a little tricky.

174
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Okay, here we don't call the 95% probability interval, because if you think about it, Mule is a quality unknown, but fixed.

175
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So me is the number there the number one you know it right it's either in the interval or not in the interval.

176
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:42,000
So there's nothing random about me. mule is not random so really you make no sense to talk about a meal, for you know a a interval like this. because it's either in there or not in there there's no probability so that's why

177
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
we say 95% confident number not 95% probability no, because we still don't know me.

178
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
We don't know whether me is in or not in it we think it's probably in there most of the time.

179
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Why it's it's also likely it's not it's also possibly not in it.

180
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:08,000
So really, what we can say is that if you repeat this whole thing right sampling, and then so each time, if you repeat the experiment each time you draw random sample, then you'll compute the sample mean sample standard.

181
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
deviation. Now you've got a different interval because the interval itself is value.

182
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
So if you repeat this like a 100 times, you got 100 random interval.

183
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
That pretty much meal will be in that level. 95% of chance.

184
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:33,000
95% of time. So that's the frequency approach right so we still don't know whether mu is in this particular interval or not. always say it's very likely it is that's why we call the

185
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
95% common. So that's the interpretation of i'll always keep that in mind.

186
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
We can never say for sure whether me is in there or not because we don't even know you.

187
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Well, we have high confidence. It is in there

188
00:29:49,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Question so far

189
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I'm sorry if you well say something I I wasn't able to hear

190
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:16,000
You can type in the chat, or you can, you know, recess or microphone

191
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
So essentially the confidence interval depends on the standard deviation.

192
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Correct. Yes, it depends on both the sample mean and the sample standard deviation and the sample size.

193
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
But depend on 3 quantity. Are they telling us the same thing?

194
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:46,000
In a sense, what is the same thing, the values? because the standard deviation tells us the percentage of our sample falls within certain value.

195
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And then the confidence interval tells us how confident we are that is that it stays between this range.

196
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
: Yeah. Yeah. yeah, I mean, they they are very much related.

197
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Yeah, I mean, they're interpretation. But here we are not really directly using the sample standard deviation.

198
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
We also divide by the square of the symbol size, because this whole ratio is the standard error, right?

199
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
The standard error is is related through the summer standard deviation, but it's not a sample standard division.

200
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
There's also sample size coming there so the larger the time of size.

201
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,000
The integral will be narrower shorter that's Why, we have you know, more information about the meeting.

202
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
How about you? So the all 3 quantity play a role here?

203
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Not just one

204
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Any other question. I will go going over again some simulation and some you know. exercise right? Of course i'll hear it, I understand. you know.

205
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Where are we? are from? where we are often. okay. So essentially, remember, right, we draw the sample, trying to make inference about the population meet.

206
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:06,000
New. Now we are making inference, because from the sample we compute the interval, we say new is very much in the same table. right?

207
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:15,000
We still don't know me exactly we still don't know whether for sure me is in the interval, but we know very likely it is in the interval right that's that's good enough that's all we can say

208
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:24,000
about me because it after all, it's still something we didn't measure

209
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Alright, so the combinator will tell off the range of value or the public domain.

210
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Now the pay that can tell us I still that's what they say we use the data to say something bottom.

211
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:43,000
You. the data itself is not an interest. but data self is even run them, which means, if you're repeating farming, you're actually going to get a different interval.

212
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So the interval itself. This non particular number doesn't really mean much, because they are actually random for the fact that we can say Mu.

213
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Very likely, following this interval it's very useful Okay, so given the sample. Our best gas for the popular meal is to sample me.

214
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:22,000
But that's just a guess. because that's a random yes, and then the colony of all go one step further to say Not only we know me is nearby is X Bar i'll also say how far away it could be here you say you know

215
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:33,000
most of the time. it's not too far away and give a quantitative measurement about how far away a mule can be from next month. That's why I would say the common number is a quantitative measurement you know that

216
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,000
we can say about me, and that that does this due to something vulnerability right?

217
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:55,000
We have no control right, given the sample size given the population variation that that distance is always there. We are the qualitatively this describe the you know, the variability due to this family vulnerability.

218
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:03,000
So the number 95% coming over to compute it require 3 values, right, the sample size, the sample mean and assemble standard division.

219
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:15,000
We need all 3. Well, luckily, we can compute all 3 from the data, and then every time you repeat a study we will get a different interval, because the interval is random.

220
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Okay, So there's no magic number here this number is by no means special.

221
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It's just a random number they call from the data what's important is that we can. we can copy this tool number to to somehow bracket the the possible values of new

222
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,000
But I think the crucial thing is I know time you know whatever we're doing, and what the common general is really saying right how to compute this exactly.

223
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I mean this parameter you don't have to remember you may remember right now.

224
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
But you know after year, if you don't use it probably for Gap.

225
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
But now, with the last, all the little software will do it for you, right?

226
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So the keys will understand. You know what what they mean, really

227
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Okay. So now the question is that if the interval is on how random each time you repeat the study, you've got a different interval. The which interval is actually called on Port correct, is actually contain new.

228
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Yes, I unfortunately, is that we don't know how we never know the meal could be in in the it could not be in it, because we don't know me.

229
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:44,000
We can never say for sure what we can say. for sure is that if we really compute the integral £100 No, it's very likely 95% of time the mule is indo.

230
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:52,000
But for a specific email. We never know right so so it's There's a building randomness in there.

231
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:02,000
We have no control on. Well, we are, we are, you know, taking advantage of all the information as much as we can.

232
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So there are many, you know, When we talk about 95% common level, we talk about 95% commentable, and the people probably know what they miss, but not the last.

233
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You know, in the long run. Some people forget it's original meaning probably in cover them all.

234
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I exactly meant. and then, once you go beyond that in the particular may be wrong.

235
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:26,000
For example, you could say, i'm not i'm 95% confident that the publishers me is in the interval.

236
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,000
But this is a very, very, I would say lose, and the subject, if you use the word confidence right here.

237
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
The confidence is not really. Talk about your own confidence. really.

238
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Talk about the repeated frequentist sort of a behavior.

239
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Well, you you could still be 95% confident but that's not a point here.

240
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:55,000
The point is that we are confident if we repeat the experiment a 100 times 95% of the time it will cover.

241
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:05,000
But that has nothing to do. a single time right that's not there's a probability of up you know 95% that I'm always in the interval again.

242
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Happy colleague. It is wrong but you can think that way. but when you say it out, the technically wrong because Mu is either in the invaluable, not in the in the role. there's no probability associated because me is a

243
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
fixed number he's not random we'll have only part of our probability with random measurements.

244
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
So here the 95% really talk about is frequentist interpretation.

245
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Where, if you repeat the experiment a 100 times, or even more, right, the 95% of high, it will be in there.

246
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Okay, so I I would recommend you. I mean, whenever you say something like this technically is wrong.

247
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
But people probably know what you meant. And after, anyway, right?

248
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Some people are more picky, right if you put this kind of sentence, you know, loosely.

249
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
State standards in your paper or in your proposal.

250
00:37:50,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Grant proposal you know. the reviewer might think you're not well Chinese, so bad enough saying, them, although people probably know what you've meant right, Just say 95% harmony number and that's the packaging way of

251
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:12,000
saying right anything before that will likely be wrong technically because you know that the the the real technical, correct interpretation is this repeated sampling, which is very, very long sentence, Right?

252
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You don't want to say nobody is here just say 95% commentable.

253
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Don't say anything else that will make it perfectly correct any questions here

254
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Okay. So there are a lot of things that we have.

255
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:49,000
We kind of trying to learn from conference room. For example, remember the combination of the combination of the company in the is the mean plus minus 2 standard error.

256
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Where are the standard arrows? The standard deviation divided by square root of N.

257
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So Why, we have a 2 here where the 2 come from.

258
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:07,000
It turns out that the tool, remember, come from the fact that normal distribution has 95% of you know probability mass within 2 standard deviation from the mean. So that's the 2.

259
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
The 2 cover 95% right. So if you want to 95% common in the volume.

260
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
You don't have a tool here, which means that if you put a one here.

261
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,000
You have a 68%. How many level is that right?

262
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Remember, because 68% of the publicly math in a normal distribution with the So this is not what people cause, you know, 68% having the money is not a whole lot of confidence.

263
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Right. Nevertheless, you can talk about like 9, 90%.

264
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:46,000
How many devil 95% common double right by varying this particular tool?

265
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:54,000
If you want a 90% home level, it turns out you need 1.6, 5, not 2.

266
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So if you mu plus minus 1 point, 6 5 i'm standard error, you have a 90% commonly mode is that Similarly, if you use mu plus minus 2 point, 5, 8 stand arrow you've got a 99% common

267
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
number. so you found the more confidence. you just increase the number.

268
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:16,000
If you look at it right once you increase the 2 this interval got wider, So that's part of the fact.

269
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:28,000
You're covering more you know how a confidence. right that's all, and so forth, will decrease the tool. the integral got shorter than you have less prominent Well, why do you think we will cover the truth you know

270
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:35,000
with higher confidence. I think that's very maturity. so typically 95 is the most violent youth. Now with us.

271
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Occasionally people use 99. You could do 9. You need to replace 2 by 2.5. 8.

272
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I guess 2 is is nice, because 2 is a good number right to remember, and the 95 is also a good number which corresponds to pivotal later on top of all, this is 0 point 0 5 which is why they

273
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
use, you know. I just want to tell you, for those are interests.

274
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:04,000
The 2, please. Alright, exact, the the real exact number is 1.9, 6 blah blah blah, right?

275
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:15,000
If you use the software, they have to use this 1 point: 9, 6 blah blah blah blah capital in develop, not 2 2 is just a rule of phone, because 1.9 6 is very close to 2.

276
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:26,000
So using 2, you got a good enough interval, but the software will actually give you a slightly different one, because they use 1.9, 6, plus one

277
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Okay. Yeah, Melanie, are you? You will actually learn in the next lecture.

278
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Even 1.9 6 is not actually because that by the exact one. Will you know even the color value actually will depend on the sample size.

279
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I mean we'll talk about those give you a technical detail later. But I don't wanna go into that hi kind of a you know.

280
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Deep health right now, because I am confusing more drop.

281
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Just just so. You know That, too, is good enough. Approximate things come from approximation, anyway. right?

282
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:12,000
So. okay? No, let's look at some Reo novels let's go back to this Remember the high in short, mother and their birthday of their in the New York. right?

283
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Remember that we have 100 children, or in the I, you for mother, and use the data.

284
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:27,000
We compute the 95%. common number for the population. in In this case it's 2,236 ground to 2,464.

285
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Grand. you. This invo is pretty popular right let's say the W. H. O.

286
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Something right defines a healthy birthday is 2,500 ground.

287
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Now my question is based on this data and the evidence provided from this study, do we believe that babies for, and why you should mother have healthy birthday?

288
00:42:49,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Yes or not. and why? I wonder if anyone like to answer this question?

289
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I don't think so. Yeah. the apple limit of our 90% configuration. to all is applies below the 500 grounds.

290
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Yeah, yeah, go ahead. I have a I have a doubt about that, like this is saying that it is based upon our sample of 100 children. So we don't know. they don't actually know the total amount of children like the entire population, of

291
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
children born planning short mothers, because this 95 person can confidence.

292
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Interval is for the for the sample of 100 children.

293
00:43:48,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Right. so I don't I don't think we can see that. I mean, I mean, I I don't think they can like. say that that No, they're not healthy thank you any other common thanks thank both.

294
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Of you really appreciate that anybody else want to say something

295
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Okay, thank you. You know I i'll talk about it where we are from a way off to right.

296
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Remember, the sample itself is never the the quality of interest.

297
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,000
The sample is just random. We used to sample to say something about the population, so here there is a population of iron.

298
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Short, mother, we want to say whether their birth, you know their childbirth is healthy or not right here, or healthy.

299
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Say this is 2,500 ground right? The problem is so big, and everybody in the population will have a different birthday.

300
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
So the chance that randomly drawing individual will exactly have 2,500. This is 0.

301
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
That's just don't happen so what we really are asking here.

302
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Is that do I need for the mother? They have a birth weight so they can lower than the healthy weight. Right?

303
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
So basically saying, if you run on me, pick up I information, mother.

304
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
The birthday could be any, anything could be, 2,500 could be below, could be above.

305
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:21,000
That in each individual itself is not of interest. Well, we really want to interest, you know. focus on. Is that a randomly joined some? that right?

306
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Is it very much, you know, If a randomly drawing subject from the population will very much likely to be below, then we say the whole population is not healthy, right, although there could be thumb individual in the public is healthy right. so the way.

307
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
We put the question is, really, Is the population healthier now?

308
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And one way to define that is, the population meet right?

309
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:50,000
If the population means is significant, is lower than 2,500, then most of the subject in the population will be around its meeting.

310
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:58,000
The most of subject will be unhealthy then we say the population is not helping, so there's a lot of quiz.

311
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
And how do we define a question to How do we design a study?

312
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Finally, to how do we make the inference? So now, keeping this question in mind, we draw a sample of 100, and we collect the data.

313
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:15,000
We calculate the confident interval. this confident interval is for the population mean.

314
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:24,000
So we still Don't know for sure what population means is they could be in the interval, could be outside. could be on on the left hand side.

315
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Anything cool hopping, but because this is the 95% common level.

316
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:36,000
We think the mule it's very likely in the interval with high confidence.

317
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Meal is in the middle. if meal, is in the interval, because the interval totally below 2,500. the interval doesn't cover 2,500, which we we basically to conclusion that me is very much likely to be

318
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:00,000
below 2,500 that's an indicator now this population has unhealthy birthday, Right?

319
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:08,000
There are a lot of stuff until we draw the conclusion

320
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:22,000
So from this interval, because the interval doesn't contain 2,500, we can conclude that with high confidence that this population has, as last time how people

321
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Any question.

322
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Okay, Now, again, let's go back the invo itself is right now, right?

323
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,000
So each time you conduct study, the integral might change. But sometimes you make maybe like this.

324
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Sometimes we actually cover the plenty, 5% of 2,500.

325
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Sometimes the be could be given above the 2,500, so our conclusion is never like conclusive.

326
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Our conclusion always associated with some confidence or probability.

327
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:19,000
There, right, which saying, when you repeat the study it's. likely that you will rip, you will reproduce your conclusion. but it's also possible your conclusion may actually may not hold Okay, So that's why we put the 95

328
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:28,000
percent common there. basically. Say, when you repeat the studies like it's, very likely the compulsion will stay rather than being, you know, flat.

329
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Not on the left. Let's think about even look to the study, but with a small sample size.

330
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
So this time we take the sample size of 50 rather than 100.

331
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Suppose this new study has the same mu and a standard deviation.

332
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
New reality probably never happened, but just just post implicitly.

333
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Suppose 200 X bar on aspects of unchanged, but N.

334
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Is reduced from 150, and they use the same parameter.

335
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Now we got a wider interval, right. Remember now, the size of the interval.

336
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
There's a over square root of n right and smaller than the will become wider.

337
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So the same 95% common vote. But in this particular data will be this and this interval now cover 2,500. right.

338
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:20,000
So if the email is this one instead of this one. So now our computer will be different, because we know meal.

339
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Very likely in the in the vote, but 2,500 is also very likely in the interval. so there's not much we can say about the relationship between me and the 500 500

340
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:46,000
So, which is saying in this particular study, We do not have enough evidence to say that whether the public is healthy or not, help, it could be not healthy.

341
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:56,000
But we do not have enough evidence to save them. so there is a lack of evidence to conclude that is not healthy.

342
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Here. we think we have you not have enough to conclude so that's the difference. These 2 are not in contradiction to each other.

343
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:11,000
You could think about it right? This is like saying we have others to conclude right with confidence that the population is not healthy.

344
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Here, we are saying we do not have evidence to to make that conclusion.

345
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Well, nothing. we have come. We have have it as a common and say it is. How so?

346
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
That's the different thing right not enough evidence to say it's not healthy.

347
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
It's not the same as saying enough evidence to say it is healthy.

348
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
So that's why these 2 actually are now in contradiction to each other.

349
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Yet our conclusion is different

350
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Yeah, I know It's a little bit philosophical twisted but that's the way you know.

351
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:55,000
How how statistical difference works! Fortunately.

352
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:03,000
So there's a question in the chat Why do you or do you not have evidence to make a conclusion? right?

353
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
So the evidence are the piece of implement go from a data to summarize right.

354
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
So in the particular case, the evidence is this confident in the world.

355
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:16,000
So here, because the common interval doesn't complete part of our hydrogen, we know very likely Mu is less than 2,500.

356
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:25,000
If the population means is unhealthy no we say the population you know in general it's not healthy, and that's that's one of that.

357
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Beyond how you interpret that. But but technically we're saying the population means is unhealthy right in this case, so we have high partners, including the population meeting, is unhealthy. But here.

358
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:47,000
We don't have that confidence we don't have that piece of information, because we we, with the common interval from you, is death, and the healthy way is also in the interval right me with you in the interval healthy weight is also in

359
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
the interval. So there's not much you can say they both are in the interval.

360
00:51:51,000 --> 00:52:01,000
You cannot really say mu is less than 500 so that's why we we We have a lack of a confidence. I'm not sure whether I'm asking your question, but that's that's the way.

361
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I would put it. Thank you very much. Any other questions

362
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Okay, yeah. to my I I think one thing to remember. is that whatever conclusion would make about this study is random, which means the next study might actually have a different conclusion that's totally expected.

363
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:58,000
So the only way we do this calculation is that we wanted this conclusion to be asked bus as possible in the sense that is, it is more likely that the next study we'll get the same conclusion. rather than not but still you cannot rule out the

364
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:11,000
possibility that the next study will have a different computer, because everything is running

365
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Now let's come back, and there is this visualization of confidence in the world that's tried. you know. Hopefully, Visualization will help you understand that because I I think some people are you know more comfortable with you know verbal or

366
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
hacked Taxville interpretation. But some people are more with, you know.

367
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Giving battle with equations, but some people didn't by the way you know figures Now i'm showing a fever.

368
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
So this is a simulation, interpret and confidence interval.

369
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:50,000
So let me slow things up. So these are very busy figures.

370
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I will take a few minutes to explain that right so what's going on here?

371
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Who's that this is the figure

372
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Let me either set it up

373
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:16,000
So what's going on here? is that this this web that's the line is the population me?

374
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
So here the population mean is 0. It can be any other number it doesn't really change the fact.

375
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:41,000
But let's just say that 0 for the simplest and the population is this is, you know, fine sort of a normally distributed with a mean that's nice. that's that's put in 95 Okay, there's a lot

376
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
of turning miles. Okay. Actually, I like to reset this page.

377
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Let me let me!

378
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Okay. I guess I just cannot

379
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Okay, So the population mean is 0 right? So here we have a sample size of fine.

380
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:16,000
So what we do is, are we draw from a population of some hope size by? And then we compute the sample mean little computer, common nameable right, which is based on a standard deviation and sample.

381
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Size. So we do it many many times because we're assimilating data.

382
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:27,000
We could do it right. So each horizontal bar here is one individual study of samples as 5.

383
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:43,000
The blue circle. Here is a sample mean from that particular study. and then the the vertical bar is the confident interval from the people that are study.

384
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Actually, I don't know exactly why they have some thick thick black line and the summer narrow wise some thumb theme one.

385
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I think they they show a big one every 4. Yeah, enemy regardless.

386
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
So remember, for each sample you have a it's almost as a 5.

387
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,000
You can do the same only as common in them, other than that in the may or may not cover the population.

388
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Meeting, which is 0. So what did they do is that if the particular interval cover 0, the population means they draw a black line.

389
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Otherwise they draw a red line. So you have. You see, there are one right one, the other one right one here.

390
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Right. So, because the sample is random which means the sample mean is random.

391
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:36,000
You see there's all over the place nevertheless the sample mean somehow is always nearby.

392
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,000
The public for me. but that's not here it's not too far sometimes can go as far as here.

393
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:57,000
But it's not too far sometimes can be very close and Also there's no tendency that a blue circle is slice on one side versus the other side, so which means the sample mean is an unbiased estimate of

394
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
the population there's no bias in there right there's a variability.

395
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:11,000
But there's no bias and also you see the length of the bar which correspond to the standard arrow.

396
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:19,000
They actually change. Sometimes it's longer bar sometimes the shoulder one That's because the sample standard deviation is also random right.

397
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
The sample standard deviation will be a good approximate of the population.

398
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Standard deviation, but with sample size is small, the approximation will be inaccurate, which means the bar actually changes.

399
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Last pretty, you know, wildly

400
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
So for a particular study. you have one sample you've only got one bar.

401
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
So you can. Only I you know, if I math all the wrath of art.

402
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I only give you one bar. You actually have no idea where the population mean?

403
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Is, it could be on the left who'll be on the right of your sample.

404
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Me could be in your interval could be all 5, because if you buy chance, you pick this red bar.

405
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,000
No, Then the the population, in fact, outside you right so for a particular sample.

406
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:12,000
You actually don't know for sure whether the whether the population is in in the bar or outside the bar, or on the left on the right.

407
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:18,000
You don't know anything you just know it's nearby is not too far.

408
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Yeah, if we repeat this study like a 100 times, you see that, you know this is probably 50 times or so.

409
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:30,000
You see that only 2 out of the £50 The bar is all fine, right?

410
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:39,000
A publication meeting and most of the time. is in that's where the last 5 account for some common interval. 95% call comes from right for a particular bar.

411
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:48,000
We don't know where whether the publisher is in well, but we know most of the bars have it in there, so we have high confidence.

412
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Now let's turn them on right this shows you that the confidence, right?

413
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
No, he's 95% common them if you make it like 90%.

414
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:03,000
The bar. does Schwarzenegger. I make it 50%.

415
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
The barg got even shorter you see what's the bark of shoulder.

416
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,000
There's a higher chance. The bar doesn't cover right that's correspond to the percent of confidence.

417
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Right now only 50% of our are black 50% of red That's why we want to.

418
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:29,000
95. You could, of course, do not then almost all the Bar will power, but one of them actually still doesn't 95 is is about a good one.

419
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Secondly, if you increase your sample size

420
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I'm very excited Once you increase the sample size let's make a bigger. Let's make it 20.

421
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
You see, the new bars are shorter than the old bars, because the old bar from a sample size of 5.

422
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Now we are getting from a sample size of 20. The bars are getting shorter, and then the Samhomae are closer now to the population.

423
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Meet right that's both that's benefit from a large sample size.

424
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Yeah, we still do see robots because it's still 95% confidence, right?

425
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
So the so the blue dots are closer to the red.

426
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
That line. Oh, the bars are also shorter. So this 2 go against each other.

427
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
In the end we still have 5% of ours are red.

428
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:30,000
So, no matter how big your samples are used if you'll fix your you know confidence would be 95%.

429
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
There still will be red bars from time to time occasionally Now it's all black.

430
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Let's just wait. There will be a red bar come out from time to time.

431
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
That's just mine

432
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,000
But each part is random, so you could wait with more than 50 bars to see the next one.

433
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Could, you know. They also make cluster You know coming out 2 or 3 red bars at once.

434
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:00,000
It's all random let's make it quicker Oh, that's real quick sorry.

435
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
See there are red bars from time to time, on average, is, you know, 5% of time.

436
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:11,000
You see a red bar

437
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Okay, and if you look at the right hand side, right, not mute.

438
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Now we have run like a We have power about, like, you know, 500 bars, among them 450 have meal included.

439
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,000
17 has new Miss Overall. We are covering 96 point, 4%, so little over 95.

440
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,000
But this number is random, right. As you keep going, the coverage will be 95.

441
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Guaranteed by the theory and that's the normal distribution. That's the sampleing distribution of the company.

442
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:49,000
So hopefully this this, you know, simulation help. you understand.

443
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:58,000
The cost of the company level is really talking about when you repeat experiment many, many times, is not talking about one specific experiment.

444
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Unfortunately, with real data, we only have one bar with us so all we can say is that we have high confidence.

445
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:28,000
The meal is in it that's all question

446
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Okay, that's great. Now hopefully, this helps and also will do some exercise.

447
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:39,000
So let's pick a 10 min break and come back at the 9 38, and then continue.

448
01:02:39,000 --> 01:03:09,000
We're gonna move on to a project thank you

449
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Okay, let's continue so now let's move on to projects.

450
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Remember when we first finished 5, 8 the last time we had 5, 8, and there was one question.

451
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:51,000
We skipped It's a 2 B. which asked us to compute the 95% commentable for the publisher meeting of Pm.

452
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:57,000
10 and CEO and and also let's now try to do it.

453
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:05,000
So. So this is exactly what we talk about in in the lectures. therefore we just use the formula there.

454
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
If you still don't remember you know I will type it here, right?

455
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:15,000
So the 95% confident in the world That's just a ci more for me. I I don't.

456
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I cannot have me. I just think you equals. Remember his

457
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:45,000
The interval will be the mean minus 2 as D over square root of end, and the mean plus 2 times. I'm just called the equation here, not a deviation divided by where are Ruth about that So that. was the equation that I

458
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:56,000
gave in lectures. So all we need to do is to find the 3 quantity that we need the mean the standard deviation. the sample side for the 4 variables.

459
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I'm. gonna do it together with you for for the sake of time. I want to spend more time in a very hard room for the 5 B.

460
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:10,000
So let's you know I don't need to no which equation to use.

461
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:18,000
And then which quality to fine right this is in table 2.

462
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:27,000
So when we go to table, 2

463
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Right. There are 4 variable Pm. 10 C. O. N. O.

464
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:42,000
2, and also depending on. which one we're looking I think we are looking at the first month of parking, and see, therefore, is is the the lower half right?

465
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,000
So the mean is this: the standard deviation? is this: An sample?

466
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Size is given here in right, so we have all 3 quantity.

467
01:14:53,000 --> 01:15:03,000
So we do is that we'll basically use mean plus minus 2 standard deviation divide by square root of a lot.

468
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,000
So what we do is for the for the Pm.

469
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:17,000
10 right that's just typed or p on penn now you know the 95 what's on call See?

470
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I, for you know, Pm. 10 that would be equal to that will be 48.3 mindless.

471
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Who would times right, 16.9, divided by square root, of 9, 7, 1 58 by 90, 43 point, 3 cost 2 times 16 point, 8, 9 divided by square root, of 9, 7, 1 58 i'm.

472
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Not going to do the rest. but they're the same thing right you have you have the equation, you plug in this It's a popular.

473
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
It can be other numbers. I have to say if you use a physical software.

474
01:15:52,000 --> 01:16:01,000
The number you've got will be find it different because the software Remember, they don't use 2 use 1.9 6 blah blah blah. right?

475
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:07,000
So the number we slightly different. Well, now, with the last, they should be fairly close.

476
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:12,000
So. So for the other 3 of our 3 variable, you just get a different, mean, and different standard deviation.

477
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,000
But Assembly's actually the same so any question for this exercise.

478
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
So I'm not going to do the rest you could try if you like.

479
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:33,000
There are 3 more variables. right? Had a question. Yeah, I have to say, you never really need to do this by hand, cause all the software, even the spreadsheet.

480
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I will show you they actually can do the population for you.

481
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:40,000
You just need to identify, you know which formula to use, and which quantity the fueling which which black right eventually.

482
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:47,000
They will do this for you

483
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,000
So the second question I think i'd like some of you to answer right.

484
01:16:51,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Remember in 2 A. we ask about whether the population distribution are normally distributed, and i'll ask was that it's likely not, because the range is a metric along the mean and there seem to be all liars right especially for

485
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Pmp. so. but you know that's inconclusive, because assembly has also very huge.

486
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Right. So all I do have with that kind of samples.

487
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Nice. So the question here suppose our answer to a is correct.

488
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:27,000
So the population distribution is not normal. Then do you think the company interval we computed here are still credible.

489
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Find the sense that commit, Do we still have confidence? right?

490
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Are those? Are they still 95% high level?

491
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Do they still cover the truth? 95% of the time, yes or no.

492
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:44,000
And why.

493
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:57,000
I mean, I think I I would lean towards saying that the answer here would be Yes, just because of the way large sample size, right like the sample size makes me feel better about the chances of us.

494
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Actually up with a value that is representative of the population.

495
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:17,000
There. Yeah, thank you, absolutely. You are right, I just wanted to talk about in a more mathematically reader way, you're saying this company interval comprom the assumption, not assumption the fact that the sampling distribution is normal right?

496
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Only when it's normal we can use this to if it's not normal.

497
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:30,000
We use use other numbers? right? So the question is that if the population distribution is now normal, does the summary distribution of the sample is still normal.

498
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:36,000
The answer is Yes, because of central limit theorem karen he's not with large sample size here large you know, larger than 20.

499
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:41,000
It's good enough, larger than 50 is already you know very good. 1 100 is super good.

500
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:48,000
But now we have a sample size of 97,000, which man, you know you might be.

501
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,000
The public is highly now normal. the public, I mean, probably distributed to the part of the summer.

502
01:18:52,000 --> 01:19:02,000
We will still be perfectly normal. Pretty much right so this intervals do it's still very accurate regardless of the shape of the population.

503
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:09,000
So you may ask if the population is super highly skilled. right?

504
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Then what do you lose? right? I talk about last time, right?

505
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:21,000
If the population is hard, is you then this common interval still cover the population mean very much with 95%.

506
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,000
So that's the whole center in the theorem doesn't care.

507
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Well, the problem is that the public for me is not a good characterization of the population anymore. Right?

508
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,000
So you say, a lot of publicly mean but unfortunately publicly It's not good properization of the population.

509
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:48,000
You know, center or location in highly skilled population, you really would should care about meeting, because meeting is the sort of a 50 person town right? if you say meaning is in some interval, you know, 50% of the population are below the 50%

510
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Alabama, right, you know a lot but for me you can't really say that right?

511
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:58,000
You know the means there, but the mean could be driven by the pale, and you don't really know the ballpark of the population.

512
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Where are they Actually, by the ballpark will be way less if you think about.

513
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:16,000
If these are not pollution. But these are like, you know, like annual income, family income, that even though you do the mean something, has nothing to do with the ball part of the population, because the mean could be you know, mixed with some

514
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:21,000
billionaires and some very poor people. so you lose in interpretation for highly skilled distribution.

515
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Well, the inference is still correct. The math is still correct Well, you're just using the wrong math. there.

516
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:35,000
I'm saying, right or how is skill distribution you make inference on the mean, your invitation, your you know of the final conclusion.

517
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
It's not very useful in practice that's what you've moved.

518
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:53,000
But now, with the last, the company of those few commerce question here

519
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:07,000
So this is bye use to sign to name in theorem, and a large normalized it. doesn't seem to be like our population. is Hi this Kevin, my highest.

520
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,000
You, I mean, you know you have some poor people on some billing there, both in the population.

521
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:24,000
This is not a case right you know, from the lowest go highest. That's our there's a range of pan handful of difference that's not highly skilled right? but really high school. you Could have you know meaning is a pot

522
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
difference.

523
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:35,000
This is cute but not highly skilled I will say okay if there's no question, you know, let's go back right?

524
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:40,000
So please complete and submit 5, 8, which is still tomorrow at 8 30.

525
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Also Please do the post-acter quiz and summit tomorrow morning.

526
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:50,000
And now we are going to do 5 B. but 5 B is not required for some measure.

527
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:59,000
We just do it at an exercise Well, that's open fiveb

528
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Probably requires you know excel operation and Then it's basic to do with again with the M.

529
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Eps data. Sorry I haven't share my screen yet so it should be good now.

530
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:18,000
So 5 B still to do is have Eps data, you know you.

531
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
You need to use, excel and ask you to do capitalism.

532
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:28,000
A pito brand right? Answer some question here, compute some common in the vote right, and then answer some question here.

533
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:36,000
So there are 8 questions. so we'll do it together if you personally break our group then together, right so to do 5 B.

534
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:42,000
There are 2 spreadsheets available here. Alright, I will open them and show you how to use them.

535
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Just briefly the tunnel, the 2 scratch heat and also you need to download the Meps data right which we did lock on.

536
01:22:50,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I'm not in the show again. okay

537
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Okay, they are here right Once you follow the expression open, the first one is still the the histogram.

538
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:26,000
You still remember, I usually use to ask a question. Just copy the data in the first column.

539
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Everything will be oh, right. Another second spreadsheet is similar, Right?

540
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:43,000
If you copy the height of data here, it will tell you the mean the median of the data, the standard deviation, the mean, the max, the person, how a number of observations tell you all of this right?

541
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
And then, if I use the number, you need to compute the common anymore.

542
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Alright, that will help you answer the question. so we need this to spreadsheet to do the exercise in fivee, and then let's go ahead.

543
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Do it. So this week i'm gonna have a new randomized groups, i'll try to keep you in the same group as some of you.

544
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I just couldn't for technical reasons I apologize so any question before I send you out to breakout rooms for this, let me

545
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Okay, I recurring the rooms again, I will do 25 min

546
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
If there's no question i'll send you to the room just like last week.

547
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:51,000
But now, this week we'll have a new randomized room. so you have to go to talk with different people.

548
01:24:51,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Alright see you in the bit

549
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Okay, i'll come back I just took some time to save the precaution assignments hopefully.

550
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Tomorrow can use the same thing. So I hope you all got a chance to worldcom most, if not all of the exercises.

551
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:47,000
And now we'll go in together. you're gonna take your time to to do the things you didn't do.

552
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
But nevertheless, this one you know you don't need to submit.

553
01:51:49,000 --> 01:52:01,000
So you don't have to finish that's right So the first question based on this data right and based on the age collective, the question is, How do the data so just ages normally disability in the public or not

554
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:04,000
i'll provide both of graphical and numerical evidence for your answer.

555
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:12,000
So let's do it together for the graphic on the market evidence, and then we'll ask you know someone to tell us what you take.

556
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:17,000
So so we do. With that. We go to the the data and then take the age column.

557
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Just selective copy, and then a call with the pistol ground and then paste the heater.

558
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:33,000
So this is the Hitler Brown. So you can change the number of this if you like, you know, because there are a lot of data point.

559
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:38,000
You can change the body, I know look like this, or you can change the number.

560
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:47,000
So. do any of you think this is? Well, the other one we could do is actually copy the same column.

561
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:56,000
And going to this particular sheet, and then hey, stick here Now we got the mean, the median, and other things right.

562
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:02,000
So from either the the pistol graph, which is visual or from the salary statistics. right?

563
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Do you think age is normal or not in the anyone else will answer.

564
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Maybe from group, one

565
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Yeah, we think it's it's likely it's just like the normal normal.

566
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Not normal distribution, because the me and the medium are very close, although they are not exactly the same, and the histogram is kind of look like a bellship with the value of 40.

567
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:42,000
The 45, or 46 at approximately the

568
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:52,000
The middle of the of this histogram. but Yeah, it's just approximate to one normal distribution.

569
01:53:52,000 --> 01:54:05,000
But not exactly yeah. I know the comments.

570
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Yeah, you're right, you know this is approximate normal

571
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Well, not exactly normal, but not nothing is exactly normal. I I think the the the point here is that we know this.

572
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
So you can think about in In the population of study like this.

573
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:26,000
They will have a cut off, maybe 18 years old right that's why there are no children in the study very few, and then they probably sample the whole population.

574
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Therefore, you know you probably probably tape her off at a elderly right.

575
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Sorry it is not perfectly normal for sure but it's somehow unique model, you know. this one's probably just a randomness is a unique model, and then this doesn't skill it doesn't have a very stretch out

576
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:48,000
tail, but it's not highly skilled so for the purpose of the analysis.

577
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Right. it is. It is fine, right? it is not definitely not perfectly normal, but it's not too bad.

578
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:59,000
And also like you mentioned them. The me and the meeting are fairly close right.

579
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:04,000
And then there's no outliers right if you look at the present house and the the you know the range right.

580
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:18,000
There's no strong outliers. Oh, so I think it's a good approximation by normal any other question

581
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Alright number 2, right so based on an age Well, are your best estimates for the me, and started the vision of the age in the population.

582
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Let's calm here. So these are the sample right if I ask you the best. Ask me to me and the standard degree in the population, which number should you use group 2

583
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:50,000
We used the numbers for under mean and also the standard deviation.

584
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:56,000
So it was 46.6, one and standard deviation of 17.5, 6 perfect.

585
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Thank you. Yeah, absolutely right. So the the Sam homie and sample standard deviation are the best estimates for the population.

586
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Me and the population standardization. So it sounds very trivial, right?

587
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:09,000
So in the end, like I talk about all those phenomena in class.

588
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:12,000
But you you pretty much have no chance of using the following yourself.

589
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,000
You know that real data analysis, the software always do it for you, right?

590
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:23,000
So the key is to you know, for those of you who had the experience with physical software, they are super sophisticated. When you really use the software they give you so many option.

591
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:28,000
You want to use this app that every single one has different parameter, different output.

592
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
They give more information than the one I showed you an expression.

593
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:37,000
So. the key, you know, take home thing from this course is that you understand what they are doing, and know which number to look at.

594
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Answer the right question. But that's the crucial thing not to really remember the following little compute: this numbers Okay, any questions here

595
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Alright. Yeah, these are pretty straightforward once you know what to do.

596
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Right. So the number 3 is computer, 95% polynomial for the mean age in the population.

597
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:04,000
So the puppet the 95% common vote for the population, I mean, keep on interpretation.

598
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Let's come here again. so maybe group 3 can tell us how to do that.

599
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Let's say, let me write it you know this is a 95% calm, common in the low fall.

600
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Me right operation, I mean. So how do you do that? group?

601
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:30,000
3,

602
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:46,000
I can do this one. So we multiply the standard deviation by 2, it's a 95%, and then add or subtract from the mean the values that I got where 11.4 one and 81 point

603
01:57:46,000 --> 01:58:02,000
8. Okay, So you were doing this guy minus 2 times this guy, and then that's what I do have gotten right this guy plus 2 times.

604
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Let's go bye correct yeah anybody else got a different answer

605
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Yeah, don't you have to do over the square root of N.

606
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:28,000
So I got So i'm finding it 46 point, 2, 5 to 46.9. 8.

607
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Okay, So you are doing is equals. this guy minus 2 times this guy over square root.

608
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:47,000
This guy right? There are 3 numbers involved, bye. Just copy this one and put it here, and then change the minus the cost.

609
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Oh! sorry!

610
01:58:54,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Oh, sorry, my my back! Let me find it again, because this guy lost 2 times this guy over a square root.

611
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:16,000
That's what you got right Yeah, thank both of you i'm Sorry on the second answer is correct.

612
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:24,000
So the common interval will you know it's 2 times a standard arrow, not the standard deviation and the standard error is the standard deviation over square of the sample size.

613
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:28,000
So because the sample size is large here almost 10,000, right?

614
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Probably the voice very high, which means have high confidence that the population is actually in the same, but in a very narrow level.

615
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:44,000
That's the power level. large sample that was large sample you have a lot of information to say about the population.

616
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:51,000
So what? what's this this? is the 95 common interval for the for the data?

617
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:56,000
So exactly, you would expect 95% of the data. Why, this thing come on.

618
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:05,000
If the thing is really normal, which is also not because this almost cover all the age age, group, right?

619
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Oh, even the publishers is normal, then 90 parts within the data point here.

620
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:12,000
But this is 95% of coming over for the population mean so that's part of time.

621
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Any question.

622
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Okay.

623
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:32,000
And now the second question is interpretation of the company level.

624
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:36,000
So I know you might want to say, this is just. I have 95% confidence.

625
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:48,000
You know this the interval for the public, I mean, I want you to talk about the correct and rigorous statistical way to interpret this, although you, you, reality, will never use that. But you know for the sake of the course I want you to to say

626
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:53,000
what this interval really in a repeated sampling framework.

627
02:00:53,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Anyone. Maybe again from Group 3,

628
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Well, maybe from I don't know anybody in the cough what's the interpretation.

629
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:18,000
This interval

630
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:22,000
I can try this out I don't remember what group I was in.

631
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:39,000
But if we're basing it off of like the frequency style that you brought up earlier, wouldn't it be if we completed this experiment a 100 times 95 times our sample mean would fall in the middle or in this

632
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:44,000
confidence interval of between 46 point, 2, 4, and 46.9 7.

633
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Therefore it is a likely, like approximate estimation of population mean age.

634
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Thank you. Thank you very much. Any anyone wants to pretty much buy another.

635
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Buy, you know it's kind of twisted interpretation, so that there are many words who put it together.

636
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:07,000
They would violate, or wrongly right. I mean in reality, nobody really interpret that.

637
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Just for the sake of rigorous right.

638
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:17,000
So the right way to interpret this that again. I think you'll hold it right if we repeat the study 100 times or many, many times.

639
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Right, and each time we will compute the integral like this. use the same format on each time. we have a different interval.

640
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:30,000
If you think about it, and then the unknown population mean, we will volume that random interval.

641
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:42,000
95% of times. So it's not a sample mean by the population which is on, though so if you repeat the study medium times, I know he's kind of got a random mean interval then the unknown unknown

642
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:50,000
population will be in 95% of the needle computer, which is fairly useful because you still don't know the population right?

643
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:53,000
This whole process. Just give us confidence about this particular end.

644
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:59,000
What we compute so still. Yet we don't know where the population is Just know it's probably in the same level.

645
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Very likely. yeah. So yeah, there's there's fixed that there are randomness.

646
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:09,000
So you have to be careful with which line you know we talk about.

647
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:12,000
But you know, yeah, question Dr. Yang's have a question here?

648
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:20,000
So. does this mean that the that the population mean the actual population mean?

649
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Does this mean that it will fall between this 2 values? the 46 point, 2, 4, and point 6.9 7.

650
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:44,000
It will very likely for you but we don't know for sure you could be outside. and when you say that if I if I take samples like 100 different times, and then 26 explain that again I I didn't understand that

651
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:48,000
sure this interval just one of the bar we computed in the simulation right.

652
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:53,000
If we repeat the whole company and study a 100 times, then we got a 100 different interval.

653
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Each one is never. it's just one of the under possible intervals. So the population means somewhere.

654
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Okay to this or we don't know where it is could be in the interval, very likely to be, but also could be outside on either side.

655
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Alright. So all we can say is that if we really do the interval 100 times we've got a 100 integral.

656
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Then 95% of them will cover the true population. Okay, So we have no idea.

657
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:24,000
If this like this, 46 point, 2, 4 to 6. elector.

658
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Actual population mean false. between 46 point, 2, 4, and course 6, 9, 7, right?

659
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:33,000
We have no idea it just you know. 100 interval, Right?

660
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:36,000
If we we have 100 of them, we know 95 of them will.

661
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:40,000
However, 5 will not, but we don't know whether this is the 5 or the 95.

662
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:43,000
We will guess this is 95, but we don't know for sure.

663
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Yeah, that's the that's that's what to make the attention really tricky that's why people don't really interpret that.

664
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,000
But I just say these 95% how anymore.

665
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:56,000
But you know, at least for this particular lecture. I want you to know the underlying publication Right?

666
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Pretty Okay, and You said something about the in your lecture there was this: The thing that there was probability of 0 point 9 5.

667
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:12,000
That the population made me is in my confidence interval.

668
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:20,000
And then he said, that we shouldn't turn equate like probability with the confidence interval, I didn't understand that part.

669
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:31,000
If I don't show you anything is simple but you don't really know the the real real truth. I do I show you a different thing.

670
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:36,000
You might got confused, so that's the tricky part let me go back to to the lecture.

671
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:41,000
I know you were talking about this particular. thanks. Thanks for asking here.

672
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Right. So everything is the probability of associated i'm using the probability notation a little loosely.

673
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:54,000
I'm. Here the random thing is x bar the interval is is fixed up here.

674
02:05:54,000 --> 02:06:01,000
New is fixed. the random thing is the integral. So here is a random number fall in a fixed integral

675
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Here is a fixed number, for in a random interval, we both have 95% probability.

676
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:14,000
But they are really different things right. If you repeat the experiment like a meeting time, then this thing will vary a meeting times.

677
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:18,000
But here the interval will vary a meeting times. Okay.

678
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:25,000
So the last line, this means that the sample mean new has the probability of 0 point.

679
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:34,000
9, 5 per select of 95% to fall within this random interval is that I wouldn't put it that way.

680
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:39,000
I'm sorry i'm just saying this event this particular random event has a 95%.

681
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:53,000
What you said is now technically wrong. but it's very close to be something wrong, because you cannot really say a random chance to a fixed number of fine an interval, unless you you you specify the interval itself is random right?

682
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:58,000
So this account is random. So this event happening with 95%, however.

683
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Yes. Well, I wouldn't say me far in the interval because Mu is fixed.

684
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Oh, okay, So okay, Okay, I get it now. Okay. So the the probability of this interval is okay. Okay, I get it.

685
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:18,000
So the wrong way to say, in this type you know you don't want to say there, Okay, let me go on to say right?

686
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:25,000
You cannot say new, for in this particular interval with 95% probability, because this interval is not random.

687
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Once you have the number. it's already fixed Yes, if you consider interval to be random, then.

688
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Yes, you're right. 95% chance for you know random but the random interval is a very hard concept, so so little bit twisted, a little bit tricky.

689
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:47,000
There. So that's why, in the end we don't say this is a 95% probability interval.

690
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:53,000
We say it's a 95% confidence in the whole, because the invoice all was given is no longer random.

691
02:07:53,000 --> 02:08:01,000
It's only random before you realize it Yeah, it's only random before you really see the data right?

692
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Once you see, the data is already given

693
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Yeah, I don't want to sort of a angle here, but too long in the end.

694
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:19,000
You know this is 95%. How common them all and the mu is very much likely in there.

695
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:32,000
I think that's the take home message, but you know be careful how how you put the if you want to use the rigorous probability statement, you'd be very helpful, because there are like I would say although not all the 100 way, you'll

696
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:37,000
put the senders maybe 9 if I have them are wrong right so it's very easy to get it wrong.

697
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
So don't don't try them until unless you are very short.

698
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:44,000
But you know you're getting the right answer but Nevertheless, you know, this is 95% call in the moment.

699
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Okay, Any question.

700
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Alright, so I will. I will write it here right So the invitation right, I would say, the 95%.

701
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:14,000
How many in the world or confidence interval for the population team?

702
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Right. 8. Yes, let me find a numbers. this tool right?

703
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:32,000
You know. Let's just make it simple right bonnie 6.2, 5 to

704
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:49,000
That's true. 20 45 who will find who are 46, all right, 43.3 to 4, 7.0

705
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:54,000
I don't know how to do it

706
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Why is there on the table

707
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:06,000
And I the interpretation is that in? repeated Tom.

708
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Honey. 95% of all of those in the voice computed, like, you know, using this matter right well include the true population, right?

709
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:36,000
So that's the right way of saying it of course there are different way of saying the same sentence.

710
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
But most of the way, if you vary too much you would be wrong with the same right.

711
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:46,000
So really it's talk about frequency frequency you have to do, repeated sampling the most time you each time.

712
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:53,000
Will you compute the random, confident in the book and not if 5% of time they will cover it right.

713
02:10:53,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Really it's 95% of common computer using this matter, when we include the true population in which is unknown.

714
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Yeah, for the sake of you know. course I put a sentence here.

715
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Just be careful if you don't if you want to stay here.

716
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:12,000
But really, really in practice, nobody really need to say it alright that's cool.

717
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:19,000
But down here right? repeat a question for family income, and repeat the question for Mandela House.

718
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Let's now do it very quickly, so 4 4 can you sort of go over the question.

719
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:32,000
1, 2, 3 for family income

720
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Oh, I could try for a family income. I said that

721
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:59,000
There is a descript there's a larger gap between the mean and in the median and so when you look at the histogram it's very I mean it's drastic that the numbers and in

722
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:14,000
terms of the main and standard deviation. I got the 62.9, one for the main 57.4 3 for the standard deviation.

723
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Cool. I don't know you find me getting the same number thanks so much.

724
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:28,000
I'm our just reviewing right So I just call copy the family income, and then to the scratch he, you're absolutely right, you know.

725
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:34,000
See that distribution is skilled to the right right and

726
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:40,000
And then the description right. So here the mean and the Median, they are fairly different.

727
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Right, and then the standard division did I mean I I guess I just didn't follow the number.

728
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Did you say this cool? Then you are perfectly correct.

729
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Actually. Yeah, thanks. No one actually I don't you know because I I have the parameter here.

730
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Let's do this one. This is wrong, and then this actually gives the common number for the mean right.

731
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:11,000
So the formula is still there. So it's not it works so that also passes the question number 3 right?

732
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:17,000
So the question part of the question number 3 is that that yemen I didn't have the question right.

733
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:25,000
But now the population is now normal, right at least this more non normal than the age, right?

734
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Because it's steel, and because the mean is is then, and the and meeting or not there you know how far away right?

735
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:38,000
And then you see the range right? Go up to 500. right?

736
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:50,000
So this is not a extremely skilled case, but definitely more skilled than the age, and I mentioned that anything to do with money with economics tend to have a highly, You know, a right scale to distribution.

737
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Now the question is that human is not normal. if this comedy was still valid.

738
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:01,000
That's a that's a add on question but I want anyone to think about him.

739
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Let me know. Given a you know, population, distribution or income, family income is skill to the right.

740
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Is this common interval for the population meet this time on income still valid

741
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:24,000
I would say no, cause there seems to be some outliers.

742
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:39,000
That significantly alter the the mean. Any other answers

743
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:51,000
I i'm not sure but I thought I remember us we were talking about how you could still make statistical inference, even if the even if the population is not perfectly normally distributed.

744
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:59,000
So it's Still, useful. is it. valid i'm not sure. Okay, thank you both of you. I i'll i'll go this this way. right?

745
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:02,000
So that's why I want to repeat it because I think these are important.

746
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:06,000
But if if by valid we mean, does it still cover the poverty for me With this?

747
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:16,000
You know the expected covering, you know. probability. The answer is, Yes, because central limit theorem will work extremely well on this large sample size.

748
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:22,000
So, even if the population is highly non-normal, the pop, the sample, mean, will still be very normal.

749
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Given the large sample size. So this yes, we'll cover the public unknown population mean with a very good a chance, for example, here the population.

750
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:37,000
No, there is a sample mean that for the population we we know very likely, probably in this very high level.

751
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:41,000
So in that sense mathematics is still bad. So what do we lose here?

752
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:58,000
I think, interpretation. so even though you know the population is very much in here, because the population is still so knowing the population means of a skill that you're using it's not that much useful it is still useful for nothing but that.

753
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:12,000
much useful, because you see the meetings 47, right? So when I talk about all the average family income is probably between 61 point, 7 and 64.1, while the meeting is 47, which means 50% of family are lower than

754
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:19,000
47. Now we'll talk about the average is 61. There's a discrepancy there, right?

755
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:23,000
When we talk about average, we're thinking about the typical family in the population.

756
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:32,000
But now the typical family is way below the me. The typical family is probably recognized by the medium much better than I mean.

757
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:37,000
So the mean here is much higher than a meeting, simply because there are some very rich family like this one.

758
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:42,000
The income is, you know, 521 I think it's 1,000 right?

759
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Is you need a $1,000. Yeah, we're not even including a billionaires in the in the data set.

760
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:59,000
If there's a beating there then the medium and then the mean would be way much higher than nice right so the indifference on the population, I mean, mathematically speaking, is still valid.

761
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:03,000
But just in this case the mean doesn't really say much about the typical family in the population.

762
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:12,000
I think that's your original question. while we answer right when we talk about the average family income, we need to talk about average the ballpark of population.

763
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:17,000
But unfortunately, in this case, the mean is now very representative of the all part of the population.

764
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:23,000
The meeting is, Does that answer You know all of your your your thoughts, or Dallas?

765
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Or are there any other comments or questions on this

766
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:51,000
So that's why you know from Now, on if you'll see a news article. you see a study saying particular policy increase the average family income or things like those right you need to really have to think about yourself whether that's useful

767
02:17:51,000 --> 02:18:12,000
for now it could be also could not right. If I, if some State has a policy, make the rich richer, that could also make the average income higher by May, actually may not make the the the you know the the Ballpark of the population richer at

768
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:15,000
all.

769
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Right. So increasing. Increasing average family income may or may not be used for in changing everyday life of a you know, typical population, because the distribution is still

770
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:34,000
So that that also apply to some. You know, tax policy right?

771
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:38,000
If the tax policy reduce the tax for high income population.

772
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:42,000
No, it has nothing to do with the rest of the conversation.

773
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:49,000
Right, but the mean will still change right. but a meeting will not be impacted right.

774
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:54,000
So so in those kind of population me and the meeting are quite different. So you have to think about which one I want to focus on.

775
02:18:54,000 --> 02:19:01,000
It's easy to study the mean because The Mean is easy to measure, but sometimes meeting is a better characterization.

776
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:05,000
It's very hard to after you change in a meeting because meeting is more robust. right?

777
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:11,000
So change the meeting. You need to change the ballpark the population. that's much harder from a policy point of view.

778
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:20,000
That's why sometimes they say the mean? But you have to Ask yourself, are they really doing the thing you you are you know, expecting them to do?

779
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:23,000
You may or may not have nothing. All of them are not useful.

780
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Some of them are, but it's hard to see just from the meeting.

781
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Okay, Any question.

782
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Thank all of you I think it's time to take another break, and then we will continue for 5, 6, 7 8.

783
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Alright, let's take another 5 min Break and Come back and 1055.

784
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Thank you very much

785
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Okay, that's continue

786
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Sorry I have forgotten live transcript I Don't know why it's not showing up.

787
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Can you hear me? Yeah, We can hear you. Okay. Cool: alright.

788
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:44,000
So number 5 is the same question, or for Mendel House with someone from Group 5.

789
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:50,000
And for this Thank you

790
02:29:50,000 --> 02:30:06,000
I'll be doing the calculation a lot of high

791
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:18,000
I think the mean that we got was 2 point, 1, 3 median of 2 standard deviation of 1 point o one, and then a confidence interval of 2 point, 1, one to 2 point, one.

792
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:41,000
If so, Yeah, thank you. So what what about a normal normality Question.

793
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:45,000
Approximately, normally distributed, but also skewed to the right.

794
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:53,000
Yeah, Yeah, this is this distribution. Thank you. This is to be somewhere in between the the age and the family income.

795
02:30:53,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Right is sort of a skill to the right, and but not as bad as the income.

796
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:10,000
You know it's definitely not normal. but but for the purpose of our inference is probably fine, because you know it's It's the discrete distribution only take a virus.

797
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:14,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, So, even though it's still it's not extremely skilled. right.

798
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:23,000
You don't have value like a 50 or 500 I don't have extreme outliers, and then, although it's not symmetric although it's not symmetric.

799
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:32,000
But let me and meeting are not so far apart right last time you know me are fairly close.

800
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:42,000
I would say it's not normal twice close thank you and the common in the voice Here, right, let's go back.

801
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:49,000
So the next question asking a colleague of yours we call from this to the cost that not if 5% common number required data come from the normal.

802
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:54,000
So he's concerned not a validity of all the common intervals.

803
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:59,000
Right, so explain what are the concerns already in the now?

804
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:02,000
So I think I already talk about this in the previous session.

805
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:16,000
So the answer is that this common intervals they are still valid because they do not really rely on the population being perfectly normal, they are good as far as the sample size is large, so that central limit theorem works right So with *.

806
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:20,000
Met theorem when the sample has large, even though the population is not normal.

807
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:27,000
The sample mean? the summary distribution is still normal, so that that's where the 95% come from, you know, will come from.

808
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:34,000
So the common level is still violent. What really what you really need to worry about is that what the population means?

809
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:57,000
Is the right answer to activate for your population so that's. the question of the interest like once you decide to make inference on population mean, then, this approach is about as well as your samples as a large any question here

810
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:04,000
So personally. when now you you you tell me something to do with like income or or or money, right?

811
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:09,000
My first question will be, What about a meeting right I I not only I won't known the mean.

812
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:18,000
I also want to know the meeting to make my own call cause the mee might me leave you So that's my personal pay.

813
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:24,000
Okay, and then number 7. now 7 and 8 are again about the interpretation.

814
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:34,000
I think that's the crucial part of this course So let's you know, walk through them. You are reading your favorite news website, which stays a study found that the average family has an income.

815
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:44,000
Of 65,000. I look at the wording right average income right? no, it's not really the habits average Us.

816
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Family, You know you have to think about. What does average Us family mean as income of 65,000, based on how the value of computing the question.

817
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:55,000
For do you feel there is a conflict between your results and the study?

818
02:33:55,000 --> 02:34:00,000
You read about the Internet right? If so, what might be the source?

819
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:07,000
So let's let's go back to the you know to the this statistics.

820
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:10,000
So this about a family income in the unit of 1,000. right?

821
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:18,000
So the article says, the average family maritime family has an income of 64,000, a 65,000.

822
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Do you agree that with that news or not? and why? there is no correct answer here.

823
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:32,000
I just want to hear North and your call anyone from the call. I want more than one of you to try to answer this question.

824
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:38,000
If you're still look the palm this interval is 61 point, 7 to 64, and all the number here.

825
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:41,000
And the news article saying: The average family America. a Us.

826
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:49,000
Family has income of 65,000. So anyone wants to try, I said.

827
02:34:49,000 --> 02:35:05,000
All our our group said the conflict. was due to income being the type of data where it's always gonna be skewed like if you have a normal population and then someone in our group like talked about elon

828
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:17,000
musk like that data point will immediately skew the data and make make it seem like It's within the interval.

829
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:47,000
Thank you. Yeah, like your answer. Anybody else wants to try Answering this

830
02:35:49,000 --> 02:36:03,000
Okay, you know, I think there are many layer, several layers that several angle answering the question right just from this interval you can see 65,000 is not in the interval.

831
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:15,000
So if this sample either simple random sample, then either the new report is wrong, or we are very unlucky to to to hit, you know.

832
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:26,000
What does it include the population in so that's layer one answer later to answer is that these are likely for this sample to be simple random sample, right?

833
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:35,000
Because this sample was drawn to study the medical expanded it's not drawing to study the population income. right?

834
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:38,000
So this is unlikely to be a simple, random sample for the whole Us.

835
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:42,000
Population. Anyway, i'm getting a whole us you know population would be very hard.

836
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:48,000
And anyway, so this sample probably be biased little or small, in that size.

837
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:55,000
You know the the fact that 65,000 is not interval, but right on the boundary right outside is also hiding right?

838
02:36:55,000 --> 02:37:01,000
Maybe the 6 to 5,000 number is not wrong, but because assembly is is slightly biased.

839
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:06,000
Therefore, the interval doesn't contain alcohol You know 62,000 versus 6 5,000.

840
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:10,000
It's not that much a difference right so from here to here.

841
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:17,000
You could expect a variation like that so so it's a second later in the patrons that all those 65,000 is not in the interval.

842
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:27,000
It's not that big of deal that's a second layer The third layer of you know inhabitation is my favorite.

843
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Is that here? you say the average Us family had an income.

844
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:41,000
What do you really mean by average uf us? If you average myself together with Bill Gates, then the average will be like several.

845
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:47,000
Billy is not a really average. Personally, I would really take the average, or I would say the typical right.

846
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:50,000
When you say the average family, you tend to think about the mean.

847
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:55,000
But here we're not talking about the average income we're talking about average family right?

848
02:37:55,000 --> 02:38:01,000
I would really think about a typical Us family. Well, everyday family would draw randomly.

849
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:07,000
Now for those kind of questions. I would really much interest in the meeting rather than the mean.

850
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:11,000
Now, you see, the meeting is actually 47,000 is way lower than 65,000.

851
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:19,000
I would think of the Median family income is more typical for for a typical American family than a than a mean.

852
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:26,000
I mean in this size looking at a that mean income is just it's actually just not the the right point to look at.

853
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:30,000
If you look at the meeting right, there are statistical methods to look at a meeting.

854
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:35,000
The computer company know for the meeting I I will very much interested in dialogue rather than I mean.

855
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:41,000
So that's the third layer of invitation so there are many different hands that people are not what are you looking at.

856
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:50,000
Right. So this interval is not wrong. assuming the the sample is oh, it's right now. The sample is now likely to be random.

857
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:54,000
Then the interval may be a little off. but all of these are just answering the wrong question.

858
02:38:54,000 --> 02:39:07,000
If you really want to look at a meeting any comma

859
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:17,000
So not saying the some of the I guess some of the interpretation of this is is sort of based on who it's aimed at. right?

860
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:38,000
So the news articles in the quote the average American right? And so when they read, when they read that the you know the 65,000, I think they like you just said they will be looking at or thinking of the mean and then in actuality this would make more sense if it was

861
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:46,000
the the distribution of that particular variable right in on our population.

862
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:51,000
So so I guess from a I guess from one more learn it's there.

863
02:39:51,000 --> 02:40:11,000
When after this class, you know, if if we were to do anything, would it be better to help the news media and choosing better words right as a as in being more accurate, not saying average, but your typical us family right

864
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:15,000
Yup: Yeah, absolutely right. I mean, this is your Us family.

865
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:21,000
I think most people think about the typical Us. family, but they should really say the average income of all the Us.

866
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:28,000
Family, not the average family, but rather every income. Then that will be mathematically correct. Right?

867
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:32,000
I have an income of all. The Us. family is not the same as average to family.

868
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:35,000
You know this average is not a mathematical average in my understanding.

869
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:43,000
It's sort of a typical us family in that sense there's a little bit mystery meeting here, that's that, you know.

870
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:47,000
You can say they're right I mean they use the work in in their choice of work, right?

871
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:54,000
But but still, I think whenever I see income, I would more be more interesting medium rather than me.

872
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:57,000
In that sense we should let the news news. report.

873
02:40:57,000 --> 02:41:01,000
Also know that back right? then the average, you know, sometimes instantly.

874
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:04,000
So there are many layer of things that can be improved.

875
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:11,000
The Paul right? This is better than nothing on the meeting would be better than than this, and the better wording of this will be better than this. right?

876
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:20,000
So So yeah, you're actually right there there are ways to improve this

877
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:28,000
Yeah, you know. think about the joke I made about my friend right when you when you go on a Wall Street firm, you want to ask on the medium bonus.

878
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:32,000
Not the the the average bonus, because you are average with your CEO. right?

879
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:35,000
So you can have. You had much less than you would expect.

880
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:39,000
But the media will be more typical number for you to get so same thing here.

881
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:46,000
Anything to do with money. Be careful, i'm not only money right any variable you suspect, to be highly wisep.

882
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:53,000
Be careful.

883
02:41:53,000 --> 02:42:06,000
Any other comments

884
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:15,000
Okay, So now, question number 7 right what's the practical in terms of melody of the company, you're computing a classroom part right?

885
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:27,000
Does it make sense, you know Question 5 is about manual health, but doesn't make sense. we'll talk about populating. I mean with this variable.

886
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:33,000
Let's go back here. So this is the common level for the mental health.

887
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:37,000
Remember a month Old House has a discrete distribution right from one to 5.

888
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:44,000
It's all in no data really so is this into combinable interpretable.

889
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:53,000
Well, how important was it so? anyone else will answer

890
02:42:53,000 --> 02:43:06,000
Yeah, I can go for that. it does not make sense because perceived mental health is a quality variable is variable.

891
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:14,000
Yeah, thank you. Let's go back I think when you go back to the Paula Mandals right the dictionary.

892
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:24,000
Well, I know how. Here is a score from one to 5 is, you know, excellent, good, good, a very good good parent, for right.

893
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:30,000
It's facing a ordinary or quality variable but we code it from one to 5.

894
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:38,000
So this kind of variable, although you can trade them as as new mark that's coordinated. You can still computer me on the meeting.

895
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:45,000
There's nothing wrong with the math about you know there's something wrong with the Internet page, and I would say no.

896
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:57,000
In the mean, in this variable it's still better than nothing, but not as useful as at the number of age or even income right, because those at least those are coordinate, variable right?

897
02:43:57,000 --> 02:44:05,000
We know the population. Me for Mandel House could be 2 point, 1, 3, while we know 2 is very good, 3 is good.

898
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:09,000
So this is more more close to, very good rather than good.

899
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:19,000
So we know the average population, mandal. house is probably very good. But there, there, there's a lot of you know Stretch going on here in interpreting that right?

900
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:24,000
Because why did you choose? My question is, why did you choose this 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 on this scale?

901
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:32,000
In the first place, right? What if you have a you choose like only 4 level or 6 level, or you don't code them up that way?

902
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:38,000
Things will change that. there's a lot of arbitraryness right by treating those them as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

903
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:49,000
You are essentially assuming the gap between this 5 level are equal and that's a very strong assumption that you make a very subjective call.

904
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:57,000
Right, I would think, between poor to good it's much bigger distance than between good to excellent Amanda.

905
02:44:57,000 --> 02:45:02,000
How right as fine as you all Bob good I don't worry too much about you.

906
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:06,000
Right 5 is fair. I start a war if it's poor I really worry about you right?

907
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:11,000
I don't really care whether you're very good or excellent. you mean no health, at least from my personal point of view.

908
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:18,000
Right, so I don't really see this particular you know coding scheme a scoring scheme to be very useful in invitation.

909
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:25,000
So tell me, under this scheme the population in this tool I don't really buy them off right?

910
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:31,000
So the answer is in cover. The ability of This result is way much less than those for the previous 2 questions.

911
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:36,000
I wouldn't say is not useful at all because that's a very strong statement.

912
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:40,000
I would say this is much less useful, not a positive, variable.

913
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:46,000
Any comments.

914
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:51,000
So a better question. you know let's talk about let's don't just criticize right so that the patient would like to criticize.

915
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:59,000
Hello, let's make constructive so jasmine right? If we were to analyze this data, what battery is that of the the mean?

916
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:02,000
We just did right. What other statistic, what other way you want to look at it?

917
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:12,000
The mind of how data anyone.

918
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:28,000
And I think I think if you were like an employer you'd wanna look at the folks that were 4 or 5 right tes out that data, and then potentially, see if there are any variables that correlate with their

919
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:33,000
saying the 4 or 5 right? Are they doing certain jobs? Are they?

920
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:49,000
In certain states of health or certain incomes, because those are the ones you are sort of concerned about in this particular variable right like we're concerned about those that. have below quote average or good mental health exactly.

921
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:57,000
I totally agree with you Personally, I would very much look at the people who have 4, you know, especially 5, 5 right mental health scores.

922
02:46:57,000 --> 02:47:03,000
And then, you know, isolate them. Look at their other property, Basically, first of all, how many of them in the population right?

923
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:16,000
And then look at other variables associated with them to think about right? So that's the question. I I really don't really care whether you are excellent or very good I personally to me that that make no difference Yeah, any

924
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:22,000
other path I mean i'm not a you know psychiatrist or psychology is a whatsoever.

925
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:26,000
So i'm just talking as a late person but if they're expert in the room.

926
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:36,000
No study man, no house, Maybe you can educate us how how you guys deal with this or it doesn't have to be an expert right, and anyone has any thought about it.

927
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:56,000
I want to learn from you

928
02:47:56,000 --> 02:48:11,000
I'm sorry I I missed the the what the question was, Yeah, the question is, you know, I I just wonder whether there anyone has any idea, or thoughts or experience or expertise in dealing with mandal health data and you know Besides, school

929
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:17,000
you know, scoring them from one to 5. On taking the mean, which is a very bad approach, we just pop it up.

930
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
Are there any better way of dealing with this this particular?

931
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:28,000
You know, kind of data, It might not help your experience

932
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:41,000
I know. I know a lot of the instruments that We deploy to determine somebody's mental health where that be psychological distress, anxiety, repression.

933
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:50,000
They often use like scales. and and basically although you just said it's kind of bad, but the you usually the greater the score.

934
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:57,000
And again, greater mental health concerns in those domains so i'm not sure What if there's a better way to really collect that data?

935
02:48:57,000 --> 02:49:00,000
But I and you make them a parameter insight on ways.

936
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:10,000
We could do that. but from what you're saying and most of the skills such as the ads or or or other ones, they kind of collect a basic overall score.

937
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:17,000
And then they evaluate that usually by saying that either greater or lower indicates greater or less psychological concerns. Hmm.

938
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:24,000
Thank you you're saying people still do this like our score and take the me and see why doesn't mean change or things like those. right?

939
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Thank you very much that's very good to know yeah I mean I think for good or for bad. right.

940
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:42,000
This this whole analysis. Talk about making inference around the me which will stick, keep doing all has been the most widely used tool in statistics for more than half a century, even more than one century.

941
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:49,000
I don't know exactly the history. right so you just take there because the tool was developed many, many years ago by famous people, mathematicians.

942
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
That edition and the central limit Theorem is so strong, Right?

943
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:56,000
People has a lot of mathematical confidence about making the inference on the mean.

944
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
So just mathematically very convenient. So people just stick to it right.

945
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:04,000
And if you see, you know, basically, you know, when you divide a new study or like, look at the whole paper.

946
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:08,000
Give they use some approach you might to continue using it right that's why?

947
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:18,000
Because done maybe more. I I what i'm trying to Say, is that this whole approach making inference on the mean, maybe use more than this should have been right.

948
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:30,000
You you, you not your family income. They should I look at a median. But most people don't really know how to make inference on a meeting, so they still do the mean also you might know how right they should have Maybe you know maybe better

949
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:35,000
have analyzed the data as a categorical variable. But that's just mathematically most sophisticated.

950
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:42,000
So they again, they usually like, for, like her score and Then look at the mean that's just mathematically convenient. right?

951
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:46,000
So for many reason, people still analyze the data this way again it's definitely useful.

952
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:53,000
It's better than not doing it. i'm not saying there are battle ways of leaving with this kind of data.

953
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:56,000
So that's why you know introduction to statistic is still helpful.

954
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:59,000
So for you to know there are things out there right? You think.

955
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:04,000
Think again before you decide on the Korean scheme, you know, study design also.

956
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:16,000
Now, analysis, plan. I have a question so you said that there are better ways to capture somebody's basically anxiety or depression or other mental health concerns.

957
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:28,000
What ways do you suggest that? that we start to deploy to kind of get a better representation of those facets that we're trying to do with good question.

958
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:34,000
So yeah, i'm not really you know branching out talking about other like depression or other scores.

959
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:41,000
You could do that. But you right now, the same thing in yeah, you have to, you know, somehow code them as different, like a microscope or something like that, right?

960
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:44,000
Because those are not measured, you cannot measure the depression contains.

961
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:49,000
It like you will measure block pressure right you have to ask question that's right.

962
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:56,000
So you yeah, you i'm not with a question like it mayor like this, for whatever my number house trace you are measuring right?

963
02:51:56,000 --> 02:52:07,000
And then you end up with course like one to 3 for fine But i'm just saying that beyond the size just looking at your mean right, There are better ways of dealing with this kind of a qualitative data.

964
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:12,000
I will talk about later later. For example, using some sort of other categorical data.

965
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:17,000
Analysis, like high school, has a other thing There you can read it itself.

966
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:22,000
How many people are in poor condition versus fair versus, you know Google auto, or better good.

967
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:33,000
Essentially, you can really look at each level by myself, or or if I merge different levels in a way that you think is a magically, or you know, whatever clinically.

968
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:43,000
Useful or interpretable right. For example, Personally, if you really care about people who are you fair or poor condition?

969
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:49,000
Right. you should really group those, or better than good and Then analyze the data, as I call categorical data using the matter.

970
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:54,000
I'm going to talk about later this week right I'll talk about this?

971
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:59,000
How do we deal with categorical data Okay, thank you You're?

972
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:11,000
Welcome any other password here.

973
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:18,000
Okay.

974
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:26,000
Let me call them

975
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:37,000
So remember to turn in 5 a and the quiz which is deal tomorrow, and if you are interested I don't have time, but not, you know I think it's kind of boring but I don't have time to go over if you go to the

976
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:44,000
homepage, and then scratch each right last time I mentioned. There are 2 spreadsheet blue, I mean a simulation with Sandra limit theorem.

977
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:54,000
That's another 2 dealing with confidence interval with normal and the non-normal here a particular exponential samples, just to show you how central limit theorem works.

978
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,000
Right, so which means even the population is not normal. the central limit.

979
02:53:56,000 --> 02:54:04,000
Theorem still have very good coverage i'm not going to do that, because I already did the you know the fancy similar right?

980
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:09,000
You could look at this if you're interested but this are not that crucial to our learning.

981
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:13,000
So i'm gonna skip them and now let's move on to lecture.

982
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:23,000
6 is on how positive testing. So we're gonna talk about this for you know I I wouldn't be able to finish.

983
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:32,000
I'll start and then finish tomorrow. Okay, hypothetizing is a second.

984
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:37,000
Why did he use, maybe even more widely used and confidentable way of making statistical inference?

985
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
So there are 2 major way of making the for us.

986
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:44,000
How about testing and commonly available, so that's why we're talking about them.

987
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:55,000
So the remember the confidence interval. give us a qualitative sort of a range of, or the pro plausible value for the population parameter to lie in.

988
02:54:55,000 --> 02:55:03,000
In this particular case, population mean, or we could actually construct, combinable for other quantity of the population parameter.

989
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:20,000
Nevertheless, it's very useful but Now, with the last Sometimes we make inference for us to make a decision right use example of a clinical trial, for, like a covid vaccine right from that kind of clinical trial we'll collect

990
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:24,000
a lot of data. In the end we can analyze the data and make conclusion.

991
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:29,000
For example, we could say the fact side or the you know you've fact.

992
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:37,000
Given this, I think people call the application of of of the vaccine could be between some interval right now.

993
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:51,000
Those are common interval. For more importantly, if you think about a regional goal running a single trial, is that in the end they have to make a decision right? What to approve the vaccine, or now, so in the end is A binary

994
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:57,000
decision. Not rely on the data. Once you have a binary decision. you don't mind right.

995
02:55:57,000 --> 02:56:01,000
You will feed all that. Some other type of viewers may be more useful.

996
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:08,000
That's what we we talk about here is to have other passing Okay, So we review what we learned earlier.

997
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:17,000
Right. The sample by itself is not of interest. It just a means for us to collect information, to study the population which we do not.

998
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:22,000
Observe, we would like to infer something from the sample.

999
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:27,000
What a popular am I look like? right? Sometimes we have a puppet in a parameter.

1000
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:33,000
Want to know autable around it. but sometimes we also ask a question about the population.

1001
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:37,000
Well as for the question, we said Yes, No answer. Okay. this time.

1002
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:42,000
We just wait, or again study the population mean because that's very easy to study.

1003
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:45,000
But later on, this whole framework a pop of common interval.

1004
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:51,000
And about tapping can be used to study other quantities of the population.

1005
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:57,000
So in this case, again, we use the notation x bar it's a sample. Mean assax the sample standard deviation. right?

1006
02:56:57,000 --> 02:57:02,000
These are the things you measure, and these are the things which are random.

1007
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:10,000
If you consider, you know, the repeated phone model, they have their own standpoint distribution in the population.

1008
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,000
There are parameters of interest like a mule. Sigma.

1009
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:22,000
Those are fixed but unknown quantity. These are not random, so these are known and random, and no, and measure, these are unknown.

1010
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:33,000
Yeah, but you know but fixed and of the interest now let's say we mostly interest in the meal because it rarely. Even now I rarely.

1011
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:37,000
We are interesting signal, or rather say my tangled with the mule.

1012
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:40,000
So we need to deal with. but the real type parameter.

1013
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:50,000
Yeah, is the new where to the population you so that's why we cost Sigma a nuisance problem, which is a problem which is there we need to deal with it.

1014
02:57:50,000 --> 02:58:03,000
But it's not a major interest so let's always say we want to see why the meal take a specific value or not.

1015
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:08,000
So we have a hot poppy box you we'll like to confirm with the data.

1016
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:16,000
So we either want to confirm or have all of this, or more important than want to reject apologies.

1017
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:24,000
Okay, For example, suppose the population is 6 year old children living poverty in us.

1018
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:30,000
That's supposed to be all parameter is the mule which is the mean number of charities by H.

1019
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:37,000
6. So for some reason we think this parameter is of how many, how important?

1020
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:43,000
Oh, how probably is that a new is 8, which means that we assume in this particular.

1021
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:48,000
You know, population, which are 6 year old children living in poverty right?

1022
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:54,000
We cannot possibly measure every single one of them. but this population nevertheless exist.

1023
02:58:54,000 --> 02:59:01,000
I've been. if we were to be able to measure that we would know the mean number of carriers key.

1024
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:07,000
We assume the population is 8. No, let's collect data to see why this assumption is right or wrong.

1025
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:12,000
So that's hypothetical you need to have a hypothetical in mind.

1026
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:18,000
We call it no apologies. I mean, we collect data to see whether that is right or wrong.

1027
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:29,000
No, I have this right or wrong. Okay, again, let me know if I have any questions.

1028
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:37,000
No, let's move on so the way we do that we use. We use this statistical have all passing framework right?

1029
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:45,000
And then we compare the null hypothesis with this contrary statement, which will usually call the alternative hypothesis.

1030
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:51,000
So there's a null have opted there's a ton of the contradictory.

1031
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:58,000
We talked right, so one of them must be right. One of them must be wrong.

1032
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:02,000
So in this particular case the know about the same mu equals 8.

1033
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:09,000
Then the alternative is that Mu is not importantly There are contradictory for each other. they're a company metric.

1034
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:13,000
We try to. they cannot both be right at the same time.

1035
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:16,000
Yet one of them must be right, so the notation H.

1036
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:20,000
Stands for hypothesis. H not thanks for the know.

1037
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:24,000
How about this? H. 8 that's Why the alternative will have office?

1038
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:34,000
Sometimes people use h naught H. 1 0, and one, but sometimes people use H* either way. just a no patient difference.

1039
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:39,000
Of course we can say nothing about this until we have some evidence, Right?

1040
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:47,000
The evidence come from the data. So again, we need to design the experiment to collect the data and then measure the observations in the sample.

1041
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:52,000
And then, you know, summarize the data to set to to to has our questions right?

1042
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:59,000
How our goal is to determine whether or not our data support either of these hypothesis.

1043
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:09,000
You put it's not okay, you know you could say because these 2 are complementary, right?

1044
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:14,000
Saying one you're saying for the other anyway. but you will see later on.

1045
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:19,000
These 2 are not so so symmetric. Think about the case.

1046
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:27,000
H Naught is a is a point sharp. All of this we saying, mule equals some mu equals some guy.

1047
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:31,000
Take a point of view that's why it's called the Polyh office.

1048
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:40,000
But the alternative. Exactly everything, all of the agents here in the attorney who doesn't really take any specific value.

1049
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:49,000
I'm you can take anything other than hey? so this for now. So in symmetric, I will show some analogy later on.

1050
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:53,000
But now on the left there's some design fourth will achieve some goal.

1051
03:01:53,000 --> 03:02:00,000
So usually I was. I'm saying usually we collect data trying to reject H*.

1052
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:07,000
You favor of Hh. i'll turn up you pay okay that's the usual design.

1053
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:13,000
So usually we design this framework. Trying to save the null is wrong.

1054
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:17,000
Therefore the alternative must be true, or very likely to be true.

1055
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:26,000
So really we want to establish the truth of the target rather than the truth of the the No cause.

1056
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:31,000
Usually we set it up so that we want to show the no it's not true.

1057
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:41,000
I'll show example later. on i'll make it more clear just pair with me that there is a asymmetry building in this framework question.

1058
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:48,000
So far.

1059
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:57,000
Alright. Now I'm using a knowledge right which is not a perfect analogy, because at any time you'll make a knowledge.

1060
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:59,000
You you have to make some assumption, anyway. but this is you know.

1061
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:17,000
I think that's a fairly good amount how about testing in size is analogous to how us criminal core system, Maybe another country, as well determined, is built right with someone going on port in the Yeah, you know the judge or the jury.

1062
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:24,000
Has to make a decision on whether the dependent is either unison or guilty Right?

1063
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:28,000
So here let's say the h not is innocent hey?

1064
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:34,000
You will see there is some asymmetry building right?

1065
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:38,000
This tool hypothesis, or just like our hypothesis.

1066
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:43,000
These 2 are exclusive right. Only one can be true.

1067
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:49,000
Both cannot be twice the same time, and also one has to be true.

1068
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:59,000
But there are. They are asymmetric in the means that we all know right, depending on, of course, depend on the kind of file right whether the civil trial or a criminal file.

1069
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:04,000
But now, with the last right, the defendant was assumed.

1070
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:11,000
Innocent bye default until proven guilty.

1071
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:20,000
So basically, i'm saying, there are cases where we just do not have enough evidence in saying one versus the other.

1072
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:29,000
We do not have enough evidence in those cases. We declare you know something right.

1073
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:33,000
The bar to declare beauty is different. for civil trial versus criminal trial. I'm.

1074
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:41,000
Not an expert right? but nevertheless, unless you have enough evidence you cannot reject. Hey, It's not so.

1075
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:48,000
There's some asymmetry beauty right by default. We are Zoom h now until we we collect enough evidence.

1076
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:52,000
Go against it. In those case we declare guilty.

1077
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:58,000
We we declare H. H. so that's nice and a semiature building.

1078
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:05,000
So the analogy is about happening is that before evidence right in the court is really criminal evidence.

1079
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:09,000
Buying statistics is data, right? people having us to present it.

1080
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:12,000
We assume h naught which is inner sense of defendant.

1081
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:17,000
Here by in about the half thing is statistic. We are from the normal.

1082
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:30,000
And now we present evidence which is data, not my support. The author which is guilty here, right, and the average should be strong enough.

1083
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:36,000
In particular, you know. Look, you know law terms is beyond arithmetic.

1084
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:43,000
I think that's. I I I don't even know I don't wanna say things i'm not expert in, but beyond a reasonable dog.

1085
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:48,000
So if the evidence is above a certain level, that is beyond a reasonable doubt.

1086
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:57,000
No, I declare beauty and the the equivalence in statistics that we we declare h not we concluding H.

1087
03:05:57,000 --> 03:06:07,000
You know, H. a reject it's not where we have statistical significance

1088
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:17,000
Okay, Any questions, so far.

1089
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:23,000
Alright. So Inbn right either a Drury or a job or researcher.

1090
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:27,000
In our case you have to make one or 2 possible decisions.

1091
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:35,000
Right, so either it's not or h a right you just have to pick one, because those 2 are exclusively complementary right?

1092
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:39,000
You have to make a decision that's why we use this how about passing?

1093
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:47,000
Because we just have to make a decision. So now, later, you know, you know, core system.

1094
03:06:47,000 --> 03:07:00,000
Actually, the jury cannot really declare someone unison the Internet was Assume Doesn't need a pool. So in the end.

1095
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:10,000
What you're really deciding is whether you have enough evidence to declare, Judy, what you, you don't have enough evidence to declare guilty.

1096
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:15,000
In the second case, you know, you just go with assuming that you know.

1097
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:19,000
So you know, send out a zoom and proven guilty.

1098
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:21,000
Alright that asymmetry is the same thing.

1099
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:28,000
You know, in statistical, hypothetical.

1100
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:34,000
Any questions here. So basically, i'm saying you never really prove that the know is correct.

1101
03:07:34,000 --> 03:07:42,000
You just assume it, and you you reject it with evidence

1102
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:51,000
In this particular case, right in the now we assume the me and this I I don't need even need data.

1103
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:57,000
I will know the mean is not A. because the mean is the continuous variable.

1104
03:07:57,000 --> 03:08:03,000
The continuous marble can take any matter. 8.1 8.0, 0, 1 8.0 0 0. one.

1105
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:11,000
Right. you can take infinite number of variables so the chance that the mu equals exactly 8 is actually 0 from a probability or not medical point of view.

1106
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:17,000
I know for sure. mule does not exactly equal a so proving me when it was 8.

1107
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:25,000
It's not my point My point is from this study is trying to see whether there is enough evidence against this all this.

1108
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:42,000
Either. They're already not evidence where there's not see i'm sorry, you know it sounds like no why is perfectly innocent all about this something that so the whole point of the port is not approved some why it's perfect and innocent

1109
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:50,000
but rather than show they are not duty enough, or they, they do not have enough evidence showing their you know, did some very bad thing.

1110
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:58,000
So what are you doing? Some minor bad thing doesn't really matter

1111
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:13,000
So any any question.

1112
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:21,000
Okay. Now, once we put into this framework right, there are a lot of thing involved.

1113
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:26,000
First of all, like I mentioned, we can never really prove some wise innocent.

1114
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:37,000
We can only say, there's lack of evidence showing beauty second thing you thought we can never know, for sure our decision is correct.

1115
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:44,000
Yes, the pfix, because we never know the wrong truth, and the data is random, and our decision is also random.

1116
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:54,000
So if we repeat the experiment, the amount of times, we might make a different decision, and either one of them could be wrong in the core.

1117
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:59,000
Similarly, you can never know for sure, dial decision is correct, right?

1118
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:09,000
So there are 2 types mistake the court can make if a defender is truly innocent.

1119
03:10:09,000 --> 03:10:19,000
But somehow, right at the core, decide that there's the amount evidence that he or she is guilty a part of the makeup.

1120
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:23,000
Now, and the cost of going is that they might send an innocent person to jail.

1121
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:39,000
The statistic we call it type. one error which means that it's also called the fast positive Conclusion, which means that it should be negative. But you you declare it's possible right when you run a Pcr.

1122
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:44,000
Text path or covid. You are actually negative, but some of the tests went wrong.

1123
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:51,000
They carry your positive that's called a pause problem so far as possible.

1124
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:57,000
Type on arrow have different degree of awesome request. Right? depending on where you are apparently in the court.

1125
03:10:57,000 --> 03:11:00,000
That will be a very, very severe consequence. Right, they said. We said. some.

1126
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:03,000
You know some people to jail and we don't want to do that right?

1127
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:10,000
That's why we only want to do that with strong enough evidence go beyond rhythm of that right.

1128
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:13,000
But there are a second type of arrow in my main.

1129
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:16,000
Bye you if the defendant is truly guilty.

1130
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:23,000
But somehow the core find there is insufficient evidence, good declarability.

1131
03:11:23,000 --> 03:11:34,000
So they they sat on free. They let, them go free right so that's a different kind of arrow, because of type 2 where or fourth negative, which is also the case.

1132
03:11:34,000 --> 03:11:40,000
When, for example, we are really positive for Covid by the past summerhog shows negative.

1133
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:48,000
So these 2 are different kind of error. you might make in this kind of framework in an ideal world.

1134
03:11:48,000 --> 03:12:00,000
We don't wanna make mistakes at all therefore we want both type, one error and type, 2 error to be 0. Apparently that's 2 idea to be 2 right you reality.

1135
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:09,000
Probably both of them will be positive non-zero, but we want to make them as small as possible.

1136
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:30,000
Okay, My question here for you is that which of the 2 errors you think i'm more severe, and why

1137
03:12:30,000 --> 03:12:34,000
Seems like that depends on the question that you're asking and what the risks are in either direction.

1138
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:41,000
Yup, Yup, this is absolutely right. I have a nice depend on the risk from this particular.

1139
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:53,000
Say, because i'm holding the port which which of the mistake you think is most of the year

1140
03:12:53,000 --> 03:13:03,000
Type 2 era because you're letting a possible Well, someone that you think is guilty. You're letting them free.

1141
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:07,000
Yeah, you're letting a criminal go free that's definitely very bad.

1142
03:13:07,000 --> 03:13:10,000
But comparison, You know some people go to jail.

1143
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:18,000
I would disagree. I would say that type one and this in this scenario setting in a person innocent person, the jail is worse than letting a criminal free.

1144
03:13:18,000 --> 03:13:24,000
You know. Yeah, yeah, I mean, I guess this is philosophical or you know socially constructed.

1145
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:31,000
I don't wanna make a you know universal conclusion, but personally I agree that hypnotism type one error.

1146
03:13:31,000 --> 03:13:37,000
This case is most severe personally to me, but I understand, you know, in other scenarios, or you know the other country.

1147
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:43,000
On the culture, it might be different. but I think in the us port system.

1148
03:13:43,000 --> 03:13:51,000
I think is is design a way that they you know they design this core system in the in a you know the way that I think pipe one, or is more severe.

1149
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:56,000
Of course, both of that right. but this one is. this is worse.

1150
03:13:56,000 --> 03:14:01,000
I just want to say that you know the difficult framework, the how about packing framework?

1151
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:06,000
There are technology there. They also think type. One error is worse than type.

1152
03:14:06,000 --> 03:14:16,000
2. So you, you, you welcome, make you want to reduce both post policy and the possible negative, or your first one will really want to reduce cost company.

1153
03:14:16,000 --> 03:14:19,000
Well in the P. are you gonna call me the case i'm not sure right.

1154
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:24,000
You know a false positive of Covid has may not be that bad right?

1155
03:14:24,000 --> 03:14:29,000
We have our putting you for jail. What you need, which is unfortunate.

1156
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:33,000
But you know it's not that bad especially when you have a false positive.

1157
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:37,000
You you can test again right, which may I get clear you all i'm not false negative.

1158
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:42,000
I don't know. you also set some people go on Street, and you in fact, other people right, both are bad.

1159
03:14:42,000 --> 03:14:45,000
So in the covid past case, you know the type.

1160
03:14:45,000 --> 03:14:53,000
One error. Is not that bad? So maybe they are equally bad. But in most of the cases I would say, no free framework is building, you know.

1161
03:14:53,000 --> 03:15:00,000
Assuming the type. One error is worse because there is an eighth to begin with, right?

1162
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:06,000
So we design a system with the with the mind, not high one that is works.

1163
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:16,000
Okay. So because we think the type one error is worse in the framework.

1164
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:21,000
So we want to. We want to reduce both hypothesis. Oh, everything.

1165
03:15:21,000 --> 03:15:31,000
I was equal. We want to reduce type one first, however, as well as for later on type on Iran type, 2 error.

1166
03:15:31,000 --> 03:15:42,000
They go against each other in the sense that if you push one to way, too, down the other one will go up, and there's a no way up.

1167
03:15:42,000 --> 03:15:50,000
You just had to strike a balance. I will give you a very intuitive proof.

1168
03:15:50,000 --> 03:16:02,000
If you'll set type on arrow to be 0 You can always set half an hour to be 0 in the core case, you just set everyone.

1169
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:12,000
Free. Then you will never make a single type one error but in that case you'll have to error will shoot up crazy.

1170
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:22,000
Similarly, you can set type 2 error to be 0, which means that you send everybody to jail. The taco era is always 0.

1171
03:16:22,000 --> 03:16:33,000
They'll have one error will go to help right so this to go against each other if you push one of them way down to compromise on raising the other one way often.

1172
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:38,000
So because they are asymmetry, so our best could do is strike a balance.

1173
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:44,000
So the best we can do with that with such a level for type, one arrow, because Taiwan is more severe.

1174
03:16:44,000 --> 03:16:50,000
Label will have one arrow, we think is, we can tolerate that.

1175
03:16:50,000 --> 03:17:06,000
I know we control type of arrows will be below that level, and then, under that assumption, we try to reduce type 2 error as much as we can, But there's just a limit where we can do

1176
03:17:06,000 --> 03:17:15,000
So unfortunately that's all we can do so as a consequence we'll always be making some level of pipeline error.

1177
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:23,000
I'll pause positive on any path. even covid has, I think the current Covid type of type of error rate is really small, you know.

1178
03:17:23,000 --> 03:17:27,000
If you look at a Covid has, I think the number I got is I have a Pcr.

1179
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:35,000
Test the time on error is like why in a minute or something like that very small. Well, the 5 2 h actually is pretty hot, you know.

1180
03:17:35,000 --> 03:17:40,000
Can't go off to one person, even depend on something or even 10% or more.

1181
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:45,000
Depend on where you I have to sample right. For example, we collect the sample deep down in the throat.

1182
03:17:45,000 --> 03:17:47,000
The type. 2 error will be lower but that's very inconvenient.

1183
03:17:47,000 --> 03:17:55,000
So sometimes we just do a simple, you know, dip into our nose, and that the type that will go off that way. right?

1184
03:17:55,000 --> 03:18:01,000
So it depends on. or if you collect the sample way early on, when you before you have the same phone now, the type there will go up.

1185
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:04,000
So the time is already manufacture. How you? how do the environment?

1186
03:18:04,000 --> 03:18:08,000
But not with the last half my narrow way to really help.

1187
03:18:08,000 --> 03:18:16,000
But if you do another path like the at home, antigen path, then the pipeline error rate will actually be higher than the Pcr. tax. Pcr.

1188
03:18:16,000 --> 03:18:22,000
Tests because of nature of the past that didn't have enough so specific.

1189
03:18:22,000 --> 03:18:27,000
I have the Pcr. test. Therefore you have make more type on our way. Okay.

1190
03:18:27,000 --> 03:18:34,000
So so and so forth. right so in any case we want to reduce the pipeline error rate control the pattern right? Well, i'll try to reduce the pipe.

1191
03:18:34,000 --> 03:18:42,000
However, they're not in magic for your hypothesis have been.

1192
03:18:42,000 --> 03:18:50,000
You have to set a particular level. We kind of a significant level in most cases we'll set it as 0 point 0 5.

1193
03:18:50,000 --> 03:18:57,000
So 5 5%, we call it a alpha. So Alpha is at a significant level, usually taken at 5%.

1194
03:18:57,000 --> 03:19:06,000
You can change it. But you're gonna take on 5% that's the type that's the average for type of arrow around the control within 5% high viral is small enough.

1195
03:19:06,000 --> 03:19:14,000
We can tolerate, which means, on average, will make 5% positive conclusion.

1196
03:19:14,000 --> 03:19:20,000
You will see later on, this 5% actually corresponds for the 95% confidence interval.

1197
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:33,000
So if we use confidence interval to make conclusion right if the company number will contain a value, would say, you know we we, we take the null if the cost variable is outside the value will take the alternative that we'll make

1198
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:42,000
5% type of hour right there, because the company involved will 5% of time, remember.

1199
03:19:42,000 --> 03:19:46,000
So this this to our problem

1200
03:19:46,000 --> 03:19:50,000
And once we control the pipeline arrow rate will be 5%.

1201
03:19:50,000 --> 03:19:53,000
We also try to reduce the type 2 error rate right?

1202
03:19:53,000 --> 03:20:00,000
Because if the type 2 error rate is so hard, like 90% of the wildlife, the test is useless.

1203
03:20:00,000 --> 03:20:03,000
Right. Say, you have a covid half. You never make type Arrow.

1204
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:08,000
They make like very few type of error by your failure to detect 90% of the positive cases.

1205
03:20:08,000 --> 03:20:14,000
Then that's pretty much uses

1206
03:20:14,000 --> 03:20:22,000
So what is a good type to error rate? You know the the the the rule of pharmaceutical way, we think, are small enough.

1207
03:20:22,000 --> 03:20:40,000
All of this are rule of phone you can pick different values but that's the value people take in general, which means that if you think about the coldly cases right? which means that 100% of 100 positive people will detect 80 of them

1208
03:20:40,000 --> 03:20:48,000
right in the core system, which is the same wander criminal. We'll put 80 of them in jail, said the other point.

1209
03:20:48,000 --> 03:20:57,000
Go free, which, of course, is not perfect by something which hold on, quote good enough.

1210
03:20:57,000 --> 03:21:09,000
So any question on this slide

1211
03:21:09,000 --> 03:21:11,000
Apparently you want to vary this This cut off right.

1212
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:20,000
Alpha beta depend on particular question of interest here i'm just putting a number as reference that people usually pay without other.

1213
03:21:20,000 --> 03:21:26,000
You don't have it as all other knowledge on the particular question interest.

1214
03:21:26,000 --> 03:21:44,000
Usually people take these values in in the clinical biological studies

1215
03:21:44,000 --> 03:21:55,000
Okay, if there's no question here I think I I gotta stop the lecture here, i'll continue tomorrow, right, and then we still have a few more minutes right?

1216
03:21:55,000 --> 03:22:09,000
If anyone wants to share what you have rat over the weekend about any public house topic where you want to share what you turning in for the first homework is time to share, we We can't you know talk a little

1217
03:22:09,000 --> 03:22:15,000
bit before we take before we stop today. Any moment here.

1218
03:22:15,000 --> 03:22:23,000
Just want to have some chat with you
