1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:16,650
Some of those things are also people who are struggling in public schools are

2
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:39,960
saying that raising interest rates from here with the U.S. couldn't help it.

3
00:00:39,960 --> 00:01:04,780
Isn't that right? So I thought it was already starting to look like a failed state.

4
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:24,630
And I don't like that. Yeah, I don't think God should go back to those things so we can.

5
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,460
Okay. Good morning. Good morning. Everybody, have a nice break.

6
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:43,590
Yes, travel and travel. You get to the airports, okay?

7
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:52,230
Yeah. Time for you to get out and then come back about the football game.

8
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,150
If you watched the game, that's about that most American football game.

9
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,890
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Part of that going on right now.

10
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:15,940
You know, today we're going to talk about the first part of lifestyle modification and talk about focus.

11
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,050
The talk is going to be focused on the diabetes prevention program.

12
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:27,490
And I'm going to talk a bit more on lifestyle modification again on Wednesday.

13
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,360
And in that lecture, we're going to talk about specifically exercise and some other things.

14
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:41,290
So let's first go over the quiz. Quiz number 11, pretty much everybody got this question right.

15
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:51,790
The mechanisms known to contribute to obstructive sleep apnea include which of the following and not antioxidant deficiency,

16
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:57,610
not elevated consumption of caffeinated beverages or sleeping on your side, actually sleeping on your back.

17
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:08,680
That can increase your risk of airway collapses. It's increased reactive oxygen species and that cup that occurs as a consequence of that apnea,

18
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:18,670
those athletic events where there's a near 90% closure of the airway and there's a hypoxia develops as a consequence of that repeating over and over.

19
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:33,410
All of. So number two, all of the following are risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea except febrile, yes, tonsils and adenoid hypertrophy.

20
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:42,290
That's a risk factor on advanced age. Your soft palate gets a little less rigid and comes gets sloppier as you get older.

21
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:49,940
Obesity is a risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea, and then it's actually being male.

22
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:57,740
That's a risk factor. Being female is not a risk factor. So that's the right answer in this particular question.

23
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:09,320
And then weight gain and inflammation contribute to the pathogenesis of knee osteoarthritis by increasing mechanical stress and cartilage degradation.

24
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:15,530
And that's true. And we went over some of the mechanisms by which this process occurs.

25
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:27,980
So today, lifestyle modification, part one we're going to talk about, well, the study objectives is to understand the rationale for weight management.

26
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:35,340
To define the purpose of the standard of medical practice for the prevention and treatment of diabetes.

27
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:43,740
And finally, to describe the intervention and the results from the diabetes prevention program.

28
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:51,450
So one of your assigned readings for today was a story from an alumnus alumna.

29
00:04:52,320 --> 00:05:00,210
And I asked her, send me an example, a story of where you help somebody with metabolic disease.

30
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,860
And she she produced the story. And she's a registered dietitian.

31
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:15,330
She works in a hospital in Lansing area.

32
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:25,770
And this is the story that she provided, talks about a 50 year old woman who has had an ankle fracture.

33
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,900
And this particular individual had a history of substance abuse.

34
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,560
And during the pandemic and prior to her ankle fracture, she had gained £80.

35
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:45,000
So this is during the pandemic. She reported obstruction associated with this this weight gain.

36
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,129
And she notes that she had obesity.

37
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,500
And then she wrote morbid obesity in her description of her body size.

38
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:07,120
And like I said, right now, the correct classification of this BMI, BMI affording over to actual class three obesity, but one.

39
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:13,290
I left it in there to say, look, you're going to see this when you go out to do your practice.

40
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,670
If you are going to be a clinical dietitian, you're still going to see this terminology used.

41
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,910
It's an appropriate place. It's out there during the pandemic.

42
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:34,650
She had this sudden significant weight gain and this was associated with this increased caloric intake and poor diet.

43
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:40,500
And she reported some habits of, you know, consuming whole pies, whole box of ice cream.

44
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:47,640
COLLINS for a particular meal. And this was also associated with a vitamin D deficiency.

45
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:58,980
So she's hospitalized for a broken ankle and she has this sudden increase and £80 increase in her weight of her usual body weight.

46
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:12,540
And so the clinical dietitian, she gets to visit with this patient and she looks at her diet.

47
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:20,460
And the first thing she looks at is what is her total caloric intake based on her caloric needs.

48
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,630
And she looks at the patient, how many calories she's ordering.

49
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,090
When you're hospitalized, you can order certain items on the menu.

50
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,100
And she she took a diet history from this individual.

51
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:44,460
And the patient was ordering, you know, over 3000 calories on her trays that she was given in the hospital.

52
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,030
And looking at her diet history, this is consistent with the amount of calories that she was consuming.

53
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,770
And this explained the £80 weight gain prior to the ankle fracture.

54
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:10,419
So she recommended 1800 calories per day and she did this using the standard assessment based on

55
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:18,760
her body size and also a vitamin D supplement because she presented with vitamin D deficiency.

56
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:26,890
So I may not have mentioned this, but vitamin D deficiency is a fat soluble vitamins common in people who have obesity.

57
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,580
And this was addressed by recommending the patient receive this supplement.

58
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,850
So the follow up is relatively brief.

59
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:46,390
So she's seeing this person as an inpatient. So she makes these recommendations and here's what happens.

60
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:57,610
So within just a few weeks, a week or two, Patients says she feels that consuming this diet based on the medical nutrition therapy approach,

61
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:08,469
improving the diet quality, reducing the number of calories, she is looking at her consumption of food in the hospital.

62
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:18,380
That calorie restriction is well-controlled. The patient's record confirms the maintenance of the diet within this particular setting.

63
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:27,140
It was a very modest but structured weight loss within a short period of time, one or two weeks.

64
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:35,810
And after this particular initial phase, the patient was graduated to rehabilitation.

65
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:41,630
So somebody hospitalized with acute illness in this case is a fracture.

66
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,760
They're stabilized and then they're sent over to rehabilitation.

67
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,630
And based on this experience, the patient was really thankful and happy.

68
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:59,000
They had a newfound perspective on the role that nutrition plays in their overall health,

69
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:11,420
and the patient expressed her confidence in her ability to maintain this new diet, healthier foods and fewer calories.

70
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:19,130
And this, however, was an exception to what this particular dietician is used to.

71
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:31,160
A number of patients that she sees aren't receptive to this type of dietary change, and this is not that unusual of a case.

72
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:41,000
This particular person describes her caseload as at least half of her patients that she sees have this class three obesity.

73
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:48,680
So half of her patients and this is kind of consistent with what we've been seeing in terms of increase in

74
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:55,969
the prevalence of that particular category so that we now have 10% of the adult population that have a BMI,

75
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:10,490
14 over that class size. And then because the patient was receptive, she found this is a very valuable and rewarding experience.

76
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,900
So I'm interested now in some of your comments about this alone, a story about this particular patient.

77
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,320
Many of the comments, questions they wanted to talk about with this particular individual.

78
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:31,590
Yeah, the decrease in calories seems like a lot in a very short amount of time.

79
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:41,310
I was wondering, is that usually a place to go about recommending decreasing calories, like cutting it right away?

80
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,690
Yeah, I saw that on the perusal comment.

81
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:52,530
I'm not sure in terms of whether this is always the practice in this particular health care company to do this.

82
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:01,530
Yeah, I would think that a more or a gradual type of process would be more easy to follow.

83
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:08,160
However, this is a health care setting where you have somebody who essentially has a very limited activity,

84
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:16,330
and I don't have any more details just to say, okay, what did she feel after consuming a few amount of calories?

85
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,680
I don't have those details to fill in. Yeah.

86
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:25,720
I'm not sure. Like she is having food outside somebody's hospital.

87
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:37,450
During my internship, we had a patient, and at that time we were like following him and sending him trays for diabetic patients.

88
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,559
But it was surprising. He was like going down.

89
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,650
And then we realized that his wife was giving him food from the.

90
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:53,950
So it's like he have to make sure that she, as you mentioned, like it's very hard for a patient to go down from 3000 calories to this.

91
00:12:55,090 --> 00:13:00,969
So this is also this is also an issue this particular patient didn't have diabetes,

92
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:09,520
didn't have type two diabetes, but she had other factors that would put her in the metabolic disease category.

93
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,819
Other hand went up in the comments on this. Yeah,

94
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:22,940
actually the same one of the reading that you gave was it says that we it's safe to subtract 500 to 1000

95
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:33,440
correlated day to P to achieve 7% 7% weight loss safely within six months or six months of the intervention.

96
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:43,130
But study has proven in three push to the 10% loss is that we have to do the 1000 like safe save

97
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:49,100
this with this these values are based on clinical trials and we'll talk about some of these.

98
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:55,310
But it's in terms of figuring out what somebody needs and what those calorie

99
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:59,600
reductions are is like what you need to make the appropriate changes for that person.

100
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:10,400
You need to consider their their body size for, first of all, their age and body composition.

101
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,419
In addition, you need to consider their physical activity level.

102
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:21,470
So all of these things need to be included in that calculation, therefore, from 1800 to 3000.

103
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:30,180
What is the first goal that we set? The first thing that she did was that medical nutrition therapy was a healthy diet,

104
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,770
which would include, you know, the things that you learned in medical nutrition therapy,

105
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:43,080
starting with the healthy plate increase the amount of fruits and vegetables in her diet compositions and decrease the amount of.

106
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,659
I would tell you, if you don't eliminate it completely, you reduce the amount that people are getting,

107
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,010
the number of calories they're getting from that source. Maybe you had a comment question.

108
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,650
My thought was terms like mental health, because it seems like a lot of weight.

109
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:04,740
It's not like it was a gradual thing. It's like she gained a lot of weight and she's getting over like a substance abuse.

110
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,710
So it's possible she's using like food as a coping mechanism.

111
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:15,840
So my first thought would be it are some sort of like cognitive behavioral therapy, just like maybe help.

112
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,149
Yeah, perhaps that was that. Yeah, that was one of my first thoughts too.

113
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,950
It's like, okay, what else is going on here?

114
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:33,390
But again, when you are in practice, you have limited information about you see that information, but you don't have anything else to to say for sure.

115
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:42,810
Okay. This person needs to have this has depression and they need to have some kind of intervention here for her to treat her depression.

116
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:49,080
And whether or not her primary care physician missed that or didn't think that was appropriate, I don't know.

117
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,130
These are all good comments. So.

118
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:08,590
What is the stance or the position of your accrediting body, the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics for Weight Management?

119
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:16,810
Well, things that we've been talking about all semester that obesity can negatively affect the health of the population.

120
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:24,730
It has significant impacts on the health of the population.

121
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:31,930
The cost of medical treatment, longevity and reducing obesity is considered to be a public health priority.

122
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:38,340
And if you want details about these comments, you can sources are down here.

123
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:46,650
There are five different sources. A weight loss of 3 to 5% produces clinically relevant improvements in metabolic health,

124
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:57,840
and 5 to 10% weight loss reduces additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease and a need for medication to control co-morbidities.

125
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,230
And then this level of weight loss, in addition to cardio metabolic disease,

126
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:11,940
can improve outcomes in people who have obstructive sleep apnea and osteoarthritis.

127
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,610
So you follow the standard of care.

128
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:26,090
And first of all, there's this expectation when somebody gets treatment that they're going to follow a certain standard.

129
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:33,890
And the standard will be based on the most up to date information in terms of evidence based therapies.

130
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:40,640
In this case, it's the treatment or prevention of prediabetes or diabetes.

131
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:52,339
And if somebody comes in and they have these conditions and the health care professional is not equipped,

132
00:17:52,340 --> 00:18:01,790
they don't have the training or background to treat a particular condition that they would refer them to another facility,

133
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:06,380
another health care professional to meet, that the medical needs of the individual.

134
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:16,530
So there are these standards of medical care and there's a so there's this standard for diagnosis treatment out of

135
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:25,230
the treatment process that a clinician should follow through a particular type of illness or clinical circumstance.

136
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:35,430
And in the case that I gave you, it was just the standard of medical care was defined by the American Diabetes Association.

137
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:44,979
And so the other thing you have to ask is, is this standard being practiced throughout the industry?

138
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:54,580
You would expect that it would be. And if there are issues regarding variations in the care,

139
00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:06,280
it would have to be consistent with a standard of care that would have has evidence to back up the treatment.

140
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:15,190
And we would expect that another skilled health care professional would provide the same type of treatment.

141
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:23,650
And if they don't, they have to have a very good rationale for that and evidence to back up their wanting to use an alternative therapy.

142
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,570
So what's the standard of care for prevention delay of type two diabetes?

143
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:36,250
First of all, you need to look at somebody is likely cause status or a glucose homeostasis.

144
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:44,710
So there's screening done for hemoglobin. Let's see, there's a fasting blood glucose tolerance test.

145
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:53,590
And in addition to these for the screening of prevention of diabetes is like history.

146
00:19:54,190 --> 00:20:03,760
So if you have parents or if you have family relatives that have a history of pre-diabetes or diabetes, this would put you at a greater risk.

147
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,940
And this is something that you would note when they're collecting information,

148
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:19,450
when you go into physician's office, you talk about your family history, they have your homeostasis information.

149
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:28,300
You need to tell them whether or not you have a sibling or a parent who has had pre-diabetes or diabetes.

150
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,830
So remember the pre-diabetes range for hemoglobin A-1 C and fasting blood glucose.

151
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,770
And if you're in this range,

152
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:51,020
you get a recommendation for people who are overweight or have obesity enough to be enrolled into a lifestyle modification program.

153
00:20:52,610 --> 00:21:02,120
And the lifestyle modification program is a program that is a behavioral change program.

154
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,560
And the goal is to prevent the element of diabetes.

155
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:13,190
And this is done. Yes. For people who have overweight and obesity.

156
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,380
It's a 7% reduction in weight. That's the goal weight that one is supposed to achieve.

157
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:23,990
And this comes with modifying the diet caloric intake,

158
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:32,660
which to an appropriate level and increasing physical activity to at least 150 minutes per week.

159
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:36,589
This is moderate physical activity. This is aerobic activity.

160
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:48,170
And the initial studies where we had the diabetes prevention program, it was walking 30 minutes a day that was prescribed for these individuals.

161
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:55,310
So the other thing that's critical, it was mentioned in your readings to prevent waste stigma.

162
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:05,350
Be respectful. Use first person language. Lifestyle modification is about reducing risk and disease prevention.

163
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:17,590
It's not about appearances. People may expect that they once stay engaged in these programs, should, could or should lose a lot of weight to,

164
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:25,270
in their minds, improve their appearance is not the goal of diabetes prevention program or diet modification.

165
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:29,860
It's to reduce the risk of developing diabetes.

166
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:44,410
So even if someone, let's say someone has a way to £300 and they achieve this 7% weight loss goal, they may still experience weight stigma,

167
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:55,000
even that even in those cases, the individual will benefit from this particular reduction in weight loss through this program.

168
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,920
So you're trying to affect change?

169
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,290
We used to I used to see if this works.

170
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:14,470
Yeah, I used the analogy of the bathtub to describe what's going on.

171
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:24,490
So in this case, you have somebody who has obesity and insulin resistance and you have a water overflowing bathtub,

172
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:31,690
you have a soggy carpet, and the water is overflowing because there's an increased energy intake.

173
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:46,390
The idea here with the diabetes prevention program is to reduce deaths such that you would lower the water in the bathtub.

174
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:59,800
And this is done by reducing some of the energy intake that comes and then increasing the energy expenditure such that

175
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:10,840
we don't no longer have a soggy carpet or the ectopic deposition of lipids that can make tissues resistant to insulin.

176
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:16,360
So that's the goal here, a five, 7% goal of weight loss to do that.

177
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:22,990
And that's that's what you're trying to do in this particular scenario.

178
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:30,950
So the first thing was mentioned in the alumni story was the diet modification.

179
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:38,510
And for years, we've had dietary guidelines for Americans.

180
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:52,459
And one that I'm going to mention in the next study I'm going to talk about is focused on greater intake of fruits and vegetables,

181
00:24:52,460 --> 00:25:01,520
a reduction of sodium, a reduction in compared to the recommendations for fruit and vegetable intake.

182
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:06,920
So you've heard this over and over again. Daily fruit intake.

183
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:16,190
Two cultures are four servings per day and a daily vegetable intake, two and a half cups or 7.5 servings per day.

184
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:26,150
So the total here, fruits and vegetables, nine reduced calories from fat to less than 30% and less than 10% from saturated fat.

185
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:32,030
And that's to reduce the sodium to less than 2300 milligrams per day.

186
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:43,550
Okay. And then in terms of added sugars, the goal here is to reduce your intake of added sugars to less than 10% of your total calories.

187
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,950
So this sounds like, of course, we would advocate this,

188
00:25:50,330 --> 00:26:00,020
but until recently there have been little in terms of studies that have backed up this type of

189
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:06,530
recommendation in terms of what changes it can have on somebody's overall metabolic health.

190
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:16,430
So the focus of this study that I'm going to discuss here next was does the healthy diet improve cardiometabolic risk factors?

191
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:30,710
So in this particular study, these guidelines compared them in a randomized clinical trial with the typical American diet.

192
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:41,510
And so they wanted to evaluate the impact of this dietary guidelines for Americans versus the typical American diet.

193
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:51,950
And they're going to be looking at things in this study, glucose status and lipids and then other things, such as the risk factors,

194
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,450
individuals who are at risk of cardiometabolic disease,

195
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:05,360
and they're looking at weight independent cardiometabolic effects of a high quality food based diet.

196
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:12,500
So the goal in this particular study was to just look at what does changing diet quality do to these end points?

197
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:23,640
So in the study design there it was randomized, double blind and controlled, and it was an intervention.

198
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:33,750
We had in the study 52 overweight or obese women where the average BMI was 32.

199
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:40,700
And the they had 30.

200
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:46,350
They had some insulin resistance or without insulin resistance and dyslipidemia

201
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:51,210
and fasting blood glucose levels were below the threshold for prediabetes.

202
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:56,070
Their waist circumference average was 95 centimeters.

203
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:06,720
And they were randomly assigned to the Dietary Guidelines Diet for the typical American diet.

204
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:22,920
And the typical American diet was based on the average adult intake from the and Heinz assessment done in 2009 2920 ten.

205
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:37,570
And they collected information based on the recommendations and the typical American diet and assigned to or calculated a healthy eating score,

206
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:44,500
98 versus 62. All foods and beverages were provided during the intervention,

207
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:51,760
so these people were coming into a facility and getting all of the food that was provided in this particular study.

208
00:28:53,020 --> 00:29:01,660
They did an oral glucose tolerance test and they measured fasting lipids at baseline at two and eight weeks of the intervention.

209
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:09,310
And they looked at insulin resistance and sensitivity with a number of different surrogates.

210
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,930
Ah, and they used some other surrogates for insulin sensitivity as well.

211
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:21,040
So this is a table that compares the servings of food groups.

212
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,360
Here's a typical American diet and here's the dietary guidelines.

213
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:29,300
And you can see every time you see an arrow here.

214
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,130
So here's just looking at fruit cups per day.

215
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:41,280
Typical American diet one. And if you include whole fruit and juice, this is the typical American diet.

216
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:51,530
During that enhance assessment 2000 and 2010 and with the dietary guidelines, you see that they're increasing this substantially.

217
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:59,750
And the same is true for vegetable intake is increased with the dietary guidelines diet.

218
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:04,500
They're increasing grains.

219
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:12,049
I'm sorry, they're decreasing the amount of grains. You're increasing whole grains and they're reducing in rich, refined grains.

220
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:15,080
And with the diet doctor guidelines diet.

221
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:26,330
And then in terms of the consumption of meat, fish, poultry, eggs, nuts and seeds, they're reducing meat consumption, increasing seafood,

222
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:41,060
decreasing these types of of of meat, poultry, eggs and increasing nuts and seeds, and then finally increasing dairy and oils.

223
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:46,100
And then they're reducing substantially solid fats and added sugars.

224
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,860
And then in terms of the amount of sugars as a percent of energy, they've decreased it substantially.

225
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:02,680
So this is that the main differences in the diet? So what happened during this time period?

226
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:11,140
Well, this is a table showing you the typical American diet versus the dietary guidelines diet.

227
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:17,020
So you have up here in the top of the table weeks zero through week eight.

228
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:27,460
And I have highlighted the rows here in which there was a significant difference between the two different groups.

229
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:36,970
So there was no difference. Significant difference in terms of between groups or within groups during this time period,

230
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:42,940
in terms of fasting, blood glucose, hemoglobin, A1, C insulin.

231
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:49,390
Some of these indexes for insulin sensitivity, none of these were different.

232
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:58,300
There was a difference in total cholesterol with the dietary guidelines diet.

233
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:03,100
So what decreased was different than the typical American diet.

234
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:09,610
But the differences in LDL cholesterol were not statistically significant.

235
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:16,660
There was a trend for a reduction in the Dietary Guidelines group, but this is not statistically significant.

236
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:22,370
Yeah. Did they test for diameter of the LDL cholesterol?

237
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:29,260
Is that right? You know that that information wasn't provided by whether it was a different classes of LDL particles.

238
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:38,160
Uh, fasting HDL cholesterol actually went down a little bit in the the dietary guidelines group.

239
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:42,660
Triglycerides were not significantly different.

240
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,550
Yeah, but this is a normal finding.

241
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:51,660
For example, they just followed them for eight weeks with each balance attempted.

242
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:56,130
Mean this is a limitation of most of the sample size.

243
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:03,690
Very small. Yes. So that's a limitation of this study, certainly.

244
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:10,260
But just within eight weeks, the big take home message here was look at what happened to systolic blood pressure.

245
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:16,980
Systolic blood pressure went down six millimeters of mercury in the Dietary Guidelines group.

246
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:24,000
So. That was the big win here for this particular thing.

247
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:30,340
No, no difference in diastolic blood pressure, but systolic blood pressure went down by six millimeters of mercury.

248
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,700
There was a modest reduction in total cholesterol,

249
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:43,810
but no differences in the other endpoints that they hope to see some changes fasting, insulin, glucose, insulin resistance and lipids.

250
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,830
So yeah, eight weeks was a short period of time.

251
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:55,840
These types of clinical trials are difficult to run.

252
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:08,680
They are very expensive and it is even more difficult to control the conditions within your different treatment groups.

253
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:13,930
So those are yeah, those are certainly limitations in the study.

254
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:24,660
So let's look at lifestyle modification weight management programs.

255
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:31,980
So what they say here is you try to maintain a weight below 25 for your BMI.

256
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:37,830
And if you have a BMI higher than 25 with co-morbidities, want to prevent weight gain?

257
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:52,170
If you have a BMI between 25 and 30 with co-morbidities or you have a BMI of 30 and over, the recommendation here is to reduce your weight by 7%.

258
00:34:52,950 --> 00:35:07,110
And if you don't have co-morbidities or you have a through another assessment besides BMI, this elevated BMI may be due to increased muscle mass.

259
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:15,420
You would want to maintain that weight. So in regard to this, these recommendations,

260
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:24,300
is weight loss effective in reducing obesity related co-morbidities in particular and prevention of diabetes?

261
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:35,309
And is it even possible to make many people have tried different types of interventions to lose weight, but it's maintaining that weight loss.

262
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:45,450
It's challenging. And in many instances, the methods that people use to lose weight through losing adiposity are inappropriate, are not sustainable.

263
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:54,810
And this particular program, the idea here is to reduce your caloric intake by some and increase your physical activity.

264
00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:02,070
And here are some characteristics of successful lifestyle interventions.

265
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:14,910
So this is a change in your lifestyle. Not again, a diet, not a short term plan where you follow some bizarre recommendations for dietary intake.

266
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:23,340
You'll often see the word intensive associated with lifestyle modification.

267
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:30,029
An intensive lifestyle modification means that there's frequent meetings with a group of

268
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:37,590
people who are trying to achieve the same goal and a trained health care practitioner.

269
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:47,370
And there are frequent meetings during the initial initial time points.

270
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,140
So you're meeting with a clinical practitioner frequently at least 16, at least 16 times during the initial phases.

271
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:03,400
You want this program to include a long term follow up.

272
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:10,360
In other words, more than a couple of years. The best quality studies have followed people for more than two years.

273
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:15,430
And I'm going to show you a 15 year follow up and one of these interventions.

274
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:21,340
So it's multi-component. You have a reduction in total calories.

275
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:29,120
You have improvement in diet quality. Following the dietary guidelines, you have an increase in fiber intake.

276
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:35,350
There's physical activity guidelines, 150 minutes of modest physical activity per week.

277
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:40,180
So walking would be an example, something that would raise your heart rate.

278
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:46,510
Heart rate. You might break a sweat, but you could still carry on a conversation that that level of intensity.

279
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:55,939
And these are they're strongly integrated behavioral principles that go along with

280
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:02,540
this multi-component intervention so that the goal for weight loss is modest.

281
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:10,090
It's 5 to 7% mentioned here. And then to achieve in the case of the diabetes prevention program,

282
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:18,260
we'll talk about look ahead on Wednesday to maintain this weight loss over a long period of time or the duration.

283
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:25,880
So based on these recommendations, have they been successful?

284
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,049
So what is the evidence that supports this? There are a number of studies,

285
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:38,540
and I'm going to show you one of them in that the Diabetes Prevention Program and the Diabetes Prevention Outcomes Study,

286
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,380
which was an extension of the diabetes prevention program.

287
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:50,210
Similar types of lifestyle interventions were used across the globe and Finland.

288
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,810
There was a Finnish diabetes prevention study program.

289
00:38:54,470 --> 00:39:05,540
And then in China, there was a change of prevention strategy Attaching Diabetes Prevention study, which is a 20 year, 23 year follow up.

290
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:17,840
And in this particular study, there was an improvement in cardiovascular disease mortality using this intervention.

291
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,030
Look ahead study was a bit different than these prevention programs.

292
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:28,790
And the prevention programs you have people who have a high risk for getting diabetes

293
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:33,920
and the interventions to prevent them from getting diabetes to look ahead study,

294
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:40,820
which we'll talk about on Wednesday, was done with people who had a diagnosis for type two diabetes.

295
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:48,320
Okay. So what do participants look like in this particular study?

296
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:53,180
Have you heard the story about the Daily Twins? You've seen that video.

297
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:58,030
Some of you are shaking your head. Did you see the video in another class? No.

298
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,940
Some of you haven't. Okay. I'll play the video. Okay.

299
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:11,610
You don't do that. They were just hitting skate discard.

300
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:21,420
Okay, here we go. I can see this is.

301
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:29,670
From a number of very well-conducted research studies that they can reduce their risk dramatically.

302
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:39,210
We had a study that was sponsored by the National Institutes of Health called the Diabetes Prevention Program,

303
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:44,370
and it was a research study to determine whether we could decrease the

304
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:49,290
development of diabetes in people who are identified as being at very high risk.

305
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:59,130
We identified what we thought were the leading risk factors for example, sedentary lifestyle, not enough physical activity, increased body image.

306
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:08,310
And we thought if we could reverse these environmental factors that led to developing diabetes and correct them with a lifestyle intervention,

307
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:14,630
we decreased involvement of diabetes in this population together.

308
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:25,900
And we're planning to bring. We'll crash on that one.

309
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:33,090
So we've got a bomb. We have this remarkable set of identical twins on the day of the brothers 12 years ago,

310
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:39,850
one of the brothers, Tim, came to us and joined in the Diabetes Prevention Program as a research volunteer.

311
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:49,570
He still does not live as well as Brother Paul recently started on insulin and he's gone through the usual steps of worsening diabetes.

312
00:41:49,950 --> 00:42:08,439
I think that's a big when I was in the shoes must be the weight and weight of 81, 74,

313
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:31,780
£270 like Walston Daily and five feet ten inches and £192 among all friends stranded five foot eight three quarters and about food to 40 smoker.

314
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:41,440
So it's been 12 years. I remember we were working at the video store together and Paul is heavier than I was then.

315
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,389
I was probably £25 heavier than he was. He was more active.

316
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:51,240
He played basketball once a week, and when I was more sedentary in Hungary,

317
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:57,310
I probably didn't tell him at the time when the doctor said, Come to find out, I was borderline diabetic.

318
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,110
I ignored it.

319
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:11,080
All of a sudden, I have this thirst that I cannot quench in 2019 and you see the doctor and that it was, yes, you're a diabetic medication.

320
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:17,560
And that's when it kind of hit you in the gut, because then you realize how your life is going to change.

321
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:26,470
The risk that one twin will get diabetes and the other twin has and is actually 95%.

322
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:33,760
I was at my sister White House and Congress had a brochure about this diabetes prevention study.

323
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:37,540
They do all the test, the blood work and everything in blood sugars have your own risk.

324
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:42,050
And thank God they're going into something I didn't assume, man. And I think we're honest about them.

325
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:48,130
Yes. Let's hear about what's happened because of the family history and also because the blood sugar was was elevated.

326
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:55,690
The goal was to try to get people to lose some weight and 7% of their initial body weight.

327
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:03,520
When I went into the study, I was a little over £200, losing 7%, which for me was £14.

328
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:10,300
Now I'm just respectivement what to do. And it was work, I'll be honest, but it was working against can't say it was work.

329
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:15,370
In addition, one of the to increase their activity limits and one of them to do is increase

330
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:20,200
it to at least 150 minutes more per week than they were doing currently,

331
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:24,399
which if you think about, that's not much at all. So within six months I dropped something.

332
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,690
Beside is my numbers. My numbers were were ideal and now they're fine.

333
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:33,160
What we found in the first phase of the study, which went on for about an average of three years,

334
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:40,090
was that we could decrease the involvement of diabetes with this lifestyle intervention by 58%.

335
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:46,660
With identical twins, you can separate out environmental factors from genetic factors.

336
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:52,810
What Tim Daly has done is he's taken the weight and the activity level out of the equation.

337
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:58,810
I mean, how much more proof can you have of someone who has the same genes as you and has diabetes?

338
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:02,380
And really, the only difference is, is the weight.

339
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:08,270
That is, how are you able to see it?

340
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:15,219
I'm not sure about that. I'm a work in progress, though. I look at you, it's like looking in a mirror.

341
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:20,200
Look at this. And he's got an extra and over the weight is yeah that's actually it's all

342
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:24,099
right there and we know putting that weight around the middle it seems to me

343
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:28,330
it's like a biochemical question that leads to diabetes and blood pressure

344
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:32,260
and is associated with heart disease and all that while walking that he does.

345
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:35,450
You start doing that and it doesn't take anything too awesomely.

346
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:38,890
I mean, there's some idea and oh, I've got to get down to the weight.

347
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:45,940
I was in high school or something. It's really ten £20 is enough to improve diabetes once you have it.

348
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,540
After talking to the population, some of you don't have to be on this.

349
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:53,930
On the rest, you just have to work on much.

350
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:08,190
Go home. Oh, yeah.

351
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,550
Oh, I'll let you finish up.

352
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:23,160
I see myself as a cautionary tale. Especially when Tim right here doesn't have it because he worked hard around it when he found love.

353
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:29,370
I. I kind of gave in to it.

354
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:36,960
And that was the worst decision I've made by not fighting is to change my inspiration.

355
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:45,569
I really want you to commit to yourself and think something to me.

356
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:52,530
Tokens now. So close. But then you can do what I know you can do it if you do it every day and get up every morning and say,

357
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,610
I'm going to do or I will lose the sun and the sun.

358
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:09,380
Any questions or comments about the video and experience? Yeah.

359
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:14,150
Did anything happen to that when the cat died?

360
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,210
He ends up changing his lifestyle.

361
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:27,680
As far as I know, the last time that I've seen a report on them is that he still had he was not able to and he still had type two diabetes.

362
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:33,710
That was a newspaper article in 2015, I believe.

363
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:41,810
And the brother who went through the program, he still hasn't had the diabetes to go through this.

364
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:48,830
So this was a randomized clinical trial to prevent type two diabetes, a person that's at high risk.

365
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:56,120
And it was a study not just on wealthy white people.

366
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:09,440
They had a diverse demographic here. So they had Caucasians, African-Americans, people with Hispanic heritage, Asian and American and Native American.

367
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:15,110
And they had a fairly good number of subjects over 3000.

368
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:25,060
Here. Here's the baseline characteristics of these individuals in terms of the breakdown of of men and women.

369
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:35,800
The percent of each race and the family history, not the family history of diabetes, is around 70% for all of the groups.

370
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:43,569
The average age was 50 years and the average BMI was in.

371
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:49,360
Each of the groups is around 34. Waist circumference, 105 centimeters.

372
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:54,130
And then they have waist hip ratios and other information here.

373
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:57,940
Fasting blood glucose was in the pre-diabetes range.

374
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:08,990
And so as their pre-diabetes range was also indicated by their glycosylated hemoglobin levels as well,

375
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:18,260
and then here's their physical activity hours per week, they had about the same level of physical activity at baseline.

376
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:24,580
So they took these individuals and they randomize them into three different groups.

377
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:39,450
The lifestyle intervention. Which was the 7% weight loss and based on dietary change, reducing the amount of calories and increased physical activity.

378
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:45,500
Then they had a metformin group. And then they had the placebo group.

379
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:51,130
They were given a tablet twice daily to kind of replicate with the metformin.

380
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:57,010
So that intensive lifestyle goals, goals.

381
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:00,310
They reduced their total fat and calorie intake.

382
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:04,930
They increased their physical activity levels to 150 minutes per week.

383
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:10,270
And this was primarily after walking and they wanted to the goal was to achieve

384
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:16,660
this 7% weight loss and to maintain it in terms of the metformin group,

385
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:23,170
they were given metformin the twice daily and the control group was given a placebo.

386
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,600
The initial intervention of these individuals for between.

387
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:41,680
They began recruitment in 96. The enrollment was completed in 99 and they started to report results in the early 2000.

388
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:46,500
And there was a this is a diabetes prevention program.

389
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:51,520
And then they follow these individuals for an additional number of years.

390
00:50:52,240 --> 00:51:00,580
And reports on this group are this extension of the study was the diabetes prevention program outcome study.

391
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:08,830
So this is from the initial evaluation.

392
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:15,340
So about half of the group could achieve the 7% weight goal in Title IX.

393
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:22,240
And then as time went on and then you have some weight loss occurring in the metformin group as well.

394
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:25,090
Little bit, not so much with the placebo group.

395
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:34,840
They're all receiving the same type of meeting with a counselor in terms of giving recommendations for diet and exercise.

396
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:38,770
So that part of it was even, in other words,

397
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:44,890
that they're meeting they're having the same number of meetings with health care professionals to talk about this,

398
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,210
the differences in the lifestyle and the metformin.

399
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:57,960
So lifestyle group, half of them can get this weight reduction and over time they start to gain some of that way back.

400
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:04,590
Here's the metformin group. They initially lose some weight and then they start to go back.

401
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:09,360
And then here's the control group, the placebo group.

402
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:13,580
Not very much of a change over this four year period of time.

403
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:22,470
But after four years, you know, you still have a significant reduction in weight in the lifestyle group.

404
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:29,470
That's four years. This is a graph that shows you the changes in physical activity.

405
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:33,470
So. The intervention group.

406
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:42,740
The lifestyle group was the blue line. Their physical activity is up and it stays up during this particular period of time.

407
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:51,509
And if you look at the physical activity of the people who are in the metformin, the placebo group there, despite their recommendation,

408
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:57,330
getting recommendations, their physical activity doesn't change a whole lot during this first part of the intervention.

409
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:05,160
But the most important data that came out initially was this risk reduction.

410
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:14,910
So the green line here again represents the placebo group and we're looking at a cumulative incidence of diabetes percent.

411
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:23,420
So they're meeting with these people on a regular basis and looking to see who

412
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:27,740
has developed diabetes based on the thresholds we've talked about previously.

413
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:33,650
There's a reduction with the metformin group by 31% compared to placebo.

414
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:40,429
But the best treatment for the best outcome was for people who are in the lifestyle

415
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:47,690
group where we see a 58% reduction in diabetes incidence over this four year,

416
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:53,540
three year time period, and they still maintain this difference at four years.

417
00:53:54,110 --> 00:54:00,010
So that's four years. And I should put this slide earlier.

418
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:08,760
The help classes in terms of the the differences, the only differences worth a metformin than the lifestyle.

419
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:15,580
They're all receiving these health classes four times a year after the initial phase of the study.

420
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:24,220
So they're all receiving the same amount of counseling. The biggest difference was the metformin or the lifestyle intervention.

421
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:28,900
And then with that, the people who get the lifestyle intervention,

422
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:35,950
they're getting these boost classes twice a year to help them maintain their their dietary change and their physical activity.

423
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:44,530
All right. What happens at ten years? Can they maintain this lifestyle change after ten years?

424
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:54,040
Well, as you can see, they have half of them get to this 7% goal and then they start to gain weight back at four years.

425
00:54:54,640 --> 00:55:01,990
But the kind of weight gain kind of levels off after four years, and they're no longer different than the metformin group,

426
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:12,130
but there are a bit different than the placebo is at ten years and all the lives into run together in terms of weight change at ten years.

427
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:18,700
What about the cumulative incidence of diabetes?

428
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:29,470
Well, we're still seeing a reduction with the lifestyle group compared to the placebo group and the metformin group.

429
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:35,170
So this is ten years out after the initial randomization.

430
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:44,960
So when we look at this percent, you know, what are we talking about versus the the placebo?

431
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:54,110
An 18% reduction in cumulative incidence of diabetes in the metformin group and a 34% reduction in the lifestyle group.

432
00:55:54,520 --> 00:56:01,990
Okay. So for more information about the ten year follow up.

433
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:12,540
So the people in the lifestyle group eventually did go on to develop those who did go on to develop diabetes.

434
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:19,950
They delayed the onset of diabetes by 40 years and the people in the metformin group delayed the onset by two years.

435
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:26,309
There was a lower rate of diabetes development for the lifestyle in the farm program.

436
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:35,010
That was still statistically significant, again, by 34% in the lifestyle group and 18% in the metformin group.

437
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:40,950
Okay. That's ten years. What about 15 years?

438
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,180
Here's the data for the 15 year follow up.

439
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:49,410
We're looking at, again, changes in weight.

440
00:56:50,940 --> 00:57:01,890
And you can see again after the initial four years, the metformin and the lifestyle group trends together in terms of their weight loss.

441
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:05,759
But they still are able to maintain some of this weight loss over time.

442
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:10,110
And actually between ten and 15 years, they drop another kilogram.

443
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:18,540
And interestingly, in the placebo group, they are at a lower weight during this phase of the program as well.

444
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:24,360
So you have almost 3000 participants in the study at this time.

445
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:25,710
There are some who have dropped out.

446
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:35,329
And when you look at the cumulative incidence of diabetes for men and women, men are at the top and women are at the bottom.

447
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:40,060
And these two different graphs. We're still seeing the metformin.

448
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:47,630
But the thing that you should note here is that the metformin, the lifestyle group run together in terms of incidence of diabetes,

449
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:57,200
but there's still a 27% reduction in diabetes incidence in this lifestyle group at 15 years.

450
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:06,620
And here's the graph with women showing you a similar reduction in the incidence of diabetes.

451
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:12,810
So that's the development of diabetes.

452
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:21,630
And as I mentioned earlier, yes, this is just one study, but this has been reproduced and a number of other studies done in other countries.

453
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:28,560
That was the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study and the one in China matching where you have a similar outcome.

454
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:32,930
What about some other things?

455
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:44,420
Well, we talked about the changes that occur to the vast macro, but micro vasculature, that is a complication of diabetes.

456
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:52,520
So does the prevention program, the lifestyle modification, affect those outcomes as well?

457
00:58:54,230 --> 00:59:00,560
So here's the aggregate in terms of microvascular complications that would include all of these different groups.

458
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:09,950
So in the red here, we have placebo and the blue bar, that's the metformin group and that green is the lifestyle group.

459
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:14,990
This is a 15 year time point, 15 years after randomization.

460
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:28,280
So we see a significant reduction in the lifestyle group and the aggregate in terms of nephropathy involving the kidney here.

461
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,510
There doesn't seem to be a significant difference here between the different groups.

462
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:38,870
But when you look at other microvascular complications, neuropathy,

463
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:47,570
we see a much better reduction in the prevalence of neuropathy in the lifestyle group compared to the two other groups.

464
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:58,310
And when you look at retinopathy, this is also better that the two other groups up to 15 years after randomization.

465
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:08,060
So these this lifestyle intervention has been shown to have a longstanding effect.

466
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:18,350
And the individuals who enrolled in this study and not only just diabetes prevention, but complications of diabetes better as well.

467
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:26,480
Okay. Well, we got through that awfully fast. Comments or questions at this point yet, Nicole?

468
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:32,780
So you're like testing three things at once because you made like three interventions in one study.

469
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:42,360
So I guess my question is, which of the three characteristics is makes the most impact possibly.

470
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:48,500
Is it all three together or. So with lifestyle intervention, yes.

471
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:51,370
You're talking about all of them together. Okay.

472
01:00:52,340 --> 01:01:00,860
Like improved diet, quality, physical activity, caloric reduction to get you down to that lower body mass.

473
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:09,860
So, yes, lifestyle is all of them together. If you were to look at just just exercise alone, you wouldn't get the same conclusion.

474
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:14,780
If you look at just diet alone, you wouldn't get the same degree of improvement.

475
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:19,930
And if you looked at just advice alone, you wouldn't see any improvement in these techniques.

476
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:28,310
And in terms of like a quick follow up, that they're compliant to the guidelines.

477
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:34,780
How did they confirm that? They were complying too, though I know the weight gain.

478
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:44,940
It's like you can go in and get me. In terms of the compliance or following, we are exercising to the time what kind of diet they have.

479
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,940
I don't remember exactly whether or not they had.

480
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:55,620
I don't believe that they had any kind of a device on them that would record their physical activities.

481
01:01:55,620 --> 01:02:02,520
But at least this was based on their log data that they were recording their diet and their their physical activity.

482
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:12,450
But they use the weight maintenance as kind of a way to assess whether or not they were maintaining a lifestyle change.

483
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,950
Those who didn't maintain lifestyle change, they went back up to their old weights.

484
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:23,220
Okay. So it seems like this is more of a measure of like weight gain, in my opinion.

485
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:26,580
So that's what they could that's what they could measure.

486
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:34,920
Okay. So in order this was this was what they were looking for, a 7% loss and to maintain that loss.

487
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:39,870
Right. Right. So that's what the people in the study couldn't measure.

488
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:45,750
And they were getting their their metabolic profile measured at the clinic.

489
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:52,520
And then we're going to have these assessments done. So that's that was the basis of this program.

490
01:02:52,520 --> 01:03:00,860
Yes. Okay. I guess if I would redo it, I maybe do try for this rice or two H HDL, LDL level.

491
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:03,890
Some of that information may be available.

492
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:09,950
He took a deep dive. If you looked at these studies, we looked at that information in particular, you would find it like that.

493
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:19,070
Yeah. So this data. Yes. It's collected over a period of time.

494
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:23,719
Yeah, right. It's that time based on the previous charts.

495
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:27,500
And you show us that years. Yeah. Okay.

496
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:39,260
So here. So randomization, enrollment completed here in 1994 around this time period.

497
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:46,410
So people are being recruited, their enrollment is completed, and they get their first initial results.

498
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:52,070
So around here is when they start the study that everybody is starting at the same time.

499
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:56,780
They're showing this data as an asset. What happens after 15 years?

500
01:03:56,780 --> 01:04:00,109
They may have started a little bit different time. Okay.

501
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:05,640
So 15 years, can we go back to like sliced 35 years, 36 those charts they.

502
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:11,150
We change over time. What are you talking about?

503
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:17,440
Well, we said the steep downhill.

504
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:21,700
Do let me go. 24 weeks. This is at 24 weeks.

505
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:26,870
They drop a tooth to half of them were able to achieve this 7% weight loss.

506
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:34,010
Where is that? 15 years or 15 years is beyond this chart.

507
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:40,890
So if you were to look at. What happens to body weight?

508
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:48,240
15 years. That's what you see. Yeah.

509
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:51,599
Yeah. I think it's interesting because when they're waiting comes back,

510
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:56,669
that's when you see that they said it was like delayed their diabetes for four years.

511
01:04:56,670 --> 01:05:01,530
Right. And then when their rate keeps coming back, that's when the diabetes starts.

512
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:13,219
Perhaps. Perhaps, yeah. When they, they start to increase here after years, there's, there's going to be an upward slope.

513
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:16,640
So these people are at high risk for developing.

514
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:27,820
What type two diabetes. Based on their genetic background, 70% of them indicated they had a close family member who had diabetes.

515
01:05:27,830 --> 01:05:36,569
So, you know, you're going to X, you're going to see this with some of these people despite their best efforts to kind of develop diabetes.

516
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:40,590
But they could delay it by a number of years following this lifestyle.

517
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:52,430
Yeah. It's really clear how the benefits of a lifestyle intervention like showing the data, but I was curious about that really.

518
01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:59,569
It seems to me like pretty extreme weight loss and light weight fluctuation if you and your

519
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:05,920
class that there's like sometimes like additional risks that may occur with weight loss.

520
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:15,830
So with this, we're talking this is in this particular setting, all this very modest in terms of total weight loss.

521
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:20,600
Remember, these people are starting out with if that table.

522
01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:27,370
So they're starting out at an average of 94 kilograms.

523
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:33,510
And the goal here is just 7%, just 7% and maintain that.

524
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:37,740
And they gain some of that weight back right here.

525
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:41,100
And then it looks worse here in terms of this.

526
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:49,499
So in terms of the goal here, it was a very modest reduction and the other gaining some of this weight back.

527
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:58,950
But they're able to maintain some of this weight loss. And despite that, it it significantly reduce the incidence of diabetes.

528
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:03,260
So maybe it's like less extreme than like the graph makes me think it looks.

529
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:06,480
So it might not be the risk is just that, right?

530
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:13,019
So, yes, we're talking about a modest change. What they should have what I would have liked to have seen here is the percent change,

531
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:17,340
not the change in kilograms here in this particular access here.

532
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:26,429
Yeah. I still have question with the last slide versus just on the last slice, which was the difference.

533
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:33,030
Just the less to you know, the less this one.

534
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:42,090
Oh, yeah, yeah. The steep differences in the neuropathy and that's because the first.

535
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,050
Like reduction that part because it's accumulated accumulated data.

536
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:54,340
This is yeah this is this is just at the 15 year time point, the time for coffee.

537
01:07:55,240 --> 01:08:02,860
So this is looking at people and determining if they have a complication of diabetes at 15 years after the randomization.

538
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:07,100
So this is the time point. Nothing to do it mis how to change.

539
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:10,780
This is a one time question. Thank you. Okay, I got it.

540
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:22,020
So that this is this is the basis for this recommendation, this diabetes prevention program.

541
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:27,050
And this program has been replicated in different forms.

542
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:34,140
It is, again, what's recommended for people who are at risk for developing diabetes.

543
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:43,770
And the behavior modification includes this reduction in calories depending on a

544
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:47,880
percentage of your initial based on calories and increasing physical activity.

545
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:57,630
You might not notice and some of these individuals, a 5 to 7% difference might not affect their appearance, too, to any great extent.

546
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:07,799
Again, the idea here is to reduce ectopic lipid deposition by reducing your caloric intake and then

547
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:15,510
releasing more water out of the bathtub or saying to prevent that soggy bathroom match.

548
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:23,100
So you are essentially lowering the level just a little bit and it seems to make a huge difference.

549
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:26,829
Okay. All right.

550
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:36,010
Any more questions about this? Next time I'm going to talk about the the Look Ahead study,

551
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:41,080
which was a study that was done with a large group of people for a very long period of time.

552
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:47,500
And that study began with people who already had type two diabetes.

553
01:09:50,860 --> 01:10:00,999
The other thing I'm going to mention is there's an alternative type of thing, too, that people have tried.

554
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,450
And it's this intuitive eating, mindful eating approach.

555
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:13,850
And I gave you a meta analysis of how effective that was in terms of its impact on people's diet quality over a long period of time.

556
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:17,320
So we're ending up a little bit early today.

557
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:29,320
Yeah, I also have a question is almost an extra skin and I know but not with 5.7% said they apparently that's

558
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:35,500
about to change very much at all about what we're doing in similar ways with the skin reduction.

559
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:42,190
Yes. So to me, how does that team that says talk or overall health, what's the reduction in.

560
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:46,839
Yeah, I don't know, but I wouldn't think of it. All right.

561
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:54,510
Thank you for the graphic here.

562
01:10:56,750 --> 01:11:16,700
Yeah, I mean, that it's not like I keep you know, I'll just have one more thing.

563
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:27,840
I was just going for the benefit of being okay.

564
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:36,760
But it's not that kind of to make up your mind is also what I was saying.

565
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:41,550
I mean, just like I said.

566
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:48,960
My God, I'm so sorry for your loss.

567
01:11:49,690 --> 01:11:57,860
Yeah, we're going to do it next year.

568
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:08,470
After I was like, okay.

569
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:16,929
And then I was like, Oh, well, this is something that you project.

570
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:28,300
Well, I would say binge watch both sides in the divisional figures as well.

571
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:51,430
But but they are a very big sample at the time of the presentation and I'll do whatever I usually do.

572
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:56,260
It's on X or you know, and I go shopping for my stuff.

573
01:12:58,450 --> 01:13:03,069
It's like I have a fancy camera.

574
01:13:03,070 --> 01:13:12,250
Oh, awesome. I feel like I'm laughing to make it sound like you're just in uniform.

575
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:28,120
And you know, I'll get something like via question guy John Staples, 390 points to that.

576
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:35,710
Did you end up being an employee because it was so close and it was so nice?

577
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:49,990
So when I was just like we were all not all of 2011, I ended up winning because, you know, yeah, they want you to look nice.

578
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:56,830
So do the same thing.

579
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:00,680
I know, though. So I tried.

580
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:04,060
That was interesting. So you wanted to do that?

581
01:14:04,870 --> 01:14:08,620
Oh, I do want to do this one. Okay.

582
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:12,250
You want to do you want to do this?

583
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:18,640
This is everything I have to do. This kind of any kind of I get a digital.

584
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:23,110
I can't even do that because I just don't know.

585
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:28,620
Which is why I do. I'm fine with that.

586
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:35,459
I am. I didn't. For you bring home.

587
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:43,050
All righty. And we figured it out. Hey, guys, I am so happy for you.

588
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:47,370
No, it's fine. I'm sorry to contribute this much in the beginning.

589
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:52,590
I'm sorry. I didn't realize. I thought it was due this week.

590
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:56,730
Super early. I thought when you were playing.

591
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:03,660
Oh, just the middle. It would be great. 547 I need you for the first question.

592
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:08,250
Until five. I think about the other three.

593
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:12,750
So. Yeah. This sounds great.

594
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:20,400
This sounds good. You're going to be very happy together.

595
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:29,940
Okay. I'm really exercising exercise under these locations since I tried to pick the

596
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:37,559
side of the topic of the lectures throughout the semester is about exercise,

597
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:43,020
motivation and adherence because everyone else is just like those of 330 minutes a week.

598
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:48,329
What makes you want to page over other programs where you have it be?

599
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:51,740
All the other ones are like look like Jillian mitochondria.

600
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:53,730
And I'm like, No, thank you.

601
01:15:54,150 --> 01:16:02,010
I was like, I'm going to do everything in my power to not have to do a presentation to get the taste of your presentation.

602
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:14,450
Food system is just this in the presentation. I don't understand why all the charity stuff I can't think of like a presentation.

603
01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:23,970
Yeah, I have to go first Thursday because I have an oil get to the middle and didn't

604
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:29,020
realize that I should be on the same day as I sit on a plane and set it up.

605
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:33,270
But I can't reschedule because I have to get it done before the test.

606
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:38,290
Got it. Because I'll see them at home.

607
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:42,080
I know I'm probably leaving like the 11th or.

608
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:49,590
Oh, I'm going to be there now that I have probably just approached.

609
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:53,430
It's kind of TBD right now. There's a couple of things that happened.

610
01:16:55,560 --> 01:17:15,010
So I get my natural chemical reactions and it becomes has become an issue and some items are raised.

611
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:24,680
So I'm not quite sure what kind of specialty at some point during the next 3 to 5 years, I guess,

612
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:35,220
and find out which is which area I really want to become like of these like eating disorder

613
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:44,069
and cause I feel like I still need a lot of practical experience on these topics.

614
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:56,180
So I would just like saying yes to 3 to 5 years and explore and have that decided to become what kind of specialty a violation.

615
01:17:57,330 --> 01:18:05,600
That's great. So sounds like a lot of interests and you really wanted to explore and see what it would mean.

616
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,700
A really fun filled experience. That's great.

617
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:15,390
People have an opportunity to change the internship, to explore different aspects of the field.

618
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:23,760
I see that you had a summer internship experience and you have professional experience in your resume.

619
01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:37,440
Can you tell me about a time that you had brought up against Challenge and then how you were able to overcome that challenge?

620
01:18:37,890 --> 01:18:48,050
Yeah, so I was working in medicine as a speech assistant defense and I said,

621
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:54,660
we are responsible for receiving calls from the patients and help them on their meals.

622
01:18:55,570 --> 01:19:00,809
And it was a crisis because like this process,

623
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:14,100
the order saw all the food that was conveyed and that's and what's calling from the room and it's like saying that why not use the ice?

624
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:24,840
It made some of those things. We we just make sure that we connect with this situation and can the invasion.

625
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:37,610
And this is normal and this exciting process that patients call it as soon as possible so that we can make sure that every patient received

626
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:47,520
our response as possible and those that we connect with each other and to make sure that we are in the same place in the same condition.

627
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:57,831
So through this through these measures, we successfully survive this crisis and make it not receive any companies funding.
