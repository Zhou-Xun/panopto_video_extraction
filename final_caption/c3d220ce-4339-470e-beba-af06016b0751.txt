00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:09,330
Hi there. To day, we are going to talk about public health system.

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,850
It's. And this should be the first lecture in a series of.

3
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:28,990
Lecture videos. By the end of this video, you should be able to understand why the public health system is called a system.

4
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,690
And begin to learn about different interpretations of the system.

5
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,930
We'll be going over this in different sorts of details across the semester.

6
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,070
So we should start off with a grounding definition for the public health system.

7
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:54,130
Remember, there may be different definitions to what a system is based on geographic context.

8
00:00:54,190 --> 00:01:03,069
So in the US we'll use the CDC definition, which is that public health systems are commonly defined as all public,

9
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:10,480
private and voluntary entities that contribute to the delivery of essential public health services within the jurisdiction.

10
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:22,060
So if you watch some other slides and hopefully you have watch some other videos at this point,

11
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:28,060
you'll know that this is a repeat slide and sometimes we will repeat a slide.

12
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,890
If you see something more than once that because we really want you to get it.

13
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:43,750
So for our purposes here, we want you to remember that the responsibility of the public's health used to solely rely on the government.

14
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,560
And when it became evident that the needs of the public health were too complex,

15
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:55,610
that responsibility extended outward and responsibility began to lay at the feet of the public health system.

16
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:03,930
Which, as we recall, we go back aside. Consists of all public, private and voluntary entities.

17
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:13,050
So in the future of the public health in the 21st century,

18
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:21,990
a report that came out in response to the Postal Service anthrax attacks that occurred in 2001 and lays out other reasons why we needed a system.

19
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,010
And this is part of your reading for this week.

20
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,530
We have given you the executive summary, I think, of a 400 page report.

21
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:39,900
So they lay out all of basically their major takeaways and the executive summary that we gave you.

22
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,460
And as part of this report, they recognize that.

23
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:57,720
The public's health couldn't rely on solely the government, not only because it was way too complex, but it was also way too expensive.

24
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:04,860
Public resources are finite, and the public's health is just one of many of the responsibilities of the government.

25
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,180
Also, the government has only so much reach.

26
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,860
So democratic societies define and limit the types of actions that can be undertaken only by government and reserve.

27
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,430
Other social choices for other types of institutions.

28
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:30,490
So there's only so much that the government can do when it comes to the public's health, when really it needs to involve a broader stroke.

29
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:40,260
The determinants of health that interact to create good or ill health derive from various sources and sectors.

30
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:48,780
Among other factors, health is shipped by laws and policies, employment and income and social norms and influences.

31
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,000
They don't just stem from anything that is controlled by the government.

32
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,160
Also, there's huge power in collaboration. There's growing recognition that individuals,

33
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:11,130
communities and various social institutions can form powerful collaborative relationships to improve health that government alone cannot replicate.

34
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,990
So at the end of the day, good health for the public should be a shared goal for everyone.

35
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,370
The governmental public health infrastructure is in the purview of the government.

36
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:36,170
But it has to extend beyond. So at this point, you should have seen this pyramid at least once or twice,

37
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:40,250
and you're going to see this pyramid a lot more by the end of this semester.

38
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,780
Since the publishing of the report that I just spoke about,

39
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:50,709
there has been a significant amount of attention to the capacity building of not just entities within the governmental apparatus,

40
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,450
but extending outward as well. As depicted in the pyramid.

41
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:01,059
United States governmental public health system represents a complex and broad range of federal,

42
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:08,860
state and local health agencies, laboratories and hospitals, as well as non-governmental public and private agencies.

43
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:19,649
Voluntary organizations and individuals. Federal agencies are represented at the top of the hill at the top and health departments at the center of

44
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,570
the pyramid because of their primary leadership responsibilities for developing a broad knowledge base.

45
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,649
So that policy is driven by long range issues,

46
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:37,050
ensuring that the public interest is served and achieving a balance between individual liberties and equitable actions for the good of the community.

47
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:43,110
So while note that this pyramid was developed by the federal government,

48
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,299
so it makes sense then that they see themselves kind of at the pinnacle in

49
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,240
terms of having the most responsibility when it comes to primary leadership.

50
00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:00,990
So just think about this. When we're thinking about how a system is constructed, who constructs it and for what reason.

51
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:07,610
This model is a pyramid that suggests that the most power rests at the top.

52
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,140
But what is the utility of imagining the system in other ways?

53
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:20,740
In this depiction, which is another model that you'll probably see a lot of if you haven't already seen it.

54
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:28,250
In this depiction, there is less reliance on the government per say and more on the designated public health agency.

55
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,080
Here, there is no specific category for the federal or state distinction.

56
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:40,070
The approach is more networked, relying on much more entities for a shared and broadened responsibility.

57
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:52,910
Over the course of the semester, we'll be delving more into these components through the lens of different cases.

58
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,630
Sometimes we will further investigate the specifics of the component itself.

59
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:06,530
Like, for instance, we're going to talk through the ways that a state health department has actually organized and managed.

60
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:16,760
But we'll also get an idea of how state health department is run through the lens of a case, maybe through COVID 19, maybe through vaccination.

61
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,340
But using an example will also be able to see how state health departments operate as well.

62
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,990
Sometimes we will further investigate the specifics of the component itself outside of the case.

63
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:36,669
Again, for instance, a video following this one will go into some detail about how state health departments work in general.

64
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:40,960
But you'll also listen to a podcast about the local system through the lens of COVID.

65
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,990
And since we are talking about the public health system,

66
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:56,150
it is also important to understand that to use the public health approach practitioners use and apply scientific methods.

67
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:03,830
These methods come from a series of core sciences that provide the foundation to some of those who operate within the system.

68
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:10,460
These sciences include public health surveillance, which we use to monitor a public health situation.

69
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:19,230
Epidemiology enables us to determine where diseases originate, how or why they move through populations and how we can prevent them.

70
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:25,600
And public health laboratories support public health by performing tests to confirm disease diagnoses.

71
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,370
Laboratories also support public health by conducting research and training.

72
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:39,030
As we continue to rely more and more on electronic health records, public health informatics continues to increase in importance.

73
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:45,000
Informatics deals with the methods of collecting, compiling and presenting health information.

74
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,030
It enables us to use electronic data effectively when addressing a public health situation.

75
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,920
Prevention effectiveness is closely linked to public health policy.

76
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:05,870
Prevention Effectiveness studies provide important economic information for decision makers to help them choose the best option available.

77
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:07,820
Together.

78
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:15,380
These five core sciences can help us protect and promote the public's health by giving public health practitioners the answers that they need.

79
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:22,790
Public health is better able to respond to the situation by using contributions from each of these sciences.

80
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:27,710
One science alone cannot answer the questions and provide a solution.

81
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,969
It is the application of these core sciences together and should also exhibit the importance

82
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:41,650
of why good data and good science help the public health system do its job more than.

83
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:53,399
In 1988, the Institute of Medicine defined three core functions of public health agencies that must

84
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,970
be carried out at all levels of government for the overall public health system to work.

85
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:08,590
The three core functions are assessment. Policy development and assurance assessment is doing what needs to be done,

86
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:14,830
meaning that you gather that information by collecting, analyzing and making information available.

87
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,860
Policy development is being part of the solution to get it done.

88
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:27,300
So then it's data for action and policy development is usually the action that takes place as a result of the assessment.

89
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,630
And the assurance is making sure that it all does get done.

90
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:43,870
The core functions, assessment, policy, development and assurance must be carried out at all levels of the government,

91
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,330
the federal, state and local levels for the overall public health system to function effectively.

92
00:10:50,220 --> 00:11:00,060
Here. If we look at how tobacco use might be managed on different levels, we see a few examples of each function at different government levels.

93
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,940
So here, if we're thinking about how tobacco could be managed on the federal level when it comes to policy,

94
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:13,530
when it comes to assessment, that data that's collected is collected through national tobacco, public health surveillance.

95
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,940
And then we have that data for action which lands in policy.

96
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,080
And that action is that now there's a smoking ban on commercial flights.

97
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:28,260
We've collected the data. We know that the data says X, Y and Z.

98
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,270
And then we implement a policy.

99
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:39,809
And in order to implement the policy, we then create federal grants for anti-smoking research so that there's a loop or even more assessment,

100
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:43,950
more developed, more development of policy, and then more assurance.

101
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,360
If we go down to the state level, it's the same kinds of things.

102
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,170
On the assessment side for the collection of data,

103
00:11:52,500 --> 00:12:00,630
we monitor state tobacco use and then what we might do as a result of collecting that data and noticing certain trends,

104
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:07,560
we may increase tobacco tax in order to prevent an increase in sales for tobacco.

105
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:17,499
And the way that we are able to be able to increase that tobacco tax is then a funding for campaign through Proposition 99,

106
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:27,010
which comes through the state. And then if we get down to the local and the local end, we may have a report based on local tobacco use.

107
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:36,340
And then we use that report and the data from within that report to create county laws prohibiting smoking in bars and the pub.

108
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,870
The public health system on the local level has to produce resources to help smokers

109
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:46,000
quit in multiple languages in order for all of these things to be effective.

110
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:54,370
So here's just a mini matrix on how we think through assessment, policy, development and assurance on each level of government.

111
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,350
See you at the next video.
