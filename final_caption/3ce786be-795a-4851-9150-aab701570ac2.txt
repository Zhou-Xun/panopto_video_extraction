00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Hello. Welcome to
this lecture covering

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,890
measures of association
and regression.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,600
This lecture will focus on

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,645
the concept of Pearson's
Correlation Coefficient.

5
00:00:09,645 --> 00:00:11,910
Now, often we're
interested in knowing how

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,520
continuous measures
move with each other.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,830
For example, if my
weight changes,

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:17,550
I might wonder if

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,410
my blood pressure will
change and if so,

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,000
by how much it will change.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,875
Or if I take more aspirin,

12
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:25,065
will the severity
of my pain change?

13
00:00:25,065 --> 00:00:27,870
If so, by how much
will it change?

14
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,720
Such questions as these relate to

15
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,030
the correlation that
we have between weight

16
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,340
and blood pressure or
the correlation of

17
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,190
doses of aspirin and
severity of pain.

18
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,365
We are able to use data to

19
00:00:39,365 --> 00:00:41,570
numerically quantify
this correlation with

20
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,490
a single statistic that we

21
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,840
call Pearson's
Correlation Coefficient.

22
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,820
Our learning objectives are
first to understand how

23
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,230
two continuous variables can be

24
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,015
displayed through a scatterplot.

25
00:00:53,015 --> 00:00:54,590
To then understand how Pearson's

26
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,120
correlation coefficient r is

27
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,530
computed from two continuous

28
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,480
variables to be able to visually

29
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,220
discriminate between
different values of

30
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,290
Pearson's r and to use

31
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,390
Pearson's r to make
inference about

32
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,470
the population correlation Rho.

33
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,060
Now, in front of you if
you see a scatter plot

34
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,020
published by Siegel
and Rothman in 2016.

35
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,580
In this study, they wanted to

36
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,350
examine how firearm ownership in

37
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,940
a state was related to

38
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,355
the male firearm suicide
rate in each state.

39
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:25,000
In the scatterplot, each point in

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,315
this plot represents the
data from one state.

41
00:01:28,315 --> 00:01:30,370
I've highlighted a
state here that had

42
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,650
15 firearm suicides per 100,000

43
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,380
individuals which corresponded to

44
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,980
a proportion of gun
ownership of 61 percent.

45
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,140
I highlight another
state which had

46
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,840
25 firearm suicides per 100,000

47
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,360
individuals with a
corresponding proportion

48
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,455
of gun ownership at 39 percent.

49
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:52,040
Now, numerically, we can

50
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,560
quantify this pattern
by denoting each of

51
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,880
the gun ownership rates in

52
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,075
each state by the letter
x with a subscript,

53
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:02,290
i, to indicate each
individual state.

54
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,490
The male firearm suicide rate in

55
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,200
each state is represented
with the letter y again,

56
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,725
with a subscript i so
that we can connect

57
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:12,965
each x and each y for each state.

58
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:15,260
Now, we can take the
average of all of

59
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,090
the gun ownership proportions and

60
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,100
compute an overall
sample average.

61
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,005
We represent with x-bar.

62
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:22,580
We can take all of

63
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,950
the male firearm
suicide rates and take

64
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,540
an average across all of

65
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,520
the states and we represent
this mean by y-bar.

66
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,470
For each state then,
we compare what

67
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,055
their values for x and y
are to the overall means.

68
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:38,780
We can describe
whether each state

69
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,280
is above average or below

70
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,480
average with respect to

71
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,145
gun ownership and
the suicide rate.

72
00:02:44,145 --> 00:02:46,310
Now, with these deviations,

73
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,040
if x and y,

74
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,915
if gun ownership and
suicide rates move

75
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:54,320
away from the overall means
in the same direction,

76
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,720
then both of the deviations are

77
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,190
negative or both of the
deviations are positive.

78
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,610
Therefore, if we multiply
the two deviations,

79
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,515
that product must be positive.

80
00:03:06,515 --> 00:03:08,780
In contrast, we can
think of a state that

81
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,030
maybe has gun ownership that is

82
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,250
higher than average but

83
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,330
perhaps a suicide rate
that is lower than

84
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,805
average so that
the two deviations

85
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:18,680
move in opposite directions.

86
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,840
One is negative and
one is positive.

87
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,540
Therefore, the product of

88
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,260
those two deviations
must be negative.

89
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,375
Like many other statistics,

90
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,640
we'll take the average
of all the product

91
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,085
of these deviations and
then take an average

92
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:37,040
dividing by n minus
1 instead of n. We

93
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,295
call this quantity the sample
co-variance of x and y.

94
00:03:40,295 --> 00:03:45,250
It tells us how much x and
y change at the same time.

95
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,450
This number by itself
is an interpretable.

96
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,660
So we scale this number by

97
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,740
the standard deviation of

98
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,800
x and the standard
deviation of y.

99
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,050
This ratio is known as

100
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,140
Pearson's correlation coefficient
which we represent with

101
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,450
the letter r. It is a number that

102
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,995
ranges between negative
one and positive one.

103
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,510
In front of you you
see six scatterplots

104
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,330
representing different
magnitudes of correlation.

105
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,950
The upper left-hand corner,

106
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,140
you see a scatter
plot corresponding

107
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,525
to a Pearson's
correlation of 0.78.

108
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:19,550
You see that the points go in

109
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,475
an upward pattern so
that larger values of x

110
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:24,860
are corresponding to
large values of y and

111
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,305
small values of x correspond
to small values of y.

112
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:32,055
This Pearson's
correlation is 0.78.

113
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:33,710
In the middle top plot, you see

114
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,900
Pearson's correlation
of negative 0.7.

115
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,060
Again, the points are
tightly clustered with

116
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,960
each other and they form
a downward pattern.

117
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,000
Therefore, we have a correlation
that is fairly close to

118
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,390
negative one and it is
actually point, negative 0.7.

119
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,800
On the upper right hand corner,

120
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,210
we see a plot now
with the Pearson's

121
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,385
correlation coefficient of 0.4.

122
00:04:52,385 --> 00:04:53,870
So in comparison to

123
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,795
the upper left-hand plot where
the correlation was 0.78,

124
00:04:56,795 --> 00:04:58,130
we now see the points are

125
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,945
less tightly scattered together.

126
00:04:59,945 --> 00:05:01,715
There is still an upward trend

127
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:03,980
but because they
are more scattered,

128
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,835
the correlation is not
as strong and it is 0.4.

129
00:05:06,835 --> 00:05:08,060
In the bottom left,

130
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,400
we see Pearson's correlation
of negative 0.4.

131
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,380
Again, we see points
that are not as

132
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,585
tightly clustered
as they were before

133
00:05:14,585 --> 00:05:16,820
and we see a downward pattern

134
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,625
in the points indicating
negative correlation,

135
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,490
and the magnitude is 0.4.

136
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,325
In the bottom middle plot,

137
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:25,520
we see Pearson's
correlation of 0.18.

138
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,800
Here, it is hard to
discern a pattern.

139
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,740
Perhaps we can see just
a slight upward trend in

140
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,020
the points and Pearson's
correlation is

141
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,800
0.18 getting closer to zero.

142
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,370
In the bottom right hand corner,

143
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,960
you see a scatter plot

144
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,465
corresponding to
essentially no correlation.

145
00:05:41,465 --> 00:05:44,840
The actual Pearson's correlation
coefficient is 0.01,

146
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,800
but we can not see any
noticeable pattern in this plot,

147
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,550
just a random scatter of points.

148
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,325
Now, Pearson's correlation
coefficient is a statistic.

149
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:57,200
It is computed from our data.

150
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,850
It is also an estimate of a
parameter in the population.

151
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,340
So we consider Pearson's
correlation coefficient

152
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,320
to be an estimate for Rho,

153
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,980
which is the correlation of
x and y in the population.

154
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,400
Now Pearson's correlation
coefficient has no units.

155
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,290
Therefore, it is not affected by

156
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,645
changes of location or scale.

157
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:20,990
I could take each of the gun
ownership rates for example,

158
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,925
and divide them by 100.

159
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:25,145
The resulting correlation between

160
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:26,825
gun ownership and male

161
00:06:26,825 --> 00:06:29,015
firearm suicide
would be unchanged.

162
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:31,355
I would get the same
correlation coefficient.

163
00:06:31,355 --> 00:06:33,290
So I can divide all my data by

164
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,360
the same number or
add or subtract

165
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,400
the same number from
every value and

166
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,895
the correlation will not change.

167
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:43,435
Now, if x and y are
independent in the population,

168
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:45,080
then I should get
data that produce

169
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,490
a correlation
coefficient close to

170
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,890
zero and the
population correlation

171
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,340
coefficient rho is exactly zero.

172
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,020
If I get perfect
correlation in the data,

173
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,975
if I have a Pearson's correlation
of one or negative one,

174
00:06:56,975 --> 00:06:59,225
then if I do a scatter
plot of x and y,

175
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:00,665
I will see points that lie

176
00:07:00,665 --> 00:07:04,195
exactly on a line
with no scatter.

177
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:07,760
Most importantly, Pearson's
correlation coefficient r

178
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,110
in the population correlation

179
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,670
coefficient rho are

180
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,445
specific measures of
linear association.

181
00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:18,625
They describe how x and y
would fit on a straight line.

182
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,260
Now, I returned to
the scatterplot

183
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,225
I showed you at the
beginning of this lecture.

184
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:24,680
If we take the data and we

185
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,705
compute Pearson's
correlation coefficient,

186
00:07:26,705 --> 00:07:30,785
I show you that the resulting
value is r equal to 0.84.

187
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:33,079
There is strong
positive correlation

188
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,490
between firearm ownership in

189
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,425
a state and its
corresponding rate

190
00:07:36,425 --> 00:07:38,155
of male firearm suicides.

191
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:41,370
Again, we can see a strong
upward trend in the data.

192
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,850
The points are fairly
clustered together and

193
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,590
therefore we get a
correlation coefficient

194
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,395
that is far from zero.

195
00:07:47,395 --> 00:07:49,250
Now, we can also do

196
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,065
a hypothesis test using

197
00:07:51,065 --> 00:07:53,105
the Pearson's
correlation coefficient.

198
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,130
Again, hypothesis tests apply

199
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,675
to the population parameter.

200
00:07:56,675 --> 00:07:59,060
The null hypothesis says
that the two values x

201
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,430
and y have no association or that

202
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,710
the correlation is
exactly zero and

203
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,300
the alternative
states that there is

204
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,700
an association between
x and y and therefore,

205
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,190
the correlation is
something other than zero.

206
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,200
Now, that we have hypotheses,

207
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,780
we need a test statistic.

208
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,440
The numerator, the signal of

209
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,490
the test statistic is

210
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,695
our estimated correlation
from the data.

211
00:08:18,695 --> 00:08:21,530
We take the absolute
value because we just

212
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,200
want to see how far the
correlation is from zero.

213
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,990
We do not care if it is
negative or positive.

214
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,370
The denominator of
the test statistic,

215
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,850
the skepticism is quantified
by this formula I show you.

216
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:37,070
Therefore, we can compute
a test statistic which is

217
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,645
the ratio of those two values

218
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:40,190
and using the values in our data,

219
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,920
we get a test statistic of 10.82.

220
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,140
We again, returned to
the standard normal

221
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,170
distribution to get the p-value.

222
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,010
Again, any test statistic above

223
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,230
two or below negative two,

224
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,135
would produce
statistical significance

225
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:55,490
or p-value less than 0.05.

226
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,500
In this case, my
test statistic is so

227
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,270
much larger than two that

228
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,460
the p-value is
extremely small and

229
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,075
is something less than 0.001.

230
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:06,705
Therefore, I would reject
the null hypothesis.

231
00:09:06,705 --> 00:09:08,660
I conclude that from the data

232
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,230
in the population there
is an association

233
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,550
between firearm rates
in a state and the

234
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,505
corresponding rate of
male firearm suicides.

235
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:19,220
We can also take the test
statistic and compute

236
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,690
a 95 percent confidence interval

237
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,310
for the population correlation,

238
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,590
by simply taking my
estimated correlation of

239
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,205
0.84 and ad or subtracting
two standard errors.

240
00:09:28,205 --> 00:09:32,930
Producing a confidence
interval of 0.69-0.99.

241
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,400
Again, this confidence interval

242
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,480
suggests that in the population,

243
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,990
the correlation between
firearm ownership

244
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,280
and male firearm suicides
could be as low as 0.69,

245
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,575
could be as high as 0.99.

246
00:09:45,575 --> 00:09:46,970
But again, I would reject

247
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,055
the null hypothesis
of zero correlation

248
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,080
because the null value of zero is

249
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,275
not in this confidence interval.

250
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:54,980
Both the confidence interval

251
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,840
and the test statistic lead to

252
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,515
the same conclusion to
reject the null hypothesis.

253
00:10:00,515 --> 00:10:02,990
So Pearson's correlation
is a measure of

254
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,740
how well the points in our
data cluster around a line.

255
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,080
As I've said, we view
correlation as a measure

256
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,650
of the linear
association of x and y.

257
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,610
Now, there are
situations in which

258
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,560
Pearson's correlation
can lead us to make

259
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,935
questionable or
invalid conclusions

260
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:20,510
about correlation if we
do not first examine

261
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,850
a scatter plot of the data and

262
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,870
those situations will be

263
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,159
covered in the SQL
to this lecture.
