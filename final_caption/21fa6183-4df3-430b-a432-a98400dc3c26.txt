1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:06,420
The Health Care System,
Immigration Status and Sexual Identity.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,510
There are a number of vulnerable and
disenfranchised populations that must

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,040
be considered in efforts
to address health equity.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,570
Some populations are more
hidden than others.

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,390
This segment focuses on two groups as
examples of vulnerable populations

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,720
that have received much less attention
than other groups in health equity,

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,740
research and practice.

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,860
By the end of this segment, you will
be able to understand health disparity

9
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,640
challenges faced by some immigrant and
sexual minority populations.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,540
And consider how structural approaches can
intervene to reduce health disparities.

11
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,030
A critical analysis of social
determinants of health

12
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,050
requires an examination of racism and
discrimination.

13
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:56,020
We now know that disparities in population
health is a reflection of structural

14
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,432
racism and
discrimination that results from unfair or

15
00:00:59,432 --> 00:01:05,981
unjust treatment between the more and
less advantaged groups.

16
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:10,863
Most health disparities occur because
of differences in quality of life due

17
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:15,980
to racism, sexism, classism,
ageism, among other isms.

18
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,030
Income and poverty influences, however,

19
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,540
have been examined most frequently
to explain observed differences.

20
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,910
Recently, immigration status and sexual
identity have emerged into literature when

21
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:31,500
examining disparities in
the healthcare system.

22
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,010
How do we understand disparities
based on these specific

23
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,780
social identities at the population level?

24
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,290
Just as important, what might be
done to reduce disparities for

25
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,950
these groups from a policy perspective?

26
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,680
The Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals, or

27
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,420
DACA, is a national program
established in 2012.

28
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,860
To give temporary legal status to
some young undocumented adults,

29
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,640
30 years old or younger who came to

30
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,350
the United States before they were
16 years old, among other criteria.

31
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,274
Little is known about the health and

32
00:02:10,274 --> 00:02:16,540
mental health status of DACA youth
because of limited empirical research.

33
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,797
While DACA status allow these
youth to seek educational and

34
00:02:19,797 --> 00:02:22,924
employment opportunities,
they're only eligible for

35
00:02:22,924 --> 00:02:27,570
a limited access to healthcare
services in this country.

36
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,680
Examining known healthcare benefits and
challenges for Latino and Asian and

37
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,720
Pacific Island young adults help us to
think about what social determinants of

38
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:46,010
health data are needed to make progress
towards health equity for these groups.

39
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,297
One study of the experiences of DACA
youth in the healthcare system for

40
00:02:50,297 --> 00:02:54,948
Latinos found that a lack of mental
health services, culturally competent

41
00:02:54,948 --> 00:03:02,197
providers and financial problems
remain daunting challenges.

42
00:03:02,197 --> 00:03:05,044
While another study of
undocumented Asian and

43
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:08,530
Pacific Islander young
adults raised more issues.

44
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,140
Including concerns for family members,
and a number of social determinants that

45
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,310
are often overlooked in healthcare
when serving DACA youth.

46
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,750
One example of a potential
structural intervention for

47
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,704
transgender populations is
providing legal documentation for

48
00:03:25,704 --> 00:03:31,309
changing their names to be consistent
with their gender identity.

49
00:03:31,309 --> 00:03:35,949
The healthcare system often recognizes sex
as documented on legal birth certificates

50
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,870
for medical purposes.

51
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,750
This practice is a source of stress and
discrimination for

52
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:47,560
transgendered populations
as emerging research shows.

53
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,100
The potential benefits for such
a structural change within the healthcare

54
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:55,490
system for transgendered population
is an avenue worth pursuing

55
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:00,760
as it may influence a number of health and
well-being areas.

56
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,500
What would you suggest as a potential
structural social determinants of health

57
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,450
intervention either for DACA,
young adults, or transgender populations?
