1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,740
I'm supposed to open the PowerPoint?

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,250
Maybe. And I want to see if that works.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,750
There we go. Okay. Thank you. That's weird, but.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:20,250
Okay. All right. All right. Well, I did have one more question for you for surveillance.

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,330
Why would you rather have a more sensitive or more specific definition?

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:41,320
And why? Her grandkids participated in.

7
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:48,160
I just think it's kind of like the airport is more sensitive than you might think of

8
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:53,020
things that aren't transparent because it's been kind of like this kind of thing.

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,570
So there are times when you want something more sensitive, right? Because that means you're not going to miss it.

10
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:09,970
Right. So the question is, is for hospital, for infections, is it better to not miss a case,

11
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,910
which means you're going to overcome because some of those won't be real cases like we saw?

12
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:29,380
Or do you want to make sure that all the cases are real? Yeah, I would I would answer that.

13
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,300
The cost of each thing that grew over time, you know, who raised more money.

14
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:40,600
Right. Well, so you hit on both things. So it's the reason for why you're doing this surveillance.

15
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:46,900
Right. So why are we you know, this whole class is all about surveillance for this, but that does not.

16
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,709
But. But for this reason. So what's the purpose of the surveillance?

17
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,310
What? Why do they want to do it? Kevin kind of touched on this at the end of his lecture.

18
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,450
But why do you why do you use this? How is it used?

19
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:07,360
Yeah, I think one way it would be used would be to develop like prevention bundles to be used going forward.

20
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,340
So I would say you would want to catch more cases.

21
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,999
To be able to like develop a better prevention bundle. Right.

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,490
So, so it's to make sure so you find out you have a problem, right?

23
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,200
And so you want and then what else does this available if you develop prevention bundle?

24
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:36,399
What are you using surveillance for? So you might use it to say, Oh, we need to do something.

25
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,030
But then what do you do with the surveillance? Yet to see if it worked.

26
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:46,270
Yes, to see if it worked. Evaluation, right. So surveillance tells you if you have a problem.

27
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,590
Surveillance tells you if you fix the problem. Right.

28
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:56,440
But Stephen pointed out a lot of this show of hands is mandated.

29
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,910
Right. So it's to assess whether you have a good quality control or not.

30
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:08,590
And so these definitions are not local necessarily like you might actually I don't know if you if you do an outbreak investigation,

31
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,850
you might develop a very sensitive definition. Right.

32
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,780
Which may not meet the NSA definition.

33
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:24,190
Like you could have noticed with video if you had a Canada outbreak, it still wouldn't count.

34
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,730
Right. So you want to be thinking about why are you doing this?

35
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:37,390
And there's multiple purposes with that. So, so very happy to see you.

36
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:42,400
To who he can tell you all about his. He we go back a ways.

37
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,940
Yes. My name is Jeff Kuczynski. I am h me class of 2013.

38
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:59,700
Currently senior infection prevention is over at the hospital and as part of my duties is I am the of prevention lead for the hospital.

39
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:04,120
We also have like some nursing and position leads, but I would be the one for infection prevention.

40
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:09,730
So it seemed appropriate that I come and talk about cardio surveillance or catheter associated UTIs.

41
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:17,910
First off, in order to have to look for a court order, you need to know whether or not somebody meets criteria to be evaluated for a court.

42
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,450
And so with catheter associated, we need to know what the definition of a catheter is.

43
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,300
And specifically, we are looking at indwelling catheters.

44
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,770
So an indwelling catheter is going to be a drainage tube that is inserted through the urinary bladder,

45
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,030
through the urethra and left in place and is connected to a drainage bag.

46
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:39,340
So here's just a few schematics of in case you've never seen a full catheter. I was actually going to bring one, but I forgot to.

47
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,230
But the picture does it justice.

48
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:50,889
So essentially you have the the darker yellow is the the portion that goes into the patient will go with going all the way up to through the urethra.

49
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:56,830
And then here's just the drainage tube to a collection bag. These it looks different depending on the brand and what you need it for.

50
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:05,170
But this is essentially what it is. Once it gets into the bladder, once you get it through the neck of the urethral opening into the bladder,

51
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:14,080
there's a balloon that will be inflated that basically keep it in place and allows for continuing continuous drainage of urine.

52
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:20,410
So an indwelling catheter is different and quite a surveillance excludes other types of catheters,

53
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:27,100
such as a super pubic catheter, which here is a a diagram of what a super cubic catheter is, in case you didn't know.

54
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:33,070
As you can see it, it bypasses the urethra. It goes above the pubic bone into the bladder.

55
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:41,440
So even though it is an indwelling catheter in the sense that it stays in the bladder, it does not go through the urethra, so it is excluded.

56
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,959
Other types of catheters that we do exclude would be condom catheters and intermittent catheters, a condom catheter,

57
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,340
because it does not go through the urethra and it remains on the outside and

58
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,360
then an intermittent catheter because it is not indwelling by its definition.

59
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:03,050
It goes in. Remove the urine and comes out. So indications for an indwelling catheter.

60
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:11,450
So there are certain criteria that are set out by the CDC and that all institutions try to maintain for the reasons why somebody has a catheter.

61
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,580
And if you don't meet these reasons, we want them to come out.

62
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,130
The one the indications that are pretty much standard across all institutions is a patient would have acute urinary retention or obstruction

63
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:31,490
if there is a need for accurate hourly measurements of urinary output in a critically ill patient to assist in the healing of open,

64
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,700
sacral or perineal wounds in incontinent patients.

65
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,550
If the patient requires prolonged immobilization. So if the patient has some,

66
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,809
especially like a spinal cord injury or for some reason where we want to make sure

67
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:49,940
they remain still and not disturb them for pretty much the rest of our lumbar spine,

68
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:57,620
for preoperative use and selected surgeries, and to improve comfort for end of life care if needed.

69
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,489
Just because somebody is end of life does not mean that they need a catheter.

70
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:08,570
But if it was to improve their comfort in their last days, that would be an up and appropriate indication.

71
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:16,370
A few things about the preoperative use for surgical procedures is just because you're having a select procedure doesn't mean you necessarily get one.

72
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,149
I mean, a lot of surgeons, you know, surgeons might feel differently or whoever is doing it.

73
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,640
But here's what the official reasons for that would be.

74
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:29,660
So if a patient who's undergoing a urologic surgery or if there's any other surgery on the contiguous structures of the genital urinary tract,

75
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,610
makes sense that you'd want a urinary catheter.

76
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:41,090
If it's going to be a particularly long surgery, a catheter would be appropriate because you're just trying to hold it for hours on end.

77
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,489
We're going to have to go. So surgery is no different.

78
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:49,280
And when the procedure is done and you're in PACU or like immediately going back to the floor, it should be removed.

79
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:57,680
If the patient is anticipated to receive a large volume of infusions or diuretics during surgery, they're going to be producing a lot of urine.

80
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,660
And so we want to make sure that we can drain it away.

81
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:07,700
Any operative patient who has urinary incontinence and if there's any need for intraoperative monitoring of urine during the procedure.

82
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:15,740
I think you guys have well, I know you've done via E's. I think you've done collapses and a few other of our procedures.

83
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,990
So this really shouldn't be new. But just like all those other procedures, all those other infections that we look at,

84
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,940
we do have to report these to various bodies from an infection prevention standpoint.

85
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,239
We we report our data through the National Health Care Safety Network or NHS

86
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,190
then and this data does get pulled into the CMS value based purchasing program.

87
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:39,350
So again, once one for quality improvement and also a little bit of a connection to a financial impact,

88
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:48,499
there is the joint commission wants to know that we are tracking and following up and improving on our Cordis,

89
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,350
along with other Israelis and other agencies,

90
00:08:51,710 --> 00:09:00,560
the American Nurses Credentialing Center and maybe some other bodies are going to be looking at our data to award the hospitals,

91
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:07,520
accredit, certify whatever it would be. And here's an example is a magnet status, which is through the American Nurses Credentialing Center.

92
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:13,400
And it's just one of the metrics that they would look at in determining whether or not a hospital reaches magnet status.

93
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,870
When we look at an analysis standpoint, courtes are reported as a rate.

94
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:25,360
So it'd be the total number of causes that you identified over the total number of indwelling catheter days.

95
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,310
And we do that of a rate per 1000 fully days.

96
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:38,290
Our infections are found through active surveillance and our catheter days is collected through electronic nursing documentation.

97
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:44,020
We take a snapshot of all indwelling catheters that are on all the units at a single point in time.

98
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:51,639
So I think our hospital is like 1 p.m. or 2 a.m. somewhere where we know that patients really shouldn't really be moving around the hospital.

99
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,270
They should be in one like basically in their home unit at that time.

100
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:01,989
So somebody has a Foley that was inserted at 1230 and we have a snapshot at 1 a.m. We count them for that day.

101
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:06,520
But if that patient had the Foley inserted and at 330 in the morning,

102
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,450
they wouldn't be captured until the following day, assuming that the catheter is still in at that point.

103
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:19,210
So an example of a rate would be the cardiovascular. ICU has had four causes for the month and 466 in dwelling Foley catheter days.

104
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:26,650
So we do four over 466, multiply that by 1000 and we have a rate of 8.5 cordis per 1000 catheter days.

105
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,669
Another way that we can look at our data is through what's known as the standardized infection ratio or ACR,

106
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:41,890
and this is just simply an observed over expected ratio. It it provides an improved risk adjustment and replaces the risk stratified criteria.

107
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,669
So what this means is I mean, this may be over a decade ago.

108
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:52,120
I won't say that it kind of came up, but before we were always just comparing rates among other rates from other hospitals.

109
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,709
And we all have risk stratifying based on like it's a cardiovascular ICU versus a medical

110
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:02,980
ICU with the SLR does it takes all the data from your hospital and it risk stratify.

111
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:11,680
It's several different factors and so I can't remember exactly but whether or not you are an academic institution, a large institution,

112
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,530
just like certain parts about your hospital,

113
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:22,270
and it calculates what they would expect an institution of your life to have it in terms of number of infections.

114
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:28,209
Then you put in how many you've observed or counted and that's what gives your essay are so based on

115
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:32,680
that anything that's greater than one means that you had more causes that were observed than predicted,

116
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:39,640
which is bad. Less than one means that you had less than what was expected, which is always good, not always good.

117
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,020
Sometimes going back to our like value based purchasing and like the financial impacts, we want to do better than what's expected.

118
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:52,659
So like if we're expected to have ten and that's our third one, maybe we way to look at it, that's error of like 0.7.

119
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:59,770
So we're going to be better than one. So that's know take that with a grain of salt ways that we can present.

120
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:09,940
This is how we present our data here at our institution. Various hospitals do differ, but it's all essentially the same amount of information.

121
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:16,600
You're going to want to know what unit it is, what the timeframe is. You're going to obviously level your activities.

122
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,329
You're going to see how many infections and what months you had.

123
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:25,840
You want a certain amount of time with showing the data so you can see if there's a trend over time,

124
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,010
if you can see if there's been an improvement or if there's been an increase in infections.

125
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,850
We also have what our average rate is for the year.

126
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:43,270
We have what our utilization ratio is for our catheters.

127
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:48,190
So again, observed a number of catheters over a number of patient days.

128
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:54,909
And then we also have some summary data. We have what our what our rates have been for the past couple of years.

129
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,110
And we also include what are SARS so that we can fit a lot of data onto the graphs.

130
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,959
And just simply showing your graph might not be super helpful,

131
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:09,460
but having the graph and then explaining what all the impacts mean, explaining certain things.

132
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:17,230
So like if I, if this was my unit and I was presenting this data and I notice that in the summer of 21, we had an increase in infections.

133
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:23,920
We want to talk about that if if there was something where it looks like that we have had no infections,

134
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,010
but are we're noticing like an increase in our full utilization.

135
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:31,209
We might want to talk about that. So just depends on exactly what you want to share.

136
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,770
But just like showing this graph may not be super helpful, it would be helpful to explain that.

137
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,630
As I've kind of alluded to, this data is used for value based purchasing.

138
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,100
It can be used for goal setting, for individual units and for hospital leadership.

139
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:50,470
Our SARS can be used to benchmark to other institutions that have similar patient populations.

140
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:55,479
The rate in the USAR allows us to look at the trend over time and not react to just one month.

141
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,900
With a high number of cases, the rate will allow us to compare infections to catheter use, to assess the burden of the infection.

142
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,810
And then it can be used to drive interventions in education, see if if it's had any impact.

143
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:14,350
Some of our issues that we've had with our data analysis and I would say probably this isn't just specific to.

144
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,510
Heidi, but that's what I'm talking about. Our device data collection relies heavily on proper documentation.

145
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:30,640
So as I kind of alluded to some of them, we tried the best that we can to get the most accurate number of fully days that we have at any given time.

146
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:36,260
However, you know, it's all it really is based on what is actually logged in the chart and it is also based on the data pool.

147
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,930
So that may not be 100% accurate. Pretty darn accurate, but not all the time.

148
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,500
A major prevention strategy for getting the folio out,

149
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,450
maybe causing an increase in the rate which may mask the success of quality improvement initiatives.

150
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,290
So here's an example. So we have two units that both have three parties.

151
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,030
Each one unit has 400 full days and the other has 650.

152
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:02,680
So if we look at the one that has fewer holy days, they have a higher rate of 7.5.

153
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,900
However, if we look at the one that has the more holy days, they have a rate of 4.6.

154
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,860
Could we say that one unit is doing better than the other? I mean, on the one hand, yeah, unit B is doing great.

155
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,590
They have a lower rate, but they still have three infections and they have a lot more Foley days.

156
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,719
Is that that they truly do mean more Foley days, or is it one of those situations where they have more Foley days?

157
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,709
And actually, we have plenty of opportunity that where we could reduce that maybe one of

158
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:34,000
those infections could have been prevented if a patient didn't have a a Foley,

159
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:43,870
Catherine, for super long. But, you know, conversely, maybe 650 is the best that that unit has ever had and three is the best number of infections.

160
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:51,279
So that's a huge improvement. And for a that's actually more than what they've ever had and they're having a harder rate.

161
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,210
So it is really difficult to kind of say like, okay, this is good, yeah, this is bad.

162
00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:02,260
Didn't you take a look, you know, a little bit more bigger picture approach and basically see if it is good or not?

163
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:08,980
And I would say that's why I like doing that self comparison of unit over time and then also comparing them between units is helpful.

164
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,360
And then I'm also noticing with the data analysis,

165
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:20,230
many clinicians feel that their patient population requires an indwelling Foley for reasons outside of the clinical indications from the CDC.

166
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:30,310
And then one more point I would say is and as we will see with the definition, there are times when a Foley will I'm sorry,

167
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:35,830
because he will be called, but maybe clinically it is not or it would not be considered a UTI.

168
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:42,080
But given that the nature of the definition and there may be a little bit of a head butting between, you know,

169
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:50,740
what we're saying is a UTI that's being counted against you and what is actually happening clinically and whether it truly was a UTI.

170
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,230
So some current work and areas for improvement that are,

171
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:03,310
I would say always occurring with quality prevention is one is ensuring accurate documentation.

172
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:12,729
You know, I alluded to just the sheer number of Foley days, but also, you know, is PERI care being completed and is it being documented in the charts?

173
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,540
Along with Foley,

174
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:22,750
care is the appropriate indication being selected and continually being reevaluated for the reason why the Foley catheter is in place?

175
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:28,690
And are there even orders in place that somebody place a Foley in anticipation that somebody might want it?

176
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,630
But it turns out they never did and there was never an order in place.

177
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:38,379
We like to identify contributing factors that are associated with quality and develop some improvement strategies.

178
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,710
And we we pretty much keep these in our four major buckets.

179
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:49,180
One of them is Foley maintenance. So making sure that we are performing care in Foley, care of the patient on a daily basis,

180
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,129
making sure that there's no dependent loops of the drainage catheter, that we create loops.

181
00:17:54,130 --> 00:18:00,760
And if we create it in a way where urine can backflow, that can create the risk for recording culturing stewardship.

182
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,969
What is the reason for culturing in the first place?

183
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:09,190
When you're culturing, are you culturing from a an old catheter that may be colonized?

184
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:17,860
How are you collecting? The specimens are all important things to look at Foley appropriateness whether or not there is

185
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,570
an appropriate indication for the Foley and whether or not and an alternative could be used.

186
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:34,779
So it was always the case where Foley's were always the standard for anything with the urinary collection and accurate eyes,

187
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,939
nose, there are a lot more alternatives now in place.

188
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:45,190
Maybe an external catheter, maybe a bedpan, maybe incontinence pads.

189
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:54,070
There's there's other things that we can do now to still accomplish the same goal, but maybe it doesn't require an indwelling catheter.

190
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:59,679
And then finally, just standardizing Foley care, just making sure that regardless of what unit you're on, what status you are,

191
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:06,790
whether you're a general care, a rehab or an ICU patient, that we are receiving the same level of care when it comes to a Foley catheter.

192
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,729
Other work that we'll look at was will educate and engage our providers and our nursing staff.

193
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:15,920
And then we'll also educate our. Our patients and our families as well.

194
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:25,300
There's actually been times when we've been doing these reviews of of comedies where we ask why a catheter was not removed earlier.

195
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:31,820
And it's very clearly documented in the chart that the patient or the family themselves actually requested that the Foley remain in place,

196
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,920
even though there was not an appropriate indication.

197
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:40,670
So also wanting to make sure that our patients and families understand that this isn't just a benign device,

198
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:45,650
that it does have consequences, and we do want to reduce the risk of those consequences.

199
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,310
So going into it, our definitions.

200
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:58,270
So again, all of our definitions come from an HSN and we're going to go I'm going to go through a couple definitions.

201
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:03,820
This one is primarily the big one. There's a few other ones are less used, but this is our major one.

202
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:11,110
In order to have a quality, the patient must be admitted for greater than two calendar days.

203
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:18,250
With the day of admission counting as day one, the infection must not be present on admission, which,

204
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:23,770
if I recall from I think it was last week we learned about the window period and present under mission infection.

205
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,510
So that would be the first two calendar days.

206
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:33,219
The patient must have an indwelling urinary catheter realism in place for more than two consecutive days in an inpatient location on the

207
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:40,210
day of event and was either present for any portion of the calendar day of the day of event or was removed the day before the event.

208
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,389
And if that is a mouthful, we can go over it. Exactly.

209
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:52,210
That means with these examples, all of our infection criteria must be met during the infection window period.

210
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:56,559
So the infection window period is set by the date that the culture was collected.

211
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:01,150
And that is your day for you. Look at the three days prior and the three days after,

212
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:07,300
and all the criteria must be met within those seven days in order for it to meet criteria for an infection.

213
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:14,290
Once an infection has been met or classified,

214
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:22,300
you then start the repeat infection timeframe in which no new infections of that type are reported for 14 days.

215
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:31,510
You hear some, you know, nuances and maybe some, you know, things that aren't so great about our definition.

216
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:37,180
This definition does not fully account for our intubated and paralyzed patients who really cannot

217
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:42,879
express symptoms of urinary tract infection beyond the objective fever that we can always tell,

218
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:50,709
regardless if you're awake or able to express, and fever can be used to call them multiple infections.

219
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:54,220
So often parties are called when they are truly not a clinical infection.

220
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:59,560
So as I kind of alluded to earlier, if the reason why we're calling it as a is due to a fever,

221
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,920
but that fever could very easily be attributed to another reason.

222
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,560
By the way this definition is situated. We would still have to classify that as a corti,

223
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,840
provided that they had the urinary catheter and the urinary culture that was in place, that was collected.

224
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:23,810
It's not great. So there's a few more just things with the with the definition.

225
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,270
So we do have a courtesan any age as a patients. And so like one of things we're looking at is the signs or symptoms.

226
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:33,740
As I mentioned, we have the fever and it has to be greater than 38.0 degrees Celsius.

227
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:44,090
We have super pubic tenderness, coastal vertebral, occlusive vertebral angle, pain or tenderness, urinary urgency frequency into Syria.

228
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:53,270
So with these, as I mentioned, fever can be for any reason, regardless if we think it's due to a UTI or not with super pubic tenderness or

229
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:58,730
because her I was get things one coastal vertebral angle pain or tenderness.

230
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,299
This one has to be no other recognized cause could be causing it.

231
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:08,840
So if you if you're complaining of pain in this area but like I know here from like a motor vehicle accident and got hit there,

232
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:15,710
you know it could could be due to that not due to UTI and then with urgency, frequency and to Syria.

233
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,079
This cannot be used when a whole is in place.

234
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:24,710
And that's simply because these are really common complaints that anyone who's had a faulty catheter will complain of.

235
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:30,260
And so saying that it feels like I have to go or if there's something that just not quite feels right,

236
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:35,120
that just due to the fact that you have an artificial device passing through urethra,

237
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:45,980
and so those would only be able to be used as a symptom if the Foley catheter has been removed looking.

238
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,670
So we also have what's called a non corti.

239
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:57,280
So essentially this is the exact same definitions as our CODI, except the big thing is this statement here in blue,

240
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,650
statement here in blue, the patient does not have a foley on the date of event nor the day before the date of event.

241
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:09,049
And or if they did have the Foley in place, it's been greater than two days.

242
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:15,090
So essentially quality has to be met when there's a Foley in place or the day after a Foley has been removed.

243
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:21,620
Anything beyond that would be considered a non party, or I guess that's why we just don't call them up.

244
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:28,130
Yes, but it's just it's just that, yes. You have quality or Don Carty or Carty and just a regular UTI.

245
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,210
So it's the same definition just without nuance on that one.

246
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:38,870
We do have a little bit different definition for our pediatric patients under the age of one year.

247
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:44,870
So a patient then this definition is both for quality and a non quality.

248
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,899
They can either have fever or hypothermia,

249
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:56,059
which we as the definition of less than 36.0 and those either those can be for any reason and then as long as there's no other recognized cause,

250
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,780
if they have any symptoms of apnea, break riccardia lethargy,

251
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:06,980
vomiting or super pubic tenderness that can be used as a symptom for our pediatric patients.

252
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:14,780
And then finally, we have what's known as asymptomatic bacteremia, urinary tract infection,

253
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:21,680
or what we all like to call an aboutI this is a patient with or without a Foley catheter who has no signs or symptoms.

254
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:28,370
So basically we have the positive urine culture, but no fever, no pain or tenderness, no urgency, frequency or to Syria.

255
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:33,470
And they have a matching blood specimen.

256
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:42,320
So and one if the blood specimens have multiple organisms identified,

257
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:50,899
only one of those organisms have to meet match with the with the RTI in these next two slides is for your reference.

258
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:58,850
But there is a flow chart I think and slides past it with all able to be fit on one slide, but they've kind of made it a little bit more readable.

259
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:05,540
So I unfortunately I had to put it on two slides. So the no yes on slide 19 is the same.

260
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:13,070
No. Yes. On Slide 28, in case any of you would like to use the flowchart for decision making.

261
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:20,569
So before we go on to the case studies, does anyone have any questions on the background or the definitions?

262
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,210
I know that was kind of a lot and a short period.

263
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:33,030
So so yes, I didn't realize that non parties were under surveillance, that I would think of cards, but I didn't realize that.

264
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:41,629
So they're they're under surveillance and the type of if we need to call it something we can use to call it most institutions,

265
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:49,580
if not all, I don't think actually will be tracking the non parties unless it's for a very specific group.

266
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,399
Typically from an infection prevention standpoint,

267
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:59,570
because of all the different types of infection types we have and historically the low resources that we've had as a field,

268
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,660
we have to focus on the device ones.

269
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:09,260
But if you're looking for you know, if you're looking to see if it meets criteria,

270
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:14,510
it's a great one to use or if we're especially with like Clancy surveillance where since collapses.

271
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:23,870
You look at if the VCI can be secondary to anything. That would be one that we could use then to see if we can call the classy secondary to anything.

272
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,330
So typically, though, they're not you know, we don't have like a non-call rate.

273
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,430
We we really only ever look at, you know,

274
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:38,630
I just want to like they're the rates of noncardiac in hospitals are actually pretty high when they've done point prevalence surveys.

275
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:43,280
Yes. And there's other groups within the hospital and I can't think of any of the,

276
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:48,050
you know, three, four or five letter acronym groups that will look at these.

277
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:52,790
And typically a lot of times they'll look at the non courtes for their stuff.

278
00:27:53,030 --> 00:28:00,049
Okay. It's just, you know what, 17 is one of my areas of expertize, so that's why I'm fascinated by that.

279
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:12,230
But that actually like the the kidneys and the blood, the general urinary tract infection is a very common source of of blood infection.

280
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:17,150
And that when people are in the hospital and they're not moving around and they may not be properly

281
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:21,560
hydrated and they may not be urinating as frequently as they should be if they have to get up and down.

282
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,900
That's just risk factors for for for g.I.

283
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:35,630
And I'm also interested that they only count it as a carry the day after the food was removed because if you have a catheter,

284
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:42,590
even a short term catheter, your risk of getting a clinical urinary tract infection is really quite high in the next 15 days.

285
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,160
Really? Hi. Actually, it's depressing. Yes, it is.

286
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,370
It's. Yeah, like, you know, there's always fun. That's always the fun with the surveillance definitions.

287
00:28:52,380 --> 00:29:00,100
There's always like, why did they do it this way? Yeah, right. But again, it allows us to standardize against institutions for surgery.

288
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:05,600
And even if it's short term, people go home and then they have a they have a you to two weeks.

289
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:13,359
I mean, and to that point, I will say so like some of those other groups that, um, quality improvement groups,

290
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,650
especially ones that may be associated with some sort of like insurance quality,

291
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:22,209
there's been some definitions because they've looked at our data and compared it with their data.

292
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:31,150
They'd be looking at 30 days post post-op and they would be looking at the non Cordy definition a lot and then wondering why doesn't match with ours,

293
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:37,030
but because we're looking at quality. So they would be looking at for like 30 days post-op to see if he has a UTI II,

294
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:44,620
which again like you mentioned would be higher than what we're seeing with a catheter associated because that for that standpoint,

295
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:48,940
the risk of a catheter associated is lower because the catheter is not in place.

296
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:53,890
Yeah, but you can still be 30. Yes. Yeah. 30 days after surgery.

297
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,070
So in the short term. So I mean, it really is quite high.

298
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:03,309
It's just trauma and infection. So for the FDA.

299
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:07,630
Ah, yes. What kind of demographic information?

300
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:11,860
Oh, see, I know as well as I was saying that I should have had that back. I actually don't know off the top.

301
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:15,280
Right. I think we are looking at like the age of patients.

302
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:20,500
I think we are looking at maybe the proportion of like the distribution of the sexes.

303
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:30,670
Uh, do we look at like a school nurse in a hospital and tertiary care academic centers, small rural hospitals, kind of patient beds?

304
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,930
I think we look at like diabetes, diabetic status to normalize that.

305
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:42,430
I mean, you know, like the hospital because women would not want to be really favorable to the real them.

306
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:46,899
Right. So, um, that's, that's just something.

307
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,890
Yeah. So it's, it's, it's actually just confounding, right?

308
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:55,000
We all remember confounding. So it's the idea is to adjust for confounding.

309
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,350
Anyone's ever interested. The NHS and manuals are nice.

310
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:07,340
Yeah, actually I think it's a nice thick book and it actually says like what they used to risk stratify with all of it actually is quite a.

311
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:16,090
Yeah, I think our manuals like a 700 page manual so I'm like I don't remember, it's just just remember that you can find it, you can,

312
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:28,060
you can stratified within Australia or you can do an adjustment to adjust for things like age, adjustment to age, sex, all kinds of things.

313
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:34,750
And it just, it, so it's just another way to adjust for compounding so that the rates are comparable.

314
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:44,620
Okay. Yes. Oh, why is the the the catheter through the sheet as well?

315
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:50,080
Like, is it is it like is it safer than a normal quality?

316
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:57,160
Like there's antibiotics excluded because like, I feel like that be like more risky, you know, because you got to go to the people.

317
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:02,049
So it's, it's it's above the pubic bone, I believe.

318
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:09,580
And I could be mistaken, but it would be like urethral trauma or some indications as to why a indwelling can go through.

319
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,600
I mentioned and earlier.

320
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:21,730
So every time I see you back here, I mean, those are usually used sort of for more long term management of people who have urinary retention.

321
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:27,700
It's usually people who have some kind of underlying neurologic problem and they can't empty their bladder on their own.

322
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:35,800
It's actually safer to do that from an infection standpoint than to have a long term, indwelling catheter.

323
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,519
But I haven't seen those use more in the acute setting.

324
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:44,410
It's usually more likely when people have those, and it's usually over the long term for months or years.

325
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,860
And I will say to in terms of like the risk factors with that,

326
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:57,400
we do have additional definitions that we can look for and they may we may be more interested in like a urinary system infection for them,

327
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,930
or we still look at like the, like a UTI definition for them as well.

328
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,000
Um, I would also say too, especially as it's more long term and like a lot of our patients, you know,

329
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:12,069
you get in, you get it out that there will definitely be a little bit more of a work involved.

330
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:23,889
Talk to place when you're like, yep, you need a surgical procedure to do that because it's a place those you or I know it might be.

331
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:33,310
John Bailey Interventional radiology. But yeah, it is more of like it obviously an invasive procedure, but it's not meant because I think for Connie,

332
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:38,020
we're really trying to capture these catheters that are put in in the hospital

333
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:43,930
and are meant in the short term as opposed to the more kind of long term.

334
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,980
Yeah. We're we're looking at catheters in in the hospital. Yeah.

335
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:52,180
It could be a short is I mean just for the procedure such as a number of hours.

336
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:59,500
So I mean we've I feel like a lot of times most seem like maybe the week or ten day mark and then very you know,

337
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:05,110
then there are there's always exceptions to the rule where people have had catheters in for like two weeks, three weeks.

338
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:10,299
But for the most part, it's I would say that that one week timeframe because a lot of times you pick the patient,

339
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,290
especially the health care's going, we're getting people out of the hospitals sooner anyway.

340
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:19,749
So we don't really want to have them discharge home with a a Foley if they don't have one.

341
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,110
We're going to push to stop long term.

342
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:27,549
Foley's everywhere. Yeah, very typical school system for facilities.

343
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:34,000
And now it's just mentioned there's so many other alternatives that much lower the risk of infection that they're going to do it.

344
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:42,990
Because you can die from that from a country. So it's not a joke.

345
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,990
Right with that, I believe if I did my count right,

346
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,380
I think we have eight cases to go through and we should have enough time to get through all of them.

347
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:57,660
So let's get our first one.

348
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:03,899
Mary has been in the neuro ICU for three days. She's currently intubated and has a fully in place.

349
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:11,640
Since the day of admission to the unit, her white blood cells begin to increase so the attending pan cultures the patient for infection,

350
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:20,940
her urine culture results positive for greater than 100,000 culinary colony forming units per milliliter of yeast patient does not have a fever.

351
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:26,340
She cannot express pain because she is intubated. Does this meets the client criteria?

352
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:37,440
Why or why not? Why is that?

353
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:51,670
Because she doesn't. So Rihanna answered no because there's no fever of pain, which is correct.

354
00:35:51,680 --> 00:36:01,100
But there's also another reason for the no. Because most of it is through culture of positive reviews.

355
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:10,280
Correct. So yeast is actually an excluded organism for for court surveillance.

356
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:19,310
I think maybe in 2015 we used to include yeast, but now yeast is one of the excluded organisms for court surveillance.

357
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,310
So so she does not meet criteria for a court.

358
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:29,150
However, even if we were able to use yeast, as Brianna mentioned, it still wouldn't count because there was no fever.

359
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:33,970
And since the patient's intubated and cannot express any symptoms, just would not meet any criteria.

360
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:39,170
So this is not a court. Jared.

361
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:43,220
Jared is an ICU for one week after having heart surgery.

362
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,760
He has been excavated for two days and is doing well.

363
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,480
The patient has had an indwelling folio in place for one week.

364
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,260
Does this patient, first of all, meet criteria for an invalid Foley?

365
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:14,730
I see. I see. No. So as I was reviewing this, I see our answer is actually yes.

366
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:20,880
And the reason for because I had to go look for it was because it's a critically ill patient who needs accurate monitoring.

367
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:27,270
However, as I was reviewing it, I thought it might be a difficult one to answer.

368
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,020
It's probably yes because of the critically ill with need for monitoring.

369
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,930
However, as we've mentioned now that we have a lot more alternatives,

370
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:40,730
I think the question would be whether or not the patient could meet an alternative to a full catheter.

371
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:48,120
But for this for the purposes of visits. Yes. Due to that, can we meet the criteria with this information?

372
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,920
Sorry, I think I forgot to go through all the information.

373
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:56,430
So one day, seven patients fully spikes a fever to 38.2 degrees Celsius and urine cultures are sent.

374
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:03,000
The patient's urine cultures result with greater than 100,000 duration resistance does is meet cloudy criteria.

375
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:09,239
So we have a nice little chart that we can fill out with the window period.

376
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:18,870
So again, the day of the urine culture sets our window period with three days prior and three days after along with any relevant information.

377
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:47,890
Anyone have one to venture a guess? Or does anyone need clarifying information?

378
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,690
You don't have a handout. I'm sorry.

379
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:09,520
Yeah, sure. I'm more than happy to answer clarifying, though, if you need a sister so that when we ask you this.

380
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:14,050
So does it look like there's enough colony forming units? Yeah.

381
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:20,510
So. And they have a fever, you know. But is that an allowable.

382
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:24,310
But is the question that they need? I will give you the answer.

383
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,950
Yes, it's an allowable bug. So is that what was thrown?

384
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:31,580
You know, that's wrong.

385
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,000
So, yes, it is. It is considered. Okay.

386
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:40,190
Now, based on this information, what we use the date of infection.

387
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:48,590
Yes, yes, yes. Since all the criterias on the same basis.

388
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,270
And as a reminder, the date of event is set by the date.

389
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:59,920
The first criteria is used. So since both the culture and the symptom occur on the same day, that is what the day of event is.

390
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:07,090
If there is a like meeting within the cultures here and a symptom is after that,

391
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:14,320
the date of that would still be the same because of the first day of criteria if a symptom occurs prior to the culture.

392
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:20,650
So same day six than day six would be the day of events. It's whenever whatever is used first to call the the infection.

393
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:27,790
That's a weird UCI, but I think that's for actual case.

394
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:31,270
I can't remember if we've just made these up over the years or as a history.

395
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:35,260
I can just see that very often.

396
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,569
Yeah. Would I to see it all the time.

397
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:47,559
I just saw a patient yesterday. Then she feels like the seasonality one for us too.

398
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:53,590
I feel like we see it like every year. It's a very cyclical bug. I feel interesting with the word.

399
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,580
Yeah. Oh, right.

400
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:04,390
Beth is a BMC patient. She's having trouble voiding due to an obstruction, so an indwelling catheter is placed.

401
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:09,550
Does this patient mean criteria for an indwelling? Yes.

402
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:15,549
Correct. On day five, patient experiences super pubic tenderness and they sex.

403
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:24,250
The patient's fully is removed. And two days after removal, a urine culture was sent and it grew a greater than 100,000 Acinetobacter species.

404
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,110
So can we call this a CODI? And what key definitions need to be taken into consideration?

405
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,690
Though that indication, I saw some nodding.

406
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:41,450
So I'm going to say yes for that one. So now for the other ones, can we call this a comedy?

407
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:50,200
And what would the day of event be? Why not?

408
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:56,110
Because. You wouldn't want the device in.

409
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:12,540
Either the day or the day before for the culture because you would live in the super human tenderness with of has with it for the culture medium.

410
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:20,950
So we would actually hope we would actually call this one a yes because since super pubic tenderness can be used as as a symptom.

411
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:27,040
This is as a reminder. The symptoms that we cannot use is the frequency, urgency or to Syria.

412
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:38,229
When the fall is in place, the super pubic tenderness and the coastal vertebral angle tenderness can be used when a fall is in place,

413
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:43,990
as long as there's not another recognized cause. And the fever can be used whenever.

414
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:55,680
So because the. The super pubic tenderness occurred while the Foley was still in place, we can count this symptom to be used for quality.

415
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,590
And that answers the next question as the day of event would be day five.

416
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:10,210
So to your point, though, if the tenderness occurred on the eat on the day that the urine culture was collected, we would not count this as a quality.

417
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:21,520
This would be a nonparty because it has been it had been two days after the device removal in order for it to be a party.

418
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:25,899
All the criteria either needs to be when a Foley is in place or needs to occur.

419
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:34,420
The day that is removed in the day or the day after anything after that cannot be attributed to a catheter for the purposes of this definition.

420
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,439
These are, as we see, I want to say more frequently, not not like this scenario,

421
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:48,790
but just like the fact that if this occurs and it's annoying because you see when the culture was and when the Foley was removed and you're like, yes.

422
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,040
And then you left to go and do the symptom review.

423
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:59,680
And it is always a little bit of a little bit of a heartbreak when you think that you got out of number four.

424
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:05,829
Charlie is on the rehab unit after a biking accident. The patient has acute urinary retention,

425
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:09,790
so an indwelling Foley catheter is in place for the first week on the unit

426
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:15,010
because anyone remember if acute urinary retention is an appropriate indication.

427
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:21,999
Yes, correct. The patience of waiting improves to the fully is removed in Edmonton

428
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,700
catheterization is performed on day one intermittent intermittent catheterization.

429
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:37,930
So the day following or the day of full removal, the patient spikes the fever to 39 degrees Celsius and has urgency and frequency with urination.

430
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:43,360
The patient also has a positive urinary urine culture with greater than 100,000 varied.

431
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:47,350
Does this meet criteria for a coffee?

432
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:56,980
Yes. Okay.

433
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:06,490
So again, this as we went with the number three, since it was literally the day after the device was removed, we can use this all to to count.

434
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:17,590
I would actually argue day one of see would probably be Andy would be the same Dave the device was removed but yes.

435
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:21,399
So because it occurred the day of or the day after, we can still count it again.

436
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:31,580
If it had occurred one day later, this would not count. I'm sorry.

437
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:39,060
I don't know what that's like in there. Number five, Carla has pancreatic cancer and has been in the hospital for one month.

438
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:44,460
She is now end of life care. She has had a indwelling Foley place four days ago.

439
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:50,220
Blood and urine cultures are performed because the patient becomes very neutropenic, which means low white blood count.

440
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:58,200
The blood is positive for pseudomonas aeruginosa and urine cultures are also positive for greater than 100,000 pseudomonas aeruginosa.

441
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:03,330
Patient has had no fevers or urinary symptoms. Can we call this icardi?

442
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:16,660
I think hence we want to look so we can look at our our window period that we've set.

443
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:22,840
If we look at our graph or the graph, our flow chart,

444
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:31,690
it can help give us the answers just as and intend to then figure out whether or not this meets criteria.

445
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,380
Three. I really should get in the hands of that floater. That probably would be really helpful.

446
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:44,000
My apologies. Yes, Nancy. Later, would it be?

447
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:51,470
Yes. Because you have in your ear blood to remember what definition that one means, you know?

448
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:59,300
Yes. Very good. So, yes, because of the matching urine and blood cultures and the fact there are no symptoms,

449
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:03,090
we can actually meet criteria for an about the asymptomatic bacteremia.

450
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:07,260
Can you tie. All right, three more.

451
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:15,540
We're doing it. Jerome admits to the dreaded mad floor on 510 for asthma exacerbation and 511.

452
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:20,190
He has a temporal central line and a Foley catheter placed on May 15th.

453
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:26,520
Jerome is not feeling well. He has a fever. His central line is taken out and both blood and urine cultures are set.

454
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:31,410
His blood results as an E.coli in his urine is greater than 100,000.

455
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,280
Equally, does Jerome have a clumsy or a haughty?

456
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:52,040
This is kind of even reach back to last week's lecture to. Would it be according with the secondary collapsing?

457
00:47:52,520 --> 00:48:00,350
Yes. So with the club de definition, we obviously look to see if the B-side can be secondary to everything,

458
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:08,690
since we do meet criteria for the tie and it's a matching organism, this is a BSI secondary to quality.

459
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:13,070
So no, no, no chips or anything.

460
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:16,700
Yes. He can't you can't be secondary, correct?

461
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:22,390
Correct. So unfortunately, if it if it meets all the criteria, it's a quality.

462
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,879
There are definitely times when we wish we could call it secondary to something.

463
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:32,240
But unfortunately, yeah, it's always a primary court, never a secondary.

464
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,980
Classes need to be primary or secondary. Yes.

465
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,719
Is there a reason for that? Are you just like. I have no clue.

466
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:49,760
I think currently, no. I are actually really rare for a duty to be secondary to something else.

467
00:48:50,690 --> 00:49:01,999
I think the one exception I can think of is that we see with like staph aureus bacteria or bloodstream infections that patients will sometimes see,

468
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:10,760
like the bacteremia will actually see the urinary tract, but the vast majority, 99% of the time, it's the other way around.

469
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:17,749
So so then using that information, that's probably why then they use that to define the surveillance definition then.

470
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:23,149
So even if we have like, like a fever that we could very easily attribute to another source in another infection type,

471
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:26,210
we would have that infection type plus the quality as well.

472
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:30,820
Whereas yeah. So there must be, that must be then why we I think that's I'm trying figure I'm like,

473
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:33,870
I don't know why the definition doesn't account for any other causes.

474
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:38,389
There's the fact that it's like you had the try and it's because they say the fever is

475
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:43,969
just since it's such a generalized symptom that's that we can't actually exclude it.

476
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:48,920
But I feel like there are often times when you are looking at notes and it's very clearly caused by something.

477
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,970
Yeah, I think that is true for sure. But again, it's the surveillance stuff.

478
00:49:53,270 --> 00:50:00,299
Yeah. And we want to capture more than less so that way if there is an on know an underlying issue, we want to be able to capture it.

479
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,160
It's just it is kind of annoying though at times when it affects your metrics.

480
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:08,090
And just from that point, I mean, when people have a catheter,

481
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:16,340
they start very quickly to start to get bacteria growing in the urine just to the outside.

482
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:27,740
So you could easily have a misclassification here if they had fever from another source and you check the urine and it could be positive.

483
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:38,749
Because because yeah, because urine is a good medium for bacteria to grow and that there's that tissue around the

484
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:44,210
periwinkle opening and they go in and they colonize the bladder and that's the way it is.

485
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:53,350
So. All right, left to Stacy has been in the pick U for 21 days.

486
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:59,200
She had a fully placed on day 14 of admission on day 12.

487
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:04,990
She spiked a fever and had a urine culture positive for the greater than 100 Evesham.

488
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:10,330
On day 21, she spikes another fever in the urine, a scent for culture.

489
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:14,650
Her urine culture is positive for greater than 100,000 E coli.

490
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:22,540
Does D.C. have a clotting UTI also known as a non Cardi B for this definition or both?

491
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,190
And just to map it all out, just to keep it all in place.

492
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:44,860
So I guess the first one, when we look at the 12, does Stacie make criteria for a nonparty or neither nonparty?

493
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,330
Well, somehow I just went to the very beginning.

494
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:56,540
I was wrong. Yes. So she does meet criteria for a non comedy, just a regular E.T.A. on day 12.

495
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:02,860
Yeah. So that does that are repeat infection time frame.

496
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:18,070
It would be for 14 days. She does have a fully placed and then she meets or she has a another urine culture and another symptom that occurs on day 19.

497
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:25,780
Does that meet criteria for a quality, a nonparty or neither?

498
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:34,340
And since you're still in the art world.

499
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,370
So it can be attributed to the original. Yes.

500
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:44,200
So it is a tribute to the original infection, part of the repeat infection timeframe.

501
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:53,259
So there's. Yeah, so she has the UTI without a Foley, also known as the non cardio, I think 12, the E coli, that's a UTI.

502
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:56,650
So she doesn't meet criteria for UTI and 18 as well.

503
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:02,680
And even though it's a different organism because it occurs within the 14 day repeat infection timeframe,

504
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,929
we roll it in to the original date of infection.

505
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:15,790
The original infection. So she does have to UTIs, but from a reporting standpoint, we only report one since she's still within her time frame.

506
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:27,150
All right. And our last one is number eight. Jack is on a general care floor and a fully is place on admission due to a large signal wound.

507
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,800
He spikes a fever on day ten of having a fully so a urine culture is sent.

508
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:42,810
His urine culture is growing greater than 100,000 E.coli 1000 to 10000 callus and 1000 to 10000 came to my game.

509
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:49,590
Does Jack have a body? Well, yeah.

510
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:52,860
Well, yeah. Darn. Oh, they may think that, but.

511
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:58,870
All right. Well, no, which is okay, because as I'm looking at this, I think I skipped over that part of the definition.

512
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:04,930
One things with the definition which this example is supposed to showcase is you can you can't have

513
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:11,620
more greater than two organism of one type in a urine culture to use it to evaluate for quality.

514
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:16,240
Anything more than that is there's a large concern for contamination.

515
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:22,690
And so we would exclude a culture such as this 440 surveillance due to that concern.

516
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:30,489
Obviously from then from a political standpoint, if they're still concerned for UPI cultures would be redrawn or,

517
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:36,430
you know, the clinical picture would dictate the next step.

518
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:40,090
But from our standpoint, we would not count as a five.

519
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:45,690
So if there's two, you've counted, but if there's two, if they're more than two, then we don't count.

520
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:54,580
Yeah. Yeah. So so catheter associated eyes are often poorly microbial, particularly longer term.

521
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:58,870
Um, catheter catheterization.

522
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:05,380
So if you had it for ten days, so, um, I would assume clinically to do something about this.

523
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:14,660
Um. I mean, he had a fever.

524
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:22,190
We probably treat at least probably treat like the more predominant organisms.

525
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:24,889
Yeah, well, I think one of the concerns with this one too,

526
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:32,330
as well is you notice only one of the three organisms is greater than 100,000 and the other two are 1000 to 10000.

527
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:38,629
And I think then there'd be also some concerns on whether the site was prepped correctly from a culturing standpoint.

528
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:49,630
So there's a good chance that the E coli would be an organism of concern and the other two could still be a concern, or it could be like that.

529
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:56,570
That would be maybe the contamination risk, perhaps. It's just a technicality.

530
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:05,900
Yeah. It doesn't mean the patient doesn't have an infection. It just means that we throw it out based on her definition.

531
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:10,220
Don't worry for every patient that we throw out one due to a technicality, I feel like we get three.

532
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:18,110
So you're my reference is primarily the NHS on surveillance definition of from this update this year.

533
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,300
In our guidelines, everyone did really well.

534
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:27,350
The question is, is there's any more questions? I think we have time for just a few more notch.

535
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:30,820
Thank you very much for having me. Question seven.

536
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:40,860
Oh, thank you. For me.

537
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,600
I stopped recording. Yeah.
