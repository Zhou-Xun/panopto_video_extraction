Hello, I'm Jenifer Martin and

2
00:00:07,505 --> 00:00:12,637
I am an adjunct clinical instructor in the Department of Health Management and

3
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:15,920
Policy, and I will be working with you on Unit 4.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,955
I bring to this conversation a 30-year career in government relations and

5
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:25,600
policy-making, and I'm very excited to share this information with you.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,470
Our unit opens with a return to professor Peter Jacobson who will be

7
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:35,870
giving us an overview of multiple components of the policy making process.

8
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,870
Including the specific focus on the ethical challenges

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,830
that public health practitioners may face.

10
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:48,140
He will also discuss the role of policy analysis and the ways in which

11
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,170
decision makers weigh various competing alternatives in an effort

12
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:58,370
to select the best possible option that will advance the publics health.

13
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,440
With those frameworks in mind, we then move into a conversation about the ten

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,320
steps essential in any effective public health advocacy strategy.

15
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,900
We will apply those ten steps to a real world case study.

16
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,310
Develop written advocacy tools and have a conversation about

17
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:23,080
how best to execute a public health advocacy strategy together.

18
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,990
I'm very excited about this unit and

19
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,621
I look forward to working with you, thank you.
