1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:05,700
He's flexing, you know, it's showtime. Okay.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,499
All right. So welcome back, everybody.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,920
So we still have problems with the monitor, but maybe people are going to come by and try to troubleshoot that in a minute.

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:22,290
So today we're going to get into the microbiome. This is our one and only full lecture exposing the microbiome of a person.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,970
We've already talked about it a lot of times and will continue to do the first semester.

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,860
I have a couple sort of general announcements that maybe everybody could of benefit from.

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,179
So one thing is,

8
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:44,069
please make sure if you're submitting something in this course that people people you like access to it because otherwise delivering it,

9
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:51,479
we have to wait for you to give us access. So just as a general rule, just share with two of our iReporters, make it public,

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,440
anybody at the university or whatever, so that we wouldn't have to really have them stop in the recycling.

11
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,640
So that's one thing. And then another thing, we're still almost a month out from the midterm for this.

12
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:09,360
So don't panic yet. The people start asking questions about how to self-study if they understand the material.

13
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,040
My best recommendation here is use the problem light.

14
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,550
So if you go to problem light, it has every multiple choice questions that I've written for this course last two years,

15
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,170
plus a bunch of other student related questions. So there's a ton of questions are broken down by topic.

16
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:32,160
So you can just study the microbiome for the study glycolysis to study carbohydrate absorption within probably.

17
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,400
I will never know how you do it.

18
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:40,799
You don't feel badly, but if you do get questions wrong, you can save them to your own personal notebook so that you're like,

19
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,070
Oh, this actually makes me realize I'm a little confused about this thing.

20
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,420
Then having that notebook handy might be useful for coming to either test.

21
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,770
New Horizons Office Hours something. We've got a list and we can kind of go through some questions that you might have strong about.

22
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,570
All right. So like I said, it's a good self checking tool.

23
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,930
And like I said, I think there's like three or 4000 questions. So there's like lots and lots and lots of questions.

24
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:14,430
One on every single top of the universe of people who make posts on Piazza, about nutrition in the news and things like that.

25
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,980
Again, I'd like to remind you I'm not creating an intentionally involving more people will comment on those so you get points for commenting,

26
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,880
be able to get points accomplished. So I did a Reddit post.

27
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,760
It said that if my post got deleted because I'm actually not active on Reddit.

28
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,150
Sure. Now, I don't know if it you like. I don't know that actually did or anything because like when I copy paste, like when I submitted it,

29
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,780
like you can still go to the link and see it, but I don't know if like the public can see it.

30
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:43,590
Yeah. So that happens. How good. Wikipedia and Quora and Reddit that you might for something you might be really good at the moderator.

31
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,250
Just take it down. For whatever reason, you can always still see it.

32
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,800
So in that case, you'll send me a link and I can't see it.

33
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,140
You'll probably then have to take a screenshot of it and then just email me the screenshot so that I can see that.

34
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,090
Yeah. And the same thing with Wikipedia as a matter tracking thing that I can actually go back and see.

35
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:06,420
But the like the Yeah.

36
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,260
With, with Reddit. So you won't get much feedback from anybody else, which is a bummer.

37
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,480
But if you haven't discovered yeah.

38
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:22,700
Just as everybody actually does, people can use when I was in the exams on campus or in make in person, the exam will be person.

39
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,100
They'll be they'll be physically. You will be in this class for your time.

40
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:36,420
So it's like on paper it will be on like a scantron for like oh, two thirds of it is on a scantron, so like absentee voting process.

41
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,790
And then the remaining third will be like handwritten homework.

42
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,290
Never been in this class.

43
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:56,810
Okay, so then something lose some of the other sort of exam related questions while we're waiting several days on the table to find rest.

44
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:09,090
I think you're going to go by your stance on the Shop in the Blue Book because I don't really know because I'm you know,

45
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,130
I have like a huge pile of Scantron slots. Fine.

46
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,020
And then the exam part that has the questions, the booklet will have space for you to write the answers in there.

47
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,810
I guess another thing that might be useful, for example, how do you really want to spend that much time on exams?

48
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:28,470
Because it's still, like I said, not more than a month away. Everybody's going to be allowed a cue card like a five by seven, you know, five, seven.

49
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:36,360
You must be like this size three by five cue card, which you can write literally anything you want on either side.

50
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,830
Right? So if you're and I have a pile of these, my office, if you want to come get some, that's fine.

51
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,249
But you can use that. So that way, anything that you're wondering, should I memorize this?

52
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,770
Don't just write up your card and you can write little content, match little diagrams or whatever it has to be done by hand.

53
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:57,060
You cannot take the notes and take all 500 pages of notes and minimize it, and then we like to look at it or whatever.

54
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,750
So whatever you can fit on both sides of the card you'll be able to bring to.

55
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:05,120
And so some people work on this as a study because they're trying to figure out the first lecture lectures.

56
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:22,530
One of the key things I need to have you say to myself, if you want to be in that, you can just click on.

57
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:33,770
Yeah. You know, that's the next point I thought of.

58
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:45,080
Yeah, I can offer help. I can assure you.

59
00:05:45,140 --> 00:06:00,980
I do not know if that is the right question here.

60
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:10,530
Oh, that's one thing I really like to have that, you know, I think.

61
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:23,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

62
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:48,820
I got one. I'm trying to think what you need to do is always try to make your own future.

63
00:06:53,590 --> 00:07:09,760
It's as if you had, like, Shaun has the internet and we can give it to somebody to get your picture.

64
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:27,480
But yeah, yeah, right.

65
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:35,250
Yeah. You have to right away like you needed to everything.

66
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:49,330
So what is it that tortured him on his clothes are sitting right next to me.

67
00:07:52,700 --> 00:08:04,990
It's the same thing, you know, he's obviously not working on it too much.

68
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,800
I always have to throw issues management where people.

69
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:28,510
Yeah you know I don't normally it's not I mean I'm just trying to get something done now because I think some of it's like, okay, so sorry about that.

70
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:34,569
It seems like that did not solve the problem. So, so for today's lecture, I'm going to break it up into this sort of three part.

71
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,530
We're going actually start with our food of the day. There was a fiver with last week's food.

72
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:58,510
I was ready to do that first. And then we're going to get into sort of the three parts of the microbiome, like your parents or you.

73
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,290
I was like, All right, so the food of the day for today is psyllium husk.

74
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,520
So what is Psyllium Husk? I'm sure a lot of us haven't heard of this before.

75
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,720
It's a form of soluble fiber, meaning that it is dissolved by water.

76
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,410
So as we learn in class, it means that it's a business fermentable and it can absorb lipids such as bile acids,

77
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,580
and it is source from those husks of the psyllium seed.

78
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,510
And like the formal name for it is plant tago obada.

79
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,620
And this plant is native to India, but it has also grown around the world.

80
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:51,810
In America, it's grown in the southwest region. It consists of highly rich compounds called lot of.

81
00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:00,660
And this is kind of what makes. I'll talk about this later this kind of it makes like stool like gel like and how it gets its viscous properties.

82
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:08,069
And then although it's in digestible gut, bacteria use this branch heavy cellulose as an energy source so therefore it has

83
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:12,810
prebiotic properties and why it kind of fits in this lecture that we're talking about.

84
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:22,360
So we're gone, so it must be found. You've probably heard of Metamucil before, and the main fiber source of the supplement is psyllium husk.

85
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:29,590
The Sabrin also makes these like fiber biscuits that are like different flavors of chocolate, apple and cinnamon.

86
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:35,290
So they have the same benefits as just taking like the supplement.

87
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:43,650
And then this picture on the far left just kind of shows like the texture of it, just kind of like a light brown powder.

88
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:50,290
And then the supplement I'm going to talk about with the food database is this now brand psyllium husk powder.

89
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,150
So there was only branded information on this food database.

90
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:59,590
But as you can see, the only ingredient is this house powder.

91
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,620
The serving size is nine grams. And I kind of want to know, like, how much that is equal to.

92
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,290
It's around two teaspoons.

93
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:16,360
And when you look at the breakdown besides like a few micronutrients like iron and potassium, the only thing that's in it is carbohydrates.

94
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:20,530
And here's like a situation where I feel like it's really important to differentiate between

95
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:26,620
carbohydrates and fiber because seven out of eight grams of carbohydrate come from fiber.

96
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,860
Six of those being soluble and then one of those being insoluble.

97
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:38,230
And then one serving of this powder is around 24% of the adequate intake for men and then 36% for women.

98
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:46,200
So what are some of the health claims, some of the more popular health claims are that it treats constipation.

99
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:51,490
So as psyllium travels through your digestive system, it soaks up water in the small intestine,

100
00:11:51,790 --> 00:12:01,000
which and it becomes a gel like substance and becomes easier to pass because the bulk of the stools increase and also can lower your cholesterol.

101
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,499
We talked about this in class a little bit,

102
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:09,010
but soluble fiber can bind to excessive cholesterol in your small intestine and then be removed from your body from there.

103
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:19,270
And then it also controls type two diabetes. The jaw forming properties of psyllium can slow the digestive process and glucose absorption.

104
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,390
But more specifically to this lecture,

105
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:31,820
it also has been proven to have effects on the intestinal microbiota in cancer patient and healthy control patients.

106
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,520
So this study had two individual studies completed in it.

107
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:43,850
The first one was done on healthy controls. The downward arrows signify stool samples.

108
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:51,620
So in the first study, a baseline sample was done and then three treatments in a double blind procedure was done.

109
00:12:52,130 --> 00:13:03,680
So the treatments were either 14 grams of Maltodextrin, 14 grams of Metamucil, or 14 grams of a 5050 mix between the two.

110
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,940
And there was a week washout period between each treatment.

111
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:14,720
And then in the second study, this was patients who were dealing with long term constipation.

112
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,240
So they had a no laxative washout,

113
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:24,379
like if they were previously taking laxatives and then a stool sample was taken and then they only had two treatments in this trial.

114
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:35,110
So it was either 21 grams of psyllium or maltodextrin and the results.

115
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,360
So the first graph I kind of was excited when I saw this because it remind me of Biosense.

116
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,200
But you can see that this is based on healthy individuals.

117
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:57,410
And you can see that in the Y analyzes that compared to baseline, the psyllium sample increased that strain of bacteria.

118
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,870
And same with the sub double.

119
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:10,009
And then the table on the left is based on the constipated patients.

120
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,190
And the circled strains of bacteria are the ones that were increased.

121
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,059
If you just focus on like the baseline in the psyllium columns of the table,

122
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:25,200
you can see that the baseline measurement was point 11% and then with psyllium it increased 2.2%.

123
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:32,000
And then you can see like 3.48 for the that strain of bacteria and then 9.43.

124
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:40,579
So as you can see, like there is a pretty significant difference in these strains of bacteria after taking a psyllium supplement,

125
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:46,310
especially in the constipated patients. So we should take this supplement.

126
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,960
How the individuals obviously can benefit as found by the study,

127
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:57,590
but not as much as constipated individuals, those with dealing with type two diabetes or high cholesterol,

128
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:06,680
and then individuals who are looking to lose weight because it can because your stools bulk is increased and it kind of like expands in your stomach,

129
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:13,220
it helps you feel fuller and like that can prevent you from overeating and that can help aid in the weight loss process.

130
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:32,530
Any questions? But what's the age range for the clinical study, for the two trials?

131
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:37,000
I don't actually know. I think it was adults, but I don't know the exact age range.

132
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:50,310
So I noticed in of the product breakdown it was seemed like quite a lot of iron

133
00:15:51,030 --> 00:16:01,300
which is like not intrinsic to the ceiling of 1% sure that 1.5 grams is correct.

134
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,800
But anyway, let's presume there's there's 8% higher in there.

135
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,220
Did you come across anything about why iron will be added or.

136
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:12,270
No, I didn't. There's an interesting thing. I can look into that.

137
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:19,469
Or maybe it's like and like how they add additives like cereal or something.

138
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:24,840
I don't know why these patients would need more iron. Feel like I've heard iron actually does the opposite of what?

139
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:32,020
Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. I can look more into that, though. I there's something screwy with that because the iron is like 12 milligrams.

140
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,050
So 1500 is a lot. Yeah. 100 times more than you would need.

141
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:39,900
So it's not that if I was just, like, I became positive.

142
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:43,390
Yeah. No, that's interesting. Yeah.

143
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,470
Things like sometimes, you know, about like we might have options.

144
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:55,260
That's why they are trying to increase iron supplements in order not affecting absorption of iron possibly.

145
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,650
Yeah. No, Mike, I don't know if that would work, but it seems like a better way.

146
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,750
Yeah. Mixing it with the thing that, you know, repairs the you just. But, but you're right.

147
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:11,790
Yeah. That's, that seems plausible. I keep thinking, I guess I was gonna ask in terms of like powder,

148
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:16,560
do you feel like people put it in, like you put in, like, protein shakes, like you just put it in?

149
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,760
Well, I know, like, my grandparents take Metamucil,

150
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,370
but it's literally just like a powder and you just stir it in water and you're supposed

151
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:31,140
to drink it pretty fast because it can become pretty gelatinous if you let it sit,

152
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:39,330
as we learned. But I don't imagine that if you just put psyllium husk in water, it would taste very good.

153
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,180
So that's why Metamucil was made.

154
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:51,350
But yeah, I think it's just somebody, unless you're eating it like in these biscuits, like it's something that's mixed with water, you try.

155
00:17:53,970 --> 00:18:03,270
So what's the difference between, like this and say, like Miralax, like the like something like intended like for constipation?

156
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:08,730
Like, do you think there's like benefits more for like one or the other since it, like, proves to be helpful for constipation?

157
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:17,249
I don't know specifically, but just based on, I guess, people who are looking for more, maybe natural, I'm not talking about Metamucil,

158
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:24,370
but more like natural remedies instead of looking at like medications, maybe would be interested in taking psyllium husk and implementing that.

159
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,920
But yeah, I don't know for sure. Okay, great.

160
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:40,730
So. Okay.

161
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,790
So because there was so many videos for today's lecture,

162
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:56,040
I'm going to use most of today's time to sort of talk through, I think, three different study study life objects.

163
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:00,480
I'm going to give all the studies to sort of highlight some of the key things about the gut microbiome.

164
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:07,020
And I appreciate you was also moderating this week. So I guess the first thing I want to draw your attention to is we think about the gut microbiome

165
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:12,810
pretty specifically because obviously it has a role to take us to health and and chronic disease.

166
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,610
But we have microbiota all of our bodies,

167
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:23,970
all of these different locations have different microbes and colors indicate that depending on where they are in our bodies, there's different things.

168
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,480
So the colors indicate different phyla of bacteria.

169
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,610
So you can see the bacteria that might on your face are qualitatively entirely different from the bacteria on your arm.

170
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:37,619
And even if you look at like places that are like not that far from each other, such as the buttocks and gluteal crease,

171
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:42,870
you can see even though these two regions are proximal to each other, there's really, really different bacteria.

172
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,020
And the reason I want to highlight this is one of the main determinants of

173
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,710
whether or not a bacteria lives in a particular place is sort of two things.

174
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:55,350
One is, is the environment correct for it? Right. So certain places here can be exposed to a lot of sunlight between two oxygen.

175
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,560
Other places are going to be hypoxic. They might have different acidity.

176
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,819
That's one part of it.

177
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:05,729
And then the second part of it is our bodies actually regulate which bacteria are present in which places through a variety of different mechanisms,

178
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:12,180
some of which we'll talk about today. So one of the reasons they vary with their body is actually effectively telling it like right here,

179
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:16,870
I want this bacteria, but I don't want to overthink it. And so that's why it varies by so much, right?

180
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:23,130
And this is true for just a tract as well. But sometimes we just sort of forget this is true on our body surfaces.

181
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:28,820
Some people argue I've not seen super compelling data for this, that one reason why people may be more or less susceptible,

182
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:37,760
say, mosquito bites, has to do with the the smells that come on from bacteria increasing for a while.

183
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,910
So, of course, we care in this part, mostly about the gut microbiome.

184
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,040
So just like anywhere else, it's going to vary.

185
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,969
So there's not one gut microbiome depending on where you look in the body, it's going to vary quite a lot.

186
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:55,890
So the upper part of the small intestine around where the stomach enters through the form think there there's actually quite a little bit of bacteria.

187
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,530
So the dark brown here is showing the density of bacteria.

188
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:05,960
So you can see as you go from the stomach towards the rectum, the amount of bacteria keeps increasing, but it also changes quite.

189
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,040
If you look at the bacteria in the small intestine versus in the colon versus in the cecum, you can see it.

190
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:16,950
That also varies quite a lot. And this is important when you think about how people might assess the microbiome.

191
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,270
What we actually might care about in terms of the microbiota is what's going on like right here.

192
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,890
But what we're actually measuring is what comes out over here, right? And so that's actually going to be already a chain, right?

193
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:31,260
So in mice, we can avoid this because we can just cut the mouse open and take bacteria from whichever location we want.

194
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,309
But for humans, we can't.

195
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:38,940
So most human microbiome, biological samples are already biased because you're getting the bacteria through pass through this whole region.

196
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,760
There's a lot of different reasons why the bacteria varies in these different regions, but some of the key ones are oxygen.

197
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,970
So there's lots of oxygen up here, no oxygen over here.

198
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:53,649
Antimicrobial peptides, which I'll talk about in a minute. And then of course, the page, which is going to go from the acidic environment,

199
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,730
the stomach to the more neutral environment as you get towards the large intestine.

200
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,159
Well, there's not really big, broad things, but also the actual things that the bacteria feeding on are going to vary a lot.

201
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,500
And we'll talk about those sort of as we go through this.

202
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:10,670
Now, one of the reasons why you might hear a lot about the microbiome is historically it was very, very difficult to assess the microbiome.

203
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:17,040
In example, we would take our sample, fecal sample, and we would try to find the correct culture condition for any given bacteria.

204
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,770
So we tried to spread it out on that feedback.

205
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:23,810
R And then we tried to figure out did it need to go anaerobic or anaerobic initially that what kind of food we put in the end.

206
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:29,080
And it was very, very, very difficult and extremely biased in terms of what we began to grow and what now.

207
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,980
Some things we were able to grow we know a lot about, but a lot of things we didn't build up until we were able to do this metagenomic analysis.

208
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:40,080
So what metagenomics is, is you can imagine there's a whole bunch of different bacteria that will look different DNA in the samples.

209
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,380
You just chop them all up into tiny little pieces and sequence all of it.

210
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,520
So you're not isolating any individual bacteria. You don't actually need to isolate any of them.

211
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:52,230
But by fingerprinting the DNA sequences of each of these, you can assemble and say, Well,

212
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,280
there's this much of the green bacteria in this bunch of the blue and as much of the red is going to be orange.

213
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:05,460
So this is not only been how we now assess our bacteria in not just in microbial life or in gut microbial samples, but in all sorts of samples.

214
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,360
This also showed us the identity of many, many,

215
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,549
many new bacterial species that we didn't even know about because they had previously been resistant to culture.

216
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:17,640
So now we know about millions and millions of different types of bacteria,

217
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:24,540
and this can be done now relatively inexpensively or like about 100 bucks and get a pretty comprehensive profile of any fecal sample,

218
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:31,920
at least for research purposes here. And so it can be done sort of high throughput and a lot of different now because you get a lot of data from it.

219
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,330
There have been a lot of studies that say, oh. Blood is associated with bloody blood.

220
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,280
And what they're implying here, something like that.

221
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:42,430
There's some change in the microbiota that has some association causally with some chronic disease.

222
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:48,620
So you might see something about people who have Crohn's disease have a different microbiota than people who don't.

223
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:56,090
And so the implication for many of these studies is that those microbes are what are causing Crohn's disease for people who have diabetes,

224
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:01,760
for example, have different microbes than people who don't have diabetes. The presumption being that this is what is causing the diabetes.

225
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:05,030
Now, that might be true in some cases, but it could also be the opposite.

226
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:11,180
Could be the presence of diabetes is causing changes in the microbiota and many, many, many cases that's what you see.

227
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,930
So, for example, if somebody has IBS, they have a different microbiome,

228
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,450
but we don't know if they're microbiome different because of the IBS or the idea as a result from the microbiome.

229
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,619
Right. This actually turns out to be a very, very, very difficult question to answer,

230
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:30,379
although the majority of microbiological studies and I would say the vast majority of news articles about

231
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:36,020
microbiological studies implicitly say it's the first thing without really detecting whether it could be the same thing.

232
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,670
So whenever you see an association between the microbiome and some disease state,

233
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:43,190
the first thing you should ask is like, Can I convince myself the reverse could be true?

234
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,980
Could I just myself? This is a fact, not a cause.

235
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:51,110
It can also be like an entirely compounded effect where something entirely unrelated causes both of those things.

236
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,660
Right? And so they're not connected in any causal pathway.

237
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:58,790
It could be that diabetes causes changes in blood glucose and diabetes causes changes in the microbiome.

238
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,970
But those two things actually have nothing to do with each other cause they're completely independent.

239
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,400
So in human studies, it's quite difficult to sort this out.

240
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:12,320
So a few things that you could consider if somebody is actually trying to determine the order of causality in some of these microbiome studies.

241
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:16,300
First, is, is the microbiome change present before the disease state?

242
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,150
Right. Is the microbiome changed after the disease that occurs?

243
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:24,970
And you should already be a little concerned. Right. Many of these studies were, of course, cross-sectional, so you don't really know.

244
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,870
But if you did have some sort of longitudinal analysis that people with microbiome X, you know,

245
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:34,040
three months later developed Crohn's disease, that would be better evidence than people who had Crohn's disease.

246
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:40,400
Six months later, they had this change in their microbiome. So causality, temporal causality is is one popular way.

247
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:45,890
Another way you could do it is by fecal transplants. So the microbiome is supposed to be causal and some disease.

248
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:51,260
The implication would be if you take the microbiota from the disease individual and put it into a non disease,

249
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:56,329
the individual or a non disease animal such as like a rodent or a monkey.

250
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:00,500
Can you recapitulate the disease so that the microbes are causing Crohn's disease?

251
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,790
If you put those microbes in a mouse, does the mouse get some sort of Crohn's disease analog?

252
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,540
Now that's very popular. That's part of the most popular way to people deserving causality.

253
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,799
But of course, then you have to presume that the progression of the disease and the way the microbes,

254
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,260
progressive disease, has to be the same between humans and mice,

255
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:20,330
because you're not going to get a bunch of healthy volunteers to volunteer to have pathogenic fecal transplants, for example.

256
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:25,130
People aren't going to agree to that and to be ethically dubious that people with obesity.

257
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:31,310
Yeah. Yeah. So that's a really good example. So in the case of obesity and there's a link to somebody's first comment from yesterday

258
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:36,180
was there are known differences in microbiota between people with obesity or not.

259
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,750
And so this is one very famous study that I don't have the sidewalk where they took twins that were discordant for obesity.

260
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:47,509
So the idea that genetically identical people but one was obese was not. And then they transplanted those microbes into mice.

261
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:52,370
And then those mice became the bicycle. The obese microbiota became obese themselves.

262
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:58,100
Now, that's actually turned out to be quite difficult to replicate for a bunch of technical reasons.

263
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:04,640
But that was very good causal evidence that the microbes themselves could be driving obesity per se.

264
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:10,610
And another consideration here is if you're even doing one of these studies, if, let's say, for example,

265
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:14,269
you're doing a fecal transplant, is that engraftment stable enough to actually affect things?

266
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:18,079
Just because you put bacteria into a person or into a mouse doesn't mean it's going to stay there.

267
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,030
For all the reasons we're going to talk about sort of through a class today is that we have ways to control which microbes present.

268
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:28,159
And so this is just a general thing if you're thinking that you see an association and again,

269
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,459
associations are quite easy to test right now, just to always be cautious.

270
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,290
That doesn't necessarily mean there's some intervention.

271
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,700
Another way you could get at this is you could have some intervention that changes the microbiota.

272
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:44,899
So let's say, for example, this example of the microbial changes with the Metamucil changes and then those microbial changes,

273
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,420
causal physiological calm, that might be reasonable, too.

274
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,920
But we also can't rule out that the Metamucil itself affected the outcome, sort of independent of the microbiome.

275
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:55,640
But those are sort of another way you can think about about causality.

276
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,250
The microbiota research is sort of rife with associations that people pretend I think are causal.

277
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,220
Okay. So the next thing I want to talk about is this idea of diversity in fibroblasts.

278
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,799
So every unique bacteria has a different pre by preference.

279
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,910
So what I mean by that is different bacteria like different substances.

280
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:20,930
Right. So some bacteria might really like protein and some bacteria really might like inulin and some bacteria really like beta glucan.

281
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:25,939
We've talked about all these different fermented resources, so each one has a different advantage.

282
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:31,720
If there's a lot of, for example, inulin and your bacteria that really thrives on inulin, you'll get more of that bacteria, right?

283
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:36,960
Because it will be an evolutionary advantage. Over its cohorts that are waiting for the votes to come but never come.

284
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:42,470
Right. So that's one big thing to think about. And because of that, there's such a high competition of resources, right?

285
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,420
So all these bacteria are sort of unthinkingly competing with each other, trying to find the correct things for that.

286
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,710
Right. And so there is both their food sources and what is there.

287
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,890
And then there is also what we are doing to sort of combat this.

288
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:01,710
As a general rule, a healthier microbiome is a more diverse microbiome.

289
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:09,330
And the best way to have a more diverse microbiome is how to have the most diverse subset of prebiotics.

290
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:16,700
Right. So you want to provide a broad menu of prebiotics to the bacteria so that a broad milieu of bacteria can survive.

291
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:23,010
Because we don't really know at this point which exact specific foods can induce, which exact specific bacteria.

292
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:27,120
We have general trends, but it's very, very hard to contextualize that to somebody else.

293
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:32,950
So more diverse bacteria means there's more competition, and that's going to mean that we're going to have more diverse food sources.

294
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,900
So that's why one of the challenges I have with sort of the food labeling in the fiber study is,

295
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:43,380
is that when you start putting in a sole source fiber, let's say somebody whose primary source of fiber is inulin or chicory root,

296
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,450
even if that particular bacteria is good,

297
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:52,840
that is actually going to reduce your microbial diversity because you're only going to get bacteria that are supported by that in-utero that right.

298
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,719
So that's quite diverse for a whole food.

299
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:02,100
Ideally, sources are much better for fiber health than supplements, even though supplementary fiber because of changes in USDA guidelines are much,

300
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,690
much, much, much more common now than they were even seven or eight years ago.

301
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,940
So one example of why this can be beneficial is you can imagine you've got a bunch of bacteria that are in your gut.

302
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,380
We have control systems over which bacteria are going to be present and which ones are not.

303
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,470
And the main system is through a series of receptors called M&Ms,

304
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:28,130
which are membrane associated membranes, memory micro associated membrane patterned pattern receptors.

305
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:32,970
They can detect certain patterns of bacteria. So that's how you can detect which bacteria are actually present.

306
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,959
If a bacteria should not be there, but things can be released.

307
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,770
Anti-Microbial peptides and antibodies, these are known as ant's antimicrobial peptides, and those can selectively kill particular bacteria.

308
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:48,690
So that's one of the ways by which our body can say, I don't want this particular bacteria to be here anymore.

309
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:54,050
I can actually mount an immune response against it. All right.

310
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:59,099
So there's really two ways that we can control microbial communities, prebiotics and probiotics.

311
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,930
So the definition of prebiotic is a selectively fermented ingredient that changes composition, right?

312
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:10,170
So it's not enough that it has to be fermented. You have to demonstrate that it can change the composition of a particular type of bacteria.

313
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,210
This is the thing for probiotics, which are like bacteria that are meant to colonize your right.

314
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:20,520
If you want something to be stable, you have to have a combination of both the prebiotic, so the food source,

315
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:26,660
the probiotic, the inoculations and your body has to be able to be accepting of that bacteria right to bacteria.

316
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,870
That bacteria can't be removed by, say, the antimicrobial peptides in your gut.

317
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,580
Right. So all three of those things have to happen if you want a stable colonization of your gut.

318
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,930
And there's a bunch of examples of probiotics. Now, probiotics, again, have become really, really popular.

319
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,590
But you have to be careful when you look at probiotics on a food level. So the U.S.

320
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:47,940
So the FDA labeling for probiotics is pretty vague. It's basically like opt in.

321
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:53,010
You can put on your label what bacteria you put in there, whatever you want you can put in.

322
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,469
You don't have to put it in your mouth to say how much of it is your own.

323
00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:00,570
Put the ratios and you don't even have to necessarily indicate whether or not they're alive or not.

324
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:07,110
So, for example, much of the kombucha you might buy, say, a Whole Foods or something like that has it already sterilize bacteria.

325
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:11,610
So technically it may sound like a probiotic, but if the bacteria are dead, it is not a problem.

326
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,000
Right.

327
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:18,030
Is you think that bacteria and bacteria might have some benefit to you, but it's certainly not going to colonize your gut because it's dead bacteria.

328
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:24,660
And this is true for a lot of things that are sold as sort of probiotics, but for food, sanitation reasons are sterilize.

329
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,060
So therefore it defeats the purpose of them as a provider.

330
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:33,180
Is there a reason why there isn't stricter guidelines on calling out if it's live versus not?

331
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:39,600
Versus I'm often confused about what the labeling requirements are from the FDA.

332
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,409
I don't really know. I think either minimum you should be able to say this live or not.

333
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:48,630
And I do think a lot of people do self-report that, especially if it's one because that's like a benefit of that particular food.

334
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:53,940
So my general feeling is that people who reported are reporting it because they think there's some health benefit.

335
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:58,799
But that doesn't mean that let's say you buy something that doesn't want to report it.

336
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,900
They don't have to. Right. So it's like the policy is evidence of the truth, but the negative is not the evidence of the absence of remember,

337
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:08,470
what does that mean harder for something that stays on the shelf for a really well and that's why.

338
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:11,729
Right. So like for example, if you had yogurt that had a ton of live probiotics,

339
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,940
it's kind of a shorter shelf life, which from a food manufacturing standpoint, it's not good.

340
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:21,059
And from a food safety standpoint also may not be good. Right. So I'm not saying is TV is on the part of food manufacturers.

341
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,710
Sometimes you just want something that's sterile.

342
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,750
You don't want people to sue you because they consume some thing that grew in their thing after they made their product.

343
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:31,740
Right. And that's why it's also difficult from a legal standpoint is it might change over time.

344
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:41,330
Okay. So the polar bear obviously can't get the polar bear working with the screen working tonight.

345
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,970
So what I want you to do is I want you to pretend that you are doing this, but you don't actually have to plug it and answer it.

346
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:51,800
And so this is going to seem like a bit of a bit of a weird transition. But I want you to sort of ponder this question.

347
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:58,730
So do you think public policy should specifically incentivize women to breastfeed, as in should they be giving some benefit?

348
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:02,089
So I want you to sort of think about that question for a moment and just think

349
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:18,160
about what you think your answer is going to be as you jot down your answer. Is You're meaning that you're going to be seen in.

350
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:34,670
The. You need to be able to do that.

351
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,630
Okay. So hopefully everyone has written something down. So what I want you to do is I want you to now take the opposite.

352
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,470
Think of what you just wrote down. Right. So if you said yes and I thought a lot of nodding heads,

353
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:48,800
what I want you to do for this activity as it has it goes and gets the slides that are not on this thing.

354
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:53,910
I want you. So this particular activity is I want you come up with at least two counter-arguments to what you just said.

355
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,810
So if you said yes, you have to come up with two arguments for the no side of that.

356
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:01,709
You feel free to talk to the people around you who spend probably about 10 minutes on that.

357
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:18,570
He goes on to say, Yeah, I thought you said.

358
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:33,830
I said, Yes, sorry. I said, no, because I think I because you're showing someone can be guilty.

359
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,250
I think you need to provide that.

360
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:59,110
So, you know, you know how it is. Like they maybe they might want to know what can we provide?

361
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:14,730
But you didn't have to do something like this.

362
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:29,700
So I was like, Yeah, I asked that definitely.

363
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:38,330
Because you play a little something like this.

364
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:47,000
Yeah. But I mean, don't get me wrong.

365
00:36:47,580 --> 00:37:07,870
I mean, there are so many more times year.

366
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:27,710
I feel like it's not like I want to ask, you know, but I don't think it should be in six months.

367
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:36,170
Is your assumption something this?

368
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:52,310
Like, I don't know. Like for anything, I don't know. But, you know, it's like I'm like, oh, I know.

369
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:57,520
I'm going to be great. Yeah, I think it's just that is the scenario.

370
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:03,360
It doesn't make sense to me any kind of sense of what you want.

371
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,890
It doesn't make sense to me.

372
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:33,510
So maybe you should take three weeks at a time like the present moment that I was just discussing.

373
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:46,019
Yeah, because I just want to know where they even have room for that.

374
00:38:46,020 --> 00:39:00,060
Yeah. Yeah. And you get paid your time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

375
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:08,160
That's why do you want to be able to.

376
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:15,040
Because I think at this point they just they start, they seem to be like, I say something.

377
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,690
Yeah, right.

378
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:45,600
Which is beneficial. Well, it's interesting that I heard you say that you were like, oh, that sounds good.

379
00:39:46,670 --> 00:40:04,070
Oh, yeah. You know, I guess it was like, there's another reason this is not real.

380
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:07,450
Oh, yeah.

381
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:23,160
Like, oh, just, like, make something in that way. They are just not allowed to edit the New York Times because of the severe.

382
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:37,150
You know? I don't know how to say that.

383
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:44,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

384
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:54,650
I don't even think it also presents a little bit too much.

385
00:40:54,930 --> 00:41:20,750
Oh, yes. It's very simply, what you're doing is you're going out for something I don't remember didn't.

386
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:31,900
Okay. All right. So these are both supplies and services.

387
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:35,960
So why don't let's spend a few minutes? What are some of people's thoughts?

388
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:42,540
So should we be incentivizing this explicitly, or is that a useful measure of resources?

389
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,120
I guess more part. We said, well, a few of us up here said no,

390
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:54,419
because there are a lot of like outside factors that contribute to our like the potential to breastfeed or not,

391
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,040
like if it's okay or not and things like that,

392
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:06,479
that like it would be an unfair thing to give some women who already probably are going to choose to breastfeed and tend

393
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:13,740
to position to some like it's not a choice for them who probably could honestly use that money to supplement their child.

394
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:18,719
Right. So if you think of it in terms of like maybe it's like an a regressive tax where you're giving money

395
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,110
to people who don't necessarily need it or whatever the incentive is somebody who doesn't need it,

396
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:30,330
but the population is disproportionately not able to do it, is not able to even receive that incentive because of whatever factors impact estimates.

397
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:41,459
But I went back to the reading and it said that there were higher levels of pathogenic bacteria identified in Nonporous fed infants,

398
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:46,890
but it doesn't really make any specific claim that this is causing harm to those infants yet.

399
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,670
So that's a really good point. So in a different class that I teach,

400
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:53,489
somebody made the comment that the one thing that all public health people can

401
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:56,490
agree on is that breastfeeding vegetables are good for you and breastfeeding.

402
00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:04,860
So that's like the general theory. But it may shock you to know in my whole experience, we do a lot of work on breastfeeding in my lab.

403
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:08,339
There's only ever been one hour of breastfeeding ever.

404
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:12,860
And that was imposed Soviet Union, Romania, where effectively they did it because they didn't have enough formulas.

405
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:18,870
And so in that case, they did randomly allocate formula or breast milk to the point of actually starving women.

406
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:23,220
And that's the only study we have in our city. Everything else we know about breastfeeding is observational.

407
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:32,250
In fact, the irony we start the year, Michigan would say that we cannot do an intervention where we give somebody support that is not breastfeeding.

408
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,940
Because the idea would be that potentially, as you allude, you might cause some harm.

409
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:39,569
Yeah, I think like, I mean,

410
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:47,140
incentives already exist like within that and like they're not necessarily like pay direct type of thing or like within work,

411
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,649
like there's $90 million allocated to education,

412
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:57,270
but that's within a $6 billion budget for which or like having extra funds like for women who are breastfeeding like compared to non

413
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:04,730
breastfeeding because obviously if you're breastfeeding you need more calories like you need like a higher quality diet and that also like,

414
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,380
like how it leads to like help for like the mother's health like and also like making sure that she's

415
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:15,990
fed and like having like healthy things or like incentives to like lactation things like with,

416
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:21,330
and things like it's not always just about like they're not paying people to like breastfeed.

417
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,080
They're just reducing the barriers to something. So that's a good point.

418
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:27,840
Right? So sometimes incentive might just be reduction of areas. It doesn't happen.

419
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:34,190
Yeah, I guess you guys had a sort of interesting thought to sort of along those lines here want to say,

420
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:38,519
oh, I mean, we discussed because of that we could sample that.

421
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:44,460
I also brought up we discussed the basis upon which this premise accepted.

422
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,920
So whether that providing the incentive to the breastfeeding women would mean

423
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,690
that we would provide something similar for the women that we're giving formula,

424
00:44:54,690 --> 00:45:03,030
or it would mean that you favor one situation over the other so that when example it actually

425
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:09,330
the mothers are offered the option to either get a voucher to buy more carrots and vegetables,

426
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:14,490
the breastfeeding mothers, or they're given money for formula.

427
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:23,070
So that's a situation where you incentivize, but you don't take an incentive away from that part of the population.

428
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:33,080
But it is an interesting aspect that we can bring up is the socioeconomic status and whether there would be criteria for incentive or not.

429
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:40,440
Right. And I think so many of you might have been aware there was a industrial challenge at that formula, prison plants.

430
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:42,780
And there was a lot of talk about, well, there's this formula gap.

431
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:48,110
And I felt like a lot of the public health reaction to that was like, well, people should see breastfeeding and conversation.

432
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:53,490
That's kind of hard to do. If your baby's already three months old and you were breastfeeding at that point, you can just start at that point.

433
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:59,580
That's not how this biology works. And so I think there was a lot of sort of ignorance I'm going to go into to say mostly like dudes being like,

434
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:06,959
I don't understand, why don't they just breastfeed their breasts? Whereas like, yeah, people have like legit reasons not able to breastfeed.

435
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,570
A lot of them can be structural and could be by choice. It is for some women incredibly painful and incredibly difficult, incredibly time consuming.

436
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:19,020
Some of it you had mentioned, it made me start thinking that the incentives don't have to be direct incentives like pay outs,

437
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:24,239
that they could be policies that require all offices and institutions to have breastfeeding rooms

438
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:29,130
or that insurance has to cover or Medicare or Medicaid have to cover lactation consultants.

439
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:36,680
So that you mentioned lower the barrier again for those who want to do it, make it easier for them to do it.

440
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,559
So they're actually pumping in their car break, right? No, absolutely.

441
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,580
Yeah. And those barriers are pretty rare, I think, to like like looking at.

442
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,399
Maternity leave.

443
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:51,129
Like that's something that can benefit both groups, like making paid maternity leave like a thing in the U.S., like it is everywhere else.

444
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:57,940
But that's beside the point. I won't get on my soapbox today, but like, that's something that, like, an incentive for like both groups.

445
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:04,959
Like, well, it's like, oh, maybe it's like kind of more like beneficial for like the breastfeeding, things like breastfeeding.

446
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,020
It's incredibly time consuming. Like it's going to benefit both parties, right?

447
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:15,190
It will be disproportionately benefit from somebody who chose not to breastfeed. You could do something else productive with that free time candidate.

448
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:19,690
For what's worth, it's 50 weeks of even during the 300 followers.

449
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:24,250
So you guys wouldn't know. I do like you wouldn't appreciate that.

450
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:29,030
I'm not going to eventually turn this into biochemistry example. So why why did I bring up breastfeeding in the first place?

451
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,070
What is this actually matter?

452
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:36,100
And actually turn the fiber is really important and especially for mental fibers are extremely important for development of the gut microbiome.

453
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,190
And it turns out breast milk has absolutely zero power in the way that we defined.

454
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:48,040
Right. And no fiber does not come from any plants. But those babies who ideally preferred nutrient supply for the purpose of life is either formula.

455
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,849
Breast milk need to have some sort of prebiotic, right? They need to have something in there.

456
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:57,430
And in human breast milk, this prebiotic is something known as human milk oligosaccharides.

457
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:04,239
And so this is the complicated structure of some of the more common even though beliefs are these are actually quite abundant in milk.

458
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,610
So but like 15 grams per liter, right so behind lactose.

459
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:14,470
So the second most abundant thing in not so this is lactose which as you know, most people can digest as babies,

460
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:19,389
but not as adults, even though the thing is that grades are oligomers of lactose.

461
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:27,580
So you can see all of these here. If you look carefully enough, have a lactose moiety on the face, either be elongated by sort of conjoining series,

462
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:37,480
the lactose is in this quadrant, or they can modify by adding either mucosal groups or and and glucose amide groups here.

463
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:41,620
Or you can have a combination of both so you can are not my body's your body's many of

464
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:45,609
your body are able to make a whole variety of these different milk oligosaccharides.

465
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:48,849
Right. And they vary really really really dramatically between women.

466
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:53,319
Right. So it's not like all women had the same one, right? We used to sort of think the key thing was lactose.

467
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,920
All women had lactose. We knew that these other things existed, but we didn't know what they were.

468
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:04,540
And again, because of advances in mostly mass spectrometry, now we can measure all of these sort of on mass globally at scale, right?

469
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:08,170
So we're part of a study where we have milk from something like four or 500 mothers.

470
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:13,830
And the cost to measure all we can measure about 150 different versions of the it only costs about $8 percent.

471
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:21,190
So it's actually quite inexpensive. The advantage of these other lactose molecules are they are extremely fermented.

472
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,940
So they are very, very, very, very, very good prebiotics.

473
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:29,830
Now which particular species and in which ratios support which particular bacteria?

474
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:36,549
Well, that turns out to be a much more complicated question. Right. But before I would say, I don't know, eight or nine years ago, these things,

475
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:39,220
we knew they existed in breast milk, but we were just kind of like other there.

476
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:43,330
They used to call them gyno lactose, which sounds like vaguely sexist to me, but that's what they would call them.

477
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:49,330
But they were not supplemented in formula. So now formula is supplemented, but almost always just with this one.

478
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:50,800
I just have a few calls lot.

479
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:58,000
So if you see a formula it says contains human milk oligosaccharides, chances are it just has that one and it certainly doesn't have this diversity.

480
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:05,740
Now, the mother is the mother. Infant communication here is really interesting because these change as the babies grow, right?

481
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:10,330
So one mother's particular subset of eight families is not even stable over the course of lactation.

482
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:14,050
They're responding to the nutrient needs and maybe some other signals from the baby.

483
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,290
Plus, I'm sure her diet and and the rest of her environment.

484
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,150
So here's the biochemistry of them. Obviously, they can vary a lot. This is just one example.

485
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:26,740
So one class of these were called Lewis class moments called secrete or class.

486
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:31,780
So if you don't have the Lewis or secrete enzymes, you mainly just start with lactose and that can be a link memorized.

487
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:37,330
So you would end up with mostly these things if you had what's called a Lewis thing.

488
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:44,230
That means you tended to be course late on the number two position of the other goes here.

489
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:50,380
And so you end up with a bunch of alpha one twos, which would be this one here and this one here and this one here.

490
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:55,540
Or maybe you have more of the ability to closely on one for position and you make a bunch of these.

491
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:59,620
So we've started to learn a little bit more about these enzymatic activities,

492
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:06,880
but it's not super clear exactly if we can predict which women are going to fall into which type of HMO class at which time.

493
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:13,270
And that's something that there's a lot of research around. So broadly, people classify them into four subgroups.

494
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:21,850
These are called subgroups. And you can see largely that implied by the two of you calls the lactose and three fuels, the lactose and L.A. labels.

495
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:26,020
So you can see group one in three have a lot of too few causal lactose.

496
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:31,660
That is this one here. And groups two and four have almost no pupils of lactose,

497
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:38,530
but they then have a lot more of three if you also lactose in L.A., three equals electrons is here, L.A. is four.

498
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:44,470
Right. And so for reasons that we're not sure, people tend to fall into these roughly four kind of.

499
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,820
So you could generally identify a mother in one of these four categories.

500
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:53,820
And these four categories have different outcomes in the microbiota of the babies that are nursing from left to right.

501
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:57,020
And so are these optimized for that particular baby?

502
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:01,500
Some people say yes. That's why they're different between mothers. The mother is somehow sensing what the baby needs.

503
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:05,340
Is optimizing it, or are they a property of the mother because the mother died?

504
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:08,670
We don't actually know the answer for that. But that's, again, an ongoing question.

505
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,530
I'm showing this mainly to let you know that if you were to say go into the milk formula production business,

506
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:20,910
you may want to have a more diverse set of human milk oligosaccharides than just two people selected because as you can see, two sets of babies.

507
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:27,300
And in fact, this group and this group, which are the third or fourth most abundant groups, actually have no fecal lactose in divide at all.

508
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:33,510
But they're synthesizing those. And those aren't being extracted from humans, but they are generally synthesized.

509
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:34,829
And it turns out that easy ones too,

510
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:39,690
if you look a lot of times you would be surprised to know is that you just want to make and 3G calls the doses next you want

511
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:45,209
to make it so they are synthesized these complicated multichain ones are very very very difficult to make exist in nature,

512
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:51,840
but they're very hard to make. All right. At the same nuts and we talk about a lot of synthetic supplements and vitamins, not really be the same.

513
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:57,959
Yeah. So the evidence behind supplementation today of too few calls of lactose was that they were IDs.

514
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,660
If you come in general mentioned or alluded to this a minute ago,

515
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:08,190
there were observational associations of mothers who were formula feeding and babies at a higher risk of interrupting infections.

516
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:15,389
And so the suggestion was maybe by having more typical lactose, you'll be able to have a more diverse microbiota and could avoid that.

517
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:22,860
And so the first set of studies just supplement to people, select those, and those did show reduction in interacting infections in beans.

518
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:26,670
So that one alone had some benefit. Now was that the maximal benefit?

519
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:32,460
Almost definitely not, right. The more maximal benefit would be again on the 1% of prebiotic sources.

520
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:37,560
Right. But there is good evidence that at least that one had some benefit relative to having none at all,

521
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:42,230
which is the norm for any of you who maybe had formula when you were babies.

522
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:49,610
Probably didn't have any of these in your. Okay.

523
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:52,489
So that's each of us. I'm more than happy to talk about that.

524
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:57,210
If somebody mentioned something about milk not changing and I was like, Oh my God, I've got like a thousand paragraphs to say, I'm Piazza.

525
00:53:57,230 --> 00:54:04,130
That was like, no date sold out. But if anybody wants to talk about the variability of human breast milk, that is a key thing at our level.

526
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:12,530
Okay. So I'm going to transition from what's in the microbiota to sort of what the microbiota is doing.

527
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:18,379
And there's really three rules that I want to sort of touch on what is energy extraction, what is in treatment of the gastrointestinal system?

528
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:23,180
And the third is immune barrier function. So protection of the water.

529
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:28,609
So start with energy extraction. So you may not think of it as energy extraction, right?

530
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:37,790
Because you might think, well, it's not our fault. But of course, there is some energy and fiber to your program, which is what the US FDA recommends.

531
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:45,679
No form is that energy. When you break down various substances that get to the microbiota, some of them are terminal products.

532
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,180
So mainly the gases such as CO2, methane, hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen gas.

533
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:53,660
These are terminal products our body cannot use. They just we just let them go, right?

534
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:58,670
We just throw them out of gas and. Right. So those have no biological value to us.

535
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:03,799
However, the majority of useful metabolites are something called short chain fatty acids.

536
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:09,170
So these are two, three or four carbon fatty acids as take unit and nutrient.

537
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:15,559
We'll talk a lot about fatty acid nomenclature in the Lipids Union, of course, but this is what they're used on.

538
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:22,250
So Buterin, I'm going to start with rates that's the longest of carbon four one is the actually the primary energy source for holding cells.

539
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:27,139
So for a lot of sites, this is Ally McCoist. You can imagine that those cells aren't actually exposed to very much glucose

540
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:30,140
compared to interest because ideally we've absorbed all the glucose earlier.

541
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:33,290
Also they don't have any CO2 down there, so they couldn't have already been one or two.

542
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:40,159
So they tend to use the butyrate in the colon. So if you look at what energy is used, they are oxidizing be pretty effective.

543
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,809
In fact, they're oxidizing so effectively almost none of it escapes out of our colon.

544
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:47,510
It gets into our blood, right? It's primarily used by our old self.

545
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:54,590
So if you're interested in having healthy Colman cells that are doing things involve a lot of energy repair and things like that.

546
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:59,240
You want to make sure there are not Butyrate I think propionate are a little bit different.

547
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:04,430
They are slightly used in small portions by the colon is largely can escape into our blood.

548
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:07,790
They can traffic to the liver. That's when the portal mangles and they can go to other organs.

549
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:14,600
So they are thought to have more sort of systemic effects in the body compared to bitrate, which is thought to have more proximal effect.

550
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:23,180
Sometimes these things, these three things are called HPS prebiotics probiotics, and these occur after fermentation.

551
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,930
And there's been a lot of research recently in supplementing these. And do they have some benefit?

552
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:33,140
I find it odd that people talk about supplement acetate. That's like adding the French fries, which is something I've done since I was a small child.

553
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:38,990
I don't think anybody would think that you should be someone with vinegar, but I do have an uncle who recently had a heart attack.

554
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:42,139
He's fine, but he used to swear by drinking outside of vinegar.

555
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:46,070
And you've been telling me for decades, apple cider vinegar is good for you. And I was like, I don't know, man.

556
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:50,959
I know that's about nutrition. I'm sick of the company and I feel like I'm slightly I'm coming around his idea I

557
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:58,460
think he just like they have calcium supplements thought so perhaps I mean I'm sure

558
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:02,480
they do stuff right I don't the problem is like either such blunt hammers that I

559
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,900
don't know if they do enough that it would actually affect things like beneficially.

560
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:10,220
Right? Like normally you would have a fiber that gets turned into separate and that would help your monocytes.

561
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:15,350
You could argue that just giving butyrate directly might affect your eyesight, but I've actually never seen any good evidence of that.

562
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:18,740
Whereas we have tons of evidence that Byron affects the climate sites.

563
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,859
And the problem is when you have too much of these things and often when you're supplementing,

564
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:28,100
you have quite a lot of it that actually might now disrupting the natural balance and maybe changing the bacteria away from whatever the normal,

565
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:32,050
proper milieu is. Right? Because now you've got a lot of the end product and you adapt and product.

566
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:33,800
So it's possible I'm not ruling it out.

567
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:39,239
I just, you know, I have a hard time thinking that something that straightforward is going to necessarily mimic the effects of the biology,

568
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:43,610
that I wouldn't make it through that digestion because you're not digesting butyrate,

569
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:48,740
you're digesting something else that by the time it gets to the large intestine has become butyrate.

570
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:53,570
So if you start with theory, does it even make it to my understanding, is it?

571
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:58,760
Yeah, because there's not really good absorptive channels in the small intestine because our small intestine is not assigned to it.

572
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:03,620
So especially butyrate, I don't want to say for sure for us in terms of butyrate, most of it that seems to get through the court.

573
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:10,190
Okay. So that's that. So a couple of other things sort of about metabolism here.

574
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:14,540
So we've talked about some of these before. I took this out of the are you on that slide?

575
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:20,780
There are several microbes that also can become terminal gases. The most common attending ones are roughness that and verticals.

576
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:24,380
You may notice all of these start with galactose just like lactose does.

577
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:28,160
So these are the root fermentable things that generally provide a lot of gas.

578
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:32,450
If people have problems with these, usually that's why they take an alpha glycosides supplement.

579
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:37,700
That's what you notice, for example, is an upper glycosides, and that's because these are very, very rapidly fermentable.

580
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:43,370
Okay, so the next sort of study, like a study like object,

581
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:48,560
I want to orient you to spend a few minutes on a group activity about this is this pilot study of a volumetric.

582
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:53,650
So we talked about biometric rights with dignity. I can't remember.

583
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:59,380
We're not going anywhere. What about your diets? Our diets that have high volume, low energy density.

584
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:05,520
Right. So the idea is that you eat a lot of food that has a lot of volume that effectively suppresses ghrelin, which is your whole food.

585
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:05,950
Therefore,

586
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:12,519
you'll be able to eat less food fuller longer because you've got all of this stuff in general that involves a lot of on digestible materials,

587
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:16,450
primarily fibers. So this is a pilot study, a reasonably small pilot study.

588
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:21,280
But I think it's interesting for for a couple of reasons. So the intervention was they randomized people.

589
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,170
This was a single study. They gave everybody the same volumetric diet. They followed it for three months.

590
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:32,710
This involved huge amounts of vegetables, fruits, low energy density foods and reducing the intake of high energy density foods like that.

591
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:36,980
And the average weight loss was like 3.8%, three months.

592
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:40,390
It's like not nothing to scream home about, but there was some average weight.

593
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:44,800
The interesting thing about the studies, what they did is they then took the people and they grew them into two groups.

594
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:48,100
People lost weight and people who did not lose weight. It was about half in each group.

595
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:53,950
Some people lost more than 3.7 kilograms. Some people lost less than seven kilograms.

596
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:58,180
So that's what they're doing. That's their stratification is sort of quote unquote successful.

597
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:05,380
And we've got unsuccessful weight loss people and the advantages there check their microbiota before they put them on the diet.

598
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:11,440
So we've talked a little bit in class and a lot on perusal about this idea of precision nutrition.

599
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:15,730
So this is sort of a test of that idea of like, we know what somebody's microbiome is beforehand.

600
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:20,350
Can we figure out how they're going to respond to this fact? And that's the basis here.

601
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:27,670
So they argue with the microbiota at baseline and then they group people that do success or failure, really do not look at what we can deal with.

602
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:34,060
So most things there was not a big difference. But if you look in this little clade of bacteria down here, there was a few bacteria.

603
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:39,280
Names aren't super important that were predictors of good or bad weight loss.

604
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:43,490
So there was one particular family bacteria, tiny, tiny lister.

605
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:47,530
And another group that started the piece.

606
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:51,329
And they were prognostic of whether or not you could lose weight on this diet.

607
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:56,260
So you might know, imagine going forth with this and saying, well, we're going to evaluate somebody's microbiota.

608
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:01,620
And if you have a lot of this one, then maybe this data we give you.

609
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:05,470
But if you have a lot of this one, this diet's probably not your thing. Right? So that's the premise here.

610
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:13,840
Now, the key difference between these two types of bacteria is a series of enzymes that are really associated with carbohydrate metabolism.

611
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:20,440
So it turns out the ones that failed, the bacteria that were correlated with people who failed to lose weight,

612
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:26,020
so people whose weight was either stable or increased tended to have a lot of these carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes,

613
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:29,070
these specific ones, their bacteria names. So they're not you. Right.

614
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:37,870
But that was the key molecular difference between these bacteria clades that distinguish between failure to lose weight and success and losing weight.

615
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:45,879
Okay. I think I'm a little confused because the -2.0 is a negative one because we

616
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:49,300
think that having those was going to help you be more successful losing weight.

617
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:53,360
But if that's not the case, no, this is just this LDA score is a limiter, it's a discrimination.

618
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:57,700
It just says more likely to be in this bacteria than the other bacteria. Yeah, no, you're right.

619
01:01:58,270 --> 01:02:02,230
Yeah, but the ones in the peer group had more of be carbohydrate metabolizing.

620
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,650
And that's the key thing I want you to take from this. Okay.

621
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:13,839
So. Okay, so what I want you to do in groups again. So the first is I want you to consider these questions.

622
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:19,180
How do you think their fiber intake on average change in the diet, how do you think their microbiome might have changed in the diet?

623
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:25,480
And then why do you think the people who had bacteria with more carbohydrate metabolism had less weight loss?

624
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:32,860
And that was the key outcome. The people who had these bacteria, which had more carbohydrate metabolism, had less weight loss,

625
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:43,660
so which involves some potential explanation that you won't be able to organize everything.

626
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:52,300
So what you. You think that's be justified?

627
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:00,810
Markets. La la, la, la, la.

628
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:09,200
I'm going to break up your business.

629
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:20,920
I saw the economics where I go, I never go like, oh, I will look after this team.

630
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:41,260
I will do that if you want to. Do I do you have to be able to do that?

631
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:56,920
I think we all have a lot and it's just for show my background I Indianapolis in Salt Lake City so I mean you just.

632
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:03,710
In some ways I think this is it from this.

633
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:10,430
I was going to have more of this on top of it.

634
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:36,920
I know this is going to be like it's going to be for a while because I just I can't my own I don't think I that I'm glad I was able to find it.

635
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:49,850
Sorry, but this was my favorite because Republicans and Democrats just do not exist.

636
01:04:50,930 --> 01:05:01,700
I know you make up stories and I think that's a little much more diverse and perhaps more like because we're

637
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:12,409
talking about short chain fatty acids and that prevents the significance of it because if it wasn't for marketing,

638
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:19,250
for energy, they were given advice to get more microbiological.

639
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:28,140
So they weren't given the same thing. Increase your levels of this thing.

640
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:41,370
There's a lot of strength and power in this for you digesting that.

641
01:05:43,120 --> 01:06:04,910
And I can't wait to get out there and take a shower.

642
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:18,050
I really want to work hard.

643
01:06:25,290 --> 01:07:01,960
I was like, Oh, God, I think they people like that, you guys and I want to fight against it.

644
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:23,920
And I really do think that's what I'm focusing on right here.

645
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:57,380
So. So all I want to just to reflect on what was left last night because I was the I was like, I thought I was I think I wrote that.

646
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:03,650
So it's like that, at least to me.

647
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:17,510
I would just say that this is interesting because if I was there,

648
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:31,220
I think People magazine will spend about one more minute on this and then we're going to about the lesson here.

649
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:50,240
This just not going to start your company.

650
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:56,090
The enzymes psychopharmacology, I guess.

651
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:02,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

652
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:09,640
Yeah. You know.

653
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:19,049
I know, I know. I think it's Missouri, but I think it's ties are functions.

654
01:09:19,050 --> 01:09:23,840
I'm not going to show you the news.

655
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:28,940
I have a big fan of that.

656
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:45,240
What you're eating. Okay, where you got these massive amounts of fiber, she has not anything on it, but it's just so simple.

657
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:48,420
But now I know. I'm just trying to determine. Okay.

658
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:55,800
So we're going to on to the last thing here, which is going to be a barrier function and clinic health, I think like all the teams in surgery.

659
01:09:56,220 --> 01:10:00,720
For what it's worth, we already updated the canvas slides that have all those few possible things

660
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:06,270
that were not on the original ones that you're hopefully to try to draw those. But if you need to and by the way, if that ever happens, do not try.

661
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:07,620
You walk without it.

662
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:17,759
It's like, okay, so we've talked a little bit about the most innermost cell line where if you move back to the original adjusting layer,

663
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:24,360
which is a mucus like and the reason it's called the mucous layer is that throughout the digestive tract is this sort of thing.

664
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:28,860
There's a barrier layer of stuff that's secreted from cells and it varies depending on where you are.

665
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:34,400
There's very little mucous layer in the mouth, in the esophagus. But in the colon, there's there's quite a lot there's a quick means.

666
01:10:35,370 --> 01:10:47,459
And so when that usually actually turns out it is biochemically is a protein called locally used, but that mucin importantly is highly glycosylated.

667
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:51,120
So that means it has a whole bunch of carbohydrate groups that are attached to it.

668
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,880
That's what forms this period, right?

669
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:59,579
So the reason certain things can directly interact with our cell surface memories is because we have this barrier of carbohydrates.

670
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:04,830
Right. And these are, as you can imagine, wouldn't be helpful to make them out of starter analogs because then our body would just great.

671
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:10,000
Right? So they are generally a class of glycans that are not just the wire ones.

672
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:14,280
And if you remember actually that big diagram of all the different carbohydrates that showed the only couple of we could digest,

673
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:17,790
one whole class of these are are all linked.

674
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:23,970
But so these are very, very important for protecting cells from any sort of pathogenic bacteria.

675
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:30,240
So it's a lot of study was sort of second last issue study that I want to talk about today is a study where

676
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:36,450
they were looking at mice and they were intentionally eating either a fiber rich or fiber free diet.

677
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:41,460
They also had a synthetic microbiome, which is like not super duper relevant to what we're talking about here.

678
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:48,510
So what they found is that if you look at the mucus layer here in green or here in thick blue, microscopically,

679
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:55,379
you can see the people or the mice are on a fiber rich diet, had a nice, healthy, thick mucus layer, writes the clone.

680
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:58,830
It's like through here. And when you see layers here and then anything else?

681
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:05,520
Bacteria, I'm just here, so that's good. But if you're on a fiber free diet, you can see how thin the mucus layer got.

682
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:10,500
It's very, very, very thin. Right. So you can see it's very thin. And so the green part here is almost nonexistent.

683
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:18,150
The reason for that is these all linked glycans are carbohydrates, and these carbohydrates can be degraded by your gut bacteria.

684
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:23,100
So bacteria are looking for food wherever they can find it. If there's no fiber source or no prebiotic source,

685
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:28,980
they will turn to the next available most closely affected thing, which in that case is the mucus layer.

686
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:32,310
So certain bacteria actually even prefer the weakest layer to fire.

687
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:38,040
But if you have too much of the bacteria that digest the mucus layer and not enough alternate food sources,

688
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:44,579
in this case not enough fermentable fibers, the bacteria will respond by breaking down that mucus layer, by feeding on it.

689
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:55,500
Right. Because they're going to eat whatever. Is that right. Kind of like the dinosaur planting from that from the movie so far.

690
01:12:57,770 --> 01:13:04,530
So then that is thought to be sort of the pathogenesis by which low fiber diets can cause impaired colonic health.

691
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:07,559
Right. Because now there is this protective barrier is gone.

692
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:14,520
If some implement inflammatory or despotic pathogenic bacteria is there now without that protective layer,

693
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,370
that's more likely to have damage to the epithelial cells.

694
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:22,590
That's actually to be compounded by the fact that the probably isn't going to be as much butyrate provider, right?

695
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:28,379
So as the cells get damaged and try to repair, they are no longer going to be provided with that nice energy supply period.

696
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:31,140
Right, because there is not enough fiber. All right.

697
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:36,480
So the theory here is that if you have lost the barrier, you're going to damage a lot of inflammation.

698
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:42,420
And over time, that systemic inflammation could lead to diseases such as colon cancer.

699
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:47,910
Right. So that's the theory behind that. This might be a stretch, but for like the keto diet,

700
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:54,960
like how does this come into play if like people think like carbs and fiber are like the same thing.

701
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:58,739
So there are people who are not this like keto diet,

702
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:02,370
but there are people who are on what are called like a zero carb diet, which also includes no fiber.

703
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:04,230
So you would imagine they would be very subpar.

704
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:15,679
This kind of okay there of course not the long term studies that look out for their delinquencies on people who are doing well.

705
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:19,610
Many people who are on a keto diet, they're not trying to pay attention, are actually consuming quite a lot of fiber.

706
01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:23,450
In fact, there are six that were part of the fiber intake actually increases slightly.

707
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:28,249
And they're because they're calculating that carbs not regular terms is really is like.

708
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:31,620
QUESTION But is a zero carb diet really possible? Yeah.

709
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:36,020
So anything's possible. You could eat it all but want but there's a thing on the Internet called an all potato diet.

710
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:39,049
It sounds horrifying, but yes, people can eat whatever they want.

711
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:41,390
Right? I'm not saying it's good for you. I'm saying it not right.

712
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:49,970
I think there is a chicken soup that I think there was one that was funny, but I'm not saying that's good.

713
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:55,930
That's definitely a mouthful. Okay. So let's go back to something from the In Fiber lecture, right?

714
01:14:55,940 --> 01:15:00,379
So I only alluded to really briefly the idea that dietary fiber is protective against

715
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:05,180
certain cancers and this is true mostly for gastrointestinal related cancers.

716
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:06,680
So cancers of the small intestine,

717
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:15,859
large intestine in quality and the best evidence that we have for preventative effects of fiber is from longitudinal studies on colon cancer risk.

718
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:18,290
And so this is a bunch of observational studies,

719
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:24,150
observational longitudinal studies of colon cancer as compared to their dietary fiber and usually reported by a few.

720
01:15:24,410 --> 01:15:27,710
So colon cancer is actually quite prevalent. It's occurs in all 5% of people.

721
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:36,260
So it is the third leading cause of cancer deaths behind lung and breast and is the second in men who are not supporting breast cancer,

722
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:39,920
probably about 4%, about one in 20 people. There's 60 news for him.

723
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,510
So we would expect that to be three of us might be infected with colon cancer over time.

724
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:50,179
If you look at all these studies, you can see in general, there's a broad protective effect about people who consume more than less fiber.

725
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:53,839
This is usually quintile one with a four. It's about a 10% reduction.

726
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:58,700
But what I think is more striking is if you look at the dosage of fiber across a bunch of these studies,

727
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:04,220
you can come up with a curve that compares people who are doing very low amounts of fiber, so maybe less than five grams a day.

728
01:16:04,610 --> 01:16:09,679
And then there's a linear decrease in colon cancer risk as you consume up to 40 grams per day.

729
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:14,750
And you'll notice this brackets. So the RDA for men sorry, RDA for women and the RDA for men.

730
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:18,830
Right. So this seems to be a pretty dose response of linear effect of fiber.

731
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:21,079
And this is of course, just generalized fiber.

732
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:29,930
We're not necessarily separating soluble fiber from parental, but this is one of the more strong diet health relationships that we have.

733
01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:36,020
Right. So in general, if somebody is concerned about colon cancer risk, a higher fiber diet is pretty well supported by the data.

734
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:39,920
Again, with colon cancer risk, colon cancer, it takes so long to develop.

735
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:43,420
There are good are the follow up people for a long time to see it.

736
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:47,509
You know we randomized into this fiber that when those are done they're usually using

737
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:51,829
some sort of surrogate biomarkers such as colon help or inflammation of the colon.

738
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:56,440
So you might see studies like that that are like 3 to 6 months long, but these are studies are going on 15 or 20 years.

739
01:16:56,660 --> 01:17:01,890
How would you get around the ethics part of the Arctis five?

740
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:05,000
For a long time it wouldn't be a it wouldn't be no fiber.

741
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,960
You could never recommend something it's anti the guidelines so would always be fiber supplementation.

742
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:14,479
So the hours if you fiber supplementation versus nothing requires optimization versus placebo or might

743
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:17,810
be different types of those who do it and probably want to do an article in different types of fiber.

744
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:24,559
Strong indication that the final fiber is more than okay, so that's it.

745
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:28,580
So I have two more minutes to kind of prepare you mentally and emotionally for

746
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:31,790
the upcoming biochemistry that is going to be right in the next three lectures.

747
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:35,749
We are very quickly going to turn to carbohydrate metabolism very quickly.

748
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:39,800
As in Wednesday, we're going to cover glucose, transport and glycolysis. Don't panic.

749
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:44,300
It's going to seem complicated for the first couple of classes.

750
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:48,920
But have faith in me that I've taught this class many times things that seem confusing.

751
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:52,910
I will have supplemental things that you can reach out to test, move our eyes if you're confused.

752
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:59,540
Speed so efficacious in terms of like I am confused by this,

753
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:04,340
I want more resources and there are certain terminology that I'm going to come to really quickly in this class,

754
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:08,240
but that's because I'm going to repeat those words like 100 times for the rest of the semester.

755
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:12,409
So if you start hearing things like allosteric or transcriptional and you're a little bit lost,

756
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:14,930
but you still sort of understand where I am, that's fine.

757
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:18,739
You're going to understand it after I set up with 100, if you're totally lost and you're like,

758
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:25,160
I don't even know what a glucose is, it's not good for me.

759
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:30,680
That's fine. Reach out for nothing. So the next seven lectures, I believe, are all metabolism.

760
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:33,000
So we're going to basically be talking about what happens glucose.

761
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:37,669
Once it gets into our body, what it turns into, what happens when we store it using, right?

762
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:41,780
So those can be a lot of biochemical pathways in there. And yeah.

763
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:46,759
And so that's where we're going to be for the next several weeks until we get back to lipids, we're going to get back to that guidance.

764
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:51,620
We're going to be leaving the digestive system almost entirely for about the next month, going into the next midterm.

765
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,530
And then these are just some general hints.

766
01:18:53,530 --> 01:18:59,120
So hopefully at this point you've already sort of appreciated in terms of what I saw about the structure and and the regulations.

767
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:03,290
And so we'll start with glycolysis on mechanical.

768
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:07,640
I'd like to.
