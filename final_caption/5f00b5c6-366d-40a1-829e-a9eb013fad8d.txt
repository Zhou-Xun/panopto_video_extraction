00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:04,540
Budgeting can be defined simply as planning for

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,510
how much money you have and how it is spent.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,170
A budget is detailed plan expressed in dollar terms for

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,030
how resources will be obtained and how they will be spent during

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:24,550
a specific period of time such as a month, a quarter, or a year.

6
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:30,430
Here is a simple example of a budget for individual or a family.

7
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:35,360
The budget first list the sources of projected revenues or income for

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,760
the individual or family.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,400
It then lists the projected expenses, such as rent, utilities, and groceries.

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,650
At the bottom, the budget lists the difference between projected revenues and

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,950
projected expenses.

12
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,530
The purpose of budgeting for

13
00:00:53,530 --> 00:01:00,020
an organization is essentially the same as budgeting for an individual or a family.

14
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,330
Managers in an organization use budgets to plan and communicate their

15
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:11,660
expectations for how resources will be obtained and how they will be spent.

16
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:16,280
Budgets are also an important tool for senior managers to establish performance

17
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,740
goals and to monitor operations to ensure that those goals are met.

18
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,540
The complexity of organizations, especially large organizations

19
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,060
makes the budgeting process difficult and time consuming.

20
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:37,500
Managers must make several decisions regarding the budgeting process.

21
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,870
First, managers must decide how the budgeting process should take place,

22
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,438
that is, how the budget should be developed.

23
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:51,370
In the bottom-up approach, budgets are developed first by department or

24
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:58,080
program managers and then aggregated and approved by senior managers.

25
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,320
In the top down approach, budgets are developed by the finance staff.

26
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,080
And then after approval by senior management,

27
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,920
sent to department and program managers for implementation.

28
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,490
Second, managers must decide whether to use the previous budget as

29
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:21,558
a starting point for creating the new budget or start with a clean slate?

30
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,490
Under conventional incremental budgeting

31
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,670
each line in the previous budget is examined.

32
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,140
And then adjustments are made to reflect changes and

33
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,250
circumstances when developing the new budget.

34
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:42,850
Under zero based budgeting, managers begin with a budget of zero, and must justify

35
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:50,070
every line item in the new budget based on the expected volume of services provided.
