00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:08,845
Hi there. In this video, we're going to talk about how you use, assess import wizard to bring datasets into SAS.

2
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:16,709
which is a graphical user interface,

3
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:25,799
or a GUI in SAS to basically have SAS do the programing for us in bringing the data set straight into its program.

4
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:34,529
Now, this is the only time during the entire semester that I'm going to have you use a gooey as opposed to coding the syntax yourself.

5
00:00:34,529 --> 00:00:39,569
And the reason why is because the the import wizard is really so effective.

6
00:00:39,569 --> 00:00:46,979
It's such a great method to bring in data sets. It can really save you a lot of headaches down the road.

7
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:51,089
So let's go ahead and get started learning objective for this particular video.

8
00:00:51,089 --> 00:01:01,229
Not surprisingly, is to you to learn to use the import wizard before we go ahead and get started on how you use the gooey.

9
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:07,199
I want to make sure that I reiterate how very important it is for you always to know

10
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:12,869
all the characteristics of your data set before trying to bring an end to SAS.

11
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:18,269
So, for example, not only do you need to know the file type like we talked about the last time,

12
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:23,819
but you'll want to know information such as do you have a header row where they have

13
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:28,769
the variable names in the data set itself before it starts giving you the data?

14
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:34,709
You know, how many variables are going to be in this data set? What kind of variables are they?

15
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:37,649
How many observations do you have?

16
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:47,819
Are there any quirks in that data set that you're going to have to actually be mindful of and watching when you're coding how to bring it in?

17
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:52,739
So with that, let's go ahead and get started.

18
00:01:52,739 --> 00:04:18,161
I'm just going to do a little bit of movement around on my screen so that you can see exactly what I am to.

19
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,299
All right. So here is the data streams that we're going to be trying to open today.

20
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:14,559
You can see the first one that we'll start with is Clinic 09.txt.

21
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:20,759
Now, .txt is giving me a tip off, already that it's a flat file and it's likely to be delimited.

22
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:28,079
And I'm going to guess that it's probably going to be tab delimited or space delimited with a name like .txt

23
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:32,639
So here I am. I've open up the file and what I can see is my guess was right.

24
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:41,969
So this does indeed seem to be a tab delimited. You can see pretty big gaps, like a tab separating each of the different variables.

25
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:46,049
I do have a header row, right. Which is giving me the names of the variables.

26
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:51,989
I have one, two, three, four, five, six variables, all of which appear to be numeric,

27
00:02:51,989 --> 00:03:00,839
meaning that they're all numbers with the exception of date, which is a special kind of number beaning of formatted number of date.

28
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:10,589
It also looks as if I have pretty complete records and I probably have, I don't know, maybe fifteen or twenty observations.

29
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:16,809
So now that I know a bit about what to expect and I can check to make sure that the data sets came in correctly,

30
00:03:16,809 --> 00:03:23,669
I'm going to go ahead and close out this data set. If I don't close out the data set before trying to bring it into SAS,

31
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:30,529
SAS is going to trip off a bunch of error messages because it can't bring in files that are open elsewhere.

32
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:38,369
OK. So here we are in SAS. I'm going to go over to the file menu, which is where the import wizard lives.

33
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:42,739
It's right here under import data. Very logically named.

34
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:47,639
I go ahead and I select that. And up pops what's called the import wizard.

35
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:55,799
So here I have a couple of different choices. One is it saying, do you want to import a standard kind of data source?

36
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,799
And then here it gives me a list of options. Right.

37
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:09,629
So you can see it's got Excel access, comma, separated values, tab delimited files, you know, status files, things like that.

38
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:18,161
Now, you may remember that I had a tab delimited file, so I'm gonna go ahead and click that button.

39
00:04:18,623 --> 00:04:25,043
OK, I'm going to go ahead and click next. And then it's going to ask me how to find the file.

40
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:30,653
So I'm going to go ahead and click browse. And when I do that, it goes to places on my computer.

41
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:35,123
You know, I can navigate through different directories right now.

42
00:04:35,123 --> 00:04:40,163
I've set my working directory to be this used file.

43
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:44,663
And I'll show you actually towards the end of this video how to set your working directory.

44
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:49,973
So that automatically will go to a place where you have all of your files here.

45
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:56,123
This is the data set we want to open. I just click it and say open right at this moment.

46
00:04:56,123 --> 00:05:02,153
We don't need any options. But you can see here if you wanted to.

47
00:05:02,153 --> 00:05:08,573
You know, it it can give you different kinds of delimiters. And it also here you see something very interesting.

48
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:16,133
It says get variable names from first row. That is a default setting when you have variable names in there.

49
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:22,763
So it it can detect that the first line of data is actually with variable names.

50
00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:31,133
And so it it says to take that first row, make them the variable names and then start reading in the data at line two.

51
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:35,483
So I'm to go ahead and set it aside. OK. Click on next.

52
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:42,263
This is basically just asking me where I want to save the SAS file and what I want to call it.

53
00:05:42,263 --> 00:05:47,243
So I'm going to call this clinic 09.

54
00:05:47,243 --> 00:05:52,493
I can call it clinical nine. I can use various different names.

55
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:58,343
And I'm saving this to my work directory, which is the default setting for temporary files.

56
00:05:58,343 --> 00:06:02,423
I can go ahead and click next. And then here's an interesting option.

57
00:06:02,423 --> 00:06:13,163
So what it tells you is that the import wizard can create a file with the underlying SAS code that it is using to bring in those files.

58
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:20,153
So if I want to save that, I can go ahead and say, you know, yeah, I want to save this file.

59
00:06:20,153 --> 00:06:27,683
I'm going to call it clinic read .SAS. And that will be a SAS file with my program.

60
00:06:27,683 --> 00:06:35,633
So now that I've done that, I basically just click finish. And I see in my log.

61
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:42,593
Right. That's the first thing that I want to do. I want to check my log. It says that it read in 20 rows of data.

62
00:06:42,593 --> 00:06:49,223
So it's pretty good. Guess on my part. Into this directory and into you.

63
00:06:49,223 --> 00:07:00,263
Oh, yeah. From this data set. And then it created a dataset called Work.Clinic09 that has 20 observations and six variables.

64
00:07:00,263 --> 00:07:05,123
Now, if you recall, the place that I can find my data set is here in the libraries.

65
00:07:05,123 --> 00:07:13,163
We double click that. I told you it was in the work. Directories were gonna go ahead, double click on work and there is my file.

66
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:19,583
If I double click that, I can now see that my data set seems to have been brought in quite well.

67
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:23,153
That first row of data was indeed now assigned to the variable names.

68
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:29,483
The dates look great and everything else looks like numbers as was expected.

69
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:38,933
So that was a success. I'm going to go ahead and close this out here and I am gonna go back.

70
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:45,293
And now we will bring in a data set which is Excel.

71
00:07:45,293 --> 00:07:50,573
So before we do that recall, I'm going to go to the actual file itself.

72
00:07:50,573 --> 00:07:58,845
I'm gonna open up this w.h q e three file, which is the Excel file that I am interested in.

73
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:04,339
Ah right. So now if we look at this data set. Right. This is an Excel file.

74
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:09,529
We again have a first row of data that has variable names in it.

75
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:16,639
It does appear as if we have many more variables. This time they all appear to be numeric.

76
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:24,619
But boy, there is a lot of missing data. There also appears to be quite a lot of information in this file.

77
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:31,759
So if I scroll all the way to the bottom, it looks as if we have about six thousand records inside of this data stream.

78
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,169
So that's quite a lot of records. OK.

79
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:44,359
Again, I'm going to go ahead and close this out. If I don't close it out again, SAS is going to trip off some errors.

80
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:50,899
So, again, I had gone under file and opened up the import wizard.

81
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:55,549
And now what I want to go ahead is bring in different data types.

82
00:08:55,549 --> 00:09:01,839
Now, you would think that I would want to bring in a Microsoft Excel workbook with .Xls, .xlms, .xlsx.

83
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:11,819
The truth is, is that SAS and Excel have sort of been butting heads for the past several years.

84
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:21,579
And so when you use this option, if you don't have exactly the right configuration of your computer, it will break and give you an error message.

85
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:26,849
And actually, I can show you what that looks like here. I will try and go and browse.

86
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:35,399
I'm gonna try and open up this file. And if my memory serves me correctly, it is going to give me an error.

87
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:41,549
Connection failed. See log for details. That is an indication that that was not the right thing.

88
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:50,039
It's just giving me sort of funny error messages in there. So instead of picking the Microsoft Excel again, that would have been the logical choice.

89
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:57,269
The way that it works really well in SAS is to bring in the Microsoft Excel workbook on P.c file servers.

90
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:08,009
When I do that and I click next. It looks a little bit different than than the directory that I got when I was doing a tab delimited file.

91
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:14,789
But it's the same process. I basically am just browsing until I get to the file I need.

92
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:20,209
I ignore the p.c file server option. Just click. Okay.

93
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:25,399
And this time you can see, right, that it's pulling up the sheet that I want.

94
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:31,099
It was indeed my data was in sheet one. So I'm going to go ahead and skip ahead.

95
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:38,329
If I did have multiple sheets, you know, the tabs in Excel that I could pick, which one I wanted to use here,

96
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:46,039
I am going to now create a new dataset again in my work directory called W h q.

97
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:54,579
I'm going to move ahead. I'm actually I'll skip saving the code for this time and just say finish.

98
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:59,039
So this error here was from the last time we ran the import wizard.

99
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,339
Now it's telling me that work.whq was successfully created.

100
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:07,659
It has six thousand five hundred and forty six observations and 58 variables.

101
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:11,979
So that is sounding very promising. I'm going to go ahead and double click that data set.

102
00:11:11,979 --> 00:11:18,969
Open it wide up. And yes, what we can see is that it appears like the data was brought in well.

103
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:22,689
We do have the data all the way over to the side.

104
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:28,419
And again, we know that we have about six thousand five hundred records, which is what we were expecting.

105
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:36,819
Again, there is a lot of missing us here. You can see that SAS brought these variables in as numeric.

106
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:42,639
You can see that because with the missing ness, it's putting it in as as periods.

107
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:54,249
Whereas actually, interestingly, I see that for many of these other variables, which are indeed numeric SAS read those in as text strings.

108
00:11:54,249 --> 00:12:02,019
So that would be something that we will have to fix later if indeed we wanted them to be numbers.

109
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:07,209
OK. Let's go ahead and do one last example.

110
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:12,429
I've created a file for us. As you recall from last time that I called crazy.

111
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:21,749
Right. Because it has these different percents that are delimiting the file, which is actually very uncommon.

112
00:12:21,749 --> 00:12:31,089
It's not something that you would see. But I want to show you exactly how easy it is to still bring in data sets like that in SAS.

113
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:36,099
So I'm going to go ahead again, launched my import wizard this time.

114
00:12:36,099 --> 00:12:41,319
What I am going to do is I'm going to select that. It's a delimited file.

115
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:50,109
But I'm not going to tell SAS what kind of delimiter it is until I get to the next slide or the next menu.

116
00:12:50,109 --> 00:13:00,849
So I'm going to select my file. And then here, under options, I'm going to tell it that it's not a space or a tab or a hex value,

117
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:06,429
but I'm actually going to enter in here that it is a percent.

118
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:12,759
Again, I still want to get the variable names from the first row. My first row of data is on the second line.

119
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:21,599
I will click OK and then proceed ahead. I'm going to call this data set percentage.

120
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:25,929
I'm then going to go next. Again, I'm just going to skip actually.

121
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:39,589
Maybe I will save the code. So I'll save the code for you this time and do percent I will save.

122
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:44,619
And then I will click finish and we will see how it looks. Check my log.

123
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:53,089
Always. That's the first thing that I do. It's telling me that it you know, it opened up data from this location on my computer.

124
00:13:53,089 --> 00:14:02,079
It was successfully created. And it has two observations and six variables, which actually does not sound.

125
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:08,179
Correct. Let's take a look at that dataset again. Oh, it is correct.

126
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:13,519
So my mistake. There were only two lines of data, SAS has read them incorrectly.

127
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,319
And so all is OK. All right.

128
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:27,059
So the last thing that I do want to show you is just how SAS is storing your files of the code.

129
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:32,869
Right. So I told you that SAS is indeed writing code for you.

130
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:38,389
You can see here that it is using what is called a proc import statement.

131
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:43,219
That is the procedure that imports data. You can see that it has an out statement.

132
00:14:43,219 --> 00:14:52,939
It's tying SAS where it's going to write the data set. It uses a data file command to tell SAS where you're bringing the data set in from.

133
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:56,539
This bit here is telling SAS the type of delimiter.

134
00:14:56,539 --> 00:15:03,499
And here are the replace is saying, hey, SAS, if you already have a data set that's called Clinic09.

135
00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:06,799
Go ahead and replace it now with this new dataset.

136
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:15,919
This is telling SAS that it wants to bring in the names that were in that first row and then it says, start reading your data set.

137
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:21,229
On the second row. So this is the kind of code that she will be learning how to rate later.

138
00:15:21,229 --> 00:15:31,279
But I just want to just show you very briefly what it looks like in the underlying SAS coding that is happening when you see the import wizard.

139
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:37,609
If I open up the the percent one year, remember it it sort of has the same exact structure.

140
00:15:37,609 --> 00:15:43,789
But instead of here being a tab delimited file, it is telling SAS that it is delimited.

141
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:51,689
And then now down here it is using its own message in hex a decimals for what a percent is.

142
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:58,669
That's not something that I would know off the top of my head, but that is the that is the code for a percent sign.

143
00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:05,119
Again, it gets the names and then does the data rows. OK, so we are almost done.

144
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,119
I just wanted to show you one other quick thing.

145
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:17,749
You may have noticed that on my where I got all those data sets were like buried really deep inside of many different directories.

146
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:22,819
One of the tricks that I used was to set what's called my working directory,

147
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:30,169
which is basically the place that SAS will first go to when you go ahead, for example, in an import wizard and look for data sets.

148
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:38,089
So I just write clicked on that or double click on this thing down here and then I can go ahead and change that as I like.

149
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:45,709
For example, I could set it to my desktop. I do. Okay. And now you see that that is my working directory.

150
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:51,949
If I were to go ahead and import data now, I might say I want to bring in an Excel file.

151
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:54,199
I go to next. And I start browsing.

152
00:16:54,199 --> 00:17:02,339
It's now going to start in my desktop as opposed to that other very long directory that was in my working directory previously.

153
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:26,073
OK, very good. So with that, you have now learned to use the SAS import wizard.

154
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:15,979
And I hope that you play around with it.

155
00:17:15,979 --> 00:17:26,073
And Lao, we give you many different examples of how you might try and bring in different data sets in a much simpler way than coding it out by hand.
