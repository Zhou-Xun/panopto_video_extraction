1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,440
Can I ask you? All right.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:13,350
So we're going to we're going to get started today on infectious disease epidemiology.

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,130
We're actually going to have two lectures on infectious disease epidemiologist.

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,350
This will be the first time that I've done two lectures on infectious disease epidemiologist in this class.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,650
I have taught classes on infectious disease epidemiology.

6
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,070
Part of the reason for doing two lectures is just because we have one more lecture this year.

7
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,450
And I like infectious disease epidemiologist.

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,560
So there's that.

9
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:45,000
The other reason was a lot of students said they really liked the lecture, but it was a ton of material in a very short period of time.

10
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:54,540
And so I didn't add too much more material, but I went into a little bit more depth and more samples on the material that was already in the lecture.

11
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:03,210
So yeah, so I would appreciate feedback on whether or not you liked having to infectious disease epidemiology lectures versus one.

12
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,520
We will definitely be keeping the infectious disease active in at least one lecture because that's actually part of the.

13
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:23,690
Competencies that this course covers for some people is that it should cover like how you

14
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:29,480
how you do an outbreak investigation or at least how you would calculate out that problem,

15
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,699
which is how most other people view it.

16
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:39,469
But I actually cover the entire like how you would actually go about doing an outbreak investigation if you want to do one,

17
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:44,960
which is at least kind of interesting, I think to know about even if you never go about doing an outbreak investigation.

18
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:54,260
But if any of you end up in a public health department, you may well find yourself doing an outbreak investigation even even if you didn't expect it.

19
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,680
Okay. So basic outline today.

20
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:06,470
We're going to go over outbreak investigations, talk about determinants of disease outbreaks, control of infectious diseases,

21
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:14,360
independent happenings, study designs or modifications specific to infectious disease epidemiology.

22
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,900
Because we do have some specific study designs that we use in infectious disease epidemiology.

23
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:27,590
All right. So outbreak, epidemic, pandemic, what is the difference between those three things?

24
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,110
It's really about scale, right?

25
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:42,170
All of these are a disease occurring at a level or in locations like geographic locations where they it really hasn't occurred before.

26
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,549
So an outbreak refers to an increase, often sudden,

27
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:56,060
but not necessarily in the number of cases of a disease above which is normally expected in a localized area.

28
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:02,900
Right. An epidemic, on the other hand, refers to an increase once again, often sudden.

29
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:08,059
Right. Got a epidemic peak right here.

30
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,940
This is like endemic level here. Right.

31
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:19,880
Even though it does have little peaks in the number of cases of disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area,

32
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:25,430
it's typically larger than an outbreak, even though above what's normally expected.

33
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,709
We always say that we have an epidemic of influenza right now sort of thing, right?

34
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:38,360
When you have a peak, even though to be honest, we expect at some point during each influenza season to have, you know,

35
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:51,050
a big peak of influenza pandemic is an epidemic that has spread worldwide or actually the official definition is to at least two W.H.O. regions.

36
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,270
So something becomes a pandemic once it heads to W.H.O. regions.

37
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,920
And this is just color coded by the different regions.

38
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:11,010
Okay. So I don't think I think everybody should learn a little bit about Jon Snow.

39
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,110
If they take an epidemiologist class. So Jon Snow was a physician.

40
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,460
Right. 1813 to 1858, a British physician.

41
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,300
And he performed the first comprehensive epidemiologic study.

42
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,020
That's why many of us know about him. We have a freezer upstairs that's named after Jon Snow.

43
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,940
We named all it well, except for one. We named all of our freezers after scientists.

44
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,290
Usually people like that are epidemiologist or involved in vaccines.

45
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,490
Somehow try to get a good representation of women and men.

46
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:51,329
Except we have one named Aria because one of my lab tests went rogue in winter after Game of Thrones,

47
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,050
but the rest of them are all named after scientists. One of them is named Jon Snow.

48
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,570
All right. So caller in London, there have been several outbreaks of cholera in London.

49
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,620
There were a lot of early beliefs about what might have caused this.

50
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,930
So this was a cartoon from back then. It says Gin drinkers, beware.

51
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:19,860
Right. They thought it was maybe the wrath of God. Miasma, kind of this just general dirtiness theory, a lack of good hygiene.

52
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:26,670
So you could get cholera just because you weren't very clean. Or maybe drunkenness was causing cholera.

53
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,500
Snow, however, believed it was due to water contamination.

54
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:40,410
And so he did one of the first studies on the Broad Street pump, the axes here, which are a little hard to see.

55
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,530
There's one there. There's one up over here.

56
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,420
There's one down over here somewhere. He smack it out.

57
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,140
And this is actually something that people commonly do with outbreaks.

58
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,980
Now, depending on the type of outbreak, you might go and kind of map out where the cases are occurring.

59
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:06,270
I participated in an outbreak one time in Nicaragua where it was actually improperly made alcohol, so people were going blind from it.

60
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,140
And that was one of the first things we did was actually map out where all the cases of blindness were occurring,

61
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,350
because not only did we want to figure out what was causing it,

62
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,860
which we fairly immediately thought it might be related to alcohol, we were totally sure.

63
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,290
But then you wanted to actually figure out where in the world that alcohol was coming from and nobody wanted to admit where it was coming from.

64
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:32,160
Right. So map it out. You can kind of figure those things out anyways.

65
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:39,400
So he maps it out. Red Circle. Here is the Broad Street pump notices that there is a lot of clustering around the pump.

66
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:45,300
Right. And so he did a study really is a case control study.

67
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:54,330
So he took his cases. Those were people who I think had died of cholera, if I remember correctly.

68
00:06:54,330 --> 00:07:03,990
I think they didn't just have cholera. 61 used the Broad Street water, six used another water source and six that was unknown.

69
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:11,100
You know, they were fatal cases, so they couldn't ask them what water source they used.

70
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,800
And then he enrolled. A series of controls use of the Broad Street pump was rare.

71
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:24,090
Typically, they got their water somewhere else and he calculated out and sprayed with that,

72
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:29,820
which is something that you quite commonly populate out in infectious and outbreak investigations.

73
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,790
You've already seen this in one of the earlier lectures, right?

74
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,460
So the number of people at risk in whom the disease develops divided by the total number of people at risk.

75
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,719
Notice the at risk here,

76
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:46,350
although often this is just done amongst all the people because you just kind of assume maybe everybody's at risk because we don't really know.

77
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,790
But it does depend.

78
00:07:50,910 --> 00:08:02,340
He also went on to do another study and this was, you're saying later using two different water sources, Southwark and Box Hill and the Lambeth.

79
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:08,640
They were both taking water from the things from the river, but the location of where the water was taken from was different.

80
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:17,040
This was a larger study, right? He had the number of deaths of the people who were using the soft working box.

81
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,280
So water amongst the total population that got that water source.

82
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:29,670
Same thing for Lambeth. Calculate out and a calculated out of the top rate of the number of deaths over the total population.

83
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:39,810
So for the Southwark in box, so we get 4093 over to 266,516.

84
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:47,350
Right. Which is an attack rate of 2.0154 or 1.54%.

85
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,110
Right. Same thing for Lambeth.

86
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:57,090
Right. And we get 0.27%.

87
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,200
And of course you can. Two attack rates.

88
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:07,609
And just like any of our other measures that we've used here or most of our other measures, you can get a ratio rate and we often use ratios.

89
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,880
So he took our ratio in effect rate ratio of 5.7.

90
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:16,940
So the attack rate was 5.7 times higher in the South working customers than with customers.

91
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:28,580
And so he kind of correctly figured out that this water source was indeed causing the cholera in this population.

92
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,549
And then the solution. Right. Is to actually just change where they're taking the water from.

93
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:38,150
Right. Because they were also dumping sewage into the river.

94
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:43,580
Right. So you want to take the water? Well, ideally, you wouldn't dump raw sewage into the river.

95
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,580
But, you know, this was a while ago. Right.

96
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,770
So you want to take the water upstream right from where you're dumping the sewage in downstream.

97
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,530
All right. So outbreaks, that's early examples of outbreaks.

98
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:03,260
But so for recognizing outbreaks, there are a lot of different ways that outbreaks are recognized.

99
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:10,850
They might be detected by clinicians or a laboratory scientist, so they might just notice like, oh, there's a lot of this happening, right?

100
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:18,830
So an unusual disease or unusual clinical presentation or just an unusual number of cases.

101
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:26,870
And then that's the sixth person that I've seen this week. Patient patients may also report other cases when they're present.

102
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:31,640
They go in to the E.R. and say, Oh, I've got this terrible case of bloody diarrhea.

103
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:40,399
And by the way, like I know, like 50 other people who are at my church who also have been sick with diarrhea in the last few days.

104
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:49,730
Right. It can happen through a routine surveillance review or there may be a news media reports.

105
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:55,940
I think the key the blindness cases in Nicaragua, we actually noticed first in the in the news.

106
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:05,270
So local people writing about people suddenly becoming more enduring and so so reasons for investigating outbreaks.

107
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:11,660
Why do we care about outbreaks? Why we can castigate them. We want to stop the exposure and disease transmission.

108
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:17,599
Right. Might lead to recommendations or strategies to prevent similar outbreaks.

109
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:29,690
So you might even investigate the outbreak after it's kind of ended. You may do it to describe new diseases or to learn more about existing diseases.

110
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:37,339
There are also a number of constraints when you're thinking about kind of like outbreaks and what you're going to do, right?

111
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:43,550
So there's there's a true urgency to find the source of an ongoing outbreak and prevent additional cases,

112
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,750
you know, particularly if it's it's, you know, really a severe disease.

113
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,390
There can be pressure to conclude them rapidly, particularly if the outbreak is ongoing.

114
00:11:54,590 --> 00:12:00,770
Number of cases is is always going to be limited. Right. Therefore, your statistical power is going to be limited.

115
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:10,400
And media reports concerning the outbreak may bias the responses of people that are subsequently interviewed.

116
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:23,270
There's also issues around legal liability and financial interest that can complicate outbreak

117
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:30,320
investigations and really put some pressure on individuals to conclude the investigation quickly.

118
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:45,260
And if detection of the outbreak is delayed or permission to enter whatever particular company or plant is delayed,

119
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:53,000
useful clinical or environmental samples may be difficult or impossible to obtain at that point.

120
00:12:53,660 --> 00:13:00,140
So steps in an outbreak investigation, you're going to first establish a case definition or definitions.

121
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:05,720
Then you confirm that cases are real. You establish the background rate of disease.

122
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:11,420
You're going to find cases, decide if there's an outbreak, define the scope of the outbreak.

123
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,560
Examine the descriptive epidemiologic features of the cases.

124
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,069
You're going to generate some hypotheses about what's going on, right?

125
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:29,090
If you already knew what was happening, you don't have to do the outbreak investigation, test hypotheses, collect and test environmental samples.

126
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,520
You're implement control measures and then interact with the press, inform the public.

127
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:41,719
I will note that this does, although this is the logical way to think of this happening, this does not always happen exactly in this order.

128
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,550
Right? Things may be happening at the same time.

129
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:52,100
So for case definition, it's going to include the criteria of person, place, time and clinical features.

130
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:58,880
Right. So a person describes the key characteristics of the patients share or that people share, for example.

131
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,780
It might include age, sex, race, occupation.

132
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,410
May have exclusion criteria. So for example,

133
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:11,510
persons with a had no history of some disease place is typically going to

134
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:17,870
describe a specific geographic location like a state or a county or a country,

135
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:24,610
or it may be a specific facility. So high school U of M School of Public Health.

136
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:35,510
Right. A particular nursing home time is used to delineate a period of time associated with illness, onset for cases under investigation.

137
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:43,550
So limiting time is going to help you to exclude similar illnesses, which are really unrelated to the outbreak of interest.

138
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,110
And then initially, the clinical features should be simple and objective.

139
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,740
Something like sudden onset of fever and cough, right?

140
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,110
The clinical criteria may later be characterized by the presence of specific laboratory findings

141
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:01,160
that's done once you've actually figured out what it is and have a little time to test people.

142
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:08,900
So this just goes through common components and examples of outbreak case definitions.

143
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,300
Here you can see like for exclusion criteria.

144
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,980
For example, you might say persons with no previous history of chronic cough or asthma, something like that.

145
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,510
So. So an example,

146
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:24,980
our case definition might be something like a student at the University of Michigan

147
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,600
School of Public Health who has onset of fever and rash between September 10th,

148
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:34,610
2018, and September 24th, 2018.

149
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:46,049
So four suspected probable and confirmed cases, cases of bottom be broken down into those categories.

150
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,900
Right. Suspected as somebody who reached the clinical criteria,

151
00:15:49,470 --> 00:16:00,450
a probable case is somebody who usually meets the clinical criteria and then has on epidemiologic link to a confirmed case.

152
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:06,150
Right. And then a confirmed case is usually somebody who has laboratory evidence.

153
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,010
So the case definitions are really going to vary by depending on use and situation.

154
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,500
There are usually differences between kind of like routine surveillance case definitions and ones that like a health worker might use.

155
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,050
And it's just because we're using different they're used for different reasons.

156
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,780
Like if you're having a hospital outbreak of something, you know, nosocomial transmission,

157
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,460
you might want to use a looser case definition that might capture people that are the true case definition,

158
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:44,880
because you're probably going to immediately be isolating and putting implementing additional procedures.

159
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,290
Right. To to try to control prevent onward spread.

160
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,710
All right. So we've got case definitions. Our next step is we're going to confirm the cases are real.

161
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,450
Clinical cases should be reviewed directly or indirectly. So by directly.

162
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:10,050
We've been talking to the case themselves. Indirectly means that you might look at do a medical review or speak to medical providers.

163
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,290
And you should always confirm that laboratory findings match the clinical findings.

164
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:21,359
Sometimes, you know, there is laboratory error, so everybody gets a test result.

165
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,250
And, you know, if you go in and get your blood test and you're like, oh my gosh, you know, like this is 100% the truth.

166
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,870
There's sensitivity, specificity issues. There's also contamination issues.

167
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:34,620
They're also mixing up of sample issues that can occur. Right.

168
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,760
And so sometimes it will look like there's an outbreak.

169
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:44,790
You've got a bunch of cases of X reported and it turns out there was just contamination on that entire plate of pictures.

170
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:50,340
Right. And in fact, there is no outbreak or in one of the master mixes.

171
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:55,380
Right. And so you see it across multiple, multiple days.

172
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,690
All right. Next step is to establish the background rate of disease.

173
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,870
You truly have an outbreak or did you just notice it a little bit more this time?

174
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:11,519
For some reason? Right. So you must determine the that the observed number of cases is truly in excess of the usual

175
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,320
number of cases that might be just really straightforward if laboratory tests are available.

176
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:23,430
Right, particularly if it's a nationally reportable disease in the U.S. But it may also

177
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:28,350
be less straightforward if the laboratory tests are unavailable or usually run,

178
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,790
you know, particularly for some foodborne outbreaks, like academic centers like Michigan,

179
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:40,440
will be able to do more testing on the pathogens than what you would see at other hospitals.

180
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:47,280
Right. And it also it's more difficult if the laboratory tests are infrequently used.

181
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,590
Right. So you could have a huge outbreak of a foodborne illness spanning multiple states.

182
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:57,270
But maybe only the people who come in with kidney failure.

183
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,750
Right. Are actually getting subsequent testing. The rest of the people who come in and they say, oh, I had bloody diarrhea for the last two days.

184
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,780
You know, the physicians like here's an antibiotic and drink a lot of water, you know, and you'll be hopefully good to go.

185
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,769
So so this is just kind of an example.

186
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,069
So there are certain diseases that are nationally reportable.

187
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:25,710
This is crypto's cryptosporidium incidence of reported cases in the United States and other territories in 2015.

188
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:35,070
Notice, though, there are some states, right, who probably are either aren't reporting or have very low rates.

189
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:44,490
All right. So you next find the cases, decide if there's an outbreak, and then you're going to define the scope of your outbreak.

190
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:53,700
So in that, you'll identify cases that were not known or at least identified initially.

191
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,240
Right. Because you've got a bunch that you already know about. There probably are more.

192
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:04,350
So you could review existing surveillance data, complete logs kept by the local health department.

193
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:11,070
And sometimes people will come in and say, like, I ate at Hospital Hospo, Restaurant X, and now I have hepatitis.

194
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:21,299
Right past lab data can be reviewed to see if there were other cases because you might just notice a little blip of a bunch of them close together.

195
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:26,129
But there could have been cases that were occurring in sort of the prior weeks survey of hospital

196
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:32,460
data or er results and then also interviewing known cases to see if they know of other cases.

197
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:41,970
So next you'll determine if there's an outbreak. Are the cases in excess of the expected baseline rate for the disease in the setting?

198
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:50,340
So we're going to compare all of our cases now that we figured out everybody that we think is the case right with the baseline data.

199
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:58,140
And then you always want to make sure that the change is not due to some change in reporting rate.

200
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,390
Maybe the case definition changed, diagnostic procedures have changed.

201
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,980
There's some population changes. You know, like here we have big population.

202
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,730
Just where much of the population leaves over the summer.

203
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:19,450
Right. All the students leave and then come back. Right. So. All right.

204
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:26,440
So if you determine there's an outbreak, then you're going to examine the descriptive epidemiologic features of the cases.

205
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,960
So you will review the cases and you plot an epidemic curve.

206
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:39,359
So actually, a lot of things you can do from these epidemic curves, including like start to figure out the amount of time between likely cases,

207
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:48,960
which is very helpful for narrowing down what the pathogens might be if you know the amount of time from exposure to disease, onset of things.

208
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:58,020
But there you go. Anyway, she will talk them out and then you're going to examine the characteristics of the case of the cases age,

209
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:05,399
sex, race, ethnicity, residence, occupation, recent travel, attendance of events,

210
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,430
anything that you might think they might have in common that could give you some sort of clue as to like what's happening,

211
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,260
what some factors might be really easy to identify.

212
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:20,010
You know, they all go in the same church that that usually kind of comes up pretty quickly.

213
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:27,000
Other factors can be more difficult sometimes, and sometimes people don't want to tell you what they have in common.

214
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,780
A really good example of that, but then we'll go off script here a little bit is my my ex-wife.

215
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:43,750
She's an epidemiologist and in California and she was involved in this outbreak investigation that was like,

216
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:47,399
I thought, super interesting and cool and I like got to help a little bit in it.

217
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,979
Or at least we discussed it a lot anyways and she thought, well, we can't figure out what's going on.

218
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:59,880
Like there's all these people, it was like super resistant gonorrhea, right?

219
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:05,370
She worked in the study branch and so they're like trying to figure it out. What, what in the world is happening?

220
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:15,180
And they're talking to all these cases, you know, and they didn't sequencing, typing, like they figure it out, like they're related quite clearly.

221
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,819
And the cases won't like really admit anything.

222
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:27,570
They're like, well, I mean, I go to this Kmart, so eventually they figure out that everybody goes to this Kmart, right?

223
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:31,350
You know, like but they can't get anything more out of people.

224
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:38,400
You know, the one thing it seems like this common, you know, is like all of you seem to go to the same Kmart.

225
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:45,300
So finally one of them is like, Oh, yeah, we're what? We meet at the Kmart to switch partners.

226
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,190
There's like every Thursday night you can just drive up there.

227
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,059
So I just it was really interesting,

228
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:57,600
but it took them a really long time to figure out what these people had in common because nobody wanted to admit it.

229
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,870
Right. Like so anyways, there you go.

230
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:06,480
Another example I hear is an outbreak of salmonella.

231
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:11,250
So a strange type of salmonella that people don't usually get very much.

232
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:16,290
Right. But here we've got the United States and here's Ohio and Michigan.

233
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:21,059
I did pick this one because it has Michigan in it, but there's a big blip.

234
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:25,469
Right. And you're like, well, that's looking out of the ordinary to me, right?

235
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:33,990
The dotted line there. So they go in and they like looking at the age distribution and they're like, well, this is weird.

236
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,860
Like most of our cases are between the ages of 20 and 29.

237
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,479
You know much about salmonella.

238
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:49,500
That's not normally who you see getting salmonella, but you know who you normally see getting salmonella or at least presenting with other elderly.

239
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,920
Yep. Who else? Young children, occasionally.

240
00:24:52,920 --> 00:25:00,750
Pregnant women. Right. Like those are kind of the main people you end up seeing showing up for care about of people 20 to 29.

241
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:06,360
Very few people over 50. Right, really? Well, that's strange.

242
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:16,200
So the descriptive epidemiology kind of indicated that like this is an abnormal this is a really different age distribution than we would expect.

243
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,610
So then they get to sit around and be like, I don't know, what do you think is going on?

244
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I don't know. So anyways, the age distribution, some hypothesis generation, other factors during the interview led them to ask about smoking pot.

245
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,889
Really noticed this was 1970s early eighties rights pot was not legal so of

246
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:44,070
course not something that they're not necessarily going to bring up right away.

247
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:49,320
And it turned out, yes, they were getting salmonella from pot.

248
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:56,610
So there you go. So sometimes super obvious, sometimes not particularly.

249
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:01,950
It's particularly difficult when it's something that people do not want to admit that they might have in common.

250
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,640
Right. Or not going to just immediately fess up to you. Okay.

251
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:10,900
So there you go. Next, we're going to generate hypotheses.

252
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,920
Right. You want hypotheses of the source and also the root.

253
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,520
How is this transmission occurring? So source and root of exposure must be determined.

254
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:26,440
You always want to know that or you really want to try to figure that out. Sometimes that may or may not be obvious.

255
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,860
Right. So there was that that part example. Right. That was not very obvious.

256
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:35,200
Also, my, uh, I will not call K-Mart example.

257
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:41,929
Not, not necessarily super obvious either. Although the Roots, they probably had some ideas of how that was happening.

258
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:45,520
It was just like how that network was getting together. That wasn't clear.

259
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,960
So you look at the descriptive data, right?

260
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:59,460
You review the data about known and suspected sources of previous outbreaks as well as ecologic niche of a particular, particular agent.

261
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:05,530
So you might talk to epidemiologists, but think about the effort, the immunologic factors,

262
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:10,450
the micro biologic factors, opinion tribe, veterinary factors, right?

263
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:15,110
Sometimes it's not obvious what to do with. It's not obvious.

264
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:21,250
So the open ended interviews you might do inspections or visits, refrigerators, supermarkets, etc.

265
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:27,490
Literally go follow somebody around for a little while. And if you're, Oh, that looks bad, right?

266
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:35,920
You might bring together a group of cases to try to get them talking to see if they can figure out what they might have in common.

267
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,260
Um, a good example of one of the,

268
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:50,860
like how like really not obvious and I think also good in a public health message is this multi state outbreak of Shiga toxin producing E coli,

269
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:55,150
which was linked to flour a number of years ago.

270
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,170
Right. And here we got put down the cake batter. Uncooked flour may have a e coli.

271
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:04,060
Why do we care about Shiga toxin e coli natively?

272
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:09,550
Tell me one. There's one really famous one. I mean, we care about E Coli.

273
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,210
You know, you get exquisitely cold all the time, right?

274
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,300
j015787. Have you heard of that?

275
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:22,660
Do you remember all the outbreaks with with meats, right.

276
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:28,709
Causes kidney failure can cause kidney failure. It can make people really sick.

277
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:33,830
It can kill them. Certainly can, you know, cause you didn't need a kidney transplant.

278
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:41,909
So it's one of these ones that we care about anyways. Had never seen it in flour, which is just kind of fascinating.

279
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:48,750
So now we figured out it's actually fairly commonly or happens occasionally in flour.

280
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:56,790
Uh, but like I said, epidemiologists like I had to go into my, like my kids, you know, like I went into like day care one day to pick up my kids.

281
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:04,170
And there they are, like this plate table full of flour, like just raw, you know, like flour.

282
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,159
And they're like driving trucks through it, doing things, and they're kind of like, covered in white.

283
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,000
And I'm like, so that she treated flour.

284
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,790
They're like, Know why? We also made Play-Doh out of it. I'm like, okay, my kids are eating that Play-Doh.

285
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:21,149
So we need to talk a little bit about E coli flour, right?

286
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:27,300
So anyway, so there's your public health message for if and when you have kids like avoid that raw flour.

287
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:34,409
I will admit, I still I still eat raw cookie dough. I know that I'm living on the edge there, but I can't help.

288
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:39,540
It happens on occasion. All right. Such an outbreak investigation.

289
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:43,020
All right. Well, generate our hypothesis that we're going to test our hypothesis.

290
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:51,660
So we'll choose a study design, usually a case control, retrospective cohort cross-section study.

291
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:55,110
Why the study designs? Why would we do a prospective cohort?

292
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,350
What do you think? Need to move.

293
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:08,430
Yeah, we need to know now. Right. Like, we don't want to be, like we sit around for a year and watch a bunch of more people get sick.

294
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,810
You know, figure out what's happening, right? Like, usually, like, these are time sensitive.

295
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:18,270
Right. They also, like, cost a lot of money while the outbreak is going on.

296
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:22,110
These designs are cheaper. They're going to they're going to be cheap and fast.

297
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:29,850
Right. So these are really where you'll you'll go to. This is also where you usually see, ah, cumulative case control studies.

298
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,540
Remember I said that that was a big no. No, it's not a big no.

299
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,290
No. An outbreak investigations is the easiest way to do the outbreak investigations.

300
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,450
You want to use all those cases that have already occurred?

301
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:48,900
Yes, there are some potential biases that may happen, but the benefits to that kind of outweigh the risks in this particular scenario.

302
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,520
So you'll conduct a study, right? You choose your design, you conduct your study.

303
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:58,680
Your design really depends on the nature of the outbreak and your resources.

304
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:09,360
Some of the measures you'll use usually are your top rate, your tack rate ratio rate, your odds ratio, case fatality rate, secondary attack rate.

305
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:16,860
I am not we've already done attack rate attack rate ratio in this lecture, I'm not going to repeat odds ratio again.

306
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:22,200
I'd be very disappointed if any of you cannot tell me what an odds ratio is at this point and calculate it.

307
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:29,159
But for a case fatality rate, it's the number of deaths from a disease divided by the total number of cases of a disease.

308
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:36,540
You have seen this before, too, but I thought it'd be good to remind you it's truly a proportion typically expressed as a percent,

309
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:42,149
sometimes also incorrectly called a case fatality ratio.

310
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:49,140
So case fatality rate, secondary attack rate, the attack rate in susceptible people who have been exposed to a primary case.

311
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:56,279
You know, for example, something like influenza in households and Hong Kong virus people I've been calling where

312
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,310
they they compared the secondary attack rate for pandemic flu to seasonal influenza.

313
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,760
So 8% to 9%. You probably saw a lot of secondary attack rates recently.

314
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,250
Well over the last two years. Right.

315
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:16,129
With SARS-CoV-2, you know, in comparing like Delta to Armageddon and, you know, the original virus to the new variants coming out.

316
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:19,290
All right. There was a lot there was a lot of kind of news media coverage of that.

317
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,070
All right. So we've tested our hypothesis. We're going to collect and test environmental samples.

318
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:35,130
Can be lots of things here. We've got pizza. There was a big outbreak not too long ago that was linked to the pepperoni on frozen pizza.

319
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:42,420
She is right. Natural water sources, always lots of birds in lakes, etc.

320
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:48,930
This is probably maybe for legionnaires disease, right? Water towers can get all kinds of nasty stuff in them.

321
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,940
Tampons, toxic shock syndrome. All right.

322
00:32:54,060 --> 00:33:02,310
So for environmental samples, best case scenario is that the findings of your epidemiologic study would guide what you actually go in and collect,

323
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,750
however they often need to be obtained quickly.

324
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:11,160
You know, we can think back to the kind of the start of SARS-CoV-2, right?

325
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:19,230
Like it was what I remember how many weeks later? Six weeks, seven weeks, eight weeks after that initial outbreak.

326
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:27,030
And in the live market, right where people went back to try to collect samples and then it was there were still some positive samples,

327
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:35,429
but it's hard to kind of find the smoking gun at that point. It might be reasonable to collect and store the samples.

328
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:40,680
So often they'll do that. You'll go in and collect like a thousand different samples, right?

329
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:45,899
Stored them away. And then once you kind of figure it out, what you want to concentrated on,

330
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:54,600
you can go in and then test those samples and then collaborating with the sanitary and environmental engineer or there are other professional,

331
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:04,380
maybe beneficial or. All right, sequencing this is just a kind of sequencing is often used in outbreaks nowadays.

332
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:15,030
So here we've got collecting pathogen samples from sick people, from food sources, and then actually going out to farms, going out to the companies,

333
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:20,910
to plants where things are being processed because you want to figure out what are they sick with,

334
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,959
where is it coming from, and then where is it really coming from?

335
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:32,790
Like where is it being introduced because something is going some wrong somewhere along the path, right?

336
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:36,480
And if you can figure out where that is, that's very helpful.

337
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:44,760
I always think of like Blue Bell ice cream, right where they like went in and, you know, Blue Bell was trying to say it was the dairies.

338
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,760
Right. You know, it turned out to be the ice cream. And I can't remember what it was.

339
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,610
It was something specific. It was one of the types of lines that they had in the plant or something that caused it.

340
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:59,880
But I can't remember now. Anyway, you'll identify through whole genome sequencing, then you compare the.

341
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:05,740
To actually make sure it is indeed related in the same pathogen and it's coming from.

342
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,520
All right. Then you're going to implement control measures.

343
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:14,050
So control the source of the pathogen, if it's known.

344
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:18,010
So you want to remove the vehicle or inactivate the pathogen.

345
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:28,030
You want to interrupt transmission that might involve vector control, sterilizing equipment, etc. control or modify the host.

346
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,240
So prophylactic chemotherapy, immunization.

347
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:41,100
Um, uh, Jose Victor, who's here, worked with me for many years in Nicaragua, probably remembers the RSV outbreak that we had in Nicaragua.

348
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:49,989
We had this RSV outbreak like on the border with Honduras and 68 infants died like infants.

349
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:57,820
And I think there were a few very young toddlers, which is out of the ordinary part of the Nicaraguan government.

350
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:04,120
Called up the CDC and part of the CDC, the CDC, to come in and help with the investigation because,

351
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:09,780
you know, bunch of little kids dying like in a very short period of time is obviously very alarming.

352
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:17,410
Some concern that there might be a new pathogen there, but then there was some sort of political squabble that started to happen.

353
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:23,980
And the samples like we're just sitting there. So I'm not super good at rules at all times.

354
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,470
So I actually went in with the head of the lab and I was like, Just take the samples.

355
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:40,540
I'll take I'll take the blame, like, and have Roger, one of the people that were having run them over the weekend was like,

356
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,190
just go take go take an alcohol, took everything out of the freezer and just run it.

357
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:50,679
I'm like, I think it's RSV. Like, run it for hours. Be even flew around for this one or four that had like their other ALEC quads, whatever.

358
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,790
So we run the samples.

359
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:59,140
Then we had this like call Monday morning and I said, Oh, well, you know, it turns out that it was like 87% of the samples tested positive for RSV.

360
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:06,549
So, you know, it's definitely RSV. It's a nasty outbreak. Clearly, RSV should not cause those rates of deaths.

361
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:10,690
So there's a nosocomial infection that is being spread.

362
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:20,140
It turned out this is sterilize equipment that the the tubes that they were using to intubate the children were not being.

363
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,220
I think that's what it was. Right. We're not being properly sterilized.

364
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:31,810
And in fact, I'm pretty sure that's what it was. And so they were spreading a secondary bacterial infection and that was responsible.

365
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,139
But they were able to go in and kind of look really closely, watch what was happening,

366
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,530
figure out that the sterilization procedures were not appropriate.

367
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:41,799
And then that ended the the outbreak.

368
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:51,580
Right. There you go. So control measures that are used, unfortunately, we're all very aware of working in isolation.

369
00:37:52,190 --> 00:38:00,490
Now, what's the difference between quarantine and isolation? Who gets quarantine.

370
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:12,840
Well, people get isolated to the. So quarantine is healthy people.

371
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:20,370
People that you might like might be exposed. We no longer do quarantine for SARS-CoV-2, but we did do quarantine early in the pandemic.

372
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:26,100
Right. As a rule, if you were told you were exposed, you were supposed to stay home for a certain amount of time.

373
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,600
Right. Or if you had somebody in your household that had SARS-CoV-2, you were also supposed to stay home.

374
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:35,430
Isolation. Is sick people or people that we know are infected.

375
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,620
So there you go. You might recall food products.

376
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:47,790
Everybody gets told to throw away their romaine lettuce or bring it back to the store and get a credit closed.

377
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:54,389
Affected facilities, correct. Procedural practices recommend prophylactic therapeutic or vaccine.

378
00:38:54,390 --> 00:39:00,120
So you might go out and try to prevent those cases from developing occurring.

379
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,460
It might just suggest hand-washing. Right.

380
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:09,149
And education of the public.

381
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,300
But, yeah, lots of recalls. All right.

382
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:19,080
Last but not least, is perhaps the most difficult part, which is interacting with the press and informing the public.

383
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,700
So at the end of the investigations, it's really important to communicate findings.

384
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,009
Of course, that can happen along the way, too. Right.

385
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:31,739
So you provide information to the agency that sponsored the investigation and the facility where the outbreak occurred.

386
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:38,280
You need to tell them what happened and then you're going to usually communicate interim findings and recommendations along the way.

387
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:41,940
Oral Briefing for Local Public Health Authorities.

388
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:50,640
Sometimes a report is written up and submitted to a journal, particularly if it's a novel mechanism for for transmission or a new disease.

389
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,410
Right. You want to get out? Outbreaks are super expensive.

390
00:39:56,130 --> 00:40:00,750
This is just to kind of show the cost of single foodborne outbreaks.

391
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:09,420
It can cost millions of dollars. So here we have a 50 person salmonella outbreak at a fast food restaurant, cost $1.7 million,

392
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:16,950
100 person listeria outbreak at a fast casual restaurant, 1.8 million, right, etc.

393
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:21,450
Norovirus at a fine dining restaurant. $2.6 million.

394
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:24,739
So. All right.

395
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:34,850
Findings. Findings will lead to the formation of guidelines, policy recommendations, publications, regulatory changes, suppress a media outbreak.

396
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:42,040
Investigations are always a pretty public event that's useful for alerting exposed persons.

397
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:49,340
You'll get a lot of cases that pop up because it shows up in the news advising public of measures that are being taken

398
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:56,479
to identify case and cost and control and then explaining the risk of exposure to the public after the outbreak.

399
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,270
That can also be done poorly. We've seen it done poorly recently, particularly with monkeypox.

400
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:10,609
I didn't think it was done very well, but I will admit this slide is from before SARS-CoV-2.

401
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:15,560
So, you know, like this is like this is what we should do, not necessarily what we do do all the time.

402
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:19,070
So trust trust is super important, right?

403
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:28,100
Panic is rare when people are well informed, but it is not as rare when people don't understand what is going on.

404
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:33,649
Remember the all the pictures of people like sometimes kids with, you know, did you see any of them,

405
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:39,410
like the plastic bottles cut off and like put over the child, you know, walking through a train station?

406
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:43,550
The SARS-CoV-2 happened a lot, actually, in various places.

407
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:49,940
You need to announce early. It is going to help prevent misinformation and rumors.

408
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:54,860
You want transparency. So candid, factual, accessible information.

409
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:01,940
And then there's, of course, public concern you need to involve the public in in decision making.

410
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:09,349
So here, this is actually just a picture from Sars-cov-1 or source right on here, mumps outbreaks.

411
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:15,200
We've had a number of mumps outbreaks on college campuses, although not as many recently because what happened,

412
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:21,620
people started getting another booster a little bit later on right as they come to college to prevent mumps.

413
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:32,270
And this just goes through kind of the timeline of an outbreak. It's an E coli outbreak in 2014 in Alberta, Indian was linked to pork.

414
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:41,150
But just to give you an idea of the scale of of what these really take, it's a huge amount of money, a lot of hours, a ton of work.

415
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:57,260
Right. But very important. All right. So that is that we're going to take a eight minute break and start back up at 1055.

416
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,312
But. That's the first place.
