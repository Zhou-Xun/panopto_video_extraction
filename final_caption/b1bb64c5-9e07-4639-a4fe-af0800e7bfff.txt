1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,459
So today, in the running order, I'm going to do a short lecture. Don't worry.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm not going to give you the introductory political science one on one.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,180
And then we're primarily going to have an exercise focused on targeting, which is one of the most important.

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:21,540
And it's one of these skills where doing it on a basic level as necessary and not that hard and

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,410
doing it well actually is sort of something that you can get better at for your entire life.

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,990
And it's the skill of targeting. So the point of a teaching introduction to American government today is a little bit so that,

7
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,920
you know, American government has a lot so that you can do a good job,

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,000
not just on your policy levels and strategic analysis, but also any time you need to understand how to affect some change in the political system,

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,550
it's about figuring out fundamentally who to talk to. So with that.

10
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,070
This is the one time of year that I use Microsoft products, so I always would forget them.

11
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,719
So we'll do a little quick lecture on policy tools and targeting,

12
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,799
which amounts to the factual basis for the very simple proposition that you want to

13
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,810
figure out what you want done and do it and then figure out how to approach them.

14
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,360
And then we'll do an exercise focusing on that.

15
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,980
And as I said, the objectives are partly to understand you to improve your understanding of the US political system.

16
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,830
Some of you have had the blessed lives that allow you to not really know much about American politics.

17
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,270
I'm sorry it ends now and that you really don't know much about American politics.

18
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,370
You really think it looks like Crazytown? But I do recommend reading the entire book.

19
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,420
Just it's a very nice, straightforward presentation of the entire set of languages and so forth.

20
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,450
But you had a look skim read, meaning you check to see if you know what the section is about.

21
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,900
If you know it, you can read really fast and if you don't know it, you slow down and read more.

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,419
And that is going to enable you to start practicing targeting requests for action,

23
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,660
which is going to be preparation both for written assignments and like I said,

24
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,360
alignment and the broad scale is essentially the thing that humans need to do in any social situation,

25
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,840
which is walk into some complex thing and say what's going on here and who's doing what.

26
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:15,600
So I'm going to talk about asks and politicians and ask, is what you want done?

27
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:23,390
It's that simple. And I ask you to increase funding for research into a disease that interests me.

28
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,480
I ask you to reduce funding for social services that I don't like.

29
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,810
I ask you to build a protected bikeway, and I ask you to get rid of the bike lane and reinstate parking in front of my business.

30
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:42,080
That's the political language. There's a lot of ways to request it. Now, notice the note that I stuck on there.

31
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,310
You can also bring attention to a problem. Okay.

32
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,600
Office rules 1 to 1. The busy people appreciate it.

33
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:57,860
The busy, powerful people appreciate it when you bring them a problem with no solution politicians, the rule applies as well.

34
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,480
Fine. Maybe there are some problems so bad that you need to bring it to somebody else's attention for one of two purposes.

35
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,630
One of which is it's so bad that they need to task someone to think of a solution, even if you fail.

36
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,209
And of course, the other one is at least ten years,

37
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:15,680
a written record that you knew about the problem and passed it up the line, even if you didn't do anything to solve it.

38
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:21,350
Neither of those is desirable. And most of the time, of course, you want to bring the solution along with the problem.

39
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,190
Several classes in this are going to work through essentially the indications of that.

40
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:30,020
So what it means is you bring your problem with your ask your problem and your solution together.

41
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:38,150
Here is a list. Not not not a complete list of all the things that you might want to get done.

42
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,850
You might want to pass the constitutional amendment.

43
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:47,540
Right now, Michigan is going to have a very lively ballot in November because there's going to be constitutional amendments,

44
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,620
probably about, among various things,

45
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,400
taking huge amount of money out of public schools in order to turn it into a

46
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,430
voucher program and tax break in order to encourage private competitive education.

47
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,200
Abortion rights and voting.

48
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:11,340
In other words, a constitutional amendment in the states which permit it is a thing that you can ask for in legislative or in the case of Michigan,

49
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,650
in the petition process.

50
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,580
And it could be very powerful for a number of reasons, including its major trick the Democrats are going to try to use to increase their turnout.

51
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:27,649
If you follow Michigan politics, the asterisks over all of this, but that's a different lecture pass in event legislation.

52
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,190
That's basic, right? Do you want to decriminalize marijuana?

53
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,330
Well, the easiest way to do it is to go to a legislator and ask them to do it.

54
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:40,190
Do you want to get rid of alcohol? Auto Insurance, which was a health policy, kept a couple of medical schools in good health.

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,890
You ask the legislature to organize the reform of the insurance system. Executive order.

56
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,879
That's not legislative, as the name says. It's an order from the executive.

57
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:56,970
It's essentially a memorandum telling the system people who work for the executive branch how they're supposed to fill in the gaps.

58
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,740
You don't need to memorize all of these. These are all examples of things you could ask for.

59
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:07,000
So an executive order, like, for example, the classic one is what we call the Mexico City policies,

60
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,820
which is at a conference in Mexico City in the eighties,

61
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:15,590
Ronald Reagan signed an executive order saying that no American foreign aid was going to be allowed to go to anybody,

62
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,620
get advice on how to get an abortion legally. Legislation is you can't give American foreign aid.

63
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,950
Anybody performs abortions. That's the Valencian itself.

64
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,940
Reagan added If you give advice on how to find somebody who gives abortion, you can't have American.

65
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:35,770
One came in immediately unsighted. If you give advice on abortion, you can have American aid money.

66
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,269
W came in and immediately resigned it a little bit tighter, saying if you give advice on abortions, then you can't have American aid.

67
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,800
Don't get Medicare. Obama came in and I guess is what he did.

68
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,329
Trump came in, delegated it to Mike Pence, who wrote a really, really tough version saying like,

69
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,680
you can't even like have anybody on the same premises who might give advice about abortion.

70
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,810
And I don't think you are going to be too shocked to find out the side to be really on it.

71
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:11,170
That's the thing about executive orders. It's an order where the legislation doesn't have a clear guide and it changes with the executive.

72
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,500
So Gretchen Whitmer says the state of Michigan needs to pay a lot of attention to racial equity and health policies.

73
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:23,240
That's there as long as Gretchen Whitmer or somebody who agrees with Gretchen Whitmer is in office.

74
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,560
Same thing provided.

75
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:32,920
The reason I was going on about that is that executive orders, especially under Trump, were often presented as like a really, really big deal.

76
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:38,410
And frequently, if you looked at them, they weren't because you can't give an executive order that contravenes legislation or the budget.

77
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:50,210
It's about using managerial discretion. Allocate money to support policy, cut funding for policy in the budget, pass it, amend regulations and rules.

78
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,280
We'll be talking about regulations on our own. We already spoke about regulations to capital R.

79
00:06:54,790 --> 00:07:01,780
This is where, for example, the EPA's mission to provide clean air is turned into specific standards on specific pollutants.

80
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:10,270
This is where CMS and Onshape are supposed to turn a general mandate to have interoperable

81
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,320
health I.T. into the actual guidance on what constitutes interoperable health I.T.

82
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,000
So they're really important, even if they're technical and often below the radar.

83
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:28,250
Issue a demand guidance which explains things you price guidance if you try to do complicated taxes for any reason in your life.

84
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:36,200
But again, guidance is telling interested parties, taxpayers, bureaucrats and so forth how they should understand the complicated concept.

85
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,840
This often often happens at the agency level.

86
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:46,790
So CMS puts out a regulation and then it puts out guidance explaining what the regulation was about, this large industry of figuring this stuff out.

87
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:52,130
You might notice there's all sorts of opportunities along the way for consultants and policy specialists in this process.

88
00:07:53,810 --> 00:08:00,430
You pass an amended ordinance that's a local law. So you've noticed that there's female sanitary products in all better public toilets in Ann Arbor?

89
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:06,909
That was Ann Arbor mandated. It's the only place in the state. So they can matter, but they can also be preempted.

90
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:11,290
Ann Arbor tried to pass a bag tax $0.05 if you give people a plastic bag with the purchase.

91
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:18,390
State government didn't like that. It rolled in and Ann Arbor and everyone else in the state has been banned from passing a bag tax.

92
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,810
You can't discourage plastic bags in retail establishments on the local level.

93
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:30,200
In the state of Michigan, you support a ballot initiative that is technically what the abortion, voting and education votes,

94
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,170
some other things on the ballot in November are going to be it's an effort to just push the thing onto the agenda.

95
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:41,260
You see that in some states and not others. The rules around it are always really complicated and exploitable.

96
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:50,900
Then there's the vote to raise local taxes. So broadly, every jurisdiction in the United States, every local government has some fixed funding.

97
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:56,580
So you get the sales tax levied on sales in your jurisdiction in Michigan, for example, and it's set by the state.

98
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:00,540
So we don't get competition between Pittsfield Township and Ypsilanti Township or something.

99
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,420
That's nowhere near enough for most of the services that people want.

100
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,170
That does not pay for the schools and the roads and the demand center for people without housing and to the sense of that.

101
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:19,180
So you have villages which are specific percentages of typically property taxes, which are then left right.

102
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,440
And they usually let up in August because the students, well, basically nobody wants in August.

103
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,970
So you let you always have these books in August in Ann Arbor,

104
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,160
because only a small number of people vote and they tend to be people who like the library.

105
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:39,940
So they vote for the library bill and they vote for the bus millage and they vote for the one community college village itself.

106
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,059
In Michigan, they call these villages. Nobody ever explains this. I moved to Michigan.

107
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,980
I'm a political scientist. It took me years to understand the village system, but exist in every state you see something like it.

108
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,639
So for example, the town in western Michigan made the news recently because they had a village altogether whether to fund their library

109
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,590
and they were in the middle of a fight about the library having LGBTQ books that they wanted to do for the library.

110
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:08,870
So the library ran out of money and clothes. Except now the twist is that a romance novel author has given enough money to run for it,

111
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:18,549
and they'll do another village vote now that they're national. You pay attention to this because frequently services you care about require a regular

112
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,930
political campaign because it's a specific tax with your name on it that gets sunsetted.

113
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:28,720
And if, for example, they had not put up a millage on the bus system or the village had been voted down,

114
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,650
the bus system would grind to a halt, just like the library pat of Michigan.

115
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,760
You can start a legal challenge, you know, take it to court.

116
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,270
That's both very simple to say and a lot of complexities.

117
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,490
If you really want to get into complexities, I recommend talking to a lawyer sooner rather than later.

118
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:54,270
Set up a task force. That's a thing that typically executives can do where they say bring people together.

119
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,399
This is very common in the United States because our public bureaucracies by design are so fragmented

120
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:05,250
that unless you have some kind of powerful central person with the governor or president's authority,

121
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,500
it kind of diffuses into interagency squabbling. And the weird stuff that happens,

122
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,790
like much of American Central American policy on the Democrats has run out of the Department

123
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:19,170
of Labor because they don't want to care most about human rights in Latin America.

124
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:26,879
You can conduct an inquiry, which is what it says on the tin. January six contains a high profile one and all the hearings.

125
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,790
I mentioned this already that it's very stressful if you're in the federal bureaucracy to face what they call, quote, a congressional.

126
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,360
And that's the case being put up in front of a bunch of people who are trying to find out what you

127
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,790
did right or wrong and hold you accountable isn't any thought and requires a lot of preparation.

128
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:50,990
And it's absolutely ancient history. But if you want to see how humiliating it is to show up in front of a hostile hearing without preparation,

129
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,219
find out what happened to the executives of the Big Three auto companies when they went to Washington,

130
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,880
D.C., in 2009 in order to explain why they needed the bailout.

131
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,840
It's it's a bloodsport, like they should really be content warning on it.

132
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,389
But obviously, the politicians were taking extra strips out of their hides.

133
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:13,760
So one of the things is they all showed up in private jets and they were basically told to come back in cars in a better company.

134
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:21,350
So these poor guys had to drive from Detroit to Washington, which is not the reason you see the Fortune 500 company this time,

135
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,460
that we still don't have the grace to show up in electric cars.

136
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,810
If they don't, that these are all things you can ask for.

137
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,800
I gave you a little some reason that you're going to hear more little summary is a more elaborate summary.

138
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:38,690
Those the point being there's a lot of different strategies you can adopt.

139
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:45,379
Okay. This is a major strategic and tactical challenge when you're thinking about how to get something done because of this,

140
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,140
varieties of asks, some of them are grossly inappropriate.

141
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:55,280
If your objection is to the behavior of Immigration and Customs Enforcement under Joe Biden, we are robust of people assistance to you.

142
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,600
But a lot of the time it's murkier.

143
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:05,830
If you want to pass a lot of policies in Michigan, you will typically want to start at the local level and build upward.

144
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:12,580
For example, a ban on smoking in public places. The debate they had was that they could pass it in a minute.

145
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:19,600
In an hour. And Traverse City. And if you know the geography of Michigan, you can fill in the other places that would do it.

146
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:27,180
Royal Oak, all kind of Ann Arbor places. Another hand, Detroit is very, very susceptible to the preferences of the casino owners.

147
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,370
And the casino owners are convinced that if people are allowed to smoke and drink, then they're going to gamble.

148
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:39,080
And the casinos are really being employers in Detroit. So if you let local authorities pass a ban on smoking in public places,

149
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,610
Ann Arbor would have got still more smoke free and Detroit would have remained smoking.

150
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,140
Good outcome, not from the point of view of tobacco control advocates.

151
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,320
So they deliberately didn't fight for local action,

152
00:13:53,890 --> 00:14:01,180
even though they could have because they wanted state action that would preempt any local government, ignoring it, letting people move away.

153
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,740
So it's complex and there's always going to be a plant at the embassy.

154
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:12,190
Which brings us to this. So there's all these different things you could ask for.

155
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:16,200
You start with what you substantively want. I want a better bus service.

156
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:21,720
I want reimbursement for mental health services. I want Narcan on a hanging on the wall of every poll group.

157
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,100
You want to find the best person organization to approach? Can they do something?

158
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:33,330
Can they mandate female sanitary products in all restrooms?

159
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:39,000
Is that legally possible for them? And in particular, this kind of exhibit, I guess, Michigan, that's not.

160
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,100
Will they do something different? QUESTION Right.

161
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:50,520
That's the Detroit Casino's question. Detroit politicians are perfectly well aware of the health status of their constituents,

162
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:56,130
but they're also perfectly well aware that their constituents lack of jobs and they tend to value the jobs pretty easily.

163
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:03,920
So. Yeah, that's right. Could do something, but Detroit wouldn't do something which was shaky on the calculations.

164
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,720
So that gives you plan the need for plan B, C and D, right? There's the direct way to do it.

165
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,230
Find the person who can do it and ask them to do it.

166
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:19,840
This woman is giving you a lot of memoranda about expanding abortion access being sent to Donald Trump.

167
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,110
This would give you a lot of memoranda about building the wall being sent to Joe Biden.

168
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:30,400
You see, the problem, right, is not going to work. So plan B is if I wants to build a wall on the Mexican border.

169
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,120
Who do I talk to when Joe Biden is clearly not going to do it?

170
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:40,910
If I want to expand access to reproductive health care, who do I write to under a putative Donald Trump presidency in 2025?

171
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:47,239
That gives you the plans B, C and D. This matters because when you're writing a targeting memo question,

172
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,809
one is always there's an obvious or two obvious people who could do it right to them.

173
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:56,240
Go. And if they're not going to do it, then the trick is figure out who can make them do it.

174
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:03,230
So you want to fiddle with how we pay for things in Medicaid and Medicare?

175
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,320
CMS got. What I see him as. I'm going to listen.

176
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:15,590
Well, first of all, explain why you think CNN is globalism. And then who do I write to that's going to make CNS potentially listen, write.

177
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:22,280
Who can tell CMS what to do or who can get it done even if CMS is opposed, for example, a state government in Medicaid.

178
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:28,100
With that publication. So the a crucial, skillful policy advocacy.

179
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:36,300
First of all, that shows knowledge. If you write to a legislator asking for an executive order, you're going to look silly.

180
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,860
Legislators aren't executives, right? If you write to the state government in any description about Medicare, you're going to look silly.

181
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:50,149
Medicare is not the business of state governments. So don't do it because it's a great way to discredit yourself.

182
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:56,420
And credibility is the coin of the realm. And so don't waste anybody's time, right?

183
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,290
As with anything, addressing a memorandum to the right person is really crucial.

184
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:08,390
And you don't want to waste your time. You want to formulate one page about the electoral incentives for Gretchen Whitmer to reform Medicare.

185
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:14,800
Like, what's she going to do to get. So any questions on this?

186
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:19,240
Figure out what you want to do. There's no explicit answer, but there's probably a best answer.

187
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:23,530
Figure out who can do it and then think about the backup plan.

188
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,930
If the ideal combination isn't available,

189
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:32,290
because at any time there's a decent chance you're going to have some branch of government that does not want to do it.

190
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:38,850
And then you have to think about a way around it. Questions.

191
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:45,440
Okay. That means we're actually very much on schedule.

192
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,180
So more on the specific part of Target. Okay. That was the generic.

193
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:55,940
Here's the basic grid of questions you ask. First of all, what kind of government has this authority?

194
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,580
Right. If you want to pass a bag tax sitting in Ann Arbor, it's clear that local.

195
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:11,160
By the way. Second, territorial. We forget them all the time, except if you live in American Samoa or Puerto Rico or the District of Columbia.

196
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:16,010
It's really interesting. And the other one is tribal sovereignty.

197
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:23,540
A guy who works in tribal relations for one of the people in Michigan said to me, like,

198
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:29,719
the one thing you absolutely need to start like is do not ever assume that you or the state of Michigan,

199
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,330
that you, the University of Michigan, you, the federal government has powers in reservation.

200
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:37,520
You need to figure it out because the people who reservation after the last 200 years

201
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,620
have been quite suspicious of well-meaning or otherwise efforts to make policy for that.

202
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,519
And so pay attention when I said territorial,

203
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,000
even if most of the time you can probably get by without having a sophisticated understanding of what's going on.

204
00:18:51,430 --> 00:19:00,190
First of all, over the Virgin Islands. What this means then is sometimes there's questions if you want Medicaid changed,

205
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,460
there's to some extent a federal as well as a state dimension, but not a local.

206
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,980
You want to pass a plastic bag tax? It's a more strictly political thing.

207
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:18,970
Sorry. It's a more strictly political issue, but nonetheless, it's going to be some optimal place given the politics.

208
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,090
Then the second one is formally who's got the authority?

209
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:30,610
If it's legislative meaning legislation or a budget or hearing, you need to go to the legislature.

210
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:38,420
If it's executive, if it's about using the discretionary powers of the executive within the law to get something done.

211
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:46,400
Because the executive. If it's a court case or somebody else is filing a court case that's in the hands of the judicial branch.

212
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,670
Then is regulatory agencies, to which a lot of stuff is delegated by law.

213
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,550
And that's a lot of red and that's a lot of the formal federal comment stuff that we're going to be doing.

214
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,219
And finally, sometimes it's not a part of government. If you want to do a petition drive, by definition,

215
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,450
it's because government isn't listening or government so that nobody in government can do it on their own.

216
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:14,620
And you start an organization. If you do this grid and the answer you get is you're not going to accomplish anything.

217
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:21,070
That's when you start thinking about plan B, C and D, right? If you live in a state that is completely out of sync with your politics,

218
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:26,610
that's when you start thinking about federal ways to manhandle that stake in this election.

219
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:31,690
Remember? So questions?

220
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:37,170
Yes. So judicial wasn't part of government as the basic action.

221
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:47,260
And I thought that the point of the judicial branch is that they weren't beholden to the public in the same way that politicians are in public.

222
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,390
Yes, I laughed because that's one of my favorite topics.

223
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:56,920
Okay. So really quickly, there's plenty of class on this later.

224
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,610
The federal courts are appointed for life.

225
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,080
State courts are chosen in all sorts of crazy ways.

226
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:10,730
Like in Michigan, they have to run for election and pretty much all levels of the courts.

227
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,690
Most of the local ones run on appointed, never unopposed.

228
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:20,590
So you usually don't get a contested race in probate court, judge or something at the Supreme Court level in the state of Michigan.

229
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,549
People come up on rotating terms and they're partizan.

230
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:28,690
They're 100% partizan, but they don't get their parties listed on the ballot.

231
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:36,520
In a tribute to the nonpartisan nature of the law, if this strikes you as completely bananas, I think that's a very reasonable stance for you to take.

232
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:45,310
So, for example, if you wants to have a michigan Republican state Supreme Court, you have to learn independently that Brian Sara is the Republican.

233
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:52,930
Guess what? A lot of people in Michigan don't vote on the Supreme Court races because they have no heuristic except the last name of the person.

234
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,820
Do you like names? Beginning with Z? I mean, what are you supposed to vote on? How many people can list Michigan State's Bredesen?

235
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:09,140
Only mentioning one candidate because I can't name the Democrats. So they are elected the systems or sometimes they're appointed by the governor.

236
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,180
So, for example, Ohio, basically a committee produces three choices the governor picks.

237
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:20,580
So they are frequently, yes, elected, but in a very dysfunctional electoral system.

238
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:25,930
And that's for two reasons. One is a little stupid institutional design, like what I described in Michigan, the Supreme Court case.

239
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,910
And the other is because a lot of the time any special interest job with a focus like sheriff or judge.

240
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,760
People don't really know how to think about it.

241
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:43,710
So unless they say think it's entirely a position about, say, abortion rights, everything defaults to being tough on crime.

242
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:51,510
And so what you do is you say, I personally run a business that pollutes and I don't want to be fined for polluting,

243
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:58,980
but putting out pro pollution ads is a waste of my money. So I'll put up ads accusing the candidate I don't like of being soft on child molesters.

244
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:07,460
This is a really toxic politics, right? The other layer is that if you have access to in the federal level,

245
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:15,020
an uncle led an unelected lifetime appointment judicial branch, which is what the Supreme Court is.

246
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:21,479
You're going to use it, right? You're going to make a lot of noises about impartiality and justice.

247
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,000
But what kind of political incompetence would it be to not practice Supreme Court with your partizans?

248
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:34,400
There's a vast apparatus of law professors. The rule of likes to law types tell you it's not political.

249
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:38,420
It is extremely clearly political.

250
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:42,860
And that is because otherwise our political elites would have to be really dumb.

251
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,290
I'm not sure what voters care most about passage through the Supreme Court.

252
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,310
So-and-so is a really smart lawyer. I got news for you. There's a lot of really smart lawyers.

253
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,430
What we want is a really smart lawyer who agrees with our partizan opinions.

254
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,770
That's why the Supreme Court we can comfortably describe this having a63 conservative majority right now,

255
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,460
because six of them were appointed by Republicans and three of them were appointed by Democrats.

256
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:10,360
What? Don't believe the hype. Like they want you to believe that it's all rule of law.

257
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:15,110
Judiciary. That they do indeed have to express their opinions through the language of good law.

258
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:21,950
But really these are political questions and they therefore get decided in a political way.

259
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,540
The innovation is the extent to which is partizan political. To which political party increasingly is the one stop guy.

260
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,190
Someone I don't know, like lawyers. I basically say judges are no more interesting than senators.

261
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,670
Senators just don't have the whole apparatus of law schools explaining why what they're saying is actually a great moment in judicial philosophy.

262
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:47,900
That was quite a lot more than he bargained for. There's two classes on leave and Reed Docs.

263
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,780
Content warning will read dogs. Okay.

264
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:03,710
That's enough of you. Let's take it away. Those of you sitting on Panopto, you might not get anything interesting for, like, 40 minutes.

265
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,780
Here's the task. Given the awkwardness of this room.

266
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:14,060
Just use your best judgment to try and get convenient groups of people that would give anybody a sore neck.

267
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,430
You want to start the week with your next. And pick your reporter.

268
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,610
I don't think you need me to leave the slide up to illuminate anything.

269
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,650
Now we're going to get something done.

270
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,040
Okay. I'm going to give you a list of policy ideas.

271
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:37,830
And again, even a set of questions. Okay. So jockeys down or Grandma Harris.

272
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,810
Right. What's your problem? You don't come only with a problem.

273
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:47,780
But if you come without a problem, you're likely to get sidelined. Everyone likes to talk about opportunities, but problems get attention.

274
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:52,670
Who can do it? Yeah. There's not one right answer.

275
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,780
Who's most important? Stop there.

276
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:02,560
Let's agree. Don't do the politics right. If you finish that, move on.

277
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,640
I am the reporter who has to take minimally useful notes to be able to report out.

278
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,730
Okay. We have lots and lots of things you can choose from and I will put them up.

279
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:23,410
Do anyone you like when you've done it to another? As you see, we've got lots.

280
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:39,460
1030, take a couple of minutes to get in groups come back around it's the 50% I'll be directly issuer.

281
00:26:40,600 --> 00:28:18,060
Yes. For for proposal 191.

282
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:37,180
100% right.

283
00:28:40,500 --> 00:29:19,440
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

284
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,740
You're absolutely right.

285
00:29:41,890 --> 00:30:18,310
Here is the only one.

286
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:22,420
That's right.

287
00:30:25,330 --> 00:31:17,730
Yes. So I tried to apply it to you again.

288
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:39,380
You know, I'm going I don't know.

289
00:31:40,760 --> 00:32:09,820
I think if you're out there, I guess you have to do the same thing for you.

290
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:18,020
But I want to do.

291
00:32:25,600 --> 00:33:17,860
Yeah. Mean you and I said yes.

292
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:54,140
Yes, yes.

293
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:06,050
Yes, yes.

294
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:52,030
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

295
00:35:27,810 --> 00:36:26,520
I wish I was.

296
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:36,480
Like I said, that's not true.

297
00:36:39,430 --> 00:37:42,100
Yeah, I think that that's something that could really help for something like that.

298
00:37:42,600 --> 00:38:48,880
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

299
00:38:55,130 --> 00:39:37,760
That's what I thought I was like.

300
00:39:40,560 --> 00:40:04,120
Well, you know, like, I don't know, I think.

301
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:50,700
Well, let's see.

302
00:40:52,940 --> 00:41:01,640
What have you got?

303
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:48,950
But I suppose I might be all right.

304
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:14,120
So let's look at this.

305
00:42:24,700 --> 00:43:16,740
And I was like, Oh, my God.

306
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:47,030
Yeah, I know.

307
00:43:49,870 --> 00:44:57,020
I mean, this is kind of like, oh, so I feel like.

308
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:02,620
I'm like.

309
00:45:08,420 --> 00:46:07,460
I just want to say, I was like I was like, okay, that's all of us.

310
00:46:19,520 --> 00:47:33,800
And I was like, you know, I finished high school.

311
00:47:40,810 --> 00:48:21,320
So this is All Things Considered from NPR News.

312
00:48:28,340 --> 00:49:12,440
This is all.

313
00:50:11,200 --> 00:51:32,180
I wasn't what I was in my mind that this is what's in your heart.

314
00:51:47,630 --> 00:53:07,790
Come on. All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

315
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:28,270
Make sure your recorder. There's a lot of money.

316
00:53:59,970 --> 00:55:01,240
I was at home, and I remember I told you that when I was in high school, I.

317
00:55:14,470 --> 00:56:09,400
I would like to thank you very much.

318
00:56:14,200 --> 00:58:52,089
Thank you. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, one.

319
00:58:52,090 --> 00:59:13,810
That is one thing that I don't know.

320
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:19,140
Where is it? Okay. So.

321
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:26,910
Is anybody of these three groups burning to go first? Cool.

322
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,000
You decided for everyone. So we'll start going this way.

323
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:40,810
Back down this way, and then up this way. I got this to work so I don't have to clutch that thing against my chest, pass the microphone up, basically.

324
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:45,820
Just quickly report out what you did and how you went about charting where you ended up.

325
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:55,230
All right. So the sounds that we chose to research the use of solitary confinement in Michigan state prisons,

326
00:59:55,620 --> 01:00:01,769
there's not a really good conversation about this because there's so many different things that you can find out.

327
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:11,010
And also different, like a problem that you're trying to address, can be a number of things that could be like abuse of individual civil rights,

328
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:19,710
that the economy of the house increases recidivism like an entity issue, become more dangerous, etc.

329
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:26,450
So we decided on sort of a couple things.

330
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:32,160
So in terms of like general targets, obviously you can target courts both state and local,

331
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:36,360
state and federal, you can target legislators, you can target lawmakers.

332
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:42,450
Also target like individual prison wardens in Michigan, I guess the people who run prisons,

333
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:49,650
other correctional facilities administration and they probably can beat that.

334
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:54,060
But so we decided that the most important would be like the legislature.

335
01:00:54,570 --> 01:01:05,490
And the end goal that we took was to try to have an interesting conversation about are you good at frankness to target like a broad base of people?

336
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:14,280
And so what we found was that you could essentially target both progressives and conservatives in trying to sort of different arguments.

337
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:22,620
The progressive state like this is a civil liberties type of issue, etc., and I'm concerned it's actually solitary confinement.

338
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:29,850
So you could target these are tough on crime group because solitary confinement actually increases.

339
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:32,660
Those people are more likely to commit crimes in this.

340
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:39,600
And so that was sort of where we went with this was like a target for the legislature to consider this by appealing to this crime group.

341
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:46,890
And what is the key assumption there? I would call that a plan B, because you immediately gave up on the people who directly run the prisons.

342
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:48,840
Right.

343
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:58,110
So notices this interaction of the people who actually run the prisons, can write the letter saying this, but also like, let's go to the legislature.

344
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:15,090
It has just passed my comment. I'm so proud that we were trying to address one's student loans and their security.

345
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:19,460
The group. I have a case to answer.

346
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:29,280
Who might have thought that this idea would be a government that read as a group and decided that as we sent it to the federal program?

347
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:38,729
That might overlooked because we just don't have enough power to push this through.

348
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:46,940
So we sidestep local governments and so on to start at the local government and consult with our local authorities,

349
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:55,409
specifically somebody who has enough experience and knowledge to push this through.

350
01:02:55,410 --> 01:03:02,260
And then at that point, we would present ourselves to Metro and try to gather support from our districts too.

351
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:11,820
So you kind of have to kind of give the representative an incentive to present it to the state.

352
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:19,940
And then hopefully once it's presented to the state, it's passed and will be presented to the federal government,

353
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:29,070
more specifically the Department of Education, because they're more familiar with the with the student loans and budgeting.

354
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:39,930
And also, we talked about finding ways to reallocate, and then you need to know what it is.

355
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:46,890
Already, there is a policy to cancel student loan debt, but the money has to come from another place.

356
01:03:47,430 --> 01:04:01,229
So yeah. And then sort of the end result is to answer all the questions that you think will be promoted where

357
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:10,440
in the capital the women because it is the is the government will put this in a class nationwide.

358
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:17,729
So. Exactly. So that it's federal student loan debt. And as we saw, the White House can basically give the order to wipe out,

359
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:21,000
although the administration is done by the Department of Education or the Treasury.

360
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:25,680
What you described is a very reasonable grassroots strategy to get something done.

361
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:29,430
Right. So Ann Arbor does it for any student if they can say anything they want.

362
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:34,170
But if you start getting down to the state side of things, that has a way of percolating upward,

363
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,570
shaping the national mood and getting things on the agenda.

364
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:43,469
So that strict target, as you write to Joe Biden and Joe Biden did actually respond, the pressure is canceled,

365
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:49,770
$10,000, $20,000 for Pell Grants and put in a process to avoid having you fall into quite the same hole.

366
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:58,010
Combined with in your case, you're proposing essentially a grassroots political strategy to get a policy accepted as the megaphone.

367
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:06,710
So our task was to restrict the use of solitary confinement in the Michigan State prison.

368
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:14,180
And we went from head to also like the public health problem and mental health crises

369
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:20,989
and like amplifying current mental health issues as well as lifelong effects of them.

370
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:34,160
And then we decided to also talk about the costs of this, to try to sway the like Judiciary Committee, like a head of who is a Republican.

371
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:41,660
And so we decided on the cost of health care, cost of the mental health problems in the long run, as well as in the prison.

372
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:54,110
And there we are. Plan A was originally the Michigan Jail Reform Advisory Council, going to those as they are to reform the jails.

373
01:05:55,010 --> 01:06:02,000
And right now, there is no limit or age on solitary confinement.

374
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:06,959
And then if they weren't able to do anything,

375
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:13,640
we talked about how there's a Department of Corrections for Michigan and there's a mental health department specifically,

376
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:20,510
and how the mental health department's going to be the one that they are going to be one of these patients after the solitary confinement.

377
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:26,059
So they can see firsthand how the pressure on to the Department of Corrections and our

378
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:32,840
clemency was to target specific Judiciary Subcommittee members like the majority leader,

379
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:40,130
as well as because they're able to talk to other people on the subcommittee to try to get legislation passed.

380
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:46,370
So in the spirit of building the class along, I was going to say going forward, don't tell us what policy argument you're going to bank.

381
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:51,470
And then you properly undercut me because you're making specifically a mental health argument which affects your target.

382
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:56,990
Right now, we continue the complete census of the Michigan Department of Corrections.

383
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:04,370
Unless it's crucial to your targeting, don't tell me the argument. Otherwise, we'll all be guilty.

384
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:15,550
I mean, my PSA, I'm honest about whether our test that we chose was to allow all first responders to carry administer naloxone.

385
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:21,170
So for those, you know what I'm going to focus on?

386
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:28,210
Obviously, the opioid epidemic is a significant problem in the U.S. and some states do allow democracy

387
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:33,830
care to administer naloxone or have a standing order prescription from pharmacy in Michigan.

388
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:42,350
But we wanted to make this a broader scope within the federal mandate by targeting

389
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:47,690
the two agencies that have the greatest state or anything like this needs the FDA,

390
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:55,130
and they have the money, resources, knowledge and actions that we can exploit to be able to get this to move forward.

391
01:07:55,970 --> 01:08:01,940
And as is costing us billions of dollars and our money has bipartisan support to address this issue.

392
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:09,770
And the FDA, as well as Biden, have already requested significant increases to address this task for the fiscal year 2022.

393
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:17,510
So our main goal is just ensuring that this task and addressing this as the main part of their budget increase.

394
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,069
I know this is two issues here. One is the budgeting, the actual money,

395
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:28,580
and the other is permission for them to do it because there's still a lot of restrictions in opioid treatment and response areas.

396
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:32,440
Can one of you carry the mic across the aisle? Right.

397
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:49,310
So we actually did the same one day, allowing first responders to carry out some sort of a process to prevent that from opioid overdose, overdose.

398
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:55,530
And then in terms of authority, we started at the state level a federal agency.

399
01:08:56,270 --> 01:09:04,219
And so we would target and look at the state and local health departments that state has their own rules.

400
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:11,000
And legislature are first responders, you see, like our main target, the state legislature.

401
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:16,650
And if we had to, we could go to the health departments also as well.

402
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:20,419
And this is one where you need to know your state, she says,

403
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:25,340
how exactly the scope of practices and good behavior for various first responders are set.

404
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:28,220
Sometimes it's discretion, sometimes it's somewhere on board.

405
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:33,530
Sometimes they outsource it to a regulatory body like the joint commission kind of thing, but for state paramedics.

406
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:45,980
So our group's task was to include decisions in addition to this added care to it is important.

407
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:56,270
And so we want a physician to introduce legislation that would add dental and vision to Part B of Medicare.

408
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:04,080
And we will to you know several other federal because I.

409
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:13,250
Then you have a long standing that at some level is not known.

410
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:18,150
One or two Michigan senators. Right.

411
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:34,660
And also, as far as agency goes, as with most of their movies, so and so, straight up, if you want to put it in, you have to get it.

412
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:37,610
You have to get legislation. So going to a senator is a good idea.

413
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:43,810
The case for going to see us is the first thing they're going to do is consult CMS, maybe see this person here.

414
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:48,870
And if that person comes up to the stupid idea, your campaign is not thereby advanced.

415
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:53,610
Can you pass over this way just before we go down? Okay.

416
01:10:54,350 --> 01:11:01,140
So our topic was improving the efficiency of public transportation.

417
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:09,130
And when we mentioned it wouldn't be obvious in light of communities in specific didn't see it type.

418
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:18,800
It's hard to have access to things that are accessible groceries, affordable groceries, medical emergencies going to work.

419
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:24,410
A lot of these things, you can even go outside and get access to these.

420
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:33,990
So we mentioned that local government officials or county commissioners has a big impact on this because because

421
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:42,050
they can get commissioners to add millage to fund the local bus system mentioned local U.S. representatives,

422
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:47,330
those congressional districts that advocate for funding from the state and federal governments.

423
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:56,520
And each one of the city mayors in the county and the city of Detroit specifically mentioned the Detroit Department of Transportation,

424
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:02,660
the Detroit City Council, and once again, the representatives of the congressional districts in Detroit.

425
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:05,090
I don't want to be too much of a transport nerd,

426
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:10,760
but the thing about federal support for transit transport is the support to build and buy, but not to run it.

427
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:13,910
So they'll buy you a new bus, but they won't pay for a driver.

428
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:20,990
They'll buy you a new freeway, but they won't fix the old one, which is why they're blasting an expansion of I-94 through the middle of Detroit.

429
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:25,550
Is it going to be a federal support for that, whereas fixing the potholes? Well, you're on your own bluster.

430
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:32,900
So you go to your members of Congress. They're very happy to cut the ribbon on some new busses, but that doesn't drive the bus.

431
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:38,560
Can you pass Mike backward? There's a group behind you.

432
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:43,750
Oh, sorry. Okay.

433
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:48,990
Okay. So the problem we proposed a target was requirements of objects before event purchases.

434
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:58,860
The problem, the concept is trying to address this violence, of course, of who might have the authority to implement the policy idea.

435
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:02,970
We looked at players in the state and federal government, including BP.

436
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:12,090
Well, here is Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The president divided the legislative branch branches, Congress under state senators and state governors,

437
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:16,770
including those with lobbying power, with an array of manufacturers.

438
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:25,140
Of those, one that we think will be most important will be one of the Tuesday senators Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters.

439
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:29,930
But we looked into that Gary Peters actually on the Committee on Homeland Security, Governmental Affairs.

440
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:35,010
So we feel like he had more of a voice on that topic. So we chose Gary Peters textbook.

441
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:40,229
Textbook will not pick the relevant senator from your state and you pass it all the way down.

442
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:43,650
There's a couple of groups here, but this is vitiate.

443
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:49,469
We talked about blocking enforcement and abortion.

444
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:55,020
What we did talk about very one Michigan law that is in the process right now.

445
01:13:56,280 --> 01:14:01,680
So you possible targets. The governor requested the lower courts.

446
01:14:02,190 --> 01:14:09,299
The attorney general refuse to prosecute the state supreme court can decide on the constitutionality of the law itself.

447
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:17,520
The state legislature, given the law passed the legislation and Michigan voters can do a ballot initiative to amend the Constitution.

448
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:25,410
We did agree with the tactics taken by reproductive rights organizations in the state that a

449
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:31,170
constitutional amendment is the most effective way to fundamentally block importation of this law.

450
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:38,310
A state Supreme Court decision could be overturned by another state in the future,

451
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:44,160
and the attorney general refusing to prosecute doesn't stop county prosecutors from prosecuting

452
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:50,130
as many of the Republicans and said they won over the forget about ballot initiative.

453
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:59,790
Well, no. And that also this is one of the cases, since it's not going on under our nose where everybody's doing everything right.

454
01:14:59,790 --> 01:15:03,920
So currently enforcement law is blocked by a judge in Oakland County least.

455
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:11,090
And separately, there was a court case about whether county prosecutors could be blocked by the state, not enforcing the law.

456
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:15,760
And a bunch of county prosecutors who really wanted to have a go at more cases.

457
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:18,860
And now, you know, they filed a suit saying we'd like to be able to enforce.

458
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:26,870
Everyone. We talk about the same thing. Also, how to block enforcement of anti-abortion law.

459
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:33,170
And we kind of decided that there were a few ways that we could do this.

460
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:38,600
So we decided to start at local first and talk to county prosecutors,

461
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:47,540
specifically targeting those with more liberal ideologies, easier to convince them to not pursue legislation on these.

462
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:56,160
Then if you wanted to go to the state level, it's up to the governor to be easy in this case because we know what her policies lie.

463
01:15:56,630 --> 01:16:08,750
And then also going to like state representatives in Congress to try to block or create new legislation to prevent criminalization of abortion.

464
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:16,680
This is this is a really good legislative strategy. The one caveat I put on this is that if a woman from, say,

465
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:21,770
Kent County goes and has a abortion in Ann Arbor, the Ann Arbor prosecutors who are out to enforce it,

466
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:29,930
Kent County prosecutor is perfectly happy to set police to arrest the Ann Arbor practitioner and take them back to Kent County.

467
01:16:30,830 --> 01:16:34,910
So that's the limit on local. A lot of local prosecutors are saying what they're going to do.

468
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:35,959
And actually,

469
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:41,930
the people who wish to enforce the law are going to have an easier legal case soon as this if this Oakland County judge's ruling goes away.

470
01:16:42,710 --> 01:16:47,180
Can you fast forward this way? And we have three groups left.

471
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:58,969
Oh, my God. So we looked at increase in the supply of vaccines and we actually recently found this fact sheet on the White House website.

472
01:16:58,970 --> 01:17:07,250
And it looks like the Biden-Harris administration is already looking at how to address this issue.

473
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:18,200
But what we found is that they're primarily allocating vaccines to people who are exposed to monkey pox.

474
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:24,710
And so there's basically not a lot of availability to the general public.

475
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:28,280
And we feel like that's important in preventing another outbreak.

476
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:32,270
And so one thing that they haven't done is invoke the Defense Production Act.

477
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:38,870
And so we were looking at how we might get the executive branch to do that.

478
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:44,510
And we decided to target the Health and Human Services Secretary,

479
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:48,890
primarily because going directly to the president, it just seems like he has a lot on his plate.

480
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:57,320
And it might be helpful to have encouragement from someone who kind of has the health interests in mind.

481
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:06,860
And so we would just write a memo to that person and encourage them to have the president invoke the Defense Production Act.

482
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:09,770
And we were talking a little bit about how funding for this works.

483
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:21,469
And it looks like the Defense Production Act Fund has a part of the federal budget allocated to it, but we're not exactly sure how that works.

484
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:29,540
So that's to be determined. The short answer is, given the amount of discretionary public health money still sloshing around for a few months,

485
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:33,980
we're not actually that worried, but it depends on what type of Congress gets elected in November.

486
01:18:35,930 --> 01:18:39,350
You have 2 minutes and one or two more groups. Is anybody really burning?

487
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:44,090
Otherwise, I owe you a favor. I mean, ours was the same topic.

488
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:50,750
Oh, similar approach. So how about time keeping the Senate my profession.

489
01:18:51,350 --> 01:19:03,150
Can you pass that for. So we chose to address the solitary confinement, which can speak.

490
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:06,959
You have a person who has a lot of arguments and directions.

491
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,220
You can go in disgust.

492
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:21,410
But we ultimately felt like it would be difficult legislative perspectives for so many stakeholders and so decided that would be done rightly.

493
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:27,120
Jeremy Bush is the deputy director of Correctional Facilities Administration in

494
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:34,470
Michigan to give recognition or guidance to limit the use of solitary confinement.

495
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:43,290
Finally, somebody who has faith in the actual person whose job is really struck by the number of people who like to look at Plan A,

496
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:48,620
which is the guy who could order it and certainly says something about your faith in the correctional bureaucracy.

497
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:51,420
I said, okay, you all did a really good job,

498
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:59,700
but I want you to think about there aren't any right answers in this game is to what extent did you instinctively and correctly go to plan B,

499
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:04,080
C, D, right? Did you make it harder than it needs to be?

500
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:12,120
And also, did you write a letter to somebody before you jumped off trying to get a congressional committee to harass them and takes bear in mind,

501
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:17,640
what are you doing for us? Is your strategy above all is that your policy proposal has a lot.
