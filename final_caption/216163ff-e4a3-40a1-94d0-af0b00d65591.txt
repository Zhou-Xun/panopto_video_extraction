1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,450
Okay. So we're going to go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,530
So before we start, people have questions on anything.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,290
No. Has anybody tried doing the hand hygiene surveys yet?

4
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:24,370
Okay. Did anything tips you want to pass on to your colleagues?

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,620
If you go really early in the morning, that's when they're doing rounds.

6
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:35,390
You can get a bunch of observations. That's my. So what time did you go?

7
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,430
About 9 a.m. Okay, that's. That's prime time.

8
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:53,620
That's not really early. Well, that would be surprised if we like.

9
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:00,310
Yeah, that's great. Okay. Anything else?

10
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,370
So. So I had a had a question for you folks.

11
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,440
How many of you have been to summer camp? Did you ever go to summer camp?

12
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:15,070
Anybody? All right. And did you ever sleep in a crowded cabin where they had bunk beds side by side?

13
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,210
Anybody see that? Okay. How do they make you put your head and tail?

14
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:26,530
Could you, like, have this had this head so you could talk to each other like you remember?

15
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,980
You remember? Well, would you want them to do that?

16
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:42,210
Probably not. Can you think of a transmission reason why you would not want to do that?

17
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,950
What might happen if you have two people sleeping rather close together?

18
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,800
Yeah. Would be breathing on them. Yeah.

19
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:09,480
And so what. What kind of precautions? Worried about what kind of transmission are airborne and what else would you go with?

20
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:17,370
Right. So, in fact, I remember this because the first time I went to summer camp, they gave us do that.

21
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,000
And I thought that was really terrible. I thought they just didn't want us to talk to each other.

22
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:28,970
But now I know better. Um, sometimes when you have people you have, like sleeping close together,

23
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,760
you can get droplet spread and meningitis is one of the things you worry about.

24
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:42,840
So if you start looking at the world through your your IP eyes, I think things start to look different.

25
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:56,220
Anyway, we're speaking of type. We're very lucky to have Jackie Weiss here to talk to us that she's the dancing on ice and she's an IP.

26
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,960
But you want to go and introduce yourself something a bit about yourself?

27
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,260
Sure. Hi, everyone. I'm Jackie White.

28
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:11,130
I'm one of the infection prevention is in the Infection Prevention Epidemiology Department here at University of Michigan Health.

29
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:20,430
I've been in the department for just over 17 years, so I'm actually a graduate of the general IP program here,

30
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,430
and I have my bachelor's degrees in microbiology also from UVM.

31
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,800
So I started in the department.

32
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:36,930
I actually, after graduation, worked at the Michigan Public Health Institute for just under a year and came back to work in infection prevention.

33
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,710
And I started in the department as what we call our infection prevention analysts.

34
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:50,760
So that is we actually usually fill any open positions with new grads from the but usually they're from here.

35
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,129
But that role in our department, they work a lot with our health departments.

36
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:01,860
They help with surveillance and they do contact tracing for COVID right now.

37
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,809
But then I became an IP a couple of years later,

38
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:17,310
so I've been an IP for 15 years and my entire tenure I have covered pediatric areas, so I've also covered some adult areas.

39
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,270
But my main focus is in the children's hospital here.

40
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,430
I've been through that. I've been involved in a lot of different quality initiatives.

41
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,669
There have been a lot of multicenter collaboratives in the pediatric world that I've been involved in.

42
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,570
Most of those have been around clouds that most of my talk today will be about.

43
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:47,040
I am one of the institutional co-leads for all of our labs initiatives is on along with being the infection prevention lead,

44
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,760
obviously, and Children and Women's Hospital for classic prevention as well.

45
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:57,419
And within the department I am also our Jyp intern coordinator.

46
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:06,300
So Emily and Jordan were interns last year, so I coordinate all that program for the department.

47
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,000
So that is basically snapshot of me and my role.

48
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:22,530
So today I'm going to start out by just going over a review of principles of surveillance, and then we will get into talking about classes.

49
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:30,330
And today we won't talk a lot about prevention. We're going to talk primarily about the surveillance piece of it.

50
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:39,120
So we'll talk in general about some definition components before we get into specifics.

51
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,390
And then we have a lot of examples that we'll go through together.

52
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,200
So you get a sense of how the how ABC surveillance works.

53
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,230
If you have any questions, please feel free to stop me. And you don't have to wait until the end.

54
00:05:53,370 --> 00:06:04,940
All right, so. All right.

55
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:14,540
So let's talk about surveillance. So this will probably be a review of the surveillance lecture from the previous hospital AP class.

56
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:20,990
But we like to start with this before you get into all of the surveillance talks throughout the semester.

57
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:26,600
So surveillance is an information loop or a cycle.

58
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:32,809
It starts and ends with communication or action. That diagram on the lower right hand side of the slide,

59
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:38,469
I really like it because it gives you the broad categories of what you're doing when you're doing surveillance.

60
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:44,600
So, for example, you're collecting your data, you're recording it, reporting it,

61
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,490
then you analyze it, interpret it, and then you report it out and you use that data.

62
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:54,650
And then based on that and your findings, you're going to start all over again. You're going to just keep keep going.

63
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,639
Surveillance can be not only for outcome data. So our hospital acquired infections are itchy eyes.

64
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:08,000
So bloodstream infections, catheter associated urinary tract infections, surgical site infections.

65
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,110
But it can also be used for process measures. So when I say process measures, those are the things.

66
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:21,980
So there is surveillance done and how well we are doing with all of the elements that we need to prevent those infections.

67
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:29,209
So for example, the collapsing bundle, so all the practices that our staff do to help prevent collapses, we track that too.

68
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:38,460
So that's a continuous surveillance cycle as well. So more detailed elements of their surveillance.

69
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,840
Do you always start with a risk assessment followed by From your risk assessment,

70
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:49,110
you develop your surveillance plan, then you do your case findings, data collection analysis.

71
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:56,830
From that, you do a needs assessment. You distribute your data, and then you assess the effectiveness of your interventions.

72
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,160
So let's talk about those in a little bit more detail.

73
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:06,480
So when you start with your risk assessment, so basically everyone has to do every department has to do a risk assessment.

74
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,110
This is required annually by the Joint Commission.

75
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,640
What you're doing when you do a risk assessment is you are assessing the likelihood

76
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:21,510
that events will occur that will impact patients and staff when you're doing that.

77
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,960
So you're assessing what you think the likelihood will be.

78
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,510
And then the other component is you determine the severity of that impact.

79
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,020
So just for example, on our risk assessment, there are weather related things.

80
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:42,000
So a tornado, how likely is that going to happen? And if it does happen, what is the infection prevention impact to our patients?

81
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:50,220
A flood is another example or you have things like collapses as a broad category.

82
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,180
How do we think the likelihood that a cloud is going to occur?

83
00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:01,499
And if it does occur, what does that impact to patients and staff from that?

84
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,309
So they can be you can do your risk assessment in various ways.

85
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:13,350
You can categorize them as high, low or high, medium and low, or you can give them a number like 1 to 5, for example.

86
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,750
And then when you do all that with your I think our risk assessment is like three or four pages long.

87
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,530
It's very long and detailed, but you use that to set priorities.

88
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:34,020
So your things that you think are high risk, high likelihood, maybe even the mediums that you add, you add to your sort of action list.

89
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,280
So you're going to focus on preventing those things in the coming fiscal year.

90
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:45,600
So I said, you rank them. However, there are some things that are actually required by regulatory agencies.

91
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:51,750
For example, reporting of communicable diseases. We are required to report communicable diseases to the health department.

92
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,130
So that is just we don't even write that. We know we have to do that.

93
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:05,099
From your risk assessment, you develop your surveillance plan. Who, what and where are in terms of hospital acquired infections.

94
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,129
Are you going to track infections on all inpatients or are you going to do

95
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:12,209
targeted surveillance and only track infections that are of particular interest,

96
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,500
maybe those that are high risk.

97
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:25,620
So, for example, for catheter associated bloodstream infection, Klebsiella surveillance and catheter associated urinary tract infections,

98
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:31,049
we do a hospital wide surveillance for our surgical site infection surveillance.

99
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,620
We target those high risk procedures. We do so many surgical procedures here.

100
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:42,300
There's it would be so hard to track because you track every single infection.

101
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,530
So we do those that are required by regulatory agencies and those that we feel are high risk.

102
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,140
So how do you do it? A couple of different ways. You can do prospective surveillance.

103
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:57,780
That's when you look forward in real time that says initiated when the patient is still under your care.

104
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,100
The advantages obviously are you are able to capture the data in real time.

105
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,410
You can interview the caregivers, observe findings that might not be recorded in the patient record.

106
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:12,629
So you can sit outside the room or on the unit and just watch what's happening as people going in and

107
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:18,450
out or retrospective where you look back in time does often occurs after the patient is discharged.

108
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:25,860
Some advantages. It allows for a more comprehensive review of sequential events because you have the chart,

109
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:33,900
complete chart to look at and it can be more efficient because you're not sort of chasing where people are going and how they're doing it.

110
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:42,780
AJ Surveillance honestly can be both. It a lot of times as retrospective, but sometimes the patients are still here.

111
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:47,370
And so you can you go up to the room or to the unit and watch what's happening up there if there's a concern.

112
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,920
Also in terms of your surveillance plan, is the data going to be passive?

113
00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:00,419
So the data comes to you, microbiology reports, maybe the unit or provider on the area,

114
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:06,150
in the area notifies you of a concern or from a report of discharge diagnoses.

115
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:13,230
Passive surveillance is the most common, is most commonly used for HIV infections.

116
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:21,000
And looking at specific pathogens, if you have a concern that you have a lot of Klebsiella blood cultures in your institution,

117
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,220
then you would be doing passive surveillance.

118
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:32,370
Active surveillance is when you actually look to find cases, for example, surgery patients or patients on ventilators or specific diseases.

119
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:37,800
So are ventilator associated event surveillance is active.

120
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:43,200
Every patient who is on a ventilator, they get evaluated on whether they have a video or not.

121
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:51,480
For our surgical site, infection, surveillance, we get a list of all surgical patients and we look at those to see if they had an infection.

122
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,710
So once you've developed your surveillance plane, you're going to go out, you're going to do your case filing and collect your data.

123
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,800
So, again, how do you get that data? Well, your ID systems, the lab director report from clinicians.

124
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:14,139
When you're doing your data collection and case finding for AIS, you want to make sure you're using the CDC and HSN definitions.

125
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,620
Those are the gold standard for infection prevention there.

126
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:23,319
You want to make sure that whatever type of surveillance you're doing is specific and objective.

127
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,469
So you don't just want to look for patients who have a fever.

128
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:33,220
What does that mean? When you're looking at charts, you will see your provider may say that patient had a fever,

129
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,010
but when you actually look at the documentation of the temperature, maybe it's 38, 37.8.

130
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,700
And according to the CDC, a fever is greater than 38.

131
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:49,389
So you want to make sure that it's that you have that that detail there using

132
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:53,650
these definitions or any type of surveillance you want to ensure reproducibility.

133
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:59,800
So you always want to refer to your standard published validated definitions to ensure the accuracy of your surveillance.

134
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,370
You want to make sure everyone is using the same definitions.

135
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:09,579
And if definitions change, just know that your comparability of rates over time will be compromised.

136
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:14,460
And we'll talk about an example of a definition change when we when we talk about classes.

137
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,690
But they are just a question.

138
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:25,059
So when you do this data collection, do you have standard forms that you use that have the definition on it and then people check it off?

139
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:34,900
Or how do you usually do that? So the definitions are these big PDF files and we either access them online or have them.

140
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:43,449
We used to have a paper form with the specific points, but our surveillance system is within a module within the electronic medical record.

141
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:47,859
And so when you are if you're, for example, saying, yes,

142
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:55,659
this patient has a cloud that you have to check off the components that meet the definition in order for it to actually accept it as an infection.

143
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:02,960
So if you don't check off the right things, it won't. So you're going to look like if you're doing this retrospective where, you know,

144
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:07,719
you'll have two windows open and you'll look in, you'll find information and check it out somewhere else.

145
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,310
I was just curious would just be going. Yeah. So it's actually all within my chart.

146
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:20,800
So you have the patient chart open and then the right hand side of the screen is the is the infection like checklist, if you will.

147
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,240
Okay. So they, in fact, have that integrated.

148
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:28,170
Mm hmm. That's really nice. You have to make a performance.

149
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:33,430
You know, we did use forms when I first started, though, for quite some time, so.

150
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:37,180
Yes. And that and that helps for reproducibility. Yeah. Yeah.

151
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:46,820
That may not always be true in every hospital. Every hospital has a different electronic medical record system we chose.

152
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:59,330
We use a book which we have named my chart here, and we have the we chose to use there.

153
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:06,260
It's called Bugsy there, Bugsy module. And so but not every institution may use Bugsy.

154
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:12,890
So once you have your cases, you want to analyze the data, uh, calculating rates.

155
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:17,660
So your rate is always your numerator or your denominator times a thousand.

156
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:24,230
In this case, for each and I surveillance, your numerator is the number of events and your denominator is the population at risk.

157
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,070
So denominator should always be device days when available.

158
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,580
It is necessary for benchmarking to the CDC.

159
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:44,000
Obviously, if you think about your rates, your infection rate or your infection risk increases as more invasive devices like central lines or fully

160
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,480
catheters or ventilators are used and you have higher risk the longer those devices remain in place.

161
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,560
If you don't have denominators, patient days can be used.

162
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:03,560
We use patient days for a variety of denominators with different, different ages that we track.

163
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:12,080
So let's do a little exercise. So here is a graph of the number of classes.

164
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:19,260
It's just number of classes for over a year by month. So for example, you can see in January there were two, February there were three.

165
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,559
In March there was one. This is not real. Just so you know.

166
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,459
So you can't please don't go saying, oh, my gosh, the pig.

167
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,820
You in 2017 had this funny. This is not what we made up.

168
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:36,270
So, all right. So what do you guys see here? Do you see any trends when you see.

169
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:45,160
Anything. Yeah.

170
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,070
I don't know, just maybe more of an uptick in impatience during these times.

171
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:56,310
Yeah. So this is just a number of collapses. So if you're thinking just number of collapses, how would you interpret this?

172
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:03,110
Yeah, like it looks like there's maybe a spike in classes kind of in the middle of winter and in the middle of summer.

173
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,930
Mm hmm. Yup. So it kind of looks like there are a couple of clusters of infections.

174
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:16,250
Right. So what does that mean? Well, maybe the summer months, I would think.

175
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:22,280
Well, we have a lot of new staff who start in the summer residence, things like that, in the winter.

176
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:31,820
Few people, a lot of people are off over the holidays. There's a lot of visiting nurses who come or you know, or plenty of things you could think of.

177
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,720
All right.

178
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:40,790
So what if I tell you this is a graph of just the number of central line days for that same time period, same unit, same patient population?

179
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:55,060
What does this trend look like? There were riots in the middle of summer.

180
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,520
Mm hmm. Yeah. So maybe this is your patient acuity.

181
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,540
So acuity, the severity of illness is higher, so you're using more central lines.

182
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,940
But again, you also have new residents.

183
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:12,190
So maybe they love placing central lines and they don't know or initiative to get the line 2 hours, something like that.

184
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:17,710
So when you combine those and actually calculate your rate, this is what you see.

185
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:27,519
So if you remember this first, the first slide with the number, the first graph with the number of collapses, we saw two fairly even clusters, right?

186
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,730
One in the winter and one in the summer. But then when you calculate your rate, you really get a picture of what's going on.

187
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:41,170
So what do you guys see here? Where are we really seeing an issue with collapses in the winter?

188
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:45,339
Mm. So then you can really direct your interventions.

189
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:53,560
And what I would do is I would start with my focus here, see what's going on, and then obviously you're doing this real time,

190
00:19:54,670 --> 00:20:00,700
but then uh, obviously you have another cluster, but it's not as severe as that one in the winter.

191
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:06,490
So that's why it's really important to use a denominator that represents your population at risk,

192
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:10,210
because it really gives you a better snapshot of what is actually happening.

193
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,930
When you are analyzing your data, you also want to benchmark.

194
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,570
So this is when you compare your data to other data. It helps you identify areas for improvement.

195
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:30,500
But what do you benchmark to. Well, you can benchmark to your historical unit data.

196
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:38,360
So, for example, for surgical site infections, if there's no external benchmark, you benchmark to where you've been in previous years.

197
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:47,190
The CDC and HSN benchmarks, they used to publish benchmarks every year.

198
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:57,210
So they'd give you a median median rate for similar units at similar type institutions, and they'd give you like 75th percentile.

199
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,830
They'd give you a whole bunch of information that has faded out. They don't do that anymore.

200
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,090
And on the next slide, we'll talk about really what we use as a benchmark now.

201
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,830
Obviously, you can also benchmark to literature and you can benchmark to other collaboratives.

202
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:18,620
So as I mentioned, I work in pediatrics and so we participate in a collaborative for cloud.

203
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,760
And so we can look at our rate compared to how the collaborative is doing.

204
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:28,280
So those are other children's hospitals with similar type units.

205
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:33,980
They may not be academic teaching institutions, but they have similar patient populations.

206
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:40,040
So you can also do that. You do not want to benchmark to historical data from other units.

207
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,940
So comparing our nick you to St Joe's Nick,

208
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:53,599
you really wouldn't be appropriate and you do not want to benchmark to other hospitals with different patient populations.

209
00:21:53,600 --> 00:22:01,250
So we don't want to benchmark to a small community hospital up in like Saginaw or something like that.

210
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:09,590
So what do we use now? We use something called the ACR that stands for a standardized infection ratio.

211
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:15,920
This is a summary measure used to track ages. It does adjust for patients of varying risk.

212
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:24,980
And what it does, it actually compares your actual number of ages with the baseline US experience.

213
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:34,310
So it's taking your true number of infections and it's comparing it to everything else that has been submitted to NHS.

214
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:39,740
So we submit our data to NHS and other institutions, submit their data to NHS then.

215
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:47,000
So for example, for our surgical ICU, it takes how many cots, for example,

216
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:54,110
we have called that we have and it looks at other surgical intensive care units, similar type institutions.

217
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:59,120
And it calculates what would be considered, what would be expected.

218
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:02,810
Okay. So it's basically a ratio of your observed infection.

219
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:08,870
So what we are seeing versus what would be expected from that analysis of all of the national data.

220
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,770
So basically, if you have an essay are greater than one,

221
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:20,390
you're having more infections than would be expected of similar type of units that would be predicted if your SVR is less than one.

222
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:24,110
Great. You're doing a good job. You're doing better than would be expected.

223
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,560
Obviously, we want to aspire to be zero. We don't want having infections.

224
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:34,670
But Ciara of less than one is great to see. Ours are also used for pay for performance with CMS.

225
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:43,680
So they've set an ACR that in order to get money to get paid, you have to have an SLR of less than that.

226
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:51,510
So, for example, for collapsing for this fiscal year, the ACR, the CMS threshold is 0.59.

227
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:57,020
So if we're above that, then we don't get payment for those those events.

228
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:07,320
So after you do your analysis, you say, oh my gosh, we have a huge issue with C difficile.

229
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:13,410
We need to figure out what's going on. So you do your needs assessment. So you use that data to determine your next steps.

230
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,450
Do you continue to monitor things or can you take a break from monitoring?

231
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:25,530
And we're always tracking each case, but do we need to go out and monitor what staff are doing or can we stop doing that?

232
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:35,660
You do you need to get additional information. Do you observe practice or process surveillance, education?

233
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:41,570
We need to go educate on this. So let's go educate how to use skin prep appropriately.

234
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,030
We think that is that's a concern of ours based on our data.

235
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:53,430
And then you can also from that do competency testing may result in policy revision or even evaluation of equipment.

236
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:02,130
Next, you're going to distribute your data and assess effectiveness, the effectiveness of any interventions that you implemented.

237
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:10,350
So you always want to make sure you're presenting to inequality groups both at the unit level and at the institutional level.

238
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:17,070
You want to make sure it gets to staff. You don't want to. If the more staff who see it, the better.

239
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:21,269
Put that in front of in front of them so that they know how they're doing.

240
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,300
It gets more buy in and then they want to keep doing better.

241
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:30,870
The Infection Control Committee always sees that any collaborative group so like I said, multicenter,

242
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:40,010
collaboratives and then regulatory agencies, obviously CMS, Joint Commission and then finally you set your goals.

243
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:50,370
So obviously you want to decrease your rates every year. You want your data to fall below CDC benchmarks you want to see are of less than one.

244
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:53,730
But even better, your ultimate goal is to have zero infections.

245
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,280
Does anyone have any questions on that before we get into the specifics of Clancy?

246
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:07,860
So I have a question for you all. Have you done anybody who's done SARS before, did you do them succeeding?

247
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:16,320
Is there anything you want in place to get to the energy? And if they are something similar to.

248
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,250
So when you compare to population, what are we worried about?

249
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:31,220
Like if you wanted to compare an average of this to Jackson, how would you look?

250
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:38,920
What would you worry about in terms of comparing the the rates of anything?

251
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:45,280
Like what are the things that are different that make a difference in disease incidence?

252
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:52,360
Always what varies by what characteristic of people just disease vary but.

253
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,660
Yes. Yes. Right. Okay.

254
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:06,929
What else? Socioeconomic status, socioeconomic status.

255
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:15,120
And what the other day when you're writing your mission and one of the big ones, you said.

256
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:21,060
Right. Okay. So what did you learn how to do? How? What do we do so that we can make things compatible?

257
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:32,720
Part ways. Part? I was going to say standardized.

258
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,800
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You have to standardize.

259
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:41,030
Standardize. Exactly. Or adjust. We standardize.

260
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:47,570
Right. So as far as a form of standardization, it's the same idea.

261
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:56,270
Exactly. And it's a it's an indirect form of standardization.

262
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:00,840
I don't know if they taught you direct and indirect, but it's an indirect form of standardization.

263
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:07,129
That's exactly what it is. So you learn this in basic AP class, but it is here.

264
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:14,780
The idea is you want to be able to make your data comparable to what everybody else finds, and that's how you know whether you're better or worse.

265
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:24,550
So understanding affairs are really important and so that you know what you're seeing.

266
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:28,760
Right? Right. So it's just so yes.

267
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,750
It's just a form of standardization. Right.

268
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,050
Cool. Any other questions that I have?

269
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:40,610
For sure. So for our class, you said it was like 3.59.

270
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:45,800
Mm. So assuming that like across the nation,

271
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:53,480
if you aggregate the data like some people or some hospitals will fall below that, you said things like won't get paid.

272
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,340
So that 0.5, that is the CMS threshold for a class.

273
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:08,840
So CMS is a pay for performance. So it's a it's basically you get your Medicare Medicaid payments if you perform well.

274
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:13,600
Right. And preventing for a patient safety and in particular for classy.

275
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:21,860
Right. So if you are doing well, if you're an institution is below that CMS threshold, then you get your payments.

276
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:22,940
If you don't,

277
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:37,849
then you you don't get paid for those any any additional costs that you have due to one of those infections ever happens like in Michigan, medicine.

278
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:41,960
That seems like really difficult. I don't know.

279
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:56,660
Yeah. So so as I so I say ours are kind of an interesting thing because you I don't know.

280
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:01,210
So you may think you're doing terribly right.

281
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,169
Terribly, terribly, terribly.

282
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:12,860
Like, for example, in these past two years, since during the pandemic, infection rates have increased, but they haven't increased just here.

283
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:17,020
They've increased everywhere. Right. So you think, oh, my gosh.

284
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:27,280
And I'm exaggerating again. We have we had 100 collapses, but other places have gone up, too.

285
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:36,199
So when you when they calculate say, ah, it may still be below that because everybody else is right,

286
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,570
because they're they're using everybody's numbers to calculate an expected value.

287
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:50,479
And so it's I think the key question is, how do we those is when you have a tertiary care facility,

288
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,200
it's different than if you are in a small rural hospital.

289
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:00,610
I mean, so that the thing is, is that you're going to get penalized for being like a tertiary care facility.

290
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,550
No. So the. So what? And each of them does that.

291
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:10,850
So when you set up your profile with an NHS and you specify what kind of hospital you are,

292
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,550
what kind of units you have, like every unit is classified according to an NHS and classification.

293
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:26,479
And so the expected number of infections for us, for our type of facility is very different than a community hospital because they can say,

294
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:36,740
Oh, I'm from Midland originally, so mid-Michigan health, your community hospital, this is your expected number.

295
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:42,980
University of Michigan Health in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Your an academic medical center.

296
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:52,680
This is your expected value because they look at other similar type institutions that aren't.

297
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:57,180
Yeah. Any other questions?

298
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:04,400
All right. So let's talk about collapses, central line associated bloodstream infections.

299
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:13,940
So before we get into the details specifically of the classic definition, let's talk about some basic definition details.

300
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:19,640
So like I said, we use the NHS under surveillance definitions.

301
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,750
So this basic information is chapter two from NHS one,

302
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:30,260
and they give you the basics that you will use for any of your other device associated infections.

303
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:34,790
So I know John Sweeney is coming in to talk about surgical site infections.

304
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,960
Those don't really have an infection window, period.

305
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:47,120
Some of these same principles will apply, but there will be some that don't apply as much to, I shouldn't say infection under period.

306
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:54,080
There's just some things that are slightly different for surgical site infections.

307
00:32:54,530 --> 00:33:01,840
But what I'm going to tell you today, you'll apply to catheter associated urinary tract infections, ventilators, social events, etc.

308
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:08,780
So first, there is what is referred to when you are doing HIV surveillance and infection window period.

309
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:17,330
So the infection window period, this is the seven days during which all infection criteria must be met.

310
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:23,630
So the surveillance definitions for your eyes have different components to it.

311
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:31,180
So you have to meet A, B, C and D or just A, it just depends on the particular definition.

312
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:37,280
But your infection window period, those are the seven days in which all infection criteria must be met.

313
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:45,380
This includes the date of the first positive diagnostic test, the three calendar days before, and the three calendar days after.

314
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:50,990
So when I say, Well, let's talk about the event date.

315
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:59,690
So the event date is the date. The first element used to meet the definition occurs in the infection window period.

316
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:06,740
So going back to the infection window period, when I say the first positive diagnostic test,

317
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:17,420
that could be a positive lab specimen, that could be an imaging test, that could be a procedure or an exam for labs surveillance.

318
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:23,630
We use positive blood cultures. Right. So a positive blood culture is going to set our infection window, period.

319
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,560
So if you look here, right here is a table.

320
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:34,000
And so you can see right here, this is when if we have our positive blood culture.

321
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:40,340
So today is September 9th. Let's use let's use September 6th.

322
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:50,060
So September six, do you have a blood positive blood culture? So you can look on this date, September 6th and then September 7th, eighth and ninth.

323
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:53,989
And then you can also go before September 5th, fourth and third.

324
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:56,090
So from September 3rd through the ninth,

325
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:02,510
you can look in the patient's chart and see if you meet every element you need in order to call that a classy.

326
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:08,000
All right. So and then talking about event date.

327
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,960
So right here you can see hospital days.

328
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:17,510
So here's hospital bay. One, two, three, four, five. Here are the two days before you get over here.

329
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:26,150
So when you are signing your event dates,

330
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:31,160
there are a couple of things that you need to think about and we'll talk about them on the next slide as well.

331
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:39,530
But every time something is considered present on admission, if it occurs on hospital day one or day two,

332
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:46,129
you can start calling things in health care acquired infection on hospital starting in hospital.

333
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:49,400
Day three. So.

334
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:56,180
Well, let's just go to the next slide. Okay.

335
00:35:56,870 --> 00:36:00,080
So right here, this is using a urine culture.

336
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:07,580
But in order to meet the Corti definition, you have to a little preview to Jeffs chart.

337
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:14,750
You have to have a urine culture with greater than 100,000 views of an organism.

338
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:25,759
So in this case, it's E coli right here. So this is setting our infection window period so we can look the three days before and the three days after.

339
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,040
So this urine culture occurred on hospital day four, right?

340
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:36,650
In order to meet the colony definition, all you need besides up.

341
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:43,310
So I should say a UTI, but all you need is to have a fever, right?

342
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:47,899
And you don't have to rule out a fever. Out it just if the patient has a fever, then you meet that definition.

343
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,940
You don't have to rule out other causes for the fever.

344
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:58,549
So you can see I can work these three days a day, five, six and seven, or I can look day one, two and three.

345
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:05,270
Since our positive culture was on day four, this patient had a fever on hospital, day two or three.

346
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:16,250
So if you go back to the event date, so the date that you say that the infection occurred is the date, the first element used to meet the definition.

347
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:20,630
So for the UTI, high definition is the urine culture and the fever.

348
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:25,850
So in this case, right, this fever occurred in the infection window period.

349
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:32,080
So this event to date would be hospital day two. Okay.

350
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:38,680
And when you look back up here in hospital, day two, this is considered present on admission.

351
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:45,730
So sorry to keep slipping back and forth, but in this case, yes,

352
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:52,360
this patient has a urinary tract infection but is not attributed to your institution that's considered present on admission,

353
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,340
whereas on the side urine culture on the same day.

354
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,400
But the patients make the fever the next day, the next two days.

355
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:07,180
So in this case, the event date is hospital day four and it becomes an HIV healthcare-acquired infection.

356
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:21,330
So an additional definition caveat is what we call an R, T or repeat infection timeframe.

357
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:26,970
This is a 14 day time frame during which no new infections of the same type are reported.

358
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,190
The date of your event is day one of the 14 day.

359
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:42,040
All righty. Any additional pathogens that are recovered during that are from the same type of infection are added to that event.

360
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:46,720
So let's look at that. Okay.

361
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:56,499
Let's look over here. So here's our urine culture and hospital date for the grayed out box again.

362
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,000
Is your infection window period or the the grade of cells here?

363
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:11,799
All right. The fever is on day five and day six. So again, going back to that date, you have a UTI on hospital day four.

364
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:19,540
So that is an HPI. Okay. And then this column here is just showing you your hour 18.

365
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:28,480
Okay. So 14 days here in which you cannot, from a surveillance perspective, call another urinary tract infection.

366
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:38,860
Okay. So in this case, you can see here is a urine culture on hospital day nine, which is in the right day six, where it didn't grow anything.

367
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:45,370
But then three days later, there's a urine culture with greater than 100 k staph aureus.

368
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:54,050
Even though there is a negative urine culture in here in this culture and hospital day 12 or in the R.A.,

369
00:39:54,070 --> 00:40:02,260
they know this staph aureus gets added back up to this UTI that occurred on hospital day four.

370
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:14,380
So when you're reporting this, this becomes a health care acquired infection and hospital day four with both e coli and staph aureus.

371
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:21,340
Okay, so no new infections with the same thing.

372
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:24,580
If they had a surgical site infection, that would be a separate.

373
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:32,560
Yeah, so surgical site infections. Yes. Because well, in the case of a UTI, they wouldn't be considered related.

374
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:38,889
Right. But the blood culture. So this is so this is a urine culture with a villa and a fever.

375
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:44,110
So that again, is a HPI with Klebsiella UTI.

376
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:51,370
And then there's a blood culture within the RHD. So that is not a primary BSI that are considered secondary.

377
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:58,150
Mm hmm. Okay. So just to alert you, you will actually be tested on this.

378
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:11,920
All right. Are there any questions on those couple of points?

379
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,270
I think this will all become a little clear. We're going to go through a number of examples.

380
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:22,030
I have just a few more slides to go over with clouds and then we'll talk about some examples and hopefully that well,

381
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:30,090
if it's feeling muddy, that's okay. We an infection prevention you don't just start and you do this.

382
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:36,670
I mean, Emily was doing surveillance over the summer and you are looking at the definition all the time.

383
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:41,350
We have access to those. We talk about them as departments.

384
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:45,570
We reach out to our hospital and epidemiologists say, what do you think?

385
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,690
Because this feels weird.

386
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:54,260
So but hopefully some of this will feel a little bit more clear, especially if this is the first time you're hearing about this.

387
00:41:55,330 --> 00:42:02,500
So so I just have a question. So it's confusing. If you call the day one is the day of admission.

388
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:15,790
Mm hmm. Right. So if they're admitted at 11:59 p.m. then and so then you would call that day one, even though it was only one minute before.

389
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:19,570
Mm hmm. Okay. Mm hmm. Yeah.

390
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,990
So that. Mm hmm.

391
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,180
Yeah. Yeah, that is actually.

392
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:34,900
So when we were talking about surveillance and I said changes in the definition can, you know, alter how you can sort of look at your rates over time.

393
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,190
So NHS then they publish new definitions every year, every January.

394
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:46,470
Um, and that is one of the things that has changed, has changed a handful of years ago.

395
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,230
But since I've been in the department it used to be 48 hours.

396
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:57,370
Okay. Then like the first 48 hours is considered present on admission, not the first to count.

397
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:03,460
Now it's calendar days with any day, any part of the first day being a calendar day.

398
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:15,880
So, yes. So for the like first case on the last slide where you have like a positive one, if there was a different species,

399
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:22,510
even because it's like a different culture, like would it still be counted as like one each check air or.

400
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:25,800
No, they have to be the same. They have to be matching organisms.

401
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:37,900
Okay. So even if you had Klebsiella and Candida or yeast, you would have to evaluate for a bloodstream infection.

402
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:41,290
They have to be matching. Okay. And in it.

403
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:48,460
Yeah. So, um, that's not to confuse things.

404
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:56,560
It's not 100% always the case sometimes with surgical site infections like intra abdominal infection.

405
00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:06,430
The definition may say you have to have a blood culture with at least one what is referred to as an MBA or a mucosal barrier organism,

406
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:17,080
which we'll talk about in a little bit. So but in terms of calling a bloodstream infection secondary, that organisms have to match completely.

407
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,590
All right. So let's talk about the classic definition.

408
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:32,899
So we kind of just talked about this, but in order to call and AI for our device associated infections,

409
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:38,090
the patient must be admitted for greater than two calendar days with the day of admission being day one.

410
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,840
So again, any if the date of admission.

411
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:51,440
So the other thing I want to mention about this is when you were doing your HIIT surveillance admission to an inpatient unit, not admission to the ED.

412
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:58,190
So a lot of times when you're looking at the patient's bed trace and where they've been in the institution,

413
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:03,950
if they come in through your emergency department and we all know hospitals are busy,

414
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:07,610
sometimes patients stay in the emergency department for over a day.

415
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:12,830
That does not count. That is not considered admission.

416
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:20,180
It's once they get to an inpatient unit, so they get to an inpatient unit at 11:55 p.m., that's hospital day one.

417
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:32,780
Right. So for example, if I came in to the emergency department, let's say I came in on Wednesday,

418
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:38,690
I came in like in the evening, but I didn't get an inpatient bed until last night.

419
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:43,260
Right. So that was my hospital day one. Today is my day, too.

420
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:51,730
Tomorrow is the first day that I could be evaluated for any device associated with.

421
00:45:52,340 --> 00:46:00,740
So a Clapton call your VA. So the infection must not be present on admission.

422
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:03,020
So when you are doing your surveillance,

423
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:12,170
it's really important to don't just assume so on your on your report within however you get your data and your micro report,

424
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:19,730
if you see a positive blood culture that pops up today, make sure you go back and look in that patient's chart to see if there were any prior to that.

425
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:23,060
Right. So our system is set up to pull blood cultures.

426
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,350
If the patient has been admitted for greater than two calendar days and they have a centralized.

427
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:35,210
Right, but it doesn't it doesn't look and say, oh, this patient has a blood culture today.

428
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:38,450
They also had one two days ago when they were in the ED.

429
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:47,510
So it's really important to go back and look and make sure there is nothing brewing before you start your calendar.

430
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:56,360
Day three The patient must have a central line that terminates at or close to the heart and or in one of the great vessels.

431
00:46:56,810 --> 00:47:00,740
It also must be accessed or inserted during the hospitalization.

432
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,439
So if you remember from hospital, EPI, the previous hospital, every class, if you were in that class,

433
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,800
they brought chest or the chest and B aside baby and showed you different types of lines.

434
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:21,229
So something called the pick line, peripherally inserted central catheter, something called a broken back or a Hickman,

435
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:27,410
which is a tunnel line, ports, those implanted lines, those are all centralized.

436
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:31,399
But when I say they must be accessed or inserted during the hospitalization.

437
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:37,340
So ports, right. Those are completely under the skin. Some patients have done it.

438
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:41,450
Maybe they had chemotherapy treatment and they haven't had them removed yet.

439
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:51,620
Okay. If is not if they have a port but is not accessed so they are not doing anything with it, you can't have that as a central line.

440
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:58,010
So it's really important if your patient especially with port to make sure that has been accessed.

441
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:06,559
Um, speaking of central lines, they must be in place for greater than two calendar days with the day of line placement considered at day one.

442
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:13,010
So again, same thing if the patient goes down to the interventional radiology suite,

443
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:19,880
has a pick line placed at 11:45 p.m., that's hospital day one or that's central line day one.

444
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:26,430
And so then the next day would be day two. And then the following day is when you could start there.

445
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:29,960
Any positive blood cultures they could be considered a collapsing.

446
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:37,610
The other thing was centralized. They must be in place at the time of the of the clouds event.

447
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:41,570
So that date of your event or the day before.

448
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:53,240
Okay. So if I have a central line, um, let's say I had a central line and it was removed on Wednesday and I had a positive blood culture today.

449
00:48:54,320 --> 00:49:01,220
That line was removed too far, too many days ago to be considered related to that positive blood culture.

450
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:06,020
But if my central line was removed yesterday and I had a positive blood culture today,

451
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:10,580
that you can use that central line to meet your classic definition.

452
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:18,920
Again, we have there are lots of examples with all these different scenarios, so we'll get to do them in a second.

453
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:25,070
A couple other things about clauses. So fabs, these are not counted.

454
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:29,270
So we track them, but we do. They are not counted in our rate.

455
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,970
So we also submit them to nature sun but they are not counted in rates when patients are

456
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:39,410
at low extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or have a vata ventricular assist device.

457
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:47,090
So more patients. So again, another thing that has changed in the definition, these were just pulled out.

458
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:56,600
I don't remember exactly when maybe within the last 5 to 7 years, but prior to that, patients who had collapses were counted in our rate.

459
00:49:56,630 --> 00:50:01,850
So if you've ever seen that closed circuit, there are lots of tubes, lots of access points.

460
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:08,300
The other thing about, well, patients, temperatures are regulated, so they're kept.

461
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:15,650
The goal is to keep them at a certain temperature. So it's really hard to actually get a true assessment of what's happening with these patients.

462
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:21,799
Group B Streptococcus from a blood culture in the first six days of life in our

463
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,610
Neonates is not considered a classic that's considered maternally acquired.

464
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:32,120
So that's the one thing that has a longer window of not being an H II.

465
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:38,270
And then there are some organisms that can't be used to meet any and they just end definition, Black surmises.

466
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:40,490
Still plasma cuts to the oldies, etc.,

467
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:48,590
and then collapses associated with an infection at another site is considered and a secondary BSI and those are not reported.

468
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:53,360
So to sum all that up, it's a lot of information.

469
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,990
The classic chapter I think is like 40 some pages long. It's really long.

470
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:06,080
Lots of details. Um, the primary clarity is identified by ruling out all non blood sites as the source of the infection.

471
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:13,970
So when you're doing your surveillance, you want to look at the chart and see if you can meet any other of the NHS and surveillance definitions.

472
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:22,400
You want to rule out pneumonia, you want to rule out intra abdominal infections, you want to rule out um, I can't think of another one.

473
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:27,770
Endocarditis. You want to rule all those things out before you say, yep, this is a primary classic.

474
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:37,129
You do your darnedest to rule these out. All right, so here is the first cloud.

475
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:42,110
By definition, this is called LCB one laboratory confirmed bloodstream infection.

476
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:46,850
So this is one. So again, your patient's been here for more than two calendar days.

477
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:53,540
They've had a central line in place for more than two calendar days. And now they have a recognized pathogen from one or more blood cultures.

478
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:59,240
And that organism, cultured from the blood, is not related to an infection at another site.

479
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:06,650
So, for example, Sally has a central line that's growing very vancomycin resistant enterococcus from two blood cultures.

480
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:12,710
She also has a liver abscess that was recently aspirated and found to have numerous to be very.

481
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,780
Oh. Okay.

482
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:28,520
So, Sally. So pretend this bottom thing is not there.

483
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:34,090
So Sally has a central line growing the area from two blood cultures.

484
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,390
Right? So initially, I mean, enterococcus.

485
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:42,530
Yeah, that's might be a classic, but then you find out this additional piece of information.

486
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:48,440
And so basically because there's a liver abscess and she has a blood culture,

487
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:53,570
these blood cultures would be considered considered secondary to this infection there.

488
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:02,740
Um. The next definition. Um.

489
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:07,570
Definition two. So the patient has at least one of the following.

490
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:14,749
The patient has a fever. So, again, remember I said, you want to have those details?

491
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:18,040
So it's not just a fever. It's not just physician documentation of a fever.

492
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:23,380
You want to actually look and see, does the patient have a fever of greater than 38 degrees?

493
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:32,530
Or does the patient have chills or hypertension? And the organism is cultured in the blood is not related to an infection at another site.

494
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,770
And here is the third piece to this one.

495
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:44,470
There is a skin contaminant growing from two or more blood cultures drawn on separate occasions, the same when I say separate occasions.

496
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:47,940
Those blood cultures have to be on the same day or consecutive days.

497
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:51,130
So if there's a day in between, it doesn't meet this definition.

498
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:56,620
So when I say skin contaminants, these are common commensal organisms commonly found on the skin.

499
00:53:56,620 --> 00:54:05,530
So Staphylococcus epidermidis bacillus species virulence group strep throat is propionibacterium.

500
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:11,110
So looking at this definition compared to LCB one.

501
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:15,700
Why do you think LCB too has additional requirements?

502
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:25,950
Why do you think you have to have so if you remember back here.

503
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:31,350
LC You buy one or. LCB One you don't it doesn't tell you the patient has to have any symptoms, right?

504
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:36,660
You just have to have the positive blood culture and you have to make sure it's not related to an infection at another site.

505
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:46,260
But now we go down here and we have we need to blood cultures that are growing as common commensal or a skin contaminant organism.

506
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:53,400
And now we also have to have the patient has to have some one of those three symptoms.

507
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:01,440
Yeah. Is that because it's like an infection of a commensal and not like enterococcus?

508
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:11,430
Yeah. So these skin organisms, you want to make sure it's a true infection because throughout the process of drying the blood,

509
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:15,389
something could get contaminated. If something's not disinfected appropriately.

510
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:20,040
Maybe it has the patient's skin, Flora. On the hub where you're drawing the blood from.

511
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:28,050
And so you want to make having those two blood cultures that helps you feel like this is a true infection.

512
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:34,170
Obviously, if the same person is drawing the blood, maybe their technique is bad and they're contaminating things.

513
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:42,570
So that's also why you want the symptom piece, because if the patient truly does have an infection bill, exhibit symptoms with these organisms.

514
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:51,640
All right. And then finally, there is what is referred to a mucosal barrier injury definition.

515
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:57,040
So again, another example of how definitions change over time.

516
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:59,740
These historically were always included in our rates.

517
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:10,930
They are no longer again, they're reported to an HSN, but they are not counted in our rates because they really are not preventable in every case.

518
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:21,430
So this mucosal barrier injury definition was developed and recognized as a need for a more specific cloudy definition in our oncology patient,

519
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:29,709
in our oncology patients. So what was found when the when the CDC was looking at all of the data submitted to nature,

520
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:38,020
said they were seeing a lot of mis classifications of clauses that were likely resulting from translocation of intestinal organisms.

521
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:40,740
And so in turn that was inflating clappy rates.

522
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:49,960
These patients that you can use the mucosal barrier injury definition on primarily are our oncology patients.

523
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:57,310
And so when you're receiving chemotherapy or have had a bone marrow transplant, your gut can get leaky.

524
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:02,920
And so those organisms can leak, which is called translocation sort of pass through into the bloodstream infection.

525
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:08,980
Obviously, the same thing can happen with bacteria commonly found in the mouth.

526
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:16,930
So that GI type organisms and bacteria commonly found in the mouth are organisms

527
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:25,329
that could be used for the MBI definition because patients also have chemotherapy,

528
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:29,740
patients can get mucositis, which is like these pretty massive sores in their mouth.

529
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:38,200
So again, this definition was developed for patients with what is referred to as a mucosal barrier injury,

530
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:45,400
a high risk for translocation of intestinal organisms or oral or oral organisms as well.

531
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:51,890
So this is what the definition looks like. This looks overwhelming.

532
00:57:52,070 --> 00:58:00,980
But if you break it down, it's actually fairly similar to those LCB, A1 and LCB A2 that we just looked at.

533
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:09,050
So for mucosal barrier injury, LCB, A1, the patient has at least one organism growing with an intestinal organism,

534
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:13,430
with an intestinal organism and no other organisms isolated.

535
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:19,399
And the patient is a stem cell transplant or bone marrow transplant patient within the last year with one

536
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:26,120
of the following grade three or grade four graft versus host disease of their in tests of their GI tract,

537
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:29,080
which is when they get sores on their,

538
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:36,620
in their GI tract and that can lead to translocation of the bacteria or greater than one liter of diarrhea in a 24 hour period.

539
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:43,729
Or if the patient is not a bone marrow transplant patient, if the patient's neutropenic,

540
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:50,060
meaning their white blood cell count, is less than 500 on two separate days within that seven day infection window period,

541
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:58,940
you could also meet the MBI definition so that by definition for LCB, A2,

542
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:04,309
again you have to have two positive blood cultures growing only virulence group strep.

543
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:11,150
So those are your oral bacteria. And then these two fields are the same.

544
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:20,640
So the bone marrow transplant piece with one of these or neutropenia and for both the bloodstream infections and TIA and aliya,

545
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:26,120
there is a definition for patients under the age of one. But we're not going to talk about that today.

546
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:30,440
All right. I know it's clear as mud, but let's practice.

547
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,060
All right. Sarah presents to the E.D. after a fall.

548
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:39,950
She's admitted for further workup on admission. A peripheral I.V. is inserted.

549
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:44,329
The night of her admission, she develops a fever and blood cultures are ordered to blood.

550
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:49,040
Cultures grow staph aureus. So staph aureus is considered a pathogen.

551
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:54,859
It's not considered a common commensal. And when we're doing going through these cases, everything you need to know.

552
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:59,120
I'm not trying to trick you. So there's no other information that you that you really need.

553
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:04,219
If there is something, I give it to you. So do Sara have a clap?

554
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:07,580
See how many people say yes?

555
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:13,910
How many people say no? All right, Morgan, why not?

556
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:18,500
Because it wasn't great in the two days. Yeah, that's one reason.

557
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:21,890
Another reason she has no central line. Yeah, exactly.

558
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:27,190
Yeah. So here's our table. Hustle day one.

559
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:31,480
Peripheral I.V. is inserted. Blood cultures are done on that day.

560
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:35,680
So Sarah does not have a classy, no central line. Not intended for greater than two calendar days.

561
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:39,760
Great job. All right.

562
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:47,650
Case study two. William has admitted on Tuesday to the cardiovascular ICU following a cardiac bypass surgery or cabbage.

563
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:51,370
A temporary central line is inserted in the O.R. on Thursday.

564
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:57,040
He develops a rising white blood cell count. On that day, his line is removed and blood cultures are sent.

565
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:01,090
His surgical site is well healing, no redness or purulent.

566
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:07,809
And that blood culture that was sent on Thursday is comes back.

567
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:11,230
You get the result. It's growing. Serratia. Does William have a collapsing?

568
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:18,900
How many who says yes? Who said no.

569
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:26,900
So now anybody who is not sure this is complicated.

570
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:30,750
All right. So let's go through it step by step. Okay.

571
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:34,680
William is Mitt is admitted on Tuesday, right? Hospital day one.

572
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,210
Wednesday is hospital day two. Thursday is hospital day three.

573
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:44,280
Okay, so here's our admission days.

574
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:48,440
He has his line admitted or inserted on Tuesday, right?

575
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:54,860
Here's Tuesday. He still has it Wednesday. And it's on Thursday.

576
01:01:54,870 --> 01:02:02,190
That's when his white blood cells count. They pull the line on this day, right on our third day, the same day they do blood cultures.

577
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:08,560
Okay. There there's no infections anywhere else. There's blood culture on day three.

578
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:14,070
So day three of his central line, day three of admission is growing Serratia, which is a pathogen.

579
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:19,260
So what you're looking at is the LC by one definition.

580
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:27,200
So going through that, how many people think William has a classic there?

581
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:31,070
Anyone who doesn't. Right. Right there.

582
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:36,540
Correct. So here's our little table that we can put together to look at our infection window period.

583
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:42,989
So even though his central line is removed, if you remember, you can still call it classy.

584
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:47,280
If a central line was removed on the day of the positive blood cultures or the day before,

585
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,350
as long as it had been in place prior to that for greater than two calendar days.

586
01:02:53,370 --> 01:03:00,390
So yes, William does have a classy meaning the LCB one definition.

587
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:06,480
All right. Tim has been in the thick you for 30 days following a liver transplant.

588
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:09,990
He has a tunneled central line that's been in place since his operation.

589
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:15,050
His vitals are stable. He's got a normal white blood cell count, blood pressure, temperature, everything.

590
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:23,580
He's ready to leave the ICU and go to the general care floor in the afternoon before his transfer, Tim becomes hypertensive and less alert.

591
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:27,329
The team removes the line and orders blood cultures to blood cultures.

592
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:30,590
Come back with Enterococcus. Does Tim have a cloud?

593
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:38,020
Who says yes? Who says no?

594
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:42,500
Who is an usher? Okay.

595
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:48,170
So going through this one, has Tim been in the hospital for greater than two calendar days?

596
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:54,140
Yes. Has he had a central line in place for greater than two calendar days?

597
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:57,980
Yes. Enterococcus is a pathogen.

598
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:07,450
It's not a common commensal. So what do you need to meet the LCB A1 definition?

599
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:10,730
Do you need any other information? Everything you need to know is right here.

600
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:14,980
Right. So in this case,

601
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:24,070
yes Tim has a classy I'll severe one he's been admitted for greater than two calendar days has a central line place no infection out the other side.

602
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:33,580
However, let's instead of enterococcus, let's say that tem grew staph epidermidis.

603
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:37,360
So let me go back up here. So same thing.

604
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:43,690
But in the psyche of the surgical ICU for 30 days at a time, old central line in place.

605
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:49,930
His vitals are stable when he's getting ready to transfer to the general care floor.

606
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:57,700
However, then he becomes hypertensive and less alert. Okay, now, instead of two blood cultures coming back with enterococcus,

607
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:01,810
two blood cultures are coming back with stuff like with the Staphylococcus epidermidis.

608
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:06,310
So staph AP is a common commensal. Right.

609
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:10,930
So hint hint. Think about LCB severe the HCV i2 definition.

610
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,800
Does Tim have a cloud z? Who says yes?

611
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:24,370
He says no. It was not sure.

612
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:31,120
All right, Chelsea, I think you said yes. Why did you say yes? Because he's hypertensive.

613
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:36,790
So that means the first requirement and they did more than two blood culture or they did two blood cultures and it was positive.

614
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:41,350
I know. Yeah, exactly. So, again, here's our little table.

615
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:47,589
He's been in the hospital for greater than two calendar days. Had a central line in place for greater than two calendar days.

616
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:52,239
He has those two blood cultures that were drawn on the same day. Growing staff epi.

617
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:56,880
And he became hypertensive. So, yes, this is like, see?

618
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:02,560
All right. Nancy, admit to the general medicine floor.

619
01:06:02,570 --> 01:06:10,120
I'm on May 10th for chest pain. On May 11th, her temporary central line and fully catheter are place.

620
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:13,509
Sorry, that should say, please. Nancy is not looking well.

621
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:16,540
She has a fever. Chills. Blood and urine cultures are sent.

622
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:22,430
Her blood culture grows. And as I said, methicillin, sensitive staph aureus, her urine culture tonight.

623
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:27,340
What anything does Nancy have a classy. This is.

624
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:30,430
Yes, this is.

625
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:33,880
No. Yeah. Morgan why not?

626
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:37,450
Doesn't have to be a longer. Exactly.

627
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:39,520
Yeah. The central line is not in place long enough.

628
01:06:43,830 --> 01:06:50,700
So these blood cultures, in terms of a central line perspective, they were drawn on data of her central line.

629
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:59,130
And it has to be drawn on at least day three. So she was admitted long enough to the hospital, just didn't have her central life.

630
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:08,520
April is transferred from an outside facility to 60 due to acute decompensation on August 15th.

631
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:12,840
She also has leukemia and a Hickman, which is a tunneled central line.

632
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:17,610
She's been at that. She had been at the outside facility since August 1st,

633
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:24,900
and her central line was inserted on August 2nd when she arrived at our institution from the outside facility.

634
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:29,460
On August 15th, cultures are ordered by the medical team.

635
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:35,790
Her blood culture is growing citrus back to her urine and respiratory cultures are no growth.

636
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:50,030
Her. She is a cancer patient so her absolute neutrophil count her and see and on the 13th so at the outside hospital was 1008 16.

637
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:54,600
It dropped to 402 308 17.

638
01:07:54,690 --> 01:08:07,680
Does April have a classy. So, yes.

639
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,270
Who says no? Who wants to talk about this one?

640
01:08:14,330 --> 01:08:19,110
All right. Let's talk about it. Okay.

641
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:26,270
So here's a snapshot of what's going on with April.

642
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:32,810
So here she is. So you can see I put negative one or two and she got the outside hospital.

643
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:37,010
Okay. She has a centralized, centralized, centralized.

644
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:40,310
No big deal. Here's the day she admits to us.

645
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:45,020
Okay, so this is hospital day one for us.

646
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:54,680
She has a central line in place. Cultures are ordered, her blood cultures positive for syndrome actor on hospital day two.

647
01:08:54,680 --> 01:09:03,310
And so here's if you think about this this is our, this is our, um, this is what setting our infection window period, right?

648
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:16,370
So we can look the three days before and the three days after her and is 400 and and then hospital day three for

649
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:24,260
us it's 300 something has April been at our institution long enough to have a classic attributed to our facility?

650
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:32,450
Now, when you look at this, though, does she meet any of the definitions we just talked about?

651
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:40,970
Which one? Hayley Oh yeah, the MBI definition.

652
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:49,819
So technically this patient would meet the MBI definition and the first MBI definition because

653
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:55,430
Sidra factor is a GI organism and she's neutropenic within that infection window period.

654
01:09:55,430 --> 01:10:00,200
But it would be attributed. It would be attributed back to the previous hospital hours.

655
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:06,350
So we would not consider this an infection.

656
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:11,340
We would say, nope, not ours. All right.

657
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,690
Sam has been in trauma burn following a motor vehicle crash for two weeks.

658
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:19,140
A temporary central line was inserted four days ago.

659
01:10:19,170 --> 01:10:26,010
He's confused one night. And so the team orders pan culturing blood, urine, respiratory cultures, urine and respiratory cultures come back negative.

660
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:31,950
Only one blood culture is positive. Four for mersa two Sam have a cloudy.

661
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,470
As Marcel a common commensal? Nope. It's a pathogen.

662
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:43,730
Who says yes? We said no.

663
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:48,110
All right. Good job. Yeah, because I'll see. Buy one.

664
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,870
All right. Let's talk about Sam again. Sam is still in trauma burn.

665
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,779
He had his temporary central line removed the day after.

666
01:10:56,780 --> 01:11:01,490
His blood culture was positive for Mersa because of the infection, and also it wasn't functioning properly.

667
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:08,330
The same day he had a pipeline inserted, nine days later he spikes a fever and the team again orders pan culturing.

668
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:11,690
The only positive culture is a blood culture that grows enterococcus.

669
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:18,810
Do Sam have another cloudy? Yes.

670
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:26,410
Who says yes? Who says no? Now, what would you do in this case?

671
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:34,420
I'm like, What would you do with that? Culture with enterococcus trying to attribute it to a different.

672
01:11:36,670 --> 01:11:40,090
Yeah, but it's not attributed to any other site. Oh, yeah.

673
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:46,270
But what do you. What do you do? You have another classic you added to the person.

674
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:52,030
Exactly. So this is an example of that RTT that repeat infection time frame.

675
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:56,050
Right. So here is his family with Martha.

676
01:11:56,890 --> 01:12:01,330
Right. Day 14. And remember that it starts when you have that infection.

677
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:07,000
That's day one of your repeat infection timeframe and you can go three, four through day 14.

678
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:14,980
So from that day of that first infection, you have 13 more days. Any positive blood cultures, that organism gets put back up there.

679
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,720
So this so Sam, in this case does not have another cloudy.

680
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:24,550
He has a cloudy and hospital day 14 with both MRSA and Enterococcus.

681
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:33,160
All right. Jack has been on five B for four days following surgery.

682
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:38,110
He had a central line inserted yesterday. Today, he had chills and was found to be febrile.

683
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:41,350
Blood and urine cultures were sent today. His urine culture was no growth.

684
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:46,080
But culture one group staff epi blood culture to do not grow anything.

685
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:49,389
Does Jack have a collapsing? Anybody think?

686
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:55,140
Yes. Who says no? Great job.

687
01:12:55,150 --> 01:13:00,150
Someone tell me why not? There are a couple of reasons.

688
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:03,840
The central one. Yeah. Perfect.

689
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:08,460
You know, and because stuff epidermidis is a problem. Exactly.

690
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:12,239
Yeah. So Jack's central.

691
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:17,910
I was on place for more than two days, and he just has that one possible culture with that common well.

692
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:29,430
The one thing I also want to say, as we're doing these cases, um, when you're doing your surveillance, make sure you are sticking to your definitions.

693
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:35,250
Okay. As you're reading charts, you're going to see providers documenting this patient had this infection.

694
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:39,780
This patient had that infection. Infection prevention.

695
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:43,620
Surveillance is different than clinical surveillance.

696
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:52,680
So what our providers are seeing, their job is to look at the individual and to treat the individual based on their specific situation.

697
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:58,790
Okay. But we have the NHS on definitions to give us a standard.

698
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:08,070
So it's not uncommon that what you are doing, what you are going to call a positive culture, may be different than what a provider is saying.

699
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:13,110
Okay. But that is part of infection prevention, as you have to be confident in what you're doing.

700
01:14:13,410 --> 01:14:21,000
If you're not sure. Rely hopefully you have someone that you can run something by others in the department,

701
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:27,210
your medical directors, a provider you work closely with if you're unsure.

702
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:37,950
Okay, but stick to your guns. It's okay that HIV surveillance and infection prevention surveillance differs from clinical than a clinical diagnosis.

703
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:47,969
Right. Is not unusual. And so just be confident in your definition so that if it you get questioned about it by anybody you're working with,

704
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:54,390
by the provider, for example, that you can explain why you called something the way you did.

705
01:14:55,110 --> 01:15:02,610
Okay. When I've done this lecture before, the previous instructor is that I wouldn't call that collapsing.

706
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:08,230
Right. And we use that as a good example of why even just based on this little bit of information,

707
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:11,910
a clinical decision and clinical diagnosis is going to differ.

708
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:15,809
But you have to be confident. You have to be confident. Nope. I'm sticking to my definition.

709
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:19,680
This is what it is. Right. All right. So let's move on to Jill.

710
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,570
Jill had cardiac surgery and is now on the cardiovascular unit.

711
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:28,620
She has an arterial line and officially her incision is red and pus starts draining.

712
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:34,200
Cultures are taken and it's positive for MRSA, blood and urine cultures were sent in.

713
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:40,320
Both cultures come back positive for MRSA. Does Jill have a classy.

714
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:52,830
So I know we didn't talk about surgical site infections, not to give any spoilers for the next couple of hours,

715
01:15:54,840 --> 01:16:02,910
but because her incision has purulent, has pus and is positive for me to say and then has a blood culture.

716
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:07,380
This patient meets the surgical site infection definition.

717
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:12,810
So I'll tell you that. So does Jill have a classy what would you call this?

718
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:19,170
The secondary. Secondary? Yep. Perfect. Yep.

719
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:25,980
All right, uh, have a few more minutes.

720
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:30,450
Let me see. Here, let me peek at my little cheat sheet here and see.

721
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:36,390
All right, we might be able to get through.

722
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:50,330
I'm actually going to skip this one. You have all of these with the answers in your slide deck so you can take a look.

723
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:51,440
Let's go on to Jerome.

724
01:16:52,910 --> 01:16:59,540
So Jerome admits to the general medicine floor on May ten for dehydration and malnutrition due to his underlying chronic medical issue.

725
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:03,950
On 511, he has a temporary central line that's placed on 515.

726
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:07,640
Jerome is not feeling well. He has a fever. 38.3 That's documented in the chart.

727
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:13,549
His central line is taken out. Blood cultures and urine cultures are sent, his blood cultures growing equally.

728
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:17,900
His urine culture is growing greater than 100 k e coli. Does Jerome have a cloudy.

729
01:17:21,190 --> 01:17:24,610
Anybody think? Yes. Anybody think?

730
01:17:24,610 --> 01:17:28,120
No. Anybody? Not sure.

731
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:34,090
All right. We didn't talk about the high definition, did we? So, again, spoiler alert.

732
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:38,170
Spoiler alert. Okay. So let's talk about this.

733
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:52,310
So the other high definition is a urine culture of greater than 100 K Uh, C okay, greater than 100 K And A fever.

734
01:17:53,830 --> 01:17:56,979
Doesn't matter what the fever is for, right? The fever.

735
01:17:56,980 --> 01:18:00,780
The fever. Maybe there's no air conditioning and it's like 100 degrees.

736
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:04,420
And Peter has a fever. It doesn't matter, right? It's a fever.

737
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:09,490
Um, the patient. I didn't say the patient had a foley.

738
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:15,190
Right. But when you're calling something, if you're looking to call a blood culture secondary to something,

739
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:18,870
it doesn't have to be another like device associated infection.

740
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,480
Right. It can just it can be secondary to a UTI.

741
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:31,090
You can try to meet that UTI definition. So in this case, has Jerome been at the hospital long enough?

742
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:36,760
Has he had the central line long enough? Yes.

743
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:43,569
All right. He has a fever, right? I told you 38.3 on the previous slide, his central line removed.

744
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:49,450
But that's okay. It's the day of the positive culture. Okay, so so far, I mean, I don't really need the fever, right?

745
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:56,950
So right now is looking like maybe it's a classic, but that I see with positive urine culture with the fever.

746
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,980
So right there, bam. Done. No, thank you. Now to clap.

747
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:07,450
See this patient has a UTI with equalized that positive blood culture is secondary.

748
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:15,510
All right, let's make it just a tad bit trickier.

749
01:19:16,350 --> 01:19:23,009
So on May 16th, Durham has additional positive lab results as follows He has a blood culture with equalizing yeast,

750
01:19:23,010 --> 01:19:27,690
and he has another urine culture with greater than 100,000 E.coli.

751
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:33,120
So on the next day, another urine culture.

752
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:50,110
And a blood culture with equalizing yeast. So the UTI definition yeast cannot be used as an organism to meet the high definition.

753
01:19:50,890 --> 01:20:00,250
Okay, so you remember earlier when we were talking about those basic definition pieces and we talked about the blood culture has to be matching,

754
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:05,320
right? So it's matching with E.coli, but what about that yeast? What do you think you need to do with that?

755
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:11,840
I mean, it tells you right there.

756
01:20:12,050 --> 01:20:15,850
Yeah, we have to evaluate at least four clubs.

757
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:20,540
Okay. So in this case, we go back up here.

758
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:27,079
So on the next day, right, we have a another within the infection window period as well.

759
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:30,740
But we have another urine culture with equally by culture with equal agonist.

760
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:43,220
Suddenly Jerome has a UTI on 515 with equal ly and on 516 he has a a classic with yeast.

761
01:20:43,850 --> 01:20:49,940
So he has two eyes. All right, baby.

762
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:52,220
Smith was born on August 1st at 32 weeks.

763
01:20:53,330 --> 01:20:59,670
Baby Smith is intubated, has an umbilical artery catheter placed and was admitted to the neonatal ICU on August 5th.

764
01:20:59,690 --> 01:21:03,590
Baby Smith has a positive blood culture with Group B Strep. Does Baby Smith have a classic?

765
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:11,179
Why not? Just because it could be strep needs.

766
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:21,770
Six days. Yeah. Perfect. Good job. So the other thing about neonates, you may remember we've talked about central lines are venous catheters.

767
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:25,490
The umbilical artery catheter also counts as a central line.

768
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:33,650
So it's one of the few arterial catheters that count as a central line, the other being a pulmonary AP line.

769
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:42,020
All right. Let me see a peek at which last one I want to do.

770
01:21:49,190 --> 01:21:56,700
Okay. All right, let's do let's do this one and then the first half of the other one.

771
01:21:57,060 --> 01:22:00,330
So Tony has been in the pediatric cardiac ICU for two months.

772
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:05,640
He went to the O.R. for cardiac surgery on day four of his admission and had a femoral central line placed.

773
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:11,580
Tony was diagnosed with pneumonia three days ago after a respiratory culture was positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

774
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:15,390
Yesterday, Tony had a central line removed and a new pick line placed.

775
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:20,070
Today he was hypertensive and tachycardic, so cultures were ordered blood and urine.

776
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:23,790
His blood culture from a peripheral I.V. was positive for pseudomonas.

777
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:33,740
Just Tony have a cloudy. So I'm going to talk about this one because I threw a couple little things that I want to point out.

778
01:22:34,670 --> 01:22:37,920
One, I mentioned that blood cultures from a peripheral I.V.

779
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:42,110
It doesn't matter what type of line the blood culture was positive from.

780
01:22:42,410 --> 01:22:47,270
If the patient has a central line and a peripheral line is, yeah, peripheral culture is positive.

781
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:52,160
You would still evaluate that for the central line associated bloodstream infection.

782
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:57,230
Right. So the blood cultures from a peripheral I.V., from a central line, from an arterial line,

783
01:22:57,710 --> 01:23:02,690
any positive blood culture you evaluate for a central line or for collapsing.

784
01:23:05,570 --> 01:23:10,190
And then let's talk about. So I said right here was diagnosed with pneumonia.

785
01:23:10,310 --> 01:23:17,610
That's a clinical diagnosis. So and the respiratory culture is positive with pseudomonas.

786
01:23:17,630 --> 01:23:22,550
So what do you need to do? Do you just say, oh, it's secondary to pneumonia?

787
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:33,240
No. Right. You need to look at the chart. You need to now pull up the pneumonia definition and see if you can meet that.

788
01:23:33,990 --> 01:23:38,040
That's how you want to take this. She did pneumonia available.

789
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:45,820
The real is also the poor thing. All right. So to be honest, you need more information for this, right?

790
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:49,200
So because you don't have the pneumonia surveillance in front of you.

791
01:23:51,390 --> 01:24:01,120
And to sum it up, technically, the information that I put here, the patient doesn't meet a pneumonia definition because of right here.

792
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:04,830
See there there is documentation. That provider said the patient has a fever.

793
01:24:04,830 --> 01:24:11,820
But when I look in the chart, I don't see any fever. The max temperature is 37.9 and for NHS and it's greater than 38.

794
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:20,020
So technically in this case, this is a good example where the providers are saying the patient has a pneumonia.

795
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:28,290
This is not a cloud. Right. But you're going to use your definition and you're going to say, okay, yep, means the chest x rays.

796
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:33,959
But then the next step is to have a fever or a change in white blood cells.

797
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:37,800
And the patient didn't have that. Right. So I don't meet the pneumonia definition.

798
01:24:38,070 --> 01:24:48,720
This is a cloud, unfortunately. Okay. So you are going to stick to your definition here and be confident and and go with that.

799
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:56,350
So, yes, Tony has a clarity in the situation.

800
01:24:57,190 --> 01:25:01,630
So even though his central line was switched over, he still had a central line.

801
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:07,060
All right. And then the first I'm just going to do the first part of this one and then I'll be done.

802
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:12,880
Luna admitted on September 1st she has important place from her cancer treatment and bone marrow transplant in June.

803
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:18,850
On day three of admissions, she spoke to fever and blood. Cultures were drawn via peripheral stick and positive first attractor.

804
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:22,780
Her port is accessed on day four of admission. Does I have a collapsing?

805
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:33,120
Yes. So now. Yeah.

806
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:38,530
Matthew Weiner. No access to it. Exactly. So we actually had the port in place.

807
01:25:38,890 --> 01:25:43,629
But if you remember, I said it has to be accessed or inserted during that admission.

808
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:47,650
So it was but not before the blood cultures were drawn. All right.

809
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,470
Does any there are a couple more examples. But does anyone have any questions for me?

810
01:25:54,800 --> 01:26:00,880
Yeah. For the port. Does it have to be accessed for a certain amount of time before?

811
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:13,450
For those two calendar days. Anyone else might email addresses on their first slide, so feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

812
01:26:14,530 --> 01:26:17,820
I'd be happy to chat and thank you all.

813
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:26,830
These are really formative. You're going to take a while break.

814
01:26:27,790 --> 01:26:33,760
So in about 10 minutes and.

815
01:26:48,550 --> 01:27:04,010
