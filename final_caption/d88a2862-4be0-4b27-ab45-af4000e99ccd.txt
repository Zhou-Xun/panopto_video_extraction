1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,350
I mean, it sounds like. It's like that giant voice.

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:16,170
Yeah. I mean, you just you make you make sense.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,680
Everyone was like. Like they would have sounded.

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,750
He was like, someone I know.

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,620
Yeah. I was like, let me see. I don't know.

6
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:38,490
I just don't know. Yeah. Yeah.

7
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:45,500
I thought that was ridiculous. But that, like, I took his class things.

8
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,880
I didn't know the whole story. He's like.

9
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:59,520
Yeah. So even actor, you know, I didn't know that it was that big.

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,630
I told my neighbor, like, Oh, oh, this is like, the times did not want to work with me.

11
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,390
How's everybody doing? I haven't seen you in a couple of weeks. I'm fine, thank you.

12
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,850
I have stopped coughing up my lungs. Right. I hope everybody else is healthy.

13
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,799
Today we are going to do a class on implementation.

14
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:31,110
And I have a very special guest for us, my doctoral student and the manager of the Smoke Free Environment Law Project at the University of Michigan.

15
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:38,600
Karen, kiss me. The reason why we're going to marry tobacco control policy implementation is well,

16
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:45,389
it is an area that I study in career studies and also it's an area it's a policy area where like the

17
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,420
intricate little details of implementation can make a real difference in the effect of the policy.

18
00:01:51,870 --> 00:02:01,349
So given the implementation, everything that happens after policy's been decided is a large number of things there that can derail policy completely,

19
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,540
whether it is noncompliance by different organizations that have been businesses that are being regulated,

20
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,980
whether it's not funding implementation adequately, that's a serious problem.

21
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:19,980
And I it is kind of my thing to want students to pay more attention to what happens after the law is passed.

22
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,840
If you're working in health system, if you're working part time here,

23
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,080
if you're working in a hospital, but also obviously if you're working in policy advocacy situations,

24
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,850
paying attention to everything that happens after the laws passed or the regulation is

25
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,530
finalized is really important because otherwise we don't get the outcomes that we want to see.

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,350
So Karen does a lot of work on this kind of stuff. Her dissertation work centers on this.

27
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:49,120
She works with the Michigan Health Department on a regular basis as part of her role,

28
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,180
and she works with different advocacy groups with out throughout the state.

29
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:59,070
So she's been involved in drafting policy breaks and legislation and working

30
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,219
on that and try and push tobacco control forward in the state of Michigan.

31
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:08,010
So in case parents and say, oh, where do you put this?

32
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,040
Why are these computers confusing? I'm fine. Okay.

33
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,960
Oh, yeah, do you need anything else? And I was like, this is why we don't do that.

34
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,959
All right. So if you do know, you can buy one of these on, like, Amazon for like ten bucks and they're amazing.

35
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,070
I highly recommend it because it has laser pointer and everything and you can move your sides on it.

36
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:38,130
So yeah, I'm telling you, like I did my Masters in Public Health here, same program with you all, you know, assuming you're not in range or something.

37
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,090
So I'm here and happy to chat with you about my work.

38
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,720
Work I've done with Holly and the implementation because tobacco is a mass tobacco policy is.

39
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,940
So I'm going to have a little bit of an introduction to me and my experience just because it's very broad and you

40
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:01,290
can ask questions about that later and specifically talk about Tobacco 21 and the implementation lessons from that.

41
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:09,209
And then kind of what policy and action I've seen as I've worked with the Department of Health and Human Services and then how kind of a discussion.

42
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,570
And then so I'm going to try to keep this brief. You're going to have access to these slides.

43
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,910
I'm going to go through them quickly. So you will have them. So start off.

44
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:26,580
In case you didn't know, tobacco is one of the leading causes of mortality in the United States, and it's the largest cause of preventable death.

45
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:35,190
Everybody pretty much knows that Cigarets are bad for them. You can see this like pretty much affects your entire body.

46
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,409
E-cigarettes and other products that have now emerged and come up because cigarets have been in

47
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,690
decline have caused kind of a lot of issues and a lot of policy issues because people are like,

48
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:52,890
what do we do with these? Something to know is that nicotine itself does not cause cancer.

49
00:04:53,070 --> 00:05:02,210
This is a really big misperception. And about evenly over 50% of doctors think that nicotine causes cancer.

50
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,010
So it's just not well-known. It is.

51
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:10,770
The other things in the tobacco products, though, that does cause the cancer, like the tar, the oh my gosh, that's heavy metals and everything.

52
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:15,000
Like if you actually look at what's inside a cigaret, it's disgusting.

53
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:21,780
There's also sugar in there for fun. So they think, I'm sure that you guys have seen this, maybe familiar with it.

54
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,110
So I was doing a little bit of work on COVID 19 and how they interact with that.

55
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:33,540
So there have been a few studies that show like there are respiratory infections that can happen,

56
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:39,030
especially any time of putting anything in your lungs that can happen. You can get with an immune system there.

57
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,630
There are a few things that we're starting to see come up because it hasn't been a long time,

58
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,280
whereas we have years and years and years of data for smoking, we just don't have that yet for vaping.

59
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,390
So there are some health effects and we're seeing that come up more and more.

60
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,650
But it's important to note that when compared to cigarets,

61
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:03,810
vaping is has been less harmful and has lower lower amounts of heavy metals, lower amounts of like of course tar.

62
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:08,280
It's not a combusted product. So just to kind of familiarize yourself with that.

63
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:14,610
Just a quick note about the Valley says the e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury.

64
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,960
So this was a big health scare that happened around 2019 before the pandemic.

65
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,250
This was the big thing. The cause is expected to be one.

66
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,940
One little oil called vitamin E acetate.

67
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:32,700
And it was used as a carrier within vaping products to carry like the nicotine or THC or what have you.

68
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,620
In most cases, it was cannabis and manufactured.

69
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:43,590
Like there was an example of these two brothers in Wisconsin who out of their condo

70
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,630
were mass producing THC vapes and selling them and they got absolutely arrested.

71
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:54,120
So it's just really interesting that just one small thing,

72
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,580
and that's why we talk about the technicalities and the small details because it really matters like this hurt so many people.

73
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,830
And there is also people who are using nicking vape.

74
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,020
So it's really up in the air right now. It's really hard to know what's actually true.

75
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:13,800
So it is just really interesting. And when you're trying to make policy, if you have the uncertainty, it makes it really difficult.

76
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,670
So how did I get into tobacco at all?

77
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:26,009
So like I said, I'm an alumni of this program and Holly was my advisor and just she was like, Oh, this is a research opportunity.

78
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:32,700
Would you like to partake in it? And we were focusing on tobacco 21 down in Ohio and seeing how they were implementing it and

79
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:38,310
seeing what was the kind of follow through on that to see if we would do it in Michigan.

80
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,719
Essentially, that was the comparison. So I was like, Sure, why not?

81
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,020
I thought tobacco was a dead issue. I thought, oh no, cigarets are bad.

82
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,680
And then vaping came up and I was like, Oh, this is a really big deal.

83
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,399
And so that's why I got so involved in it. Not to mention, like, cigars and stuff.

84
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:59,510
There's so many products. So now just to like get a little bit more into that product,

85
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:07,250
this was a I took snippets of a presentation I did in 2019 to go over the kind of

86
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,479
product just to let you know what Travel 21 is in case you're not familiar with it.

87
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:18,230
It limits the minimum age of sales of tobacco products to 21 and older is really

88
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,530
interesting because a minimum age of sale versus like you have to be this old.

89
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,700
There's a lot of things in tobacco where the wording matters. It absolutely matters.

90
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:37,220
So this is the technical way to say it. So that was something that had been kind of in the works for a while.

91
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:43,160
People were thinking, you know, like, you can't drink until you're 21, you can't have cannabis until you're 21 in some states.

92
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:53,840
So that's what was kind of the target of that. And you can also through these policy change, who is the enforcers and who the enforcement target is.

93
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:59,630
So we'll get more kind of into that. So tobacco 21 spread really rapidly.

94
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:06,590
So it went from about 0 to 100. So at first started over in Massachusetts with a small town called Needham,

95
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:13,190
and they dropped their teen use rates by 50% for tobacco, which was absolutely amazing.

96
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:22,040
So once they kind of had the data for that and then a bunch of other places in Massachusetts because they had their own authority to do that,

97
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,100
they just started kind of health boards were like, We're just going to do this. They didn't need to go through legislative processes.

98
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,620
It's very important. So Massachusetts just started doing it and then that spread to Ohio and it spread into like a bunch of different places.

99
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,100
And you can see it's the law of the land. Now, that passed in 2019, late 2019, like on Christmas Eve, Trump signed it.

100
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:46,760
So that's why a lot of people don't know about it, which is interesting. But now that it's kind of like the law of the land,

101
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:54,139
now there are states who are catching up because right now in Michigan, state policy has not caught up to this.

102
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:59,640
We don't have enforcement mechanisms for this. There is nothing happening. So it's kind of like that as an act.

103
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:05,300
And if I can, yeah, like that's the essence of implementation right there we have.

104
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:10,640
So I still am like I should get one of those. And that's the essence of implementation right there.

105
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:15,920
So you have a law passed in a lot of different places around the country.

106
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,180
You get a national law great. A lot of people think, oh, we're done on this issue.

107
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:28,700
And the problem is really the enforcement. I mean, you can just have some of the mechanisms that it would be needed to enforce it.

108
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,000
Probably like, I don't know, a database maybe of all the retailers in the state would be a great idea.

109
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:40,490
They don't have the lists. They have a very poor quality and there's no license.

110
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:48,019
Yeah. So they also as a state, a lot of states issue a license to a tobacco retailer in the same way they'll issue

111
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:53,569
a license to a restaurant for a license to trade to an alcohol retail environment.

112
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:58,130
So Michigan doesn't have that for tobacco businesses.

113
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:03,979
And that's a huge problem because one of the best ways to get compliance from a business,

114
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,850
if they're selling things that they shouldn't be selling to people they shouldn't be selling to,

115
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,140
is to take away that business license without that lever.

116
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,220
It's very difficult to enforce this this national law,

117
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:27,590
even though we have resources in terms of people willing to do inspections and willing to do it in sanatoriums who also do inspections,

118
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:34,940
a lack of resources and inability to kind of punish business owners, particularly.

119
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,679
We're not talking about sales folks.

120
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:43,640
It is a problem because there are a few businesses that are really bad and are making it worse for everybody else.

121
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,639
Right. So. Absolutely.

122
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,770
And if it's not common knowledge that this has passed and there's been no enforcement, how are the clerks even supposed to know?

123
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:59,599
Yeah, it's really interesting, too, that the kind of Michigan's lack of dealing with this problem is really evident.

124
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,990
And like FDA compliance checks in Detroit itself.

125
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:11,870
There were 92 checks in 68 sold to a child without even asking for I.D. So people ask, is this a problem?

126
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:18,859
And I'm like, Yes, that is exactly the information that we're giving to the city of Detroit, to Oakland County.

127
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,679
So we're in discussions with them because now they want to do something about this and they're

128
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,210
figured out that they have the authority because Michigan as a state isn't dealing with it.

129
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:34,250
So there's a lot of evidence on tobacco. 21 This Institute of Medicine report really is what set it off.

130
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:42,680
So if you kind of want to like get more background on it or the policy specifics, this is a great, great resource and it decreased initiation.

131
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,790
So the entire idea of this is to just shift the age up.

132
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:54,049
So with nicotine and addiction for cigarets and e-cigarettes, specifically, the earlier you start,

133
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,620
the harder it is to quit and control that because it changes your brain chemistry.

134
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,800
So if we can even just shift people from starting at age 12 to starting at age 15, it's a policy win.

135
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,290
So that was the idea of shifting the age.

136
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:13,069
And the idea also is that, okay, you may know your brother is 18 or 19 or whatever and can buy you like Cigarets,

137
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:19,700
but the social people you're hanging out with in high school, usually hanging out with college age kids, you're usually not hanging out 21 year olds.

138
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:25,010
You can in some cases, but it's less likely. So that that's also kind of moving in the social circles.

139
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:33,170
So tobacco 21, Michigan is very since this has passed and even before this has passed,

140
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:40,309
every year in every legislative session, they bring up a bill and it has been notoriously weak.

141
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:44,959
It's been one of those things where they try to put in other things to it.

142
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:51,170
So because they know that this has to pass, because, you know, they need to get into line with the federal law.

143
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:56,690
They are just pork barreling it. They are shoving so many different things into their they they're like,

144
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,740
I guess and if we tax laws on cigarets we should put that into the general fund.

145
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,830
Forget prevention is cessation. We don't need to do that.

146
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,700
As you can tell, I'm slightly better about the way that our legislators are trying to fix back.

147
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,690
What, pork barreling. Yes, it is. Yes. Because I don't expect to be one.

148
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,359
Yeah. So this is what station.

149
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,600
Right. So that the legislature in Michigan is bringing this up every year.

150
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,340
We've talked a bit before about must pass legislation. Right.

151
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,730
In this case,

152
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:33,470
this is a piece of must pass legislation because the state has to come into line with the national requirements that were already passed into law.

153
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:43,459
So they know they've got to do that. And so legislators are using this as an opportunity to put other sometimes non-related things in the bill.

154
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:49,670
So when we talk about pork barreling, what we mean is legislators trying to get resources,

155
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:55,849
funding all the thing on the spectrum programs or benefits for their own constituencies.

156
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:00,460
And that happens a lot in legislation. Legislators are incentivized to do that.

157
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:05,000
Okay. So in this case, you're seeing a bill that's not particularly good for tobacco.

158
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:09,440
It's okay, but it's not what the tobacco control advocates would like to see,

159
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,790
because the implementation here and the letter of the law are very important,

160
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,469
whether we get a good outcome or not, whether we get an equitable outcome or not,

161
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:23,060
there's a bunch of enforcement things that should just die in the fire, in my opinion.

162
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,800
So there's a lot of criminalization of use, basically, which is not good.

163
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,320
And so the laws that we're getting are not the best, right.

164
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:41,420
Yeah. And just to kind of follow up on that point, it's important to note that, you know, like the industry is there,

165
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,560
the industry is trying to hand them what they want, the wording they want to go into the law.

166
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,579
So we try to counteract that with I work with the department, Health Human Services,

167
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,090
of course, the other community partners because a lot of model policy out there.

168
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:58,100
So I drafted literally a model policy that could just they can just pick up and pass the no,

169
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,830
that's not what they wanted to do because it was very complicated and I asked a lot like a whole licensing regime.

170
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:09,229
So it is very interesting that it is kind of like this iterative process.

171
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,820
You go through it again and again and again and you see what comes out, you see what goes on.

172
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,040
And then you work with legislators to try to convince them that you wish you would specify public health.

173
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:27,560
And it's notable that Michigan now has a marijuana licensing, but not a tobacco licensing regime.

174
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:33,440
Yeah, I think of marijuana like there is so many laws and so many things that if they

175
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,710
just did even the same thing that they did for tobacco as they do for marijuana,

176
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:44,810
we would be so much longer. We have a capable agency that could do it, but it's a bridge too far for some legislators, unfortunately.

177
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:54,800
Yeah. Yeah. So before the national law passed, Ann Arbor and Genesee Counties had passed about 21 ordinances.

178
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,999
So you'll see why the state is not ready to move toward something.

179
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,979
But localities are, and they want to take that on and they will pass it or try to, in this case, Ann Arbor, they let it pass.

180
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:13,879
They're like, Ah, yes, let those have you do whatever. And then Genesee County, where Flint is, then they were like, Oh no, we have to get involved.

181
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,020
And they issued an injunction.

182
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:21,410
So basically they stopped that policy from being put into effect and they said that you did not have the jurisdiction to do it.

183
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,350
So that's why we're talking about this at the state level,

184
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:29,390
because there is something called preemption where the tobacco companies essentially wrote in,

185
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:37,550
they got their way with Michigan and in the state law, it says that localities can't have tougher regulations than the state.

186
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,420
So that makes it go to the state level, which is a lot harder to pass up.

187
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:47,120
So I just just, you know, and of course, marijuana, we just brought it up.

188
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,870
That has passed. And 21 is the minimum age.

189
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:55,010
So if we want to create parity, we could it's just not happening right now.

190
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:01,130
And we must. Right. And we must have. Well, you know, it's not a federal requirement.

191
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:07,310
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So just to go over kind of the policy sprint, there were three parts of it.

192
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:13,940
So there was a modeling situation where they were looking at the health and fiscal impact because you want to give that information to legislators,

193
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,260
they can make the best choice possible.

194
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:23,480
We looked at Ohio and implementation challenges that they had down there because we would likely face similar ones in Michigan.

195
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:29,180
And then we also did something called My Voice, which is a nationwide survey,

196
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:35,870
and it surveys people aged 14 to 24 and kind of got their opinions like, do they agree with this law, what?

197
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:45,020
It's a polling mechanism, essentially. So the findings from this were that in the modeling, a of 21 would save lives.

198
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,730
Just overall, pushing that age up,

199
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:55,909
pushing people kind of away from starting cigarets and being able to get off of them will save lives and tax increases can cover revenue losses.

200
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,870
So you've seen this a lot, especially with tobacco policy.

201
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,200
If you want to do something more, you need money.

202
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:10,640
And so you need to kind of put that in the bill in the end. Otherwise you are mandating something that will not be able to happen.

203
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,900
So this one said, does anyone have questions?

204
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,200
Yes, I hear people talking. I don't mind that necessarily.

205
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:24,500
But if you have questions, can you please ask them to the whole room? Do you have to give them the cube or can you just.

206
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:30,820
Oh, yeah, I can squeeze through the cube because our our video guests will definitely need that when you like to it.

207
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,120
Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of like YouTube is just going to be just figuring out.

208
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,380
A few have. Okay. Here we go. Thank.

209
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,530
Just a real question on the timeline for tobacco 21.

210
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,990
I may be remembering incorrectly,

211
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:57,920
but did Governor Whitmer signed an executive order bill earlier this summer to raise the state's age of purchase in Michigan to 21?

212
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,370
I have not heard of that.

213
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:09,740
What she did as an executive order was on flavor restrictions, and then that was challenged in court and is still sitting in court.

214
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:16,249
And she may have tried that mechanism, but because people are really on her right now about issuing executive orders,

215
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,210
because it's literally making decisions which legislating it really doesn't like.

216
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,900
So even if she tries to do something like that, it will usually get much support.

217
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:31,180
Yeah. And she may have done I haven't looked at this issue for how long, but all I remember is the flavors.

218
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:36,560
One is what? I'm sorry, what you just said.

219
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:45,110
I was just wondering what reservations the legislators have to bridge the gap between tobacco regulations and marijuana innovations.

220
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,950
I mean, it's it's really retailers.

221
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:53,750
So when you go back to your constituents, the retailers really loudly say they don't want this.

222
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:58,970
I mean, of course, they know being regulated is not fun and being held accountable is not one.

223
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,840
So, like and most people are like, well, we don't tell the kids, so it's our problem.

224
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,230
Although now we have data that shows people are selling to kids.

225
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,990
And a lot of the issue also comes from there will be owners and then there's the clerks.

226
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,750
So the clerks may be doing something the owners don't even know about.

227
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:21,650
So those owners are the ones who go to the legislature and really loudly say, no, please don't do this even within.

228
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,590
So I'm part of the Detroit Wayne Oakland Tobacco-Free Coalition.

229
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:32,840
And even within that, there is someone who is a hookah shop owner and he like he's all for like labor restrictions, etc. But he's like,

230
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:38,090
what are you going to say to hookah shop owner who's like, You're going to shut me down if you get rid of flavors because you guys all flavors.

231
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:45,950
So like and people don't have an answer to that. So I think that's where a lot of the reservations come from,

232
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:53,690
is they are getting challenged by the retailers and to say nothing of the tobacco companies and the baby companies.

233
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:59,510
So there's just a lot of pushback and public health isn't really addressing those concerns currently.

234
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:06,259
Yeah, it was interesting to talk to people in Ohio because some of the community leaders that we

235
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:10,610
interviewed were very clear on what their approach was to talking to local businesses,

236
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:21,110
because especially like we were talking to people in that, for example, you write, they are very interested in maintaining those businesses.

237
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:27,590
They've already got a deficit of local businesses and local retail outlets for people in some places within Euclid.

238
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:35,150
So they were trying to form partnerships and explain to community businesses why this is a thing.

239
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:44,660
I think where the flavor issue is more difficult on every level and I wish it were a slightly less high priority than it is.

240
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:51,320
I feel like there is some other tobacco control issues that might be a little bit more of a priority, but there's more solid evidence.

241
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:57,889
I think there's decent evidence, not flavors, but the evidence is stronger for things like tobacco.

242
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:06,110
21 And I think that ultimately the ability to actually enforce the law as we currently have it,

243
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:10,310
is vital as any of these policies are going to work and it needs to be.

244
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:18,400
Like you said, they're on site, a civil enforcement and compliance wrecking mechanism that doesn't criminalize young people.

245
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:22,459
Otherwise, you're starting off on a bad thing. I don't know who had the hand up first.

246
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,120
I know Jonathan did. And only one note while you're relating.

247
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:32,710
So this kind of also gets back to the local versus state policy because she's talking about like

248
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:40,400
Euclid and these places over in Ohio and Ohio doesn't have the same preemption that Michigan has.

249
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:48,560
So local, local places can take this on. And when it's coming from a local kind of community and, you know, those people within the community,

250
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,910
it's a lot easier to get something passed and convince people that you're not trying to put them out of business.

251
00:23:53,210 --> 00:24:00,500
But at the state level, it's very top down and how like you need a lot of polling and a lot of information to show that citizens support this,

252
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:08,270
whereas like if you're like City of Troy or something, you just go walk down the street, you walk your friends, probably business like that.

253
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:10,750
Good morning.

254
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:18,610
So this might be out of your scope of research, but I just had a question about kind of the health impacts of smoking, cigarets versus vaping.

255
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,319
So one thing that I've noticed,

256
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:27,310
that vaping tends to be kind of like an all day habit when you can go to the bathroom right now and take your vape if you want it to,

257
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:32,710
whereas people that smoke cigarets usually might smoke. You know what if they smoke three cigarets a day?

258
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,650
Is that worse or better than vaping all day?

259
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:43,330
Like, is there any research out there that kind of takes like a qualitative look at like number of cigarets versus vaping habits?

260
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:48,429
This is a really big issue because there is no direct comparison between packs a pack a day.

261
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:52,180
People understand pack a day. Like people understand. Like you can conceptualize that.

262
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:57,640
But with vaping because it is a pod like you can know if you go through pods, that's quantifiable.

263
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:01,120
Let's say you only hit it five times. That's not quantifiable.

264
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,900
So it sounds a lot different and it's really hard for people to self-regulate,

265
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,470
whereas like a smoker might be like, Man, I went through a pack, I'm not going to do that.

266
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:13,240
Whereas like, you know, when you think about it, keep hitting it.

267
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:24,040
So I can't exactly say, you know, which is better, especially if you're using it more and we don't have that information yet.

268
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:30,700
But the amounts of like toxins and some are just lower, but if you're using it every day, daily.

269
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,630
Yeah. It also depends on how you smoke. This is a really interesting thing.

270
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:42,310
There's a lot of like chemistry that goes on with this biochemistry. So the acidity and the level of the smoke matters.

271
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,710
So if if it's really acidic, like cigars, like you see big old cigars,

272
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:50,830
if you've ever smoked one and you hold it in your mouth, you don't think [INAUDIBLE] into your lungs.

273
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,799
What they do with like menthol and other flavorings and things is it makes it puts your brain,

274
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,680
I think is less harsh because it is and you can inhale it deeper.

275
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:06,750
So if you are just holding things in your mouth versus bringing it down into your lungs, deeply, not different.

276
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:16,240
So it's really interesting. So those are a lot of factors when you add to that, like the social dimensions of who are medical products marketed to,

277
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,979
especially we know more Cigarets is a lot of evidence that certain groups and

278
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:27,100
communities get targeted more and get targeted with like cheaper deals to buy cigarets.

279
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:32,590
It's a little bit different pattern in e-cigarettes, which is one of the things I was looking at for her dissertation.

280
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:39,610
So this is really a new area where relative risk is not clearly defined in the evidence, and that's a huge problem.

281
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:49,509
And also one of the things is we don't want to kill the potential benefits of e-cigarettes.

282
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:53,920
That could help a lot of people whose relative risk is really high for various reasons.

283
00:26:54,310 --> 00:27:03,190
And switching from a cigaret to a very beneficial for the overall for us, you know vaping still has some health consequences.

284
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:16,130
So it's a tricky line towards the risk and it's not a clear cohesive position coming from the scientific community or medical community,

285
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:24,309
all of these issues. And so that conflict has been a problem because we had policy and policy decisions being made

286
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:29,379
about products or whether or not to support them prior to having a very solid evidence base,

287
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:38,440
which was not the case for cigaret regulation. There were years and years of evidence leading up to the restrictions that were placed on cigarets.

288
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:49,710
Sorry. First of all, I know that you mentioned like sort of like how economy economics play into this.

289
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:55,570
I know that in other countries, like in France, that has a pretty like high prevalence of smoking.

290
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:01,930
They have been able to enforce kind of like more drastic targeting.

291
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:07,299
And so like put in kind of scary labels on stuff, I don't know.

292
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:13,510
And so I'm just curious like why do you think that there in the US that's not the case?

293
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:18,129
I'm just curious if you can make a comparison between the two. You know, this might be more of a holly question.

294
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,250
She does more comparative with other countries,

295
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:27,590
but those are called graph labels and they are used across the world and they like show you what can happen.

296
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:33,550
Like they will show you oral cancer. They will show you that you can lose toes like crazy things that you wouldn't even think about.

297
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:47,349
But I think from what I've learned is a lot of it has to do with like tobacco companies being here, like farmers and stuff,

298
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:53,500
like people really in America, people really don't like to like be nina farmers, for lack of better things.

299
00:28:54,970 --> 00:29:00,880
So I think there's like the fact that Americans producing tobacco is such a big thing.

300
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:07,420
And like even when I went down to Richmond, Virginia, there are tobacco leaves on their state house.

301
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,990
Like that is how green it is. Into politics. So I thought.

302
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:17,650
Yes. Do you have any? Yeah. Yeah. So I'm so sorry, everybody.

303
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:24,730
You said you touched him. So I do a lot of work on labeling.

304
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:30,820
So the graphic warning labels that you see three things with your patients.

305
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:37,010
And I kind of have a personal bias on this because my dad was made to suffer, which is not good.

306
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:40,780
And so nobody needs to suffer through that kind of thing.

307
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:50,500
But I think differently, probably because some have the direct regulatory capacity to enforce this kind of policy through,

308
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,780
um, American suffers more because of the federal nature of the government.

309
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:01,900
So there's a lot of conflict and our political system here is built in with a lot of points at which someone can just say no.

310
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:07,719
So when we compare different governments, we talk about these different points and say, America,

311
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:15,880
that has a much higher chance that, you know, a lot of French tobacco control legislation actually comes from the European Union.

312
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,390
French tobacco control legislation is not particularly strong.

313
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:27,550
This law that was passed in the seventies and the enforcement of it is somewhat patchy.

314
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:35,620
It was for a long time a lot of resistance from retailers in France against tobacco control regulations.

315
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:45,430
But through its membership in the European Union, France has pushed for greater control and has adopted tighter policies.

316
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:50,530
The one that remains very ambiguous is smoking in public places.

317
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:58,480
The European Union doesn't really have the authority to ban smoking in public places in its member state countries.

318
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,080
The national governments of those countries have the authority to do that.

319
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:10,100
So I could go on about this, but hopefully that because you're behind it and there are some countries that have gone back for that.

320
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:20,090
And I think and other countries who just have child warnings, we are going to get graphic warnings right before they pass.

321
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:25,210
They are issued a final rule. So do you want me to explain FDA process?

322
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,990
Oh, my gosh. You're going to have that. I do. Very briefly.

323
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,740
Okay. Go ahead, my brother. You did it. Let me. Yeah.

324
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:39,010
So this is part of my dissertation. I'm looking at how the FDA interacts with tobacco companies or saving companies.

325
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:50,350
So FDA, it takes them quite a long time, a lot of deliberation to issue a kind of proposed rule so they start or they can even start.

326
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,330
What's the other one call? The early one.

327
00:31:52,900 --> 00:32:00,459
And there's like there's about four different kinds and yes, so there's like advance notice of rulemaking process.

328
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,380
So the rulemaking process is very long.

329
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:10,000
So first we get a notice that we're thinking about this and then they have a comment period on the proposed rule and everybody comments on it.

330
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,090
I think there were what, at least like 11,000, if not more on the recent flavor.

331
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:22,270
So yeah, we we just missed that. When I knew it didn't have to do any later in the year, you would have thought that for your assignment.

332
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,130
Everybody's doing a second policy on in response to corporate.

333
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:36,699
Oh, good. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So and then after that, they sift through all of that and then they have like a final rulemaking process.

334
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,710
So it goes through this super long process.

335
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:47,020
So even though FDA is like we want to reduce the level of nicotine to a non-addictive level in cigarets, that is going to take at least five years.

336
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:57,360
And it takes so long because not only do you have the rulemaking process and everybody out of you know that you also have injunctions,

337
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:01,330
court issues, tobacco is a very litigious field.

338
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,960
Lawyers are really big in this field and we need them. Absolutely.

339
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,339
Yeah. And that's another reason why the policy is different than in other countries.

340
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:17,920
So the court system in the US provides lots of opportunities for most parties to bring the lawsuits.

341
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,640
So the French court system is not like that.

342
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:26,980
The British court system, the Canadian court system, the Australian system, these are just the countries I know that I wrote about,

343
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:32,170
but a lot of other countries don't have the court systems that are structured that way.

344
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,220
Where there's a lot of opportunities to overturn a policy.

345
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:41,650
Litigation in the US is more aggressive and it's more aggressive because American tobacco

346
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:48,100
companies have a lot of money that they can use to utilize the law and seek legal redress.

347
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,650
So those countries where there is a strong tobacco company presence, this litigation happens quite a lot.

348
00:33:55,270 --> 00:34:01,509
And then the subject of my research has been actually the international litigation that can happen through trade

349
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:07,150
agreements and investment arbitration and other weird things that nobody publicly really acknowledges exists.

350
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:14,459
And that's a. Another way for a company to change things like tobacco control legislation,

351
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:21,070
because they are global companies for the most part, and they want to see their national competitors go out business.

352
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:27,810
They want laws that favor them. And they they very strongly oppose restrictions on their intellectual property.

353
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,419
So things like branding, advertising, they hate regulations in that vein.

354
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:38,880
And those are some of the most significant things that tobacco control advocates have proposed.

355
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,530
So, yeah, the international scope of tobacco is absolutely wild.

356
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,520
Like cigaret companies, tobacco companies are always looking for new markets.

357
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,520
If their market isn't viable here, they're going to find somewhere else.

358
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:54,900
Like India and China have large, large populations.

359
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:01,260
And so some middle income company countries are now just starting to uptick in tobacco use,

360
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,889
whereas, you know, we're on the decline, other places are on the incline.

361
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,100
So it gets very messy.

362
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:12,540
Yes, this there's definitely a deliberate strategy by some of the international companies to diversify the countries in which they're setting.

363
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:21,959
So for a period of time, they might to try to into new markets and get their products established,

364
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,390
which has really serious health consequences because the cigarets are really quite bad for you.

365
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:37,020
And so it's a difficult situation where the international system is set up to support international trade, commerce, business.

366
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:47,100
But what happens when that trade or that those businesses are quite harmful, promoting a product that's hurting people?

367
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:56,670
And you're right that way. Often in these newer markets, Cigaret used to spread quite quickly along with some quite aggressive advertising too.

368
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:02,320
So it's a big problem. Sorry. Yeah.

369
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:07,650
Want to take one more and then I'll say I have so many more sites.

370
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,500
That's okay. I knew this would happen. This is better than.

371
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:20,560
Oh, I was just wondering if tobacco companies and nicotine companies like private companies are competitors or tobacco companies.

372
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,420
And this is what I wanted to kind of bring up as Holly was talking about.

373
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:30,840
Like that is really interesting because as much as they are competitors and do want their own products went out,

374
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:38,970
they also collaborate a lot, especially so like there was this thing in the 1980s called the Master Settlement Agreement.

375
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:46,889
So because you had everybody here and there like there would be people who were like, I never knew.

376
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:54,780
So he was bad for me and then held cigaret companies accountable for the damage that they suffered and that kept happening to tobacco companies.

377
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,120
So eventually they were like, well, let's just do a master settlement. Let's just settle this over once for like for good.

378
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:05,670
We'll pay out a bunch of money because we've been so terrible and naughty and and then we'll be done.

379
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:12,840
That was kind of the idea behind it so that these companies, they were all on, oh, gosh, what is it called?

380
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,440
They were all defendants. Or like, yeah, so they were all defendants together.

381
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:24,180
So their lawyers worked together. And that was another thing with it being so litigious and having other countries do other things.

382
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:30,330
You can look back at what has happened in previous cases and then use that kind of logic.

383
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,940
If that worked last time, maybe it'll work this time.

384
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:38,459
So they do a lot of sharing and comparing, and there's people who hop from one company to another.

385
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:43,620
Philip morris International may hop over to Myron Liggett.

386
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:50,340
Look at Myers one. Yeah so Altria don't get these are Ultra.

387
00:37:50,790 --> 00:38:00,419
We'll talk about that later but yeah so they are separate entities but they do collaborate when it behooves them.

388
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:08,190
Yeah. And, and sometimes then you've got to keep back because it's about survival of the industry.

389
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:15,270
Yeah. And when some companies also take the approach of they're going to try to acquire either the

390
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:20,610
products or intellectual property or sometimes the companies that are producing e-cigarettes too.

391
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:27,660
So there's sort of a mergers and acquisitions part of this for them as a collaborating as an industry part of this as well.

392
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:34,920
Although sometimes in some of the cases they have clashed quite a bit, I think.

393
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:45,510
Sometimes the companies do have different approaches or goals, but sometimes they're remarkably similar in terms of.

394
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:51,600
A lot of these companies, whether they're producing e-cigarettes or normal traditional cigarets and cigars,

395
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:55,500
they want to see a level playing field across jurisdictions,

396
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,780
and they care about that a lot because that increases their cost when they have to comply with different sets of rules.

397
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:05,940
So again, I couldn't talk about the smoke and the this is an absolute wrap.

398
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:15,230
Sorry. We got one more question and we can. Did you get going?

399
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:21,930
I should note on heels today and something that you guys had.

400
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:28,800
So I was just curious based on the map you you showed about like what stands for implementing that for like 21,

401
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:33,150
it seems like it's not as much about like,

402
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:39,440
you know, Republican or Democrat issue, like a lot of things like are there you know, there's a very separate lines.

403
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:45,060
I'm wondering, like what challenges or maybe what benefits come along with having an issue that's not so like,

404
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:48,900
you know, down the middle of like if you're Democrat, this is what you believe, you know?

405
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:58,980
And I think that there is a level of agreement that like something that is usually agreed upon is that we don't want U.S. companies products,

406
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,879
and that is for Republicans as it is for Democrats.

407
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,320
We just don't want you using us.

408
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,899
And you have to think legislators also have kids and stuff so they know that like kids are coming home and saying like are about themselves,

409
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:18,360
like, like, you know, that's cool. So they started locking bathrooms in some school districts because of this entire vaping thing.

410
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:32,129
It's crazy, but I'm kind of back to that point. It's just I think it's not as much of a you're on one political side versus another.

411
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:38,700
I think that the way that this kind of shows up is you will see like Republicans are like more of the small business minded folk,

412
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:44,430
whereas Democrats are more like, well, we want to do it because of public health, but there is a level of agreement.

413
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:47,550
So that is good. That's a good starting place.

414
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:54,960
So like for example, I went over and was in Colorado and I was talking to folks who had passed the Tobacco 21 legislation there.

415
00:40:55,230 --> 00:41:00,180
So it was actually a Republican who owned a coffee shop and he said people were making

416
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,540
it as coffee shop and he like he should do something about it because that was weird.

417
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:14,970
So then he brought it to another CPAC that one of the leaders of the Democrats and said, let's do this is a bipartisan thing.

418
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:19,049
It is beneficial to have bipartisan policy. People really like that.

419
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:23,430
It looks good. It looks like it's in play nice. So I think that is a benefit.

420
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:32,100
Where it can cause trouble between the different political folks is when it comes to like issues of taxes.

421
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,870
What who are the taxes? Where is the money coming from? Who are you going to regulate?

422
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:41,160
Is this going to put people out of business? And that's kind of where some of these come.

423
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,250
Do you have any comments on that? Yeah, I can be less cynical.

424
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:52,379
More cynical, as is my friend. Normally in this class, you guys have been thinking that I can be more cynical and say,

425
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:59,459
I think the federal Republican support was for various reasons for this legislation,

426
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,850
because this is the National Legislative Action 21 legislation passed under Trump.

427
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:07,530
So I think they supported you.

428
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,620
I think they saw there was some business arguments made that they supported.

429
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:19,530
I think probably Joe was arguing for this level playing field argument at the Trump administration bought into

430
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:27,420
there definitely aren't public health arguments really on the Republican side where they get this kind of effect,

431
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:37,860
which I would say is almost more of a moral hazard thing or a moral argument that, you know, young people shouldn't be using these products.

432
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:44,760
I think we have to be very careful with arguments like that because the left does it, too.

433
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:56,070
There were a lot of laws passed in the 1990 trying to criminalize the use of tobacco, making it worse than a misdemeanor,

434
00:42:56,070 --> 00:43:06,180
making it so that you have to do some quite invasive things at the bar if you're underage and caught using tobacco products.

435
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:11,700
And the difficult part of that is that law enforcement is not equal across the population.

436
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:20,110
And so by criminalizing the act of using tobacco, when you're that age,

437
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:26,129
you're really putting the burden even more heavily on some people and not others.

438
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:33,450
And I think that's a big problem. And so Democrats pushed for that legislation as much as Republicans did.

439
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:36,900
So we've got to be really careful. But it's definitely a moral.

440
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,090
Component to the Republican argument,

441
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:49,260
which is we should control this bad behavior is definitely a business argument and the government should let this thriving industry thrive.

442
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:50,790
Kinds of arguments, too.

443
00:43:50,820 --> 00:44:00,040
So the idea was to regulate in such a way that it was a relatively nice touch on business, which is is what they did so well for them.

444
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:06,570
If you look at this map, they actually graded the different laws in the each state.

445
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:10,560
And so even this organization, which is Tobacco 21,

446
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:16,230
which is a national advocacy organization that we set most of the time agreed with and sometimes disagreed with.

447
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:20,190
I have to say, during this project, they graded each state.

448
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:26,910
So you can see that there's a lot of variation. Much of the variation comes from these questions of implementation.

449
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,670
Yeah. So I wanted to make that point next to it. So not all policies are created equal.

450
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,510
So I went to Colorado and I went to Virginia.

451
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,249
Colorado, you can see it gets gets an A-plus.

452
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:47,399
And they really they're happy with what they did because they pretty much followed the model policy and they took a long bipartisan

453
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:59,010
process and got a good law passed in Virginia verbiage and does have a policy and it's literally the CEO of Altria went,

454
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,490
okay, so Altria is one of the big tobacco companies.

455
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:07,379
Which one really is a new name for them? That's a domestic problem.

456
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:12,660
Philip morris must have heard of Gilmore's. So they say it's Altria because it sounds like altruistic.

457
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,820
So they changed the name because people recognize organized this.

458
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:24,840
Gilmore's and the CEO literally went to the House floor in the state of Virginia and he handed the policy in.

459
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:36,650
And the fellow of Republican who sponsored the bill and had close ties with them, he was like, Well, I'll let the expert see why we need this law.

460
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:44,760
So literally. He said nothing and he just let the CEO of Altria tell the State House why they need this and the delegates agreed.

461
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:48,540
So, I mean, I think it's really interesting to see that as well.

462
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:54,600
I can't believe they literally just like let the CEO walk in and pass a law.

463
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:03,800
But that's how it works. And Altria is everywhere in Richmond, Virginia, which is where they're steakhouses and they have a theater.

464
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:12,030
They put so much money into these making the city nicer improvement projects like so.

465
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:15,360
So people want to, you know, help them out.

466
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:17,969
It's very interesting. Virginia drove me nuts.

467
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:25,350
And because the even the health department they so this was a absolutely last minute thing that they put in like the night

468
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:33,540
before they could like put anything else in for the session and the Health Department didn't know about till it passed.

469
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:38,610
Paige It was absolutely horrible. They didn't involve any community partners because they were just now.

470
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:42,150
And if you don't know about it, you can't fight it. So yeah,

471
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:52,709
that's actually kind of a an overall strategy for some of the companies supporting this recruiting tool really supported the radical 21 nationally,

472
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:56,520
and we were all very suspicious of that. Well, I still am.

473
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:09,090
And they they definitely had this strategy of going for us locally and trying very hard to rapidly get laws passed without much transparency,

474
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:19,690
without anybody really finding out they were trying to strategize, to use the the political system to pass laws as quickly as they could be.

475
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:27,300
The example, because on the tobacco control side, because advocates like me nationally and regionally and that's a big national company,

476
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:33,180
advocacy groups like American Cancer Association, the Lung Association.

477
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:40,110
So they were they hired professional advocates to cover our region.

478
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:45,600
They all paid to try to get bills passed and have they spread multiple policies.

479
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:53,820
And so the the businesses on the right were doing some of the same things, but they're doing it more aggressively, I would say,

480
00:47:54,210 --> 00:48:02,880
at a sort of elite legislative level and bypassing communities, which is a big problem because often they're talking to local,

481
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:12,149
pretty local city councils, county, etc., to try to figure out how to change policy and then state legislatures and only at the point where

482
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:16,830
they felt they could really push this enough and attract the attention of the Trump administration.

483
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:21,510
Did they start to push for this nationally because they could see that they weren't necessarily

484
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:26,640
winning enough locally and they wanted that level playing field for that business.

485
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:35,520
So yes. And so like the thing with the Virginia policy and even the one that Trump had passed is like it just kind of scratched out 18 and put me on.

486
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,870
So they're like, somebody else will do the enforcement of that.

487
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:43,650
We're not going to. So they have no teeth. So that was.

488
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:50,580
It looks good, though. There is the political science side of this of people are claim like what is.

489
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:59,009
When they take credit. Yes. Credit cards. So like it looks really good if you like.

490
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:02,610
They're like I guess everybody is complaining about e-cigarettes. And look, we did something about it.

491
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,580
Now it's done. And some constituents are happy with that.

492
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:10,320
But if you're a person who has worse that or deal with that, I am happy because oh, guess what?

493
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:12,540
Now we moved it from 18 to 21.

494
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:18,899
Who's going to pay for the signage that now has to go out to everybody in the state to change who's going to do the education?

495
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,650
Who's going to make sure they're not going to anybody under 20?

496
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:28,860
Right. Because like I said, when we talk to people in Ohio and they were done this in Columbus, they doesn't include them.

497
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:33,840
And then we talked to a couple of the smaller cities just to try and round things out.

498
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,310
But we were able to send. What did you do to do this right.

499
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:42,560
So that we can make some recommendations to Michigan so that they try to do this right, too, should they pass a law?

500
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:44,100
This is prior to the national law.

501
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:54,180
And so at that point, we were they were pointing to things like, well, we needed to have a really great database of all the retailers in the city.

502
00:49:54,180 --> 00:50:01,799
So we went and interviewed. We use public health students, we use our sanatorium workforce and others.

503
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:10,950
We had to have a big data push and we had to get grant funding to do that together to create a database for all the retailers in Columbus,

504
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:15,239
because there were like 900 of them and they were having to visit places that

505
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:20,040
they previously haven't visited for restaurant inspections or anything else,

506
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:26,640
like hotels, places that sell cell phones that also sell products and tobacco products on the site.

507
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:33,360
You have to train clerks. You have to provide them with training, preferably in person, to do this right.

508
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:42,330
You have to give them some support. You have to do that over and over because the workforce in the retail sector turns over very quickly.

509
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:48,000
You have to maybe provide some information in different languages. You have to provide signage.

510
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:55,980
You have to do outreach with retailers. Because in those communities where the retail infrastructure is quite fragile but really important,

511
00:50:56,490 --> 00:51:01,319
you can't just force retailers immediately to do this.

512
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,399
You have to take a softer approach. You have to talk to them. You have to do outreach.

513
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:10,200
You have to make them understand why complying with this law is beneficial to the community as a whole.

514
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:20,910
And a lot of retailers, if you do it that way and train their clerks and provide them with signage, their compliance is much, much greater.

515
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:27,240
And then you're in a situation where there will always be some businesses that don't comply and that are all bad actors.

516
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:33,599
Of course, you need all that compliance infrastructure. That's all implementation and it's not physical.

517
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:42,030
So cars going, this is really difficult to see exactly what's been going on.

518
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:46,350
Even if you remember the local community and you really have your finger on the pulse of politics,

519
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:50,340
it's hard to figure out this nuance and you might not know.

520
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:57,690
But though, that's the level of resources required. So when Congress talking about credit, claiming the politicians can say, look,

521
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:02,160
I passed a law on this great public health policy wonk, I great public health advocate.

522
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:07,590
They don't have to provide the resources and other things necessary to actually

523
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:13,200
ensure that the public health agencies have the ability to enforce this law.

524
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:18,810
They don't have to have a licensing system. They don't even have to have comprehensive data that would be needed for enforcement.

525
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:23,550
None of that was really included in any of these bills.

526
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,830
So yeah, and in Detroit itself, there's like a thousand retailers.

527
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:35,640
It's a crazy, weird place to put your fine tobacco a couple of bowling alleys.

528
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,930
And there was a chicken shop over in Detroit. A chicken shop?

529
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:44,819
Yeah. Get your chicken. And you did your chicken and there's just cigarillos behind them.

530
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:53,280
And they were like, oh, yes, come on. And while you're waiting for your ticket to be done, I was like, Oh, yeah.

531
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:57,420
So and some of that is like you mentioned hookers before.

532
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:02,280
Like there's a lot of different cultural practices too that have to be taken into account,

533
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:08,370
and that requires engagement and outreach and local engagement with people from that group.

534
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:12,000
And so while doing this right could be very damaging.

535
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:19,260
Absolutely. And like this in a lot of the things I'm seeing with like Detroit are the citizens and things are people are saying,

536
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:26,460
don't do this to us, do it with us. And there's a lot of times that people do things to people in policy and that don't consider them.

537
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:31,410
And then no wonder it doesn't work. And something else important for like the hookah shop.

538
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:36,480
So like I trained some investor years ago and you like.

539
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,170
Observations with me. And they were in Detroit.

540
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:45,860
It was 316 year olds and was like, I am not responsible not to handle this, but I read a line and put it in my book.

541
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,110
Community thought they were going to be partners to that.

542
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:55,430
So one of the kids though, when we were going and we went to our first shop and he's like, yeah, my dad owned a bookshop.

543
00:53:56,570 --> 00:54:02,270
So like there's a lot of black and brown people who own these shops as well.

544
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:09,800
There's, there's a lot of a lot of things to consider and who you're going to economically impact.

545
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:15,110
There's a lot of things that need put on a place and you want to make sure that

546
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:17,990
you do have the community members on board because otherwise it's not gonna work.

547
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:25,340
Which is why you've got to deal with this issue of noncompliance with the businesses that are behaving really badly and really saying to kids,

548
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,400
because quite often there's somebody that's not on board.

549
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:39,889
It's like a franchised gas station or something. And I think we know with data now with where these retail outlets are because

550
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:45,040
they are creating an unfair competition space for other local businesses.

551
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:47,600
So you got to like yeah.

552
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:55,040
And in like Detroit, it's common knowledge that the people who own the businesses living in Oakland County actually not even in my county.

553
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,670
So that there's a lot of tension between that too,

554
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:04,100
because it's like these people are coming in from the rich neighborhoods and they're taking advantage of us not under.

555
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:11,719
All right. So to do basically our findings were that this is a good policy.

556
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:17,990
We should do it. There's youth support, right? So we can put this people and program back.

557
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:25,880
And we were able to give them a number of how many kids would be prevented from starting smoking.

558
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:36,700
Wonderful. Great. And then also, of course, we talk about the grazing in negotiation and then how facts are themselves.

559
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:41,819
But it has to be a thorough, thoughtfully implemented and evaluated.

560
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:45,899
So implementation evaluation are so, so, so important.

561
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:49,330
And there are a lot of times that people just pass a policy and then don't follow up.

562
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:54,389
If you don't follow through, it can't work. This is what I was saying earlier.

563
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:57,530
Don't cross out 18 and put 21. That's essentially what a lot of the lost it.

564
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:02,130
And it's very frustrating because then the public health folks are stuck being like, all right,

565
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:08,550
how are we going to pay for people to go out and evaluate this and guess who enforcement falls to where?

566
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:11,490
There's not a simple infrastructure for enforcement. It's the police.

567
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:20,010
If so, then you've got the police stopping young people on the street corner for a minor infractions and that could escalate badly.

568
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:23,729
So it's it's not responsible policy making. Yeah.

569
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:27,100
So we did an in-depth interviews.

570
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:31,720
This is just kind of showing kind of Ohio State through it.

571
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,450
So it needs to be effective, comprehensive and civil.

572
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:41,639
So that's what I was talking about. Like it's important for this to be a civil process and just finding people and finding

573
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:48,780
the right people because you should be finding the retailer who's selling tickets. You shouldn't be buying the youth for having a cigaret on them.

574
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:58,349
You shouldn't be fining the clerk like it's important to know who the target is and it has to cover all products.

575
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:02,790
Like, we'll see if I get to this. But there are so many tobacco products, so many things I did not know.

576
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:09,170
It's craziness. These are just kind of quotes you can read through them later.

577
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:18,620
Oh, no, no, I wondered. I did. Oh, sorry. I, um, we we haven't been this project was in a long ago, so it's been really good.

578
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:24,870
Sorry. And to me, eventually I have to give a that you have.

579
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,270
Oh. So here we have a poem on licensing.

580
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:33,799
So these come from our interviewee. These are not things that we made up or extrapolated.

581
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,910
We were talking to people who are involved in implementing this policy,

582
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:43,220
either during the decision making phase or afterwards in terms and even two of the subjects.

583
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:51,880
So. He's talking about how to be effective and licensing being a key part of that,

584
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:59,970
talking about how to be comprehensive and cover a lot of these different products and think about these continuum of risk.

585
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:06,970
Think about how to have the best chance of preventing you from getting these products.

586
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:12,880
And then it needs to be a civil it's a direct quote from a policy maker.

587
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:16,250
These are bad idea for the police to go to stop the 20 year old because they are

588
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:24,040
scared of cigarets basically if they don't want this to be a criminalized activity.

589
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:33,430
Yeah. And of course, and comprehensive. That just goes back to the places that sell these things, like bars, cell phone stores.

590
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:34,840
And they do.

591
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:41,350
And like when I went over to Grand Rapids, there was a grocery store and I thought that they didn't sell because they didn't have anywhere,

592
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:45,310
but they had it right in the cash register. Yeah. So he was scared.

593
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:50,770
Yeah. Wow. We got really good information from all these folks.

594
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:53,950
And it's actually really interesting that tobacco 21,

595
00:58:53,950 --> 00:59:00,460
the people who like kind of push that the organization is called Preventing Tobacco Addiction Foundation and they're based in Ohio.

596
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:05,530
So it also like once that clicked for us because we're like why would Ohio it's usually pretty Republican.

597
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:10,510
Why would they be interested in this? Because they have a doctor who created this foundation who was really passionate about it.

598
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:15,810
And you got people on board? Yeah, we would call him probably a policy entrepreneur.

599
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:19,030
He pushed for this nationwide. Yeah.

600
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:23,790
And I didn't always agree with that organization because we all being a bit cheeky to this project,

601
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:29,080
the logo is 18 crossed out and then 21 written underneath,

602
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:34,240
which is all wanting advice and we're saying like, don't just do that, you've got to do all this stuff behind the scenes.

603
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:38,440
So I think we did get some of them to reconsider some of the things they were saying

604
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:42,129
a little bit because they were very rapidly developing some of these things,

605
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:43,540
like right after we talked to them.

606
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:50,680
So we know this communication is so important and when they had that as their logo, they didn't even intend to have that be kind of the push.

607
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:56,229
And then it got kind of co-opted by the while I had a pen with their logo on it,

608
00:59:56,230 --> 01:00:00,040
and I would go around to every meeting saying, Don't do this, this is wrong.

609
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:05,590
This is about advocacy. I think we got a bit fed up of us saying that, but where are we going?

610
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:14,170
Have our opinions and so on. So Columbus really tried to have like a gold standard enforcement regime and they based it off of food inspections.

611
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:17,980
So to again, to go back to the point I'm making in civil,

612
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,760
they want to take it out of the hands of police and put it in the hands of the public health department.

613
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:28,959
And the public health department was willing to do that. And that's very important because they can go in and when every food inspection.

614
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:35,650
So like a lot of these convenience stores and gas stations, you know, they have refrigerators anywhere that has like a refrigerator,

615
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:41,860
like a person has to come in and check that the temperature is right and it's sanitary and all of these good things.

616
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:50,680
And so, like people know, like, of course, if you are doing something wrong, the inspectors will give you a warning usually and then follow up.

617
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,820
But it's they're used to that. They're used to those people coming in.

618
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:58,210
And so it was a good touch point to also talk about tobacco, inform them for that.

619
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:04,090
So they wanted the compliance checks to be conducted by Sagittarians.

620
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:10,600
And it's really interesting because there was a lot of discussions on how is that feasible, how are we going to have the money?

621
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,630
Because now you're spending almost twice as long in the store.

622
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:20,260
So there were a lot of like kind of nuts and bolts things that they had to figure out with that, but they did it.

623
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:24,250
So they were really good with education, outreach, training.

624
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:30,280
They specifically were talking to their retailers and they were talking to clerks and kind of even if people weren't fully on board,

625
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,650
at least they weren't fighting it and they did a really good job with that.

626
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:42,440
Cleveland is totally different. There was not as much focus on implementation.

627
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:46,560
There was a lot of issues with like whose authority actually is this?

628
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:51,340
And you you have to make that very clear and written out in the law.

629
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:55,569
Otherwise, like who's going to just pick up and be like, Oh, I want to do that?

630
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:58,930
No. Like the policy needs to tell people who's going to do that.

631
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:02,440
And you need and the stage of policy work,

632
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:10,509
like if you don't have somebody who's standing up like the health department or police and nobody wants to do it,

633
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:16,690
then you nothing will get on these standards did an investigative report on the local TV news and they

634
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:22,000
they they basically wrote about what they did in the investigative reports it's public knowledge.

635
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:27,549
So they went and talked to the city department of Health and they said, well, this is not just jurisdiction.

636
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:31,930
You got to go talk to the police. And then they went talk to the police. The police said, this is what we do.

637
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:34,420
It's the local health department. You got to go see them.

638
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:42,850
And so then it became obvious after the were being passed that it wasn't a good plan, pigmentation, and that nobody knew who was in charge.

639
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:46,480
That's why it became a news story. It became hot potato.

640
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:53,540
Yeah. So there's bouncing off each other. So of course under funded by the funding of it, they don't reach out to retailers.

641
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:59,000
So for compliance like again, this is the situation where the retailers even know about it.

642
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:03,300
And so, like, there's a differential thing though, with the funding.

643
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:08,710
Like the city of Columbus was able to get taxpayer money to support this.

644
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:14,960
They were able to retake that budget and they had like a, like an on ramp bunch of initial funding.

645
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:20,360
And then also they had a plan for a retailer licensing fee that would fund the program go forward,

646
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:25,069
although we do think that they set it to low so that they might not have been sustainable.

647
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:26,990
But I think it's still going right.

648
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:34,370
Yeah, this about the timing is important too, because Cleveland went before Columbus and Columbus saw what a disaster it was for Cleveland.

649
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:41,570
And they were like, We don't want to do that. And Cleveland, they were reliant on grant funding to support this initiative.

650
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:46,129
This is not an ideal situation for them because it's temporary.

651
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:52,060
It would expire. If you're going to establish a new government obligation, you need to have sustainable funding for it.

652
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:55,100
That's one of the most important implementation questions there is.

653
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:58,910
So absolutely grant your grant money is soft money.

654
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:04,460
Like it's it's there and then it's not. So you're at a total loss if you if you don't get another grant.

655
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:13,670
Right. And so part of the problem here is the differential tax base and the two phases and also the funding prioritization in the same places.

656
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:17,540
And one program got something in support and the other one really didn't.

657
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:24,710
It really made a difference in terms of implementation and enforcement and then you get a much less effective policy.

658
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,979
Yeah. So these are like kind of things that we've been talking about,

659
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:33,500
like licensing that provides like a hard funding source that you can rely on and the Phenix is behind them.

660
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:38,720
So when we were through Michigan Department Health and Human Services, they always like,

661
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:42,440
call me and they're like, okay, this is what the legislators want to do. What do you think about it?

662
01:04:43,070 --> 01:04:47,810
They wanted to do $100 per year and then they said that was too high.

663
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:56,690
So even though like every pack of cigarets is like $10 between five and $10, $100 is way too much and it's probably going to come out of business.

664
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:06,530
Yeah, there's just so many issues and it can take as little as like 115 to $250 to actually implement this.

665
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:09,110
And if you get it from every retailer, then it will support it.

666
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:13,790
But there is such pushback and they were like, Oh no, it has to be like a one time fee of $100.

667
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:18,170
What is that going to do? Yeah, it's it's very difficult.

668
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:22,160
I there is a lot of frustration over the years with Michigan and how they're handling it.

669
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:31,160
Yeah. I mean, this one is we need to find out what the current licensing fee for marijuana businesses.

670
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:33,230
I wonder what, what level they sent that to.

671
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:39,559
And I wouldn't be surprised in the state of Michigan if marijuana is handled by a different company than tobacco.

672
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,620
Tobacco also is a strange thing because it can get put in different committees.

673
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:45,200
So the taxes go to like the Finance Committee.

674
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:52,730
The surprisingly, even if it's a public health thing, sometimes it doesn't go to the like health committee.

675
01:05:53,080 --> 01:06:00,680
It will go instead to the like law enforcement. One very interesting oversight committee is where bills go to die.

676
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:07,010
And you guys have. Yes, you've talked with them about like committees and how much difference it makes?

677
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:12,049
A little bit. A little bit. Are you okay?

678
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:16,360
Is this something you don't understand or.

679
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:22,850
I was just saying, like, the like more now, like I it's legal here,

680
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:32,629
but then still like hospitals and like finance or other has to get their own regulation because I don't

681
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:37,970
want like the surgeon come and do my surgery after having no idea because it's legal in the state.

682
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:44,620
Hopefully the health care will keep, well, a lot of problems because marijuana is not legal federally.

683
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:52,820
It's only legal in the state of Michigan. So the state of Michigan doesn't have a very good governance apparatus to regulate that industry.

684
01:06:53,150 --> 01:07:00,559
They have a license, they charge a licensing fee. And there is certain things that come along with that, but important things.

685
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:04,250
If you are running a marijuana based business like banking, finance,

686
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:09,080
you might run into trouble because you can't keep your business going at your money in a national bank.

687
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:13,310
There are other things that could expose you to litigation as a business owner.

688
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:18,110
And in the same way, there are some things that could expose you to prosecution as an individual.

689
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:23,570
But so so that's why it's a consequence of federalism.

690
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:30,229
If we had not had a national rate over tobacco, 21 states would have a tobacco.

691
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:33,379
21 requirement would be in that same situation.

692
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:41,030
It's the same difficult thing. There's a difference between the national policy and the state policy.

693
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:46,490
We can talk about how want a more authority like because it's a.

694
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:50,200
Interesting. Very, very, very interesting. Yeah,

695
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:56,139
it's also interesting because I went to one of the cannabis shops and because I

696
01:07:56,140 --> 01:08:02,740
just like to poke around and see what's going on and they have removed labeling.

697
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:06,370
So like you could have like candy or things on the front of it.

698
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:12,969
Like you could no longer have a cherry. It had to be colors, it had to be like things like that, which they're not doing for tobacco.

699
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:15,010
So it's just like there is a lot of things are going on.

700
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:24,159
People are so concerned about like people having weed gummies and kids getting a hold of them, but they're not thinking the same way for tobacco.

701
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:32,050
It's very it's very difficult for me to see how much progress there is on marijuana without having any reports of alcohol.

702
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:37,330
Yeah. And of course, the other thing about marijuana is they have built into the legislation some state funding.

703
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:43,920
So the funding stream in terms of sales taxes and other things is more significant for marijuana regulation than it is for tobacco.

704
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:50,470
So that was a big point of legalization, too. It's like you may as well make money off of it if people are using it.

705
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:54,070
Well, that was a big argument for legalization and working together.

706
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:59,110
Yeah, I don't think Trump has a lecture at 10 minutes past.

707
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:03,910
You have some concluding thoughts. Oh, I thought we went to 1130.

708
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:07,910
Oh, I'm so sorry. Hold me back in the day when I took this class.

709
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:16,060
So let me skip ahead and I'm happy to talk about any of your monologue slides.

710
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:22,420
Yeah, no, it's totally fine. I mean, it's more to kind of talk it through.

711
01:09:23,110 --> 01:09:31,240
So these are kind of like my main conclusions that I've come to over my Ph.D. and after my MPH that I've learned about policy work takes a long,

712
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:32,440
long time.

713
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:40,390
So even though you create a lovely, lovely issue brief and you create a lovely thing and somebody expresses interest in might not go anywhere,

714
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:45,880
but in the next legislative session maybe you have a policy champion that you're working with and it can have a stronger chance.

715
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:52,390
So building those connections, knowing people honestly, palate at politics, not what you know, it's for, you know,

716
01:09:53,140 --> 01:10:00,100
a lot of the studies, a lot of it, despite everybody knowing smoking is bad, which we talk about, there's a lot of misinformation.

717
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,690
So like not knowing about nicotine,

718
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:08,300
if you look at vape products like my friend who just started vaping because she might tell possible and I was like, right.

719
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:12,070
It was going on and she's like, Oh, I just like this.

720
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:15,370
And I'm like, you know, it has nicotine. And I just like, Yeah, I guess it does.

721
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:19,810
I was like, You know what concentration of nicotine you're, you know, okay, great.

722
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:25,299
I'm glad I'm making informed decisions with your life, but that's a frustration that I have.

723
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:31,510
And like, if people are going to use this, I feel like they should be knowledgeable and you need to make your case.

724
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:37,510
Why policy is important are like people don't think like they need to do anything else on tobacco.

725
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:42,730
They don't realize it's such a problem. So you have to make your point strongly because even if it makes sense to you,

726
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:46,630
you need to convince them that this is more important than allowing that to happen.

727
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:54,670
And I mean, communication and messaging needs to be consistent because if you have people like so we'll have American

728
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:59,200
Heart Association and campaign for tobacco free kids even though they want to do a similar thing,

729
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:04,300
they have different messaging and that doesn't work. It seems like they don't have their stuff together.

730
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:09,460
And when tobacco companies are coming to you with consistent messaging, it becomes more of a priority.

731
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:17,560
And lastly, implementation evaluation. You need it, you need it, and that needs to be built in from the start of a policy.

732
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:21,760
And if you don't know the right people who are going to do that, you need to reconsider who's on your team.

733
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:30,570
Thank you for that, I'm sure. Right.

734
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:37,380
Well, I'll see you again in the next month's performance evaluation and kind of extend some of these themes.

735
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,760
So you can see to me by the time you get Scott back. Sorry.

736
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:46,010
So I just want to say you like it.

737
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:50,194
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love.
