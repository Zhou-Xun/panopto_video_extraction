00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:16,770
Hello and welcome to data management and visualization in healthcare. I'm Rahul Ladhania, and I will be your instructor for this course.

2
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,340
I'm an assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.

3
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:26,610
I'm primarily affiliated with the Department of Health Management Policy, and I have a secondary affiliation with Biostatistics.

4
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:32,010
My research is in the area of machine learning and causal inference in healthcare and behavior science.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,150
Broadly speaking,

6
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:41,190
I use data driven methods to learn the effects of public policies or technology based interventions on patient outcomes and behavior,

7
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,570
and to identify decision informing patterns from large datasets.

8
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,220
And that's why I am super excited to be teaching you this course, because at its core,

9
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:59,170
this course is about teaching you the tools to be able to efficiently and effectively manage data and to be able to tell interesting stories from it.

10
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:05,680
Imagine that you are a data entry administrator for a newly opened small primary care clinic.

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,430
The key responsibility is documenting and retrieving patient data.

12
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,810
A new patient, Kamala Johnson, shows up for her annual physical.

13
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:20,990
You record the visit data in a simple spreadsheet patient name, date of birth, date and reason for visit.

14
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,480
Among other details. Over time, your clinic takes off.

15
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:32,380
Other patients come in for a variety of reasons and you dutifully record their details in your spreadsheet.

16
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:39,310
Then our first patient, Kamala Johnson, really likes the clinic, and she's back in a month this time for another reason.

17
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:46,970
Moreover, she has moved to a new address and the always diligent you record the visit details with the new address.

18
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:55,040
A few months down the line, you have a visit from Miss Kamala Johnson, this time a different one than the original character in our tale.

19
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,530
And obviously, you'll recall their details too in the all in one place spreadsheet.

20
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,870
The final twist in the tale. Please bear with me, we're almost done.

21
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:10,070
Our original Kamala Johnson, let's call her Kamala-1 she calls the clinic for a prescription refill.

22
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,670
You're asked to check the system to be able to validate her information.

23
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:22,400
You go to your master spreadsheet and do a filter for all entries with the patient name Kamala Johnson, and you get this information.

24
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,630
What is the problem here or what are the problems here? Number one, conflicting values. Which Kamala is it?

25
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:37,160
Where does she stay? Whose information do you use? Do you ask her for more information to be able to uniquely identify her?

26
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:45,140
Number two, redundant information. Do you really need to save Kamala's name and DOB every single time she visits?

27
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:52,850
Then pulling all the data every time we run a search. Over time as the number of patients increase, these problems can escalate.

28
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:58,460
Mistakes can be costly and in healthcare, potentially life threatening. Patients get mixed up,

29
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:04,290
wrong medication or wrong treatment could be sent to the wrong patient. So what can we do about it?

30
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,800
Welcome to data management. In all organization systems,

31
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,830
big or small from the Googles and Amazons of the world to the local health system, a nonprofit,

32
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,340
there is some form of collection, storage, aggregation,

33
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:23,790
manipulation and visualization of data and most importantly, use of that data to make decisions.

34
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,950
Some important questions, then, are how do organizations process this much data?

35
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:34,920
How do they store it? How do they retrieve it? Take the example of a big health system like Michigan Medicine.

36
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,460
Think of the types and amount of data that is being collected and stored,

37
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:43,920
millions of clinical records, insurance claims, physician, resident nurse information, and so on.

38
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,890
How do all those various datasets come together when you show up for your annual physical at Michigan Medicine?

39
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:56,220
The nurse pulls out his fancy tablet, and all your allergies and past prescriptions get retrieved almost instantly.

40
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,990
How does that happen?

41
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:05,160
Is there one massive data set like that spreadsheet that you designed, which the nurse pulls it every single time they have you visiting?

42
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,020
For reasons we discussed above and others, you can see why that might not be the best idea.

43
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:16,410
Moreover, beyond data storage and retrieval, how do organizations use this data for decision making?

44
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:21,390
In the tale of Kamala Johnson's, we discussed what if you, the data entry administrator,

45
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:28,320
wanted to know the number of visits per week to ensure adequate staffing levels as your clinic grows and becomes more popular?

46
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,000
What are the most common reasons patients visit the clinic for?

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,110
This course will try to help answer these questions in this video first, I will introduce databases and database management systems.

48
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:44,540
I will then talk about data visualization and why that is useful for making sense of the data.

49
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:50,000
Finally, I will give you an overview of the structure we will be following in this course.

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,320
Efficient data management typically requires the use of a computer database.

51
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,260
Databases are specialized structures that allow computer systems to store, manage and retrieve data.

52
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:05,150
A database stores two things. First is what we call the end user data.

53
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,740
These are the raw facts of interest to the user in the tail of the two Kamala Johnson's.

54
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,550
That would be patient name, DOB date, and reason of visit.

55
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,590
Second, the database stores the metadata or the data about data.

56
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:26,100
The metadata describes the data characteristics and relationships that link the end user data found within the database.

57
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:32,510
In our example, that would be the type of values: patient name or address should it be stored as a text field,

58
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:40,110
along with the permissible number of characters for each of those fields. The date of the visit has to be stored as a date field and so on.

59
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,380
Next, what is the database management system?

60
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:50,850
So you have the database, we just described the DBMS, or the database management system is the actualization of that database.

61
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:57,060
It is the collection of programs that manages the structure and controls the access to the data stored in the database.

62
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,440
It is the intermediary, the one that speaks with you and with the database.

63
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:08,190
So if you're the end user and there is this big DB with hundreds of tables and data on how these tables interact with each other,

64
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:13,070
the only way for you to access that data is through the DBMS.

65
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,730
This image is an adaptation of a figure from the recommended book for the course.

66
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:23,450
It is the visualization of how the DBMS facilitates an interaction between the end users and the actual database structure.

67
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:29,900
So on the right is the database structure comprising the various tables, patients procedures, diagnoses.

68
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:36,860
The center is the DBMS which presents the end users on the left with a single integrated view of the data and the DB

69
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:43,340
and receives all application requests and translates them into the complex operations to fulfill those requests.

70
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:49,050
It hides much of the databases complexity from the application programs and users.

71
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:54,660
So now, assume we have figured out how to efficiently store, manage and retrieve our data.

72
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,650
What do we do with the data we have been able to efficiently and effectively retrieve?

73
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,660
How do we use it for decision making?

74
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:07,050
From the hospital systems perspective, there could be so many questions they want to answer or have specific needs that they need to be met.

75
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:13,700
How do we translate this data? Raw, unprocessed facts into information that is actionable.

76
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:20,600
The answer: data analysis, it is the process of systematically applying statistical techniques to describe and illustrate,

77
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:26,030
condense and recap and evaluate data. Data visualization is a form of data analysis where

78
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,500
you use graphs for representation of data by using visual elements like charts,

79
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:36,260
graphs and maps. Data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends,

80
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:41,310
outliers and patterns in the data, which can then be used to inform decision making.

81
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,750
There are a variety of computational tools for data analysis and visualization.

82
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,470
The schematic here shows tools by increasing lateral complexity,

83
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:54,900
along with the flexibility we provide in doing intensive data analysis or visualization.

84
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,800
Tools like Microsoft Excel are helpful for lightweight individual analyses.

85
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,690
While programing languages such as C++ are useful for high performance analysis.

86
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:10,500
MS Excel has a neat user interface and a suite of user friendly tools which help in data analysis and visualization.

87
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:18,120
In many organizations, it's the most commonly used tool. The middle ground, where analysis is done by an individual on their own computer.

88
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:26,850
In an exploratory fashion, which can then be transferred to a server for advanced analytics is the domain of R, Python and other scripted languages.

89
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:33,960
In addition to transforming and analyzing data, languages like R can produce amazing graphics and reports with ease.

90
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:41,160
Here is an example of a plot that uses data from the 2018-19 Tobacco Use Supplement plotted as a grid.

91
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:48,600
It visualizes the prevalence of current cigarette use at the intersection of four demographic variables: age, gender, income and race.

92
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:57,270
This was plotted in R using the ggplot2 package. We can clearly see some patterns here, how lower the income, higher the cigarette prevalence.

93
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:03,200
Similarly, there are patterns linking age and race ethnicity with cigarette use also are displayed here.

94
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:10,250
What if I wanted to compare ages more directly? Here is a different view of that plot using the same data as the previous plot.

95
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,660
The difference is that you can within the panels now compare the age groups.

96
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:20,460
We could do this with a super minor tweak in the R code. Finally, here is View three,

97
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:26,220
it sorts all demographic combinations into one single plot to help identify which subgroup is

98
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,890
the most at risk of high cigarette use and which is the least. For some decision making context,

99
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:37,140
one type of plot might be most useful, while for others you might need something else.

100
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,790
Now coming to the course structure, the course is divided into two modules.

101
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:49,830
The first module will focus on databases and database systems. You will learn how to design and implement small to medium relational database systems,

102
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:55,620
learn structured query language or SQL, and how to perform data retrieval using sequel.

103
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:03,470
The second module is focused on data manipulation, analysis and visualization using R and/or Microsoft Excel.

104
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:10,610
You will learn how to use R or Excel to perform basic data manipulation, such as filtering, aggregating, organizing data sets,

105
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:17,330
and you'll learn how to produce specialized graphs to explore and visualize the data in a detailed and statistics oriented manner.

106
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,240
Finally, you will apply these techniques for analyzing,

107
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:27,590
interpreting and communicating data from real world datasets relevant to health care, which we will be doing through a class project.

108
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:34,220
Also, while the primary tool of visualization in this class would be R, and most of the course content in Module two will use that,

109
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,070
I will be dedicating some lecture videos and provide resources for using Excel too.

110
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:45,640
In summary, I'm excited to be beginning this journey with you, and I hope we can together make this an enjoyable and effective learning experience.

111
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,789
Thank you. And look forward to seeing you in the next video.
