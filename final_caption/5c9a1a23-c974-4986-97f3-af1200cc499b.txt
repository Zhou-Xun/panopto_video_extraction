1
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:46,220
We have. To my.

2
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:08,840
I. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:29,730
I get. Now.

4
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:55,020
Now I. I wasn't exactly.

5
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,110
I know it's not. Okay.

6
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:20,730
So why is it that so?

7
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:42,210
Yeah. I thought that was probably the most.

8
00:02:46,270 --> 00:03:02,240
What are. Yeah.

9
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:20,310
You know, I. Yes, I did.

10
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,090
I know you think it's bad.

11
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,040
I guess I can.

12
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:05,430
Test. Test, test.

13
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,980
Can you hear me? Okay? It's okay right now.

14
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,600
Hello? You know, over the years. Yes, it certainly seems to been down here.

15
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,010
I'm sorry. I'm just checking to see if we can keep it down here.

16
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,600
Oh, I don't see one. Yeah, I don't know.

17
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:31,710
Yeah. Thank you. So good morning, everybody, and welcome to HMV 620.

18
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,100
Good to see you all. I hope you've had a good week.

19
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,110
How are you doing? How are you feeling? What's the temperature in the room?

20
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,230
Yeah, I'm overwhelmed.

21
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,210
Yeah, it's starting to really pile up. Yeah.

22
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:56,370
Um, and how are you doing to manage that? How are you doing to manage that?

23
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,210
Starting. Yeah.

24
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,140
It was making lists. Yeah.

25
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:11,890
Um, time management. Yeah, it's a lot of volume, for sure.

26
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,710
Um, and it does start to pile up quickly, and it can.

27
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,780
Is this too loud, by the way? No. Oh, really?

28
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:27,070
If I can make that. Oh, I don't know how to do that.

29
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:38,620
Really? It was just.

30
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,130
Well, it doesn't seem to want to change it.

31
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,650
So. Okay. So I think, you know, time management and being really,

32
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:10,460
really organized really helps think also making sure that you're getting enough sleep, you know, so I mean, which is like an oxymoron, right?

33
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:20,170
Do the work, but get enough sleep and like, how do I do both? But so when I was here in the program, I, a I graduated in 1997.

34
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm embarrassed to tell you that that's a long time ago. Some of you probably weren't even alive then.

35
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:35,200
Um, but I came to this program with a husband and a toddler the age of three and ten years of work experience.

36
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,620
And so that's probably why I have the gray hair.

37
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:48,370
And I found I was feeling pretty overwhelmed in the fall myself just because I was juggling multiple priorities, you know?

38
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:57,010
And I think for us and my husband was a full time graduate student at the same time, so we were eating a lot of macaroni and cheese, I tell you.

39
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:07,930
And, uh, I think being really, really structured and having a plan and, um, and also, um,

40
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,980
uh, making sure to utilize the supports that you have, you know, that are available to you.

41
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:20,620
Um, I mean, there's no magic secret sauce or anything, but it's heavy, but you'll get through it.

42
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,090
And, you know, you wouldn't be here unless everyone believed that you'd be successful.

43
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,460
So, um, but it is, it's, it's a heavy fall and it starts to add up quickly.

44
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,840
But this too shall pass and you won't believe it.

45
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,050
Next thing you know, it'll be December. And it's like, where did the semester go?

46
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:47,890
Um, and, uh, and all the stuff that you're learning right now, um, you really need it, you know, so that you can speak the language and,

47
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:54,160
and you can participate in the conversations and the problem solving, using some of the levers that you're being taught right now.

48
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,950
So but it's but it's heavy, there's no question.

49
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:03,970
Um, but if you can make time for some fun too, because there's nothing like having a little bit of fun to feel recharged.

50
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:09,219
Um, so, uh, but, you know, I'm proud of you all.

51
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:17,380
I mean, it's, it's almost the end of September and, you know, zoom with, you know, I mean, a month is almost already gone.

52
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:24,160
So. And the other thing is, take advantage of your professors and your size.

53
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:37,360
You know, I hear that econ and accounting are heavy right now and so chuckle and you know rich person that comes talk are amazing and and they

54
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,790
want you to come to office hours you know they want to see you they want to help you take advantage of them and that opportunity.

55
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,860
Get your full money's worth for your tuition, you know, outcome.

56
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:53,110
And make sure that if you don't understand and don't understand something, don't let it pile up.

57
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:58,110
Just jump on it. Ask for help. Um, they're there to help you. So.

58
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:05,830
Richard was one of my professors when I was here. I think he must have been a pretty new professor, and I just straight out said,

59
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:11,920
I'm totally intimidated by your course, and because I don't know this language at all, but I really want to learn it.

60
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:17,170
And I just was in his office every week, and and it really helped.

61
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,730
So don't be shy. There's lots of resources.

62
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,800
Take advantage of them. So much for my sales pitch.

63
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,460
Okay. Making connections is what we're talking about today.

64
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:41,420
So some announcements before we get started. If you haven't done so already, please register for the GLC symposium.

65
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,740
You're going to hear me talk to you about that until you are really sick of hearing me.

66
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,360
It's on Friday, October the seventh. That's only three weeks away.

67
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:56,660
There are no classes that day. It's going to be a full day. That's I think you just won't want to miss.

68
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,440
And the deadline is noon on September 30th.

69
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:06,530
It's $15 to register. And for HP students that attend, you get your $15 back.

70
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:13,550
So it's pretty sweet deal. The Makers case competition is on October 21st.

71
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:20,540
McAfee stands for the Midwest chapter of the American College of Healthcare Executives.

72
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:32,810
McAfee and McAfee has a hosts case competition every fall for all the Regional Health Administration programs in Southeast Michigan.

73
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,920
And. And the case competition rotates from school to school.

74
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:43,160
This fall, it's our turn to host it. So it will be here on Friday, October 21st,

75
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:53,719
and there will be opportunities to potentially be on the team helping to support the event or even just going and

76
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,180
watching all the presentations and getting a sense of what's it take to dissect a case and make a presentation.

77
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:07,460
So just keep that on your radar. You'll hear more about that for later and journal prompt.

78
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,750
I didn't give you a journal prompt last week and I promise to give you one every week.

79
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:20,630
So here's one. Today I want you to think about what are strategies that you will use to build your professional network?

80
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:27,380
How do you feel about networking? What can you do to boost your confidence when reaching out to new people?

81
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,230
So if you need some ideas for thinking about journaling this week, there is an idea.

82
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:42,020
I just want to also say some students in the room went to the McAfee emerging leaders event in Detroit this week on Wednesday,

83
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,820
which was just a really great event.

84
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:54,139
And some of the leaders spoke about the importance of journaling in their lives and in their leadership journey and how you can sort

85
00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:01,280
of track your changing thoughts over time and how it's nice to be able to go back and revisit what you were thinking at that time.

86
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:07,040
So it's not just me talking about, yes, you should have a journal and you should be journaling.

87
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:15,140
It's just a decent practice to help you for the long haul as you grow and develop as a leader.

88
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,410
So networking. Do you love it? Do you hate it?

89
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:31,850
How do you feel about it? What barriers or concerns do you have when it comes to networking?

90
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:39,340
Just shout it out. With plenty of time.

91
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,020
It's time consuming. Yeah. Yes.

92
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,760
Most emotionally draining for sure. Takes effort, doesn't it?

93
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:55,040
Yup. What else? It's awkward.

94
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:01,520
Absolutely. Sometimes it's awkward. Sometimes it feels sort of forced and transactional.

95
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:07,760
And we all know we're playing this game, you know? And yeah, it's sometimes it's awkward.

96
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:13,880
What other barriers or concerns do you have about networking? Yes.

97
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:26,340
You know, that's. Yeah.

98
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:30,480
You feel inadequate. You feel like you have to prepare. Yep, for sure.

99
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:35,370
I have felt that way. Absolutely. Any other?

100
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,210
Yes, that, um. Especially if you are someone.

101
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:47,550
If you're rejection. Yeah. Yeah.

102
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:55,300
Yeah. Fear of rejection. Tough when you're an introvert to be putting yourself in sort of an extroverted role.

103
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:59,610
Absolutely. We. Sometimes it's like.

104
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,500
Yeah. Well, and that's sometimes tricky, isn't it?

105
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:13,200
I mean, it's really helpful if you can get a list in advance so you can sort of plan who you think you want to reach out to.

106
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:19,440
Um, but yes, that can be tricky. Yes. So I guess morally would be one of.

107
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,590
Well, you're not using them, you know?

108
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,780
I mean, I think it's I think it can be effective for both parties.

109
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:43,110
But I that's what I try to do. Yeah.

110
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:49,030
Yeah. Any other comments? Okay.

111
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:59,570
So it's a funny sort of thing, isn't it, that not everybody feels universally delighted about networking, but it can be a really powerful thing.

112
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:08,030
We all know we need to do it. We all know that it can be beneficial for us to build strong professional networks.

113
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:16,700
Well, there we go. So networks happen on a networking, happens on a spectrum.

114
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:22,580
Some people are interested in having just a few select folks in their network.

115
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:29,420
And the benefits of that is having deep relationships that are easily called upon and easily nurtured.

116
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,340
But the downside of that is limited scope.

117
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:40,610
When you have just a few really good connections, the other end of the spectrum is many folks.

118
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:45,650
And the benefit is a wide range of options within your network to be able to draw upon.

119
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:53,990
But then the challenges involve maintenance, keeping up with those connections and nurturing those connections.

120
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:02,500
So you really need to be thinking about, you know, what's your personality and what's a plan that's going to work best for you.

121
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:16,440
So today we're going to talk a little bit about networking opportunities where the network and who work to network with.

122
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,270
We're also going to talk about making the connection, reaching out to new contacts.

123
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:26,100
We'll talk about the Tierra method and open ended questions.

124
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,079
Dressing for the occasion, for building relationship and then fostering the connection.

125
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:43,380
Following up timelines and strategies. So seeking networking opportunities make a goal and prepare.

126
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,880
So you want to you want the general advice is to grow your network early, early on.

127
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,360
It's always good to think about the areas you want to connect and what you want to learn.

128
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:04,950
So I think the standard concept is to say you want to grow your garden before you're hungry, you know, and because when you're trying to network,

129
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:14,160
when you're really desperate for an opportunity, it's not as easy to grow a network because people sense that you're anxious and you're concerned.

130
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:19,649
So the best time to be building a network is now when you have the time to focus

131
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:25,380
on that and and you don't have a specific concern on the immediate horizon.

132
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:38,380
So networking is all around us. And what places have you successfully made connections before?

133
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:42,300
Because I know you have networks and I know you've done some of this before.

134
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:51,870
What has worked for you in the past and where where have you made successful connections in your networking experience in the past?

135
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:58,570
Yes. Per me. Extracurricular?

136
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:04,130
Yep. Clubs? Yep. Good idea. Conferences.

137
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:11,310
Conferences, for sure. Yes. He's had cold emails.

138
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,090
Awesome. Great. Yes. Coffee shops.

139
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,340
Coffee shops right after a conference. Well, excellent. If you want to build community organizations, great.

140
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:30,080
Yes. My job is probably not only that, but if you work with.

141
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:39,850
Of. Yeah. Awesome.

142
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:44,040
Oh, that's great.

143
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:50,580
Starting with people, you know. He was like your undergraduate education alumni.

144
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:57,220
Great. You guys should teach this class. You got it all figured out. Is there somebody back here?

145
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:02,560
No. Anybody else? No.

146
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,830
Okay, well, what a great list. So you guys are on the way.

147
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,970
So lots of lots of places where you could be looking to build your network.

148
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:23,320
So at school here at UVM, you could be networking with faculty and staff, peers, student organizations, alumni, employers.

149
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,610
You could ask for a mentor. You could attend talks.

150
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:37,180
You could follow up with guest lectures. You could talk to faculty about their research interests and hope to be connected through that online.

151
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,549
There's the Public Health Connect platform, which I think you've heard about recently from Tara.

152
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:47,020
Eleanor for the public at the school level with LinkedIn.

153
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:52,030
There's an alumni group, the HP alumni group on LinkedIn.

154
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:55,800
Actually, that's something you should join.

155
00:19:55,810 --> 00:20:00,820
I would encourage you to do that. The HP Alumni Group on LinkedIn.

156
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:08,770
I think it's HP department. Um, just check it out and see if you can find it.

157
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,550
If you can't, let me know what, I can send it. Send a message through campus.

158
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:18,870
I'm one of the owners of that group, and I would strongly encourage you to request to join the group,

159
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:26,080
and I'll approve you because it's a way to be able to connect with other HP alum who are pretty active.

160
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:33,850
So LinkedIn has is a great source and the alumni group in the HP group.

161
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:41,409
There's also a School of Public Health alumni group that I don't think you can join until after your first semester.

162
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:46,870
But I but I know you can join the HP alumni group right now and I would encourage you to do so.

163
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:56,379
Other places you can connect to our previous roles professional associations, conferences, case study panels and personal relationships.

164
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,070
All things that you've suggested. Professional associations.

165
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:05,470
What professional associations might you consider joining now that you're in this program?

166
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:11,470
What are some organizations that you're aware of? Is is one for sure.

167
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:21,590
It's a large one. Any others? OC apa.

168
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:31,640
The American Public Health Association is another h f m a health finance, management and accounting.

169
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:36,499
Uh, I think it's something like that. Health Finance Management Accounting Association.

170
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:44,410
HFM Um, there are a number of organizations and actually I think I listed them in the syllabus, uh,

171
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:51,319
for this course you might refer to that and I'll update that on canvas when I, when I catch up on canvas.

172
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,460
But there are a number of organizations out there that could be useful for you to join,

173
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:01,610
and I would encourage you to investigate them and pick one because you can't join them all.

174
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:10,849
It's expensive, but most of them have student rates and it's useful to join at least one just to get connected and see what

175
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:16,700
resources that are available for you as a student and opportunities to network with other professionals.

176
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,910
So making the connection, reaching out to contacts.

177
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:30,140
So one way that you can reach out to people is through an email.

178
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,520
Someone mentioned they've had big success with cold emails.

179
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:39,460
And I hear this is from Steve Dalton's, the two hour job search.

180
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:46,720
The five point email is a strategy that works very nicely for reaching out to someone that you don't know.

181
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:57,400
It's 100 words or less. You don't mention anything about jobs either in the subject or the body of the email, and the connection always goes first.

182
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:05,170
For example, you want to make make sure that you're highlighting the University of Michigan School of Public Health and Connection.

183
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:09,880
You want to generalize your interest and then gain control over the follow up.

184
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:18,400
So here's an example of what that looks like. So Durham is alumni alumna.

185
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,990
So the connection goes first. My name is Clement Chen.

186
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,590
I'm a graduating student who found your information on LinkedIn for the school.

187
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,520
Okay, so you've already said right at the top who you are and how you're connected.

188
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:39,230
And then you're going to say, May I have 20 minutes to ask about your experience with Kaiser Permanente?

189
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:45,460
You're specifically asking what you need, and it's very straightforward and easy to understand.

190
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,720
I'm trying to learn about managed care companies in California.

191
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,220
Your insights would be would be very helpful.

192
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,330
So your generalizing, your interest, you're saying what you would like and why, and you're being quite specific.

193
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,419
And then you're maintaining control of the follow up saying, I recognize this may be a busy time,

194
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:09,970
so if you're unable to connect by email, I'll try to reach you next week to see if that's more convenient.

195
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,810
Thank you for your time. So it's brief, it's specific.

196
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:19,479
And, and, and it's very clear you want to keep it less than 100 words.

197
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,740
So they're going to read it. And you do not mention anything about a job.

198
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:35,800
And why would you not do that? Why would you not mention anything about a job? Very transaction, very transactional.

199
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:41,469
And it might be a turnoff. You know, it might be, oh, I don't know anything about jobs right now.

200
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,560
You know, they may not know. That's right.

201
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,780
They may have no control of information about that.

202
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:52,569
And so if you're busy and you're looking at have like, oh, I can't help them with that, you know, move on to the next thing.

203
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:57,730
But if it's just a straight request for information, you know, that could be an easy and enjoyable ask.

204
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:08,070
So. Networking. Introductions. Best practices.

205
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:12,180
Things to remember, especially when making new connections online.

206
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:19,469
Note how you know each other. So in lieu of this, shared groups or interests make sure you say how you found them.

207
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:28,080
So if you don't have a specific connection, just highlight how you found their name and why you're reaching out to them specifically.

208
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:33,450
Be honest with the Why are you asking for an informational interview?

209
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:41,910
Are you interested in their industry perspective? Would you like to know about projects or experience that they have?

210
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:48,990
Be specific and be honest about why you're trying to reach out to them and then show you did your homework,

211
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:54,570
reference their profile on LinkedIn or wherever you found information about them.

212
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:03,550
Okay. Building the relationship. Think about what you want to know.

213
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:14,740
Okay. What do you want to know? Think about questions you generally you genuinely want to talk about and how will you contribute to the conversation.

214
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:23,500
So you want to be thinking about what kind of information do you hope to learn from networking or how have you used networking in the past?

215
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:29,890
So be very, very organized and prepared and and intentional.

216
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:44,370
So in planning for a conversation or an informational interview, you can use the Tierra method.

217
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,000
Who is does this sound familiar? Do you know what the Tierra method is?

218
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,510
Have you heard of this before? No.

219
00:26:52,620 --> 00:27:03,320
It's an acronym. So it stands for trends, insights, advice, resources and assignments.

220
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,770
And so I just put an example of each of a question under each one,

221
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:11,210
but there are several examples and I'll include that as handouts on the canvas website.

222
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,410
So trends, you know, what does a typical day like look like for you?

223
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:21,080
That could be an example that you could sort of start off the conversation with insights.

224
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:30,860
You know, what do you find most fulfilling in the work that you do or what are conversely, you know, what are what are some of the challenges, advice?

225
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:40,490
What experiences led you to this role? And by extension, you know, what experiences would you suggest I try to collect or acquire to be?

226
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:45,500
If I'm interested in cultivating a career like yours and resources,

227
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,370
what trade journals or professional organizations would you recommend that I investigate?

228
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,020
And then assignments? What courses have proved to be the most valuable?

229
00:27:54,890 --> 00:28:00,980
What skills have proved to be the most valuable valuable that you that I should acquire while I'm in graduate school, that sort of thing.

230
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:08,990
So it's just a a handy way to think about how you plan your conversation so you have specific things to ask them.

231
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:17,890
So utilizing this chair method, you start off with open ended questions.

232
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:21,640
You start with soft topics. How was your day with the highlight of your week?

233
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:28,030
If you're in an in-person event and you're at a conference, you're at the GLC symposium on October 7th.

234
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:34,630
You could say, How do you like the event so far? How's your retirement Michigan been?

235
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,940
Nice to be back. You know, those kinds of things just to sort of get the conversation going.

236
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:47,080
And then you can build into deeper questions as the conversation warms up and you move forward.

237
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:56,090
So a few topics to avoid controversial things like religion and politics.

238
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:03,799
I think that goes without saying personal things like partners and children and

239
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,430
questions about an employer's competition because that could get a little bit sticky.

240
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:17,510
Conversations that shift towards hobbies and non-related work issues are a lot of fun, but they most often don't start there.

241
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:25,040
So try to keep some of those suggestions from the TR method in mind as you think about how you plan your conversation.

242
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:35,590
So addressing the part, prepare for the day that you have ahead of you.

243
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:42,700
So business professional in situations where you'll be formally formally evaluated such as interviews,

244
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:54,670
you want to wear a professional business, professional attire. And so that usually is a suit, a jacket and pants or a jacket and a skirt for women.

245
00:29:55,330 --> 00:30:03,790
Or it can be. There are a broad range of things that you could wear, and the Careers Office actually has some really good guidelines on that.

246
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:09,850
But it's I think, you know what it is, you know, it's it's pretty straightforward.

247
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:18,580
And then there's business casual, which is for less formal events like information sessions or an informational interview.

248
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:26,349
And that might be like a sports jacket and and and pants for women.

249
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:31,600
There's a little more flexibility in terms of color and and then, you know,

250
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,580
items that you might wear and then smart, casual, let's say speakers coming for a guest lecturer in your class.

251
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:44,409
And they they're either in the work they work in the field that interests you and you want to, um, and they have good connections to the field.

252
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:50,980
You might consider just upping your game a little bit that day, knowing that you want to approach them and have a conversation.

253
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:03,650
So having mentioned a little bit about attire, let's talk about bias and perception.

254
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:09,770
So health care is a pretty traditional field historically in terms of professionalism.

255
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:15,560
And but I think expectations are changing and I think that it's it's flexing a little.

256
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:29,180
And so I think it's important to understand what the norms are so that you can make intentional decisions about what you're comfortable with the most.

257
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:35,600
So I think thinking about your identity and how you want to show up in that space is important.

258
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:38,850
What tradeoffs might you be making? How are you achieving your goals?

259
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:47,990
So I have a friend who loves to wear bright colors all the time, and I have a bright color on today and I had a bright color on on Wednesday.

260
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:51,740
That's not actually historically me. I wear a lot of black.

261
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,799
Typically, I have two Labrador retrievers that are black.

262
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,820
So I'm covered a dog hair all the time and I don't want anybody to know about it.

263
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:08,330
So black's an easy color to wear for me, but I have recently decided that I need to up my game and inject a little bit of color into my clothing.

264
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:12,890
But I have a friend who wears bright colors all the time, you know, big chunky jewelry, you know,

265
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:19,430
and bright colored scarves and, you know, bright green, bright pink, red, you know, just all kinds of colors.

266
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:26,510
And to ask her to wear a straight navy blue suit would not be in line with her personality at all.

267
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,660
She'd be quite uncomfortable, and it just wouldn't float.

268
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:34,520
And so she's able to carry off this big, bold look because that's who she is.

269
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:41,240
And it's just seems right, you know? And so and she looks very professional all the time.

270
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:47,000
Um, on the other side of the coin, you know, my husband, who's at the Rascal business,

271
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:57,530
always wears a collared shirt with cufflinks, usually a jacket and a tie, and is usually pretty, pretty buttoned down guy.

272
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:04,129
And, and that's just who he is and that's the environment that he's in.

273
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,230
And he's sort of expected to show up that way.

274
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:12,620
So I think I think there's a range and I think getting a sense of what the range is in the in the in the

275
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:17,899
organization or the work setting that you're going to be in or the social setting that you're going to be in.

276
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:24,590
Getting a sense of what that is in advance is very helpful so that you know how to plan what you're going to do.

277
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:31,940
And just another short story. When my husband was he did a Ph.D. here at Michigan at the business school.

278
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:42,440
And when he went on the job market, he he used to wear an earring and ride a motorcycle.

279
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:49,819
And he was, you know, pretty cool guy. And he went on the job market and he was going to be showing up at other universities and business schools,

280
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,510
making presentations, hoping to be hired as a business school professor.

281
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:59,330
And he'd say to me, Do you think I should wear my earring? And I said, Well, it depends what your objective is.

282
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:03,170
You know, if your objective is to look pretty cool.

283
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:12,950
Yeah, sure, where are you wearing? But if you're not sure how you're going to be received as you're making your job talk and hoping to be hired,

284
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:17,720
maybe you want to take it out because maybe, you know, that could be a barrier for you.

285
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:24,800
And anyway, he ended up taking it out for all of his interviews when he got his job.

286
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,730
Any sort of was there for a little while and he realized, you know, it's still okay.

287
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:33,560
You know, you went back in and it was fine. It depends on the university.

288
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:38,770
That's right. Depends. You know, so everything but the bottom line is it depends.

289
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:45,409
Right. And so it's just always a good idea to be sensitive to the setting that you, you know,

290
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:52,790
you're going to be in or that you want to be in and aware of your own preferences and just be aware of,

291
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:59,420
you know, what potential trade offs you might be making. But you also want to be really comfortable, you know, and you want to be yourself.

292
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,960
So I just felt like I needed to say that.

293
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:16,200
So introductions. This is just talking about having a conversation with someone.

294
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:32,220
And we've talked a little bit about, uh, doing a cold call email and having a conversation with someone, um, for a networking situation.

295
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:45,000
I have a handle here and I, I'm going to pass it out because I want you to think a little bit about what, what an elevator pitch might look like.

296
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:51,630
And this whole session isn't on elevator pitches, and there are sessions that you can do on elevator pitches.

297
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:56,130
Um, actually, I should have one of those copies myself. Can you pass me one, please?

298
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:06,839
Thank you. But I think, you know, it's good to be to have to have a focused,

299
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:12,870
short blurb about yourself that you can that you can be ready to deliver on a moment's notice when you're in

300
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:19,740
a social situation and whether that's at a conference or whether you're meeting someone for the first time.

301
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:30,120
And it's just basically to be very clear about who you are and what you hope to do and let them know what your interests are.

302
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:40,850
So I've given you a handout that talks about a networking introduction and five things to consider the where you were, you know,

303
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:50,880
what kind of setting are you in, who you are, the what you want, who you are, you're speaking to, and what you have to offer.

304
00:36:52,110 --> 00:37:02,510
So just flipping the page. I want you to take 5 minutes and think about who you are.

305
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:09,500
What you have to offer. What problem is to be solved?

306
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,770
I mean, are you interested in getting information? Would you like connections?

307
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:19,970
Would you like to learn about their story? And what are some some contributions that you could make to the conversation?

308
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:24,890
And why should the listener be what should the listener be doing as a result of hearing this?

309
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:37,220
So there are some examples down below of short sort of 32nd pitches that someone might deliver if they were meeting someone for the first time.

310
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:46,099
And I'm asking you to think about this for 5 minutes, because then I'm going to ask you to lean to your partner next to you and then

311
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:51,080
share your little pitch that you have just sort of spontaneously put together.

312
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:58,010
And I'm not getting a lot of time to do this because, you know, when you're in a conference setting and you're meeting someone for the first time,

313
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,710
you might have an organized pitch in your head or someone might throw you a curveball and they might say.

314
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:08,240
Cathy Kelly, it's so nice to meet you. So what's your passion?

315
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:14,390
I was asked that once and it totally brought me to a standstill.

316
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:18,229
What's my passion? I stood there and kind of went.

317
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,870
But, uh, uh. But, uh, but uh. And, and, you know,

318
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:26,690
now I have an answer for it because I've been asked and I'm sharing it with you because you might be asked and now you can think about it,

319
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,870
have an answer so that you can talk about what it what excites you professionally.

320
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:36,560
Maybe it's not a thing that excites you professionally.

321
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,860
Maybe you love making certain bread, you know, maybe you love birds, you know, maybe you love, I don't know,

322
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:50,930
football, but you might have a passion and it's okay if it's not work related or school related.

323
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,060
The think about what that answer might be.

324
00:38:53,660 --> 00:39:05,330
So, okay, so for the next 5 minutes, I want you to think about how you would introduce yourself in a 32nd blurb looking at some of these examples.

325
00:39:06,050 --> 00:42:03,590
Okay. So I'll give you some time to think about this. There's just another sample up on the screen here, too, to help you out.

326
00:43:09,960 --> 00:45:11,700
Yeah. Are we doing?

327
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:19,889
Are you almost finished? It's a side note about passion.

328
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:24,570
What's your passion? Professor Joe Horton, who who spoke to you last week.

329
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:31,200
If you were to ask him what his passion was, I think he'd say helping to grow strong leaders.

330
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:36,840
But he'd also say music. He loves the Beatles and he's always singing.

331
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:53,390
And so I know he's very passionate about music. It could be.

332
00:45:53,420 --> 00:46:02,120
Sure. Yeah, it's it's really great if you can sort of if you can sort of figure out how to bring the two together.

333
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,950
That's ideal. But. But it's okay if it's not a work thing.

334
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:40,990
Okay. So I think probably most of you are mostly done.

335
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:51,070
So I'd like you to turn to your partner or someone nearby and exchange your elevator pitches.

336
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:56,290
You give yours and you listen to them. And let's just practice this.

337
00:47:06,390 --> 00:48:18,600
Yeah. I.

338
00:48:22,670 --> 00:49:20,410
You. I.

339
00:52:26,620 --> 00:53:33,160
Yeah. So.

340
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:31,550
Okay. Okay, okay.

341
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:41,150
How did that go? I heard some very nice pitches over there on the other side of the room.

342
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:46,070
Who is who's brave enough to want to offer their pitch to the room?

343
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:50,080
Who's ock Greg standing with.

344
00:54:53,550 --> 00:55:08,680
Hi. My name is. Well after what you said about the operation.

345
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:14,650
At. Awesome. Very nicely done.

346
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:18,090
Very clear. Very straightforward. Yeah.

347
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:23,220
Big round of applause. Well done. Big points for going first to.

348
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:29,490
Who else wants to share theirs? Don't be shy.

349
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:37,380
It's a safe group of friends here. One more brave person.

350
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:41,330
Yes. Good job. All right.

351
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:45,890
Hi. My name is Louis. I'm a Services Administration, the University of Michigan.

352
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:51,080
Uh, I'm interested in hospital administration improving the patient provider care experience

353
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:56,840
over at Davis based Health Care Administration Operations and Health Program Management.

354
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:02,360
Uh, I recognize the need for many classes that will improve the patient experience.

355
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:11,940
Very nice, very nice. Very specific. How about a round of applause?

356
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:18,210
Thank you. Well done. Now, that's two people that have a chunk of experience.

357
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:24,810
How about someone that has is maybe straight out from undergrad, doesn't have experience yet and wants to practice their pitch.

358
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:40,800
Yes. Okay. Well done. So, Brandon, grad student.

359
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:50,990
Um. My only goal is to make.

360
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:17,620
Know, passenger. Well done.

361
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:21,300
Okay. Very nice. Very nice.

362
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:27,190
Is there one more person who'd like to volunteer? Yes.

363
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:48,990
Any advice about that for LinkedIn? Yeah, we're just. Like a bio.

364
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:57,670
So for. I think it's usually a good idea to be first person.

365
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:06,070
Um, but I would check in with career services about that for, for bios and LinkedIn just to get their most current advice about that.

366
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:13,300
I mean, it sometimes seems a little bit forced to, to, to talk about yourself in anything other than the first person.

367
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:17,440
Um, um, but, but I would encourage you to go and explore that.

368
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:25,240
Good question, though. Another question that I heard was what about using technical language and and jargon in your pitch?

369
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:29,980
And I think the answer to that is Reed Read who you're talking to.

370
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:35,590
In general, I would say no. In general, it's a good idea to be sort of straightforward.

371
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:39,070
Matter of fact, um. And not too heavy on jargon use.

372
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:43,510
Why would that be? Why would you want to avoid jargon in most situations?

373
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:52,210
Informal, but also informal. I do.

374
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:54,890
A lot of you weren't you didn't want to seem robotic.

375
00:58:54,890 --> 00:59:01,220
And I think sometimes using too much jargon just can be off putting because it kind of looks like you're really trying hard to impress them.

376
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:08,659
And and, you know, you could be telling me all kinds of, you know, jargon that, you know, is very, very technical.

377
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:15,379
And I don't understand a word of any of the acronyms you're using and you'll lose me, you know, because I can't follow you.

378
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:17,300
And I don't know really, I don't know what you're talking about.

379
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:22,580
But if you talk in sort of straightforward conversational language, I think that that'll get you further.

380
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:25,610
But read the room and read the person that you're talking to.

381
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:32,120
If they if they're eager to talk jargon, then you can certainly insert that into into what you're talking about.

382
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:35,990
Well, very nicely done. I'm really impressed.

383
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:44,630
This is it's just really good to have not a canned but a prepared blurb about yourself so that when you're meeting people for the first time,

384
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:50,960
it very just comfortably flows and you feel confident expressing who you are.

385
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:58,490
So fostering connections, following up and making use of the contacts that you make.

386
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:04,250
So if you're going if you're doing an interview, an informational interview with someone,

387
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:08,030
you immediately want to thank them by sending them a thank you note.

388
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:11,840
And you can send that by email. I mean, that's that's the quickest.

389
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:16,220
It used to be that a handwritten note was the order of the day.

390
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:21,649
And if you have if you're if you're doing an in-person visit to their office,

391
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:24,740
you could have a handwritten note ready to go that you could drop before you go.

392
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:31,370
That's a very nice touch. It will set you apart from others. But but it's not an essential thing.

393
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:37,370
You know, sending an email thank you note immediately is really most appreciated and thank you notes.

394
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:42,260
People don't get enough of them and they really appreciate it when they receive them.

395
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:49,220
It'll set you apart. And then one week later you can follow up on any additional questions or immediate

396
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:56,870
action items if there's something that was just sort of left out there. And and that's good hygiene to to make sure that you do follow up.

397
01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:06,020
And then as needed, you can follow up on action items or new developments in your career or your life or your your educational progress.

398
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:16,700
Just to to keep in touch so that you keep that contact warm and just even if it's just sharing information I'd like to tell you about.

399
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:21,950
You know, I just recently did my Lean Six Sigma Green Belt certification,

400
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:27,950
and I'm really excited about how I'm going to be able to apply that in my next work experience or something like that.

401
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:33,139
There's there's a video here. It's called Closing the Loop Technique.

402
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:37,760
And when I post these slides, I'll also call out that video.

403
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:46,580
So it's something that you can easily watch. It's a it's a technique for staying in touch in an efficient way with a new contact.

404
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:53,480
This guy is great. He is. He's very entertaining. Thank you.

405
01:01:56,850 --> 01:02:03,120
And then strategies for updating and engaging with your network posts and engagement opportunities on LinkedIn.

406
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:10,709
That's a really helpful tool. You know, LinkedIn and you can share announcements, you know, you've got a new job,

407
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:14,820
you have a new experience, you attended a conference, how did you feel about it?

408
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:17,880
What did you learn? You read a paper, what did you take away from that?

409
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:24,030
You went to a talk that seems to be sort of a standard thing that people like to

410
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:30,690
post about with their commentary and or maybe developments in your in your company,

411
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:35,160
that kind of thing. You can ask about developments within their company.

412
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:46,469
Also, that's useful strategy, but I think I'm noticing that because there's there's a whole science to keeping your profile up on LinkedIn.

413
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:49,620
Perhaps many of you already are doing this and are aware of it.

414
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:56,219
But there's there's a guy over at Michigan Medicine and I might have him come speak to you.

415
01:02:56,220 --> 01:03:03,810
He he has a strategy where he posts at least once a week on LinkedIn and he's posting commentary and experiences

416
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:12,330
and sharing news and and it helps to keep his profile elevated and so that he gets noticed more for opportunities.

417
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:17,280
And it's just an interesting strategy to that.

418
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:27,359
It can be very effective. And then, you know, in terms of keeping in touch with your contacts and your updates, another strategy is to send a year,

419
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:33,540
year end update the individual that I was telling you about who likes to wear really bright colors and chunky jewelry and,

420
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:44,390
you know, bright scrubs and stuff. She always she's a real introvert and she always publishes a year end update that she sends to all of her contacts.

421
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,910
You know, here's what I did this year. Here are my accomplishments I'm really excited about.

422
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:52,830
Here are the things that are on the horizon that I'm I'm really hopeful for.

423
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:59,650
And it's interesting. I mean, it's short and it's informative and we all know where she's at, you know,

424
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:05,400
and it's kind of an interesting strategy to to keep her, you know, on on your on your radar.

425
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:16,920
So that's all I have for today. And we're finished a little early.

426
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:22,290
Are there any questions at all? Any comments, any thoughts about some of the things we talked about today?

427
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:31,490
Yes. So how do you reconcile? The also.

428
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:52,050
So I don't know that they're different. I mean, I think being prepared as possible is possible as you go for it to reach out to people.

429
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:59,340
I think if you're going to be reaching out to folks, you do your homework, you decide who you want to reach out to and why.

430
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,490
If it's like a school coach. We don't.

431
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:14,380
You know, we can't. So a cold approach like, say, at a conference, for example.

432
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:21,790
So something that you can do at a conference is if they publish, who is going to be attending?

433
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:28,390
You can sort of scan that list in advance and identify who you might most want to speak to.

434
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:31,870
So, for example, for the symposium on the seventh,

435
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:40,090
I'll be publishing probably later today or tomorrow the current list of who's attending, and it'll be on the website.

436
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:44,800
And so you can scan that list and see, Oh, gee, I see that so-and-so is going to be there.

437
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:50,950
I would really like to talk to them because I'm interested in their organization and the kind of work that they do.

438
01:05:51,340 --> 01:06:00,520
So that's something that you can plan ahead to do if if you are in a situation where you're chatting with people at a at a at a function,

439
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:04,509
and then all of a sudden you you have an opportunity to talk to someone.

440
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:07,870
You don't know who they are. That will happen frequently.

441
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:13,790
You'll get introduced to someone. And I mean, you can just sort of use that to your method, you know,

442
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:19,880
as you're thinking in your head and and ask them questions about tell me about the work that you do.

443
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:24,490
You know, what really gets you excited? What's challenging? What are some of the trends in your industry right now?

444
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:29,890
If I were interested in pursuing a similar field, what would you recommend that I do?

445
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:34,960
You know, just I would I would just sort of adlib thinking about that structure in your head.

446
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:41,530
Does that help? Okay. Seemed like it was maybe not the greatest answer, but, um.

447
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:48,740
I'm trying my best. Any other questions? Well, thank you.

448
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:57,740
So for class recordings for this class, I did a Zoom recording the first week that seems to have gone missing, and so I just try to find it for me.

449
01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:05,600
The recording from last week, I know where it is and I'll be posting it coming forward.

450
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:09,500
They're all going to be Panopto recordings and they'll be and it's automatically

451
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:14,360
happening with the album turning on so they'll be all on the campus site with Panopto.

452
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:20,510
There will be the occasional time when we meet remotely again next week.

453
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:26,000
We're having a visitor coming from Ochsner Health System in New Orleans, Louisiana,

454
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,240
and he's going to talk about leadership and social determinants of health.

455
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:32,570
Michael Feld is the CEO and EVP there.

456
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:41,090
He's just a really great guy and and has just has such an interesting story to share so that I think you'll find interesting.

457
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:50,389
And then the following week, we're going to talk with Cassia Colvard, who's a young alum from Tempe, who's had a really interesting career so far.

458
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:55,340
And she's going to talk about how to get prepared for analyzing a case.

459
01:07:55,910 --> 01:08:02,090
And that's just really good stuff to be exposed to because maybe you're interested in competing in a case competition.

460
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:08,629
Maybe you're not sure about how to analyze a case for class because there's going to be that sort of opportunity throughout your

461
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:14,810
course work here in HP and just having someone walk you through how you can attack and dissect a case is really useful stuff.

462
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:21,080
That will be a remote class because she's in New York City. But and we'll use Zoom for that.

463
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:25,940
So all every week, if there's going to be something changing, I'll let you know.

464
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:30,250
I'll send you an announcement and canvas will get updated this week.

465
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:35,750
This weekend. Sorry. So, um, I hope that that's all good.

466
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:38,980
Anyway, listen, have a great week. Have a lovely weekend.

467
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:44,570
I hope that you can get a little bit of rest and a little bit of play in while you're getting all your work done.

468
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:49,490
Enjoy the weather. I think it's going to be nice. Um, and I'll see you next week.

469
01:08:53,350 --> 01:09:03,220
Yeah. My father.

470
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:10,560
Can you feel sure?

471
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:19,370
So I know you think. Oh, yes.

472
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:26,570
Yes, I know, I know. Yeah, yeah.

473
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:34,370
Yeah, I do. Okay. Okay. I think that.

474
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:49,040
What? You. Yeah.

475
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:55,060
Hi. This is my house.

476
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:14,420
Yes. Hi. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

477
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:31,200
Um, I. I don't know how to turn it off. Um, I'm just going to shut down this.

478
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:46,390
You're. Yeah.

479
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:53,480
So that's a long. Let's walk away from this.

480
01:10:53,500 --> 01:11:03,010
What I'll do before this report gets posted will try to get everybody reported to.
