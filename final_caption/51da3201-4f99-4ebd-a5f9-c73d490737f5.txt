1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:05,679
I promised I would leave you with some basic message not sort of nihilistic about

2
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:07,040
the whole thing.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,287
What do you do with the fact that they have all this jelly,

4
00:00:11,287 --> 00:00:16,702
one is trying to get excited that's okay, there's a lot to solve here.

5
00:00:16,702 --> 00:00:20,930
But some basic requirements are, is you wanna design an indicator where it's

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,661
easier to fix the problem, underlying the indicator than the game.

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,722
The ideal thing you can do,

8
00:00:27,722 --> 00:00:31,171
from the point of view of providers make is design your system so it's easier for

9
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:33,861
them to fix the problem than to come up with some way to game it.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,740
You need to get to know the data really well.

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,633
So, this is one of my basic problems with this new field of data science.

12
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:46,805
There's the way it's working is you got computer geeks

13
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:51,274
who are kind of going around and dabbling in a bunch of different domain areas.

14
00:00:51,274 --> 00:00:55,777
And they don't really know anything about the data sets that they're pulling from.

15
00:00:55,777 --> 00:00:58,993
If not you're gonna be a data scientist, you have to really engage with the data

16
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:01,840
that you have to know where it comes from, how it gets there.

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,723
As a manager you guys have to say,

18
00:01:03,723 --> 00:01:07,438
where did that number come from, are we sure it's a real number?

19
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:13,492
No, is it possible that this isn't measuring what we think it's measuring,

20
00:01:13,492 --> 00:01:17,528
and you have to decide about when the data is broken,

21
00:01:17,528 --> 00:01:21,586
you have to decide is it worth paying to try to fix it.

22
00:01:21,586 --> 00:01:24,130
You wanna direct reporting and incentives at the right level.

23
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,700
So that's that issue of, find where the variability is, and that's likely to be

24
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,611
one of the areas where both the answers to why there's variability and

25
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:35,540
the solutions are gonna be directed.

26
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,831
Some of them are about the way the clinic is organised, so

27
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:41,200
directing it at the position, they can't affect the organisation of the clinic.

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,360
You need to change the organisation and clinic,

29
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,951
sometimes it's the way the system about the clinic work.

30
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,454
Sometimes it's about regional differences,

31
00:01:49,454 --> 00:01:52,992
populations when there's very little you're gonna be able to do that.

32
00:01:52,992 --> 00:01:56,840
And you wanna quantify and report the lack of precision.

33
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,740
You need to know, if you can't distinguish between units because you don't

34
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,826
wanna apply a very strong incentive when you can't distinguish between units.

35
00:02:04,826 --> 00:02:08,661
And you need to know, how much signal to noise you actually have.

36
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:16,107
And the last one was, if you have an imprecise measure it doesn't mean you

37
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:22,840
can't use it, it's just you wanna have a relatively mild incentive applies here.

38
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,746
You can still want it, there's a lot you can gain sometimes and

39
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:31,241
just really kind of minor levels of recognition if people believe in what

40
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:33,480
it is you're trying to measure.

41
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,461
I think it's important,

42
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:38,040
I think it's important to prevent pressure ulcers in the hospital.

43
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,077
The fact that you can't measure whether I do or not,

44
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,510
doesn't mean that I don't want to improve pressure ulcers.

45
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,722
And, if I got a stock star regulated Dr cooper had the best rate of pressure

46
00:02:47,722 --> 00:02:53,940
ulcers on his service this month isn't that great, I feel good about it.

47
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,866
It wouldn't matter much whether I actually did or didn't but

48
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:58,561
I would say I got to stand up to this.

49
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,903
But you don't wanna have some huge incentive based on something that's

50
00:03:05,903 --> 00:03:07,361
a complete practual.

51
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,087
So let's go back to Wachter's bend to finish up.

52
00:03:13,087 --> 00:03:19,178
He sort of concluded it, with this in 2000 shortly before he died,

53
00:03:19,178 --> 00:03:24,040
Avedis Danabedian was asked his view on equality.

54
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,632
What this hard nosed scientist answered, is shocking at first and

55
00:03:28,632 --> 00:03:30,854
then somehow it seems obvious.

56
00:03:30,854 --> 00:03:34,799
This is nice because you get a little bio,

57
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,311
the media full public health care is considered

58
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:44,072
one of the early qualities research scientists.

59
00:03:44,072 --> 00:03:49,356
But the quote he came up with was this,

60
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:53,329
the secret quality is love.

61
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:57,589
Which is kind of Vietnam because is much more deeper finger, I mean it's a nice

62
00:03:57,589 --> 00:04:01,609
sentiment, but it's not very helpful or it doesn't tell you very much.

63
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:07,313
And, actually if you look at the article which I remember that he was referring to,

64
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,921
this was an interview with Donabed and

65
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:12,880
when he was dying of cancer end of his life.

66
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,266
And he had had a lot of health care in the hospital

67
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:23,385
very near here, and he wasn't all that happy

68
00:04:23,385 --> 00:04:28,370
with the personal character observation,

69
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,110
but it's really more nuanced than this.

70
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,797
Systems awareness and system design are important for health professionals, but

71
00:04:36,797 --> 00:04:37,550
are not enough.

72
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,922
And by that, he's talking about the whole sort of measurement enterprise and

73
00:04:41,922 --> 00:04:43,587
trying to redesign systems.

74
00:04:43,587 --> 00:04:45,340
They're enabling mechanism.

75
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,947
It's the ethical, what he called the ethical dimension,

76
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:50,671
of individuals that's essential to the system's success.

77
00:04:50,671 --> 00:04:56,041
And this is really, what it is and the love parties are explained what

78
00:04:56,041 --> 00:05:01,421
you gotta love your profession, you got to love what you're doing.

79
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:04,447
It's really talking about intrinsic motivation.

80
00:05:04,447 --> 00:05:08,589
I think the real challenge here, and particularly for

81
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:12,552
people who are managers and clinical enterprises,

82
00:05:12,552 --> 00:05:16,254
is you want to engage people in the measurement.

83
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:19,838
You gotta get them, find the things that they're interested in,

84
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:21,580
that they wanna try to improve.

85
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,130
You wanna harness what their intrinsic motivation is.

86
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,248
If you design a measurement system,

87
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:32,140
that essentially flattens people intrinsic motivation, you will lose everything.

88
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,649
It's worse than not measuring at all I think.

89
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:40,568
If you're using it in that way, and that intrinsic motivation is difficult,

90
00:05:40,568 --> 00:05:43,186
it's usually there and professionals.

91
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:48,132
But it's really something that is the challenge of being a good manager

92
00:05:48,132 --> 00:05:53,007
is trying to harness, cultivate, engage, intrinsic motivation.

93
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:56,697
And use measurements as a way to give tools to people,

94
00:05:56,697 --> 00:06:00,633
to use it in ways that you're hoping that they wanna use or

95
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:05,070
you're going to try to inculcate the spirit of them wanting to.

96
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,546
So, I think that if there was any bottom line, that's really it.

97
00:06:09,546 --> 00:06:14,384
Blind saying measurement of the answer is sitting back in your office and just start

98
00:06:14,384 --> 00:06:18,684
looking at the numbers, it's just never gonna get where do you wanna go.

99
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:22,209
A lot of providers are really intrested in intrinsic and

100
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:26,486
isn't funny how they're doing uncertain, get engaged so forth.

101
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,427
Not if it makes their life miserable and

102
00:06:29,427 --> 00:06:34,059
prevents them from doing the things they need to do, [LAUGH] and

103
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:39,245
not if seems completely arbitrary and somebody they care probably.

104
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:41,250
So that I think is pretty much, okay.
