1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,070
Let's describe the
cost-sharing provisions in

2
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,220
a hypothetical but typical
health insurance plan.

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,670
We start with a deductible
under which the enrollee is

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,570
completely responsible for
the first $1,000 of spending.

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,880
Some services like vaccinations

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,905
may be exempt from
the deductible.

7
00:00:25,905 --> 00:00:27,765
After meeting the deductible,

8
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:29,520
the enrollee becomes responsible

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,425
for a fixed percentage
of spending,

10
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:33,270
like 20 percent co-insurance

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,010
or a fixed amount per service,

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,210
like $20 per office visit.

13
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,290
Finally, after the enrollee has

14
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,405
spent $5,000 out of pocket,

15
00:00:41,405 --> 00:00:43,340
the $1,000 deductible plus

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,665
subsequent co-insurance
or co-payments,

17
00:00:45,665 --> 00:00:49,735
insurance covers 100 percent
of any further spending.

18
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:51,960
In any given year,

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,230
healthcare spending
is highly skewed.

20
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,090
The top one percent of spenders

21
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,175
account for 22
percent of spending,

22
00:00:58,175 --> 00:01:01,475
and the top 20 percent
account for 82 percent.

23
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:04,085
Conversely, the
bottom 50 percent

24
00:01:04,085 --> 00:01:07,355
account for a miniscule three
percent of all spending.

25
00:01:07,355 --> 00:01:10,625
This helps explain the
demand for health insurance.

26
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,160
At the beginning of
the year we don't know

27
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,130
for sure which of these
groups will end up in,

28
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,020
and getting into one of
the higher spending groups

29
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,870
can be very costly.

30
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,880
It will also help us
understand the economic logic

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,670
behind the structure of
cost-sharing I just described.

32
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,630
Deductibles can be
effective because

33
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,510
a large share of the
population spends very little.

34
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,175
For those spending very little,

35
00:01:34,175 --> 00:01:35,660
the financial consequences are

36
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,240
relatively low so
the policy errs on

37
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,280
the side of preserving
strong incentives to

38
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,465
shop around and not
consume low-value care.

39
00:01:43,465 --> 00:01:45,370
Those who meet the
deductible are

40
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,570
spending relatively
more out-of-pocket

41
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,330
facing increasingly painful
losses of purchasing

42
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,820
power so the policy shifts

43
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,430
towards emphasizing
protection from risk while

44
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,865
still preserving some incentive
to be cost-conscious.

45
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:02,180
For the very few at the
out-of-pocket, maximum,

46
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,850
care costs are catastrophic
and the policy

47
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,260
errs on the side of protecting

48
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,865
them from further downside,

49
00:02:07,865 --> 00:02:09,740
even at the cost of eliminating

50
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,469
the remaining incentives
for cost-conscious choices.

51
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,790
One important piece of
information we need to

52
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,320
know to determine how
best to balance risk,

53
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,230
spreading and incentives is

54
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,720
how big the moral
hazard effect is.

55
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,120
One way to assess
this is by using

56
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,805
the price elasticity of
demand for healthcare.

57
00:02:28,805 --> 00:02:31,040
This is a measure of
the responsiveness

58
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,360
to changes in price,

59
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,460
defined as percent
change in quantity

60
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,000
demanded divided by
percent change in price.

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The famous Rand Health
Insurance Experiment of

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,550
the 1970s and other studies with

63
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,010
strong methodologies
suggest a value

64
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,910
of negative 0.15
to negative 0.2.

65
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,170
That is a 10 percent decline

66
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,550
in the out-of-pocket price for

67
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,790
more generous health insurance
coverage would imply a

68
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,570
1.5-2 percent increase in the
quantity of care demanded.

69
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,800
If more generous plans
had higher premiums

70
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,590
only due to the higher
share of expenses covered,

71
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,235
premiums should rise
linearly with generosity.

72
00:03:10,235 --> 00:03:12,815
For example, if a
plan that covered

73
00:03:12,815 --> 00:03:14,660
50 percent of the
cost of care had

74
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,775
a premium of $100 per month,

75
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:18,890
we'd expect a plan that covered

76
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,385
100 percent to have a
premium of $200 per month.

77
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:24,380
However, if there's
moral hazard,

78
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,430
we know that people in more

79
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,990
generous plans are
going to demand

80
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,820
more care so the premium

81
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,980
would actually have
to more than double.

82
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,660
This would also be the case if

83
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,810
the more generous plan attracted
higher risk enrollees.

84
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,065
The adverse selection issue
discussed in another video.

85
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:41,480
Let's look at some data
I pulled from Michigan's

86
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,350
healthcare.gov website
a few years ago.

87
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,020
These are three versions of
the same plan so factors

88
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,610
like the provider network and

89
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,754
customer service are identical.

90
00:03:51,754 --> 00:03:54,815
They differ only by
generosity of coverage.

91
00:03:54,815 --> 00:03:58,590
The sample calculations just
scale up the premium to

92
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,950
100 percent coverage
like we did in

93
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,700
our example of a 50 percent
plan costing $100 per month,

94
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,085
translating into 100 percent
plan costing $200 per month.

95
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:12,410
If Blue Cross didn't
anticipate moral hazard and

96
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,500
or adverse selection in
their more generous plans,

97
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,905
all three calculations should
yield the same number.

98
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:21,050
What we actually see is that

99
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,970
the scaled-up values rise

100
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,220
as the generosity
of coverage rises

101
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,310
consistent with Blue Cross
anticipating moral hazard

102
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,600
or adverse selection to

103
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,430
occur in their more
generous plans.

104
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,060
Under age 65, there is a
mix of health insurance,

105
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,804
including a significant
share with no insurance.

106
00:04:40,804 --> 00:04:43,460
At age 65, coverage becomes

107
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,270
essentially universal as
people qualify for Medicare.

108
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,270
How much extra care
is consumed when

109
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,225
the share of the population
gains insurance?

110
00:04:53,225 --> 00:04:56,209
The figure shows inpatient
use in California

111
00:04:56,209 --> 00:05:01,400
between 1992 and 2002 by age,
unplanned admission rates,

112
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,860
defined as those
generally less elective,

113
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,330
based on conditions for which

114
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,590
the admission rate on

115
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,004
weekends is the same
as it is on weekdays,

116
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:12,665
only rose by 2.5
percent at age 65.

117
00:05:12,665 --> 00:05:16,680
However, planned admissions
rose by 15 percent.

118
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,070
As insurers try to
control moral hazard,

119
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,250
we've also seen a big
shift in the types of

120
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,685
coverage offered by the
employer-sponsored market.

121
00:05:25,685 --> 00:05:29,585
First, we saw a shift away
from conventional plans,

122
00:05:29,585 --> 00:05:31,700
which did little to
manage the care process

123
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,830
directly and generally
impose little

124
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,110
cost-sharing on
their enrollees to

125
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,720
manage care plans
like HMOs and PPOs,

126
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,030
which use various
mechanisms to try to

127
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,940
influence how much care
providers deliver.

128
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,760
In more recent years, there
has been a big shift towards

129
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,550
high deductible health
plans with savings options,

130
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,580
otherwise known as
consumer-directed health plans.

131
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,010
These plans try to
control moral hazard by

132
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,260
relying much more
heavily on cost sharing.

133
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,210
The heavier reliance on
cost-sharing can also

134
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,270
be seen by looking at trends
in the size of deductibles.

135
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,100
Deductibles tend
to be higher for

136
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,230
workers employed by small firms.

137
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,690
Since 2006, the
average deductible

138
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,090
has tripled for both
large and small firms.

139
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,985
The key points in today's video,

140
00:06:17,985 --> 00:06:19,640
are that moral
hazard occurs when

141
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,200
having health insurance changes

142
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,000
people's behavior in ways

143
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,225
that increases the
cost of their care,

144
00:06:25,225 --> 00:06:27,140
and the controlling
moral hazard is

145
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,650
a primary reason most insurers
offer plans with less than

146
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,320
complete coverage as
plans try to balance

147
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,640
the competing objectives of

148
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,740
spreading risk and
controlling cost.
