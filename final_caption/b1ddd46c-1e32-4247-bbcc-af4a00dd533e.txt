1
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:13,740
Okay. We're going to start today's discussion on cardiac, calcium and the medical nutrition therapy for heart failure.

2
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:23,319
So if you haven't done so already, please watch the first set of videos or the first lecture on the disease process,

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:32,470
because that's really important in understanding why we see what we see with regard to the nutritional decline in our patients with heart failure.

4
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,459
All right. So the learning objectives for today, by the end of the discussion,

5
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:46,430
I want you to be able to explain how to assess a patient for the presence of cardiac axia and

6
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,899
essentially that we're going to kind of use that maybe interchangeably with malnutrition.

7
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:58,190
For purposes of today's talk, I want you to be able to describe the overall goal of M.A. in the Heart Failure Patient.

8
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:03,950
So this is going to be a little bit different than some of our other diseases that we discuss.

9
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,120
Our goals, I would say, are different for these patients,

10
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:15,110
and I want you to be able to formulate nutrition interventions and apply to a heart failure case,

11
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,680
which we'll try to do together within this recording.

12
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:27,650
So briefly, I just want to talk about the medical management for heart failure patients at risk for developing heart failure.

13
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:33,260
The goal is treatment of the underlying condition. So what has led to their heart failure?

14
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:39,589
Oftentimes, as you'll hear about in the first video that could be uncontrolled hypertension or other

15
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,540
chronic diseases that have caused this now decline and have put the patient in heart failure.

16
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,410
So treatment of the underlying condition, avoidance of high risk fate, high risk behaviors,

17
00:01:52,340 --> 00:02:00,860
and that may also so that these high risk behaviors that can then worsen the condition may be tobacco smoking,

18
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,800
excessive alcohol intake or even illicit drug use.

19
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:13,129
So reducing or avoiding those behaviors and then lifestyle changes, which may involve weight reduction,

20
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:22,730
exercise reduction of sodium intake and or implementation of a heart healthy diet for our patients with more advanced heart failure,

21
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,719
there will often be pharmacologic treatment,

22
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:34,400
and that will be seen with those with more progressive heart failure and then in the final stages of heart failure.

23
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,650
So if we think about just the term heart failure in itself, that tells us kind of what we need to know.

24
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,000
The patient's heart, a vital organ, of course, is failing.

25
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:49,639
So in those final stages, surgically implanted with ventricular assist devices,

26
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,469
we'll discuss briefly as we and we won't discuss heart transplant transplant.

27
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:59,360
But that's kind of like the the end stage there. The final option would be a transplant.

28
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,669
So short term goals for patients with heart failure relieve symptoms.

29
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:13,010
These patients do have some kind of hallmark symptoms definitely to improve quality of life and reduce depression long term,

30
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:19,940
really, we want to prolong life. So by lessening, stopping or even reversing left ventricular dysfunction.

31
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:30,500
So briefly as we're discussing medication management, oftentimes our patients with heart feel will be on diuretic therapy.

32
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:36,600
So loop suicide or potassium sparing diuretics may be used in the medical treatment

33
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,070
of heart failure patients to help the kidneys get rid of unneeded water and sodium.

34
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,710
So again, recall that diuretics help the kidneys release sodium into the urine.

35
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:54,030
Sodium takes water with it from the blood, decreasing the amount of fluid through all that, flowing through the vasculature.

36
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:05,460
So this can help the heart essentially pump a little bit more easily given that there's not so much fluid retained throughout the vasculature.

37
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,110
So there are some drug induced nutrition effects of loop diuretics in particular.

38
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:21,150
So most of the loop diuretics are used in heart failure as these offer a little bit more of an aggressive diuresis than other forms of diuretics.

39
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,899
So, Houston, these can result in potassium depletion.

40
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:32,040
So as the kidneys release sodium and water to the urine, potassium will also go along with that.

41
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:42,510
Magnesium depletion can happen on diuretics, and that may require monitoring and supplementation and time of deficiency.

42
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:48,540
Again, another water soluble vitamin that we've discussed that can quickly become depleted.

43
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,720
So that can can happen on diuretic therapy.

44
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:59,240
And so the prevalence of diamond deficiency in heart failure patients has been estimated to be anywhere from 21 to 98%.

45
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,610
I mean, that's a huge range. But this is this is a big problem.

46
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:10,140
And oftentimes, again, we can almost assume that there may be some degree of thiamin deficiency if a patient is on diuretic therapy.

47
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,459
Okay.

48
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:22,290
So one of the most key points I want you to take away from our discussion on heart failure is that malnutrition is highly prevalent in these patients.

49
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:31,410
And as we will discuss in the next few slides, the reasons for this are multifactorial.

50
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:39,450
So patients with heart failure are at a greater risk for malnutrition due to malabsorption from gut edema.

51
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:50,820
So malabsorption of nutrients, particularly fat, can take place due to poor blood flow to the abdominal organs and subsequent edema in the gut.

52
00:05:51,750 --> 00:06:03,120
Also, anorexia or very poor appetite due in part to increased inflammatory cytokine levels can occur in patients who have severe heart failure,

53
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,939
may develop malnutrition and cardiac disease,

54
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:13,620
which we'll talk about due to increased energy requirements that may be associated with increased lung function needed to produce oxygen.

55
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:19,980
Also, limitation in eating and food preparation from fatigue due to increased work

56
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:26,340
of breathing is often a huge problem that can sometimes go underrecognized.

57
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:36,080
Compromised nutritional intake is also related to the fatigue and shortness of breath associated with fluid retention.

58
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:42,320
And that's kind of what we just discussed. So that's something really to consider when when interviewing our patients.

59
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:48,079
Finally, our main amante intervention of a low sodium diet, which we will talk about,

60
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,090
is not always a benefit for patients, especially when the risk of malnutrition is great.

61
00:06:53,100 --> 00:07:00,120
So I want to read that again just to to really point that out as I'll discuss in the next few slides.

62
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,540
Our primary intervention that we do in terms of MMT for heart failure patients

63
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:12,190
involves implementation of a low sodium diet that may not always benefit patients.

64
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,580
And there are studies to show that, especially when the risk of malnutrition is great.

65
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:23,240
So even though that is the hallmark MMT therapy or, you know, medical nutrition therapy is lower sodium diet,

66
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,850
it may not always be appropriate and sometimes it may even worsen the situation for the patient.

67
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:37,579
I do want to point out the something you may see referred to as the obesity paradox in heart failure patients.

68
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:46,670
So there appears to be a protective effect of elevated BMI in heart failure patients, and that has been termed the obesity paradox.

69
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:55,790
And so a meta analysis of nine observational studies concluded that patients that are overweight and or obese were associated

70
00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:02,840
with a decreased risk of all cause mortality in cardiovascular mortality from heart failure when compared to normal BMI.

71
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:08,090
So the reason for the protective effect of obesity in heart failure is not well understood.

72
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:18,620
But one suggestion has reason that heart failure may be found earlier in patients with an elevated BMI, as compared to those with a lower BMI.

73
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,750
A lower BMI may be indicative of more advanced disease progression.

74
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:30,410
Another possible explanation is that greater metabolic reserves allow obese individuals to handle

75
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:36,440
metabolic stress better than those with a lower BMI and potentially increase adipose tissue

76
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:42,169
in obese patients may play a role in neutralizing the effects of some of those pro-inflammatory

77
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:47,780
cytokines that can contribute to muscle wasting that we see in heart failure patients.

78
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,640
All right. So this term cardiac attacks here.

79
00:08:54,270 --> 00:09:02,489
I want to spend a couple of slides on this because this is something that we have to really recognize in this population.

80
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,469
So cardiac detection, we'll discuss cancer next year.

81
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,700
Next week is an unintentional severe weight loss.

82
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:21,690
So this is a wasting syndrome caused by heart disease and it is the end result in 10 to 15% or even more of heart failure patients.

83
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:30,629
So the mechanism of cardiac axia includes hyper metabolism, muscle wasting in particular.

84
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:39,990
So a rapid decline in lean body mass altered intake, you know, altered oral intake, nutritional intake as well as functional impairment.

85
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:47,100
So it is thought to involve the function of the immune system, metabolic and neural hormonal systems within the body.

86
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,600
And so this is a serious complication of heart failure with a very poor prognosis and a high mortality rate.

87
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:05,979
So cardiac axia we look at some of the definitions that are out there may involve an involuntary

88
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:12,520
weight loss of 5 to 7 and a half percent of non-dangerous body weight during a 6 to 12 month period.

89
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,420
So how is this different than normal starvation? That's kind of brings us back to very early on in the semester.

90
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:25,209
Remember that normal starvation is characterized by adipose tissue loss, predominantly.

91
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,950
Right? Our body shifts to then burn through our adipose tissue as fuel.

92
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,070
Well, cardiac exit is characterized by a significant loss of lean body mass.

93
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:47,350
So even in our patients that have adipose tissue available, cardiac axia, that really targets that lean body mass and rapid protein turnover.

94
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,320
And that's where that wasting syndrome kind of kicks in.

95
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:57,090
So this decrease in lean body mass further exacerbates heart failure because of the loss of cardiac muscle.

96
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:05,110
Remember, lean body mass protein that includes vital organs, including the heart, and in these cases, an already weakened heart.

97
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:13,540
So because of the loss of the cardiac muscle that occurs, the development of a heart that is soft and flabby can happen.

98
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:19,150
And that will even make it more difficult to pump out blood to the rest of the periphery.

99
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,790
So how how does heart failure lead to cardiac axia?

100
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,420
Heart failure can cause blood to back up into the liver and intestines, causing them to swell.

101
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:38,930
So we talked about that a little bit earlier. So that bowel edema that we see that can cause malabsorption of nutrients,

102
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:44,600
especially fat, but it also can lead to nausea and it can significantly impact appetite.

103
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:52,160
So the swellings of the intestines, again, may inhibit adequate absorption of nutrients such as fat or especially fat.

104
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,469
Heart failure also increases work of breathing and can increase body temperature.

105
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:05,660
So both of those things are going to increase. Energy expenditure can cause a calorie deficit quicker than than usual.

106
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,860
So pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and other signaling

107
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,629
molecules in the bloodstream can increase the metabolic rate of the tissues as well.

108
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,480
So that further will increase energy expenditure.

109
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:32,230
Fuel that will fuel muscle breakdown, contribute to anorexia and also contribute to a decreased exercise intolerance.

110
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:40,410
And all of these things are going to further exacerbate more muscle breakdown and this inflammatory response.

111
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:49,239
So patients with cardiac attacks here have been found to have increased levels of stress hormones,

112
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,720
including more epinephrine, epinephrine and cortisol.

113
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:58,720
And so this can kind of help explain why the condition is not reversible with nutrition intervention.

114
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,090
So, again, we cannot reverse cardiac calcium once a patient is kind of at this date.

115
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:12,700
However, that doesn't mean we ignore their nutrition. Of course, it does have the potential to diminish the negative outcomes of the condition.

116
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,600
So this nutrition is still a huge role in patients that have cardiac calcium.

117
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:29,440
So Katia could taxi should be addressed as early as possible to mitigate the outcomes of increased rate of infection,

118
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:38,830
poor wound healing to cubit ulcers, bacterial overgrowth malabsorption, loss of lean body mass and really overall morbidity and mortality.

119
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:51,400
So the sooner that this is caught or, you know, addressed, diagnosed and and interventions are applied, the better the patients can do.

120
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,360
All right. So let's talk about the role of the dietician.

121
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,120
This is a population where the dietician is so very important because of that high prevalence of malnutrition.

122
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,640
So this is from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Evidence Analysis Library,

123
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:14,459
who recommend an initial visit for at least 45 minutes in at least one, two,

124
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:19,410
three plan follow up visits that are 30 minutes each and that can lead to that is shown

125
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:24,690
to lead to improved dietary pattern and quality of life by decreasing edema and fatigue.

126
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:33,810
So along with optimal pharmacological management, medical nutrition therapy has been shown also to reduce hospitalizations,

127
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,299
which this is a population that we sometimes referred to as like frequent fliers there.

128
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:48,930
Got it there. Readmission rate to the hospital is high due to the symptoms that they experience from their condition.

129
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:58,020
And the focus is on controlling signs and symptoms associated with the diagnosis and promotion of overall nutritional rehabilitation.

130
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:05,410
All right, let's let's talk about the mentees involved with heart failure.

131
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:16,180
The biggest, again, is going to be limiting sodium intake. However, we need to really weigh that with the overall patient picture.

132
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:26,110
Studies have shown that low sodium diets in our heart failure patients in some can worsen malnutrition and lead to other micronutrient deficiencies.

133
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,850
Remember, a lot and a lot of these patients, their appetite is really compromised.

134
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,440
They have shortness of breath, fatigue, sometimes nausea, poor absorption.

135
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,700
So then further restricting their food options,

136
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:46,340
especially ones that are maybe more palatable if we think about the role of sodium in making things taste a little bit better.

137
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:55,210
Of really strict sodium, low sodium diet can has been shown to worsen malnutrition and can lead to micronutrient deficiencies.

138
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:03,969
So we'll talk about this in a little bit more detail. Often, patients with heart failure also have to limit their fluid intake,

139
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:13,660
and that will be really this will be determined by the physician like you are not going to be ordering or prescribing a fluid,

140
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:18,790
low fluid diet, that the fluid restriction will come from the cardiologist.

141
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,620
It's really important for these patients to maintain adequate energy and protein intake,

142
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:31,029
which we'll discuss in a few slides in terms of how how we estimate needs and needs in these patients,

143
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:37,450
but maintaining adequate energy and protein intake as well as maintaining adequate vitamin and mineral intake,

144
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:42,399
especially, and those that especially those that may be depleted with diuretics.

145
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,550
So thinking of our water soluble vitamins and minerals that are important for a healthy heart,

146
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,870
so really things that stand out over time and magnesium, potassium among others.

147
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:02,050
And then other goals of MMT may involve improving knowledge of heart failure and nutrition guidelines, which are not great.

148
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:11,860
But there is a bigger push to get more refined evidence driven, evidence based or evidence base driven guidelines for those with heart failure.

149
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:17,770
Beyond just this, you know, limit sodium, in some cases,

150
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:27,730
the limiting limiting the intake of saturated fat may also help if biochemical data and nutritional history indicate that a reduction is needed.

151
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:35,770
These are just some examples of some nutrition diagnoses you may see in heart failure patients.

152
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:41,080
Excessive mineral intake specific to sodium could be excessive fluid intake.

153
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:50,260
And, you know, we'll talk about how we would have evidence of that inadequate energy intake, inadequate protein intake, increased nutrient needs.

154
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:56,229
I don't really love you know, you guys know this. I don't love unintended weight loss or weight gain.

155
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:01,340
Usually that is going to be due to one of these other intake diagnoses.

156
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:09,190
So even weight gain probably going to be due to excessive fluid and or sodium intake, unintended weight loss in this population.

157
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,139
Remember, these patients are being decreased their high risk for malnutrition.

158
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:19,510
So yeah, it's unintended, but that's probably due to some type of intake problem,

159
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:28,720
inadequate vitamin intake or increased needs for certain vitamins because of the depletion that can happen on diuretics,

160
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,040
there could be a knowledge deficit, self-monitoring.

161
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:40,629
Maybe they don't know how to adequately monitor their fluid intake and weight sodium intake.

162
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:50,320
This sometimes these are good as etiologies that are diagnostic statements, limited adherence to nutrition related recommendations.

163
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:56,140
This may be pertinent for our like more stable heart failure patients on an outpatient basis.

164
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,440
You know, low sodium diets are not easy to follow.

165
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:09,070
And we'll talk about how to approach that similar with undesirable food choices, either as a diagnosis or an etiology.

166
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:13,090
Again, often in our more stable outpatient heart failure patients.

167
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,550
Definitely malnutrition if it's present.

168
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:23,500
You guys hopefully know by now if there if you even are considering or questioning whether a patient is malnourished,

169
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:30,610
you need to investigate that and really diagnosis would diagnose it when it is present and then in the same

170
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:37,120
way decrease nutrient needs for for sodium may be kind of related to some of these up here and you can,

171
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,990
you know, assess which one makes the most sense for your current patient.

172
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,570
So some sample statements. I never know if these are helpful for you guys,

173
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:53,740
but excessive mineral intake for sodium related to overconsumption of high sodium foods as evidenced by.

174
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:59,470
So if we're going to diagnosis, we have to have evidence. So usually that's through a dietary recall analysis.

175
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:09,020
And if we can have like a specific number. So I usually like to say no patient consuming 300% of recommended intake for sodium.

176
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,959
This is the evidence here showing that a patient consumes over two and a half

177
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,430
grams of sodium per day by frequently eating processed meats and canned products.

178
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:24,110
Inadequate mineral intake for thiamin by vitamin B1.

179
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,899
Same thing here related to high doses of diuretics without compensatory intake of thiamin rich foods,

180
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:35,719
as evidenced by thiamin laboratory value of 56 milligrams on, you know, whichever date.

181
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:42,470
So any any specifics here is really helpful to to provide that evidence again to laboratory value of thiamin.

182
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:51,500
Some may argue that utility is not great, but I think in these patients where they are being decreased at risk for deficiency,

183
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:59,810
you could probably use that in addition to maybe some this dietary intake evidence up here as well.

184
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:09,409
You could also use increased nutrient needs for a time and I actually kind of like that one better if let's say they're eating okay,

185
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:14,540
but they're on diuretics so their their needs are just higher. This is related to losses,

186
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:20,209
secondary to diuretics as evidenced by diary recall demonstrating lack of Simon rich foods in patient not

187
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:27,440
on diamond supplementation increased nutrient needs for protein related to increased demand for nutrients,

188
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,150
as evidenced by conditions associated with congestive heart failure. These are just some examples.

189
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,980
All right. So again, sodium is the kind of the key feature of medical nutrition therapy in heart failure.

190
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:51,750
So a sodium restricted diet may be necessary. Remember, despite low sodium blood levels, a lot of times these patients are going to be hyponatremia.

191
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:58,180
So their serum serum sodium will look very low. And that is because of the fluid retention they are experiencing.

192
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,400
That does not mean they don't they're not consuming enough salt.

193
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:09,550
It's actually often quite the opposite. So a sodium restricted diet, it's going to be necessary often despite low sodium blood levels.

194
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,470
And the degree of restriction really depends on the individual.

195
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:24,040
So recommendations may vary between 1500 milligrams, which is very low and difficult to follow up to 2400 milligrams a day,

196
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:29,109
which is essentially just kind of like the general recommendation for for sodium.

197
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:36,610
And we may go higher even if we're trying to promote intake. Most often what you'll see is a two grams sodium diet is ordered in these patients.

198
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,450
So when they're in the hospital, often that's what will be ordered as the diet order,

199
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,710
a two gram sodium diet, and that's what will be prescribed for home.

200
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:52,899
Some considerations with regard to sodium. So there are ethnic differences in sodium intake and those need to be considered.

201
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:58,480
So some cultures and you know, cultural and traditional diets are very high in sodium.

202
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:04,810
So that can be a major adjustment for some people and they will need guidance on that.

203
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:12,940
And positive outcomes are seen with good adherence to sodium and fluid restrictions, especially in our more stable patients again,

204
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:20,200
so we can see increase improvement in quality of life, decrease readmissions to the hospital,

205
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,989
lower symptoms of shortness of breath because they're not holding on to so much fluid.

206
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:34,090
So we can see some good outcomes there. So increase, decrease urinary sodium excretion, less less fatigue and less frequent edema.

207
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:45,010
The main point is if you take away anything from today's talk is A, these patients are at great risk for malnutrition.

208
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:52,090
And this would be the other thing. The sodium restriction should be the least restrictive that will still achieve the desired result.

209
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:59,890
Okay. So just because a two gram sodium diet is most commonly ordered and most commonly associated with heart failure,

210
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,050
that may not be appropriate for all people. And that may be too restrictive.

211
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:12,310
We need to liberalize these science as much as possible, especially for our patients that are not eating well and that are malnourished.

212
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,639
Okay. So let's say we're working on outpatient level.

213
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,330
You can certainly I've done this education inpatient as well.

214
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:31,750
The first step really for patients who are trying to to lower sodium intake in the diet, we'll talk about minimize or eliminate the use of table salt.

215
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:38,649
So added salt. So when you're cooking, just don't you know, we had a cardiac dietitian that I worked with,

216
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:42,610
I first heard in the hospital, and her thing was like, throw away the salt shaker.

217
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:49,540
It was like her kind of hallmark quote when she would educate patients, just get rid of it.

218
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:53,889
So like because foods and especially processed foods are going to have sodium already.

219
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:58,750
So let's just not add to it. So when you're cooking, let's just avoid adding salt.

220
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:04,300
So get rid of the salt shaker and then decrease intake of processed foods which are going to be high in sodium.

221
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:11,530
So some barriers to this, there could be a lack of knowledge about sodium perception.

222
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:16,360
The diet will interfere with social aspects of eating if they are on these restrictions.

223
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:25,480
A lot of people have lack of cooking skills, so people really often rely on the premade foods or packaged food items,

224
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,060
you know, heat and serve types of things that are usually highly processed with a lot of sodium.

225
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:35,229
So that can be a really difficult transition they're in.

226
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:38,620
There also may be an inability to comprehend label reading.

227
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:46,629
I know this label is a little bit blurry here, but this is not always straightforward for people.

228
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:54,370
Or if they if they aren't able to read or maybe they don't read in in the English language,

229
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:59,200
you know, all of these things can be major barriers to this this education that we provide.

230
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,760
All right. Let's talk about fluid again like this. The fluid restriction will be ordered by the physician.

231
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:15,190
And this needs to be really carefully monitored because often patients are on diuretic therapy so they can be become what we call dried out.

232
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,490
So they're on a fluid restriction, they're on diuresis.

233
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:25,780
And that can be that needs to be very closely monitored because they can be over decreased in dehydrated quickly.

234
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:32,319
So often you'll see a two liter fluid restriction or 2000 meals per day, and that's from foods and fluids.

235
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,650
Primarily, we think about the fluids that they're actually drinking.

236
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,520
Some cases we do have to also consider the boots they're eating.

237
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:49,420
So if a patient is severely decompensated, you may also see a more strict fluid restriction ordered even 1 to 1 and a half liters per day,

238
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:55,689
which can be really, really difficult to follow. So we'd like our patient.

239
00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:02,229
Some fluid restriction should have weight monitoring. So we'll we'll teach them how to do this or at least recommend that they do this.

240
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:07,900
And that can be difficult because of the fluctuations in their fluid status.

241
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:16,180
But weight should be taken before eating and after voiding meaning after they've gone to the bathroom the same time each day.

242
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:21,610
So usually we have patients. When you get up, go to the bathroom and then take your daily wait.

243
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:29,950
A dry weight should be determined. So this is going to be a weight where the patient does not have edema,

244
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:35,889
or at least it's the edema is at a minimum and that is considered their dry weight.

245
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:46,150
And that's kind of the weight that we look to as a as a baseline or like a marker in terms of what their then weight fluctuations do.

246
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:50,709
In reference to that, dry weight patients really should record their daily weights.

247
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:55,990
Okay. So this is important. And again, take the weight in the morning after going to the bathroom,

248
00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:00,879
preferably the same time each day because a weight gain of greater than a pound per day

249
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,190
for severe heart failure patients would indicate that they need to contact their doctor,

250
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:09,340
that they're really rapidly retaining fluid.

251
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:15,820
And so there may be need to be some some adjustments to their medications or and or diet.

252
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:21,040
All right. Let's talk about tips to control fluid intake.

253
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:29,440
Before working with these populations, I. I couldn't appreciate what how difficult a fluid restriction could be.

254
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:35,199
I'm someone that really struggles to stay hydrated throughout the day.

255
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:43,420
I have to remind myself to drink water. But this these fluid restrictions can be really difficult to to follow and adhere to.

256
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:50,680
So some tips that we can provide our patients to help control their fluid intake is to limit high salt foods.

257
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:56,950
So that's already going to be part of the MMT, but that will also potentially make patients less thirsty.

258
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:59,550
So there's there's more benefit there as well.

259
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:08,620
Take pills with mealtime liquids, applesauce or pureed fruits as able to drink from small glasses and cups.

260
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:14,010
And, you know, these sound like really small things, but they can be really good practical advice for people.

261
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:19,690
To help adhere to these food restrictions. Drink only when you're thirsty.

262
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:25,660
Choose very cold beverages that are not sweet, that can help quench thirst a little bit better.

263
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:32,080
Sometimes we'll have patients suck on sour candies or use sugar free gum to moisten the mouth.

264
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:40,110
So they're thirsty, they're dried out from their devices, and other medications can cause a dry mouth.

265
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,060
So that is what makes people want to drink sometimes, you know?

266
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,790
Add a splash of lemon juice to water or ice that can help quench thirst.

267
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,000
Practicing good oral hygiene is important as well.

268
00:29:53,680 --> 00:30:00,129
Using ice cubes instead of liquids and then just some other things like freezing grapes or other juicy

269
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:06,160
fruits and eat them throughout the day in small amounts as those will contribute to to fluid restriction.

270
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:15,040
So again, some foods do count as fluids, such as soups, packs, popsicles, sherbet, ice creams, yogurts, custards, gelatin, really juicy fruits.

271
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,600
Those things would would kind of count toward that overall fluid restriction.

272
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:26,370
Okay. So we want to individualize sodium and fluid intake.

273
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:32,129
Sodium 23,000 milligrams per day, I think is reasonable for most patients.

274
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:36,209
Sometimes you will see that a little bit lower and that may need to be adjusted

275
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:40,920
depending on the patient's nutritional status and their dietary intake fluid.

276
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:44,940
Most often you'll see a 1 to 2 liter fluid restriction per day.

277
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:53,459
One liter is very difficult to follow. So these levels of restriction are associated with improvements in readmission rates,

278
00:30:53,460 --> 00:31:01,710
length of stay mortality rates, as well as measures of renal function and also symptom burden.

279
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:05,670
So things like shortness of breath, difficulty breathing when lying, flat,

280
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:11,069
swelling of the ankles and legs, lack of energy, lack of appetite, even measures of body weight.

281
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:19,830
So there is a place for these restrictions, but we have to be careful with them and definitely should be individualized.

282
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:30,950
Okay. So we also need to individualize protein intake. You know, guidelines suggest at least 1.1 gram per kilogram to prevent catabolism.

283
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:40,370
Remember heart failure. They are in a catabolic state with high lean body mass turnover for nourished or malnourished heart failure patients

284
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:48,140
reported intakes of 1.1 to 1.4 grams per kilogram of actual body weight has resulted in positive nitrogen balance,

285
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:53,210
while protein intakes below that measure result in a negative nitrogen balance.

286
00:31:54,260 --> 00:32:05,329
Some of our patients that are obese or even overweight, we may need to relook at this if we want to use actual body weight or use ideal body weight.

287
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,280
And that can be discussed further.

288
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:16,069
But the the point is that we do need to individualize protein intake and it is going to be higher than our our maintenance needs for adults,

289
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:20,210
of course. So what about energy intake?

290
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:28,760
In our patients with severe heart failure, energy needs can be increased by 30 to even 50% or more than above the basal level.

291
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:35,360
So more than half of our heart failure patients in the hospital setting have malnutrition.

292
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:44,660
Overweight patients with heart failure caloric restriction must be carefully monitored to avoid excessive and rapid body protein metabolism.

293
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:51,800
Case. We don't want to have too restrictive of a diet in terms of sodium, but also calories and protein.

294
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:59,780
So a very common diet order for hospitalized patients is a two gram sodium, 1.5 liter fluid, restricted cardiac diet.

295
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:08,839
This is a really restrictive diet. If you see the type of foods and things you can order on this, not great.

296
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,129
So a lot of times our first step is like paging the doctor to try and get this liberalized,

297
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:18,380
especially for our patients that are have very poor intake, poor appetite and are malnourished.

298
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,399
So our energy needs really should be based on that dry weight.

299
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:29,959
That's really important also if they have activity restrictions and or the severity of their heart failure.

300
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,410
So all of these things would be considered with estimating their energy needs.

301
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:35,030
All right.

302
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:46,340
Let's talk about the Academy's evidence analysis library that has some specific recommendations for calculating energy needs in this population.

303
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,829
So adults with heart failure and you'll see the different classes and stages.

304
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:56,240
So depending on how so how advanced your heart failure is,

305
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:01,370
22 k cals per kilogram of actual body weight for a normally nourished patients

306
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,899
with 24 k counts per kilogram of actual body weight for malnourished patients.

307
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,790
And then they say, multiply this by an activity factor,

308
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:21,050
which you may see down here are even adults with advanced heart failure 18 cals per kilogram of body weight, then multiply by inactivity factor.

309
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:29,690
Now I will say some studies that have used like a measured are e so there they get their actual resting energy

310
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:37,849
expenditure in these populations have found these targets to really overestimate energy needs so we need to be careful.

311
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:41,600
I know this is like, you know what the Academy is recommending,

312
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:48,800
but there are some studies that show that these weight mean we overestimate the needs that these patients have.

313
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:53,509
So we'll kind of wait and see, you know, if these recommendations change.

314
00:34:53,510 --> 00:35:02,030
And of course, you're doing these KCAL per kilogram levels of actual body weight and then applying an activity factor.

315
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,280
And it may be too much.

316
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:14,179
I think also the Mifflin equation with an activity factor or stress factor could also be very reasonable in and that would be okay.

317
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:20,750
We just want to make sure they're getting adequate nutrition, but totally overestimating may be problematic.

318
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:28,940
Okay. So the basis for that recommendation, so the R e times an activity factor,

319
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:35,629
the goal is then to provide weight maintenance, prevent further weight gain or loss and prevent catabolism.

320
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:44,390
So even in our patients that we would classify as overweight or obese, often when we're talking about heart failure, weight maintenance is a goal.

321
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,969
And that will be echoed next week when we talk about cancer that we believe in at higher weights.

322
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:53,030
We'd like to see weight maintenance. We do not want to see weight loss.

323
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:01,700
That being said, intentional weight loss in obese patients with heart failure may be appropriate.

324
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,190
Let's talk about who this may be appropriate for.

325
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:12,919
So for adults with heart failure who are obese once the patient is considered weight stable and jubilee MEK,

326
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,160
meaning their sodium fluid and medication adherence.

327
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:20,840
So there their serum sodium levels are going all over the place.

328
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:25,830
They are retaining a ton of fluid that not showing signs of edema.

329
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:32,550
The R.D. look at this recommendation may or may not consider intentional weight loss M.A.

330
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:38,080
So essentially the Academy is saying this needs to be weighed very carefully.

331
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:43,260
If you're going to implement some measures to to have careful weight loss,

332
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:49,530
purposeful weight loss in healthy with healthy dietary intervention or physical activity,

333
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:53,540
I should say, and or physical activity for improving health related quality.

334
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:57,030
Life or management of co-morbidities may be reasonable and some.

335
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:02,450
So this again would especially be our more stable heart failure patients.

336
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:11,970
So maybe on an outpatient basis they're pretty stable and we can have very purposeful or intentional, careful weight loss measures put into place.

337
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:22,829
Just briefly for alcohol. We talked about the potential protective effect of alcohol in cardiovascular disease.

338
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:30,510
This is a whole different ballgame. Once a patient has heart failure in excess, alcohol contributes to fluid intake, also raises blood pressure.

339
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:36,320
It increases levels of the hormone renin, which causes blood vessels to constrict.

340
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:39,690
So this means that they get smaller in dynamic diameter,

341
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:46,380
making it more difficult for the heart to to pump blood throughout the body and into the periphery.

342
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:53,160
So many cardiologists will recommend strict alcohol avoidance in this population.

343
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:59,310
Some other considerations you'll see may see some data about fish oil supplementation.

344
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:09,090
So it may help. But earlier trials had indicated that fish oil may exert cardioprotective effects.

345
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:17,400
However, again, our favorite thing to look at a meta analysis of recent trials failed to find a significant reduction in outcomes.

346
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,290
So another meta analysis also failed to find a benefit.

347
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:27,540
So the discrepancy between older and more contemporary trials may suggest that fish oil exerts

348
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:34,940
only a mild benefit in heart failure and has been overshadowed by maybe more modern interventions.

349
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:40,320
So the one thing omega three fatty acids have been shown to be relatively safe.

350
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,410
So a relatively low risk intervention that may or may not help, may not hurt,

351
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:54,870
but in some they can increase the risk of bleeding and should be used with caution in patients that are taking an aspirin or anticoagulant.

352
00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:06,800
So magnesium supplementation potentially needed if deficiency is due to poor dietary intake and or losses with diuretics other b vitamins.

353
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:15,120
So high dietary okay specifying your dietary intakes in the literature has been associated with reduced risk of mortality from heart failure.

354
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:18,839
Don't see that same effect with high supplement intake.

355
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:27,510
So again really focusing on dietary intakes when possible thiamin we talked about the producing of deficiency due to poor intake,

356
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:33,360
but also the use of loop diuretics. So patients may benefit from thiamin supplementation and then vitamin D,

357
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:40,080
you may also see in the literature and that's really not been shown to know if supplementation really has any benefit.

358
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:44,550
So maybe no benefit, but you know, if somebody has that vitamin D deficiency, you know,

359
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:50,540
these heart failure patients a lot of times are are often in the hospital or their mobility is limited, maybe not.

360
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:55,350
Don't get outside a lot. So just keeping them on a maintenance level may be appropriate.

361
00:39:55,350 --> 00:40:04,530
And although risk intervention, feeding strategies, this sounds really kind of simple, but it can be really helpful.

362
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:08,640
Like smaller, more frequent meals is going to be better tolerated for these patients.

363
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:17,010
Larger meals are more tiring to consume. They can contribute to abdominal distension and then increase the work of breathing.

364
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,040
These patients are really just compensated in fatigue,

365
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:28,319
so even something as small as eating a large meal that causes them to be really full can kind of make the work of breathing more difficult.

366
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,810
So smaller, more frequent meals is definitely an intervention and a feeding strategy we encourage.

367
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:44,070
Okay. So again, the initial goal of nutrition therapy for heart failure is to manage symptoms of fluid retention, shortness of breath and fatigue.

368
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:49,919
And a longer term goal is to reduce the work, the heart's workload, providing longer life and better quality of life.

369
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:57,749
So patients receiving medical nutrition therapy for heart failure should hopefully be able to accomplish the following.

370
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:03,569
And this is because this is a long list, but when we're talking to our patients like these are some things that we can consider,

371
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,180
like monitoring, like how what are we going to monitor?

372
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:13,139
We want them to be able to state their level of dietary sodium intake that's been recommended to distinguish between

373
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:20,670
food sources of high and low sodium use nutrition labels when when able to limit sodium limit sodium intake.

374
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:29,660
A lot of times will educate on using herbs, spices, other things like lemon juice, vinegar to enhance flavor in place of salt,

375
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:36,500
adapt recipes to reduce sodium content that kind of goes hand in hand with what I just spoke about,

376
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:43,490
manage sodium intake on special occasions so patients know we want them to have a good quality of life going out to restaurants.

377
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:47,930
Why is food taste so much better in a restaurant while they tend to use a lot more fat and sodium?

378
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,370
So how to approach dining out, holidays, traveling?

379
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:57,169
What if their spouse is not able to is their spouse is ill or maybe it's their spouse,

380
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:03,559
that spouse that prepares all their meals so that this can really impact the patient.

381
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:03,850
You know,

382
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:12,890
they're not the one that usually is in control of their their meal prep identify food quantity is needed to maintain or achieve an appropriate weight.

383
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:18,020
You know so that's going to be a big focus is making sure they're getting enough nutrition.

384
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:23,990
Explain the rationale for managing sodium and fluid intake in the later stages of heart failure.

385
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:30,049
And I've always found that this is helpful. Like explain to a patient why we're recommending this.

386
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,480
You know, sometimes they never get that information.

387
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:40,430
You know, when you eat sodium or you you eat these foods high in sodium, your body is going to then hold on to more water.

388
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:48,649
That's going to make, you know, when you see the edema or the puffiness in your in your legs, ankles, that's going to get worse potentially.

389
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:58,520
So putting it into like some plain language then and things they can understand can be helpful in terms of why they need to restrict these items.

390
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:04,939
Dash Diet eating pattern has been shown to be helpful in heart failure patients.

391
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:12,229
You can understand potentially why it is much lower in sodium so that that can be a consideration.

392
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:18,170
Again, adherence to a dash diet pattern is potentially difficult and could be really hard if a

393
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:24,440
patient's appetite is very low and have them demonstrate the amount of fluid allowed per day.

394
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:32,239
So sometimes we'll say, you know, fill up your fill up a jug or, you know, a two liter in the fridge with what you're able to drink.

395
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,590
That's all you can have that day. So sometimes that helps. Sometimes that's not helpful.

396
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:42,500
But we do they do need to really monitor and measure their fluid intake if they are under strict food restriction.

397
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:51,560
So nutrition interventions for individuals, the heart failure could include of course, you may have many others, you know,

398
00:43:52,040 --> 00:44:00,259
under the meals and snacks, it may be to modify the composition of their meals and snacks with a fluid modified diet, a mineral modified diet.

399
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,919
Most often, again, that's going to be sodium modified.

400
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,629
The schedule of foods and fluids, small,

401
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:11,930
frequent meals is going to be really important for most of these patients, especially those with early satiety.

402
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:18,320
An additional considerations may be that early satiety can cause a loss of appetite,

403
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:22,580
shortness of breath may cause anxiety or interfere with adequate food intake.

404
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:31,130
So patients who tend to get more symptomatic when eating, they may just not want to eat because that that's so uncomfortable for them.

405
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:34,730
And it can be actually kind of a fear based barrier.

406
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:42,049
And people consuming high sodium foods or foods prepared with salt may need to gradually decrease the sodium in their diet.

407
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:45,260
And I would highly recommend this as your intervention or your approach.

408
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,910
People that kind of gradually reduce their sodium intake,

409
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:56,330
it's less noticeable and that can be much more achievable as opposed to like if

410
00:44:56,330 --> 00:45:00,150
you do a diet recall and they're consuming 6000 milligrams of sodium a day,

411
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:02,390
it's like, well, actually you need to go down to two.

412
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,890
You know, that's not going to set up anybody for success and that's going to be really difficult.

413
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:15,350
So I highly recommend that we do a gradual decrease of sodium in the diet and work with our patients to to do that slowly over time.

414
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:18,110
So again,

415
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:26,270
nutrition interventions for sodium less than 2 to 3 grams per day for most patients with moderate to severe heart failure is going to be appropriate.

416
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,400
But again, we may have to liberalize that depending on their nutritional status.

417
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:41,930
So restrictions, less than two liters per day with patients with the serum sodium below 130 milligrams milk equivalents per liter.

418
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:49,190
You may see that. So sometimes they'll base the food restriction, not only not just on a team of weight gain,

419
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:53,089
the diuretic therapy, but they may look at their their sodium level.

420
00:45:53,090 --> 00:46:01,940
And those lab values, thiamin and potassium supplementation is going to be needed, as indicated, to compensate for losses in patients with diuretics.

421
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:07,790
And then we want to ensure that they're getting the dietary reference intake amounts for things like folate,

422
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:11,719
B12 and magnesium through foods and or supplements.

423
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:19,190
As we know, magnesium can also be depleted on diuretic therapy and if a patient currently drinks alcohol.

424
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:24,630
And it's maybe not contraindicated. It should be limited.

425
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:28,800
And then if alcohol is really believed to be a positive factor in heart failure.

426
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:33,990
You'll hear that, you know, removal or strict avoidance of alcohol is really encouraged.

427
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:41,190
So things that we need to monitor and evaluate, we definitely want to monitor their energy and protein intake.

428
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,510
These are patients at high risk for malnutrition. We need to ensure they're getting adequate nutrition.

429
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,379
We do monitor their sodium and fluid intake potentially.

430
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:56,880
That may involve adherence to a dash dietary pattern in our more stable outpatient heart failure patients.

431
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:06,419
Currently, we need to monitor their weight. So these patients often have a daily weight record and that will help us determine weight changes.

432
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:16,780
And this is really self-monitoring. So teaching them how to do that appropriately at home, monitoring their fluid intake so, you know,

433
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:22,139
determine the best method to monitor fluid intake in response to thirst that you can work that out with the patient.

434
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:28,440
What makes the most sense? Any other bioactive substance substances, alcohol intake, caffeine, herbal supplements?

435
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,879
All of these should be also be considered just because these patients are maybe on a lot of

436
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,860
medications that could appear with interfere with these things and just the disease itself.

437
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:41,969
It's important to know what else they may be taking in them.

438
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:49,230
Physical activity patterns. If they are able to maintain some level of physical activity, that's always going to be a benefit to these patients.

439
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:56,160
Okay. Just briefly, I want to talk about ventricular assist devices.

440
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,649
So really heart transplantation remains the sole long term success,

441
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:07,410
successful therapy for end stage heart failure with a mean survival of over ten years.

442
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:11,070
However, if we think about heart transplants,

443
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:19,740
the number of heart failure or there is limited organ availability in an increasing number of patients with heart failure.

444
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:29,610
So if we think about what leads to heart failure, often it's it's chronic disease like hypertension or other cardiovascular diseases.

445
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:34,290
So as more and more people with this high burden of these underlying conditions,

446
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:40,319
we're going to see more and more people with heart failure and not enough organs for transplant.

447
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:46,979
So that's resulted in an increased morbidity and mortality while patients are on the organ waitlist or on the transplant.

448
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:56,820
Wait, transplant waitlist. So recent developments for ventricular assist devices or VAD to support cardiac function as a either a destination therapy,

449
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:04,530
an alternative to transplant or maybe a bridge to transplant has greatly improved survival of heart failure patients across the world.

450
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:14,070
So a VAD is an implant, a implantable mechanical device that is used to partially or fully replace the functioning of a failing heart.

451
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:22,739
So the nutritional care for these ventricular assist device patients is pretty similar to those with heart failure.

452
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:32,129
There may be some differences. Patients can experience early, early satiety from the device in the abdominal and chest cavities.

453
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:35,850
There may be prolonged intubation with or without a tracheotomy.

454
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:43,709
So with this whole process for wound healing following, maybe open heart surgery can also contribute to poor nutritional intake.

455
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:46,710
So there can be some other more specific complications.

456
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:56,910
So other complications involve hardware infection, bowel obstruction, GI hemorrhage, hernias, pancreatitis.

457
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:02,879
So there's there's potentially other risks associated with this.

458
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,770
But recommendations to meet nutrition needs in these ventricular assist device

459
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:12,360
patients often does still involve a sodium restriction of two grams per day,

460
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:18,089
often also involves a fluid restriction for those who continue to experience heart

461
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:23,010
failure symptoms with fluid retention and or require high doses of diuretics.

462
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:26,129
Often these patients will be on a blood thinner.

463
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:35,640
So if they're on one that's known as warfarin or it may or Coumadin, they have to have a consistent vitamin K intake in their diet.

464
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:41,720
We'll get into Coumadin a little bit later in the semester and talk about why, you know,

465
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:47,760
we recommend a consistent amount of vitamin K and take oral nutrition supplements.

466
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,309
If oral intake is inadequate, may be appropriate.

467
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:58,350
So adequate protein needs, if they're normal weight, 1 to 1.5 grams per kilogram per day, they're obese,

468
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:06,420
1.5 to 2 grams per kilogram of ideal body weight would be an appropriate method to determine protein needs,

469
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:11,700
and then adequate energy intake could be estimated by 30 to 35 K calls per kilogram

470
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,650
of actual weight and if there will be 21 K calls per kilogram of actual weight.

471
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:20,180
And again, these may overestimate in some patients. So it will.

472
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,130
Careful with we're looking at our energy needs.

473
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:29,140
And again, we don't need to estimate energy and protein needs often if a patient is not on central or parenteral nutrition.

474
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:34,180
This is just to give you guys an idea of where where we may start with those estimates.

475
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:39,850
All right. So let's do some just a couple of frequently asked questions.

476
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:45,850
We've we've talked about this, but hopefully this came across what is the first nutrition priority in patients with heart failure?

477
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:49,360
If we were in class, we would have this discussion.

478
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:58,089
But the first nutrition priority for patients with heart failure is to ensure that they are able to ingest and tolerate a

479
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:05,860
sufficient amount of nutrients to maintain weight and support healing while while adhering to their low sodium and fluid plans.

480
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:11,470
Inadequate food intake contributes to the overall weakening effect of the condition,

481
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:16,570
so appetite may be poor because of discomfort and breathing difficulty.

482
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:20,980
Small frequent meals and easily tolerated foods may be helpful.

483
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,330
A medical food supplement may be appropriate for patients with a poor appetite.

484
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:32,260
However, remember, that's going to contribute to fluid intake and you will have to consider that in their daily fluid goal.

485
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:40,180
Okay. So nutrition priority is maintaining nutritional status while also or hopefully even improving

486
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:45,820
while trying to stay within an appropriate level of restriction for sodium and fluid.

487
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:50,770
So when is sodium restriction appropriate for a patient with heart failure?

488
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:56,260
So a sodium restriction should be initiated when prescribed by the physician and after it is confirmed that

489
00:52:56,260 --> 00:53:02,560
a patient has an appetite that is able to consume appropriate amount of macronutrients and micronutrients.

490
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:07,299
Remember, a sodium restricted diet in our nutritionally compromised patients with a poor

491
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:12,880
appetite can worsen outcomes and lead to further micronutrient deficiencies.

492
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:22,540
So caution must be exercised if a patient has a poor appetite and appears to be consuming sufficient sodium to exacerbate heart failure.

493
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:34,000
So we may need to liberalize those restrictions for patients with a very poor appetite because we can see that that may actually be beneficial.

494
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:42,190
All right. I know this is not ideal to do over a recording, but let's let's go through a case study kind of quickly.

495
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:46,330
So we have our patient, Bethany. She's 55.

496
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:51,880
She began to experience shortness of breath over several months while performing her normal daily activities.

497
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:58,750
She didn't think much of it. And so until she started to notice swelling in her feet and ankles, as well as sometimes some dizziness,

498
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:04,659
lightheadedness and a rapid heart rate, she also noticed fatigue following her normal activities.

499
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:11,680
So after visiting her primary care doctor, she went to see a cardiologist who ordered some blood tests and echocardiogram,

500
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:22,360
as well as a CT scan to examine the health of her heart. So much to her surprise, Bethany, who still considers herself fairly young and healthy,

501
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:29,170
was diagnosed with heart failure, could see her anthropometric here.

502
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:35,410
Her current weight is 80.9 kilograms, with the usual weight of 77.3.

503
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:40,150
She's not on any medications. Her CBC was unremarkable.

504
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:44,530
Her comprehensive metabolic panel showed mild hyponatremia.

505
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:52,780
So mild serum, low serum sodium. Medical history is significant for hypertension, not currently well controlled.

506
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,510
And she was started on medication management.

507
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:03,580
So Bethany has started on Lasix, given the fluid retention and is referred to the dietician for nutritional counseling.

508
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:06,940
And so this is her 24 hour dietary recall.

509
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:14,560
And if we were to plug this into something like chronometer, we would see that this is a very high sodium intake.

510
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:17,620
We would do this together in class. We'd see it was high sodium.

511
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:26,230
So things that have a lot of sodium could be these can biscuits, pork, sausage, sausage links.

512
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:35,140
We look at the Greek salad with pickled banana peppers, olives and a cheese dressing, seasoned chicken and lots of sodium potentially there.

513
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:42,009
Club soda has sodium pretzels depending on the diet soda.

514
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:45,190
Sometimes there can be sodium in there. And then this is a biggie.

515
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:52,809
Take out from Chinese restaurant so that this would have a lot of potential for sodium.

516
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:59,620
So fried rice, soy sauce and then the sauces used for the entree would be probably very high in sodium.

517
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:04,809
And then you can see here a snack of potato chips and diet soda.

518
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:07,930
So some more high sodium options there as well.

519
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:15,550
Okay. So where should we start given her history and that diet recall?

520
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,370
I think the thing that makes the most sense to start with would be accessibility.

521
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:26,700
Intake. And if we actually again calculated her sodium from that diet recall, we would see it was very high.

522
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:33,029
So related to undesirable food choices in the setting of heart failure as evidenced by diet recall demonstrating,

523
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:37,080
patient consuming 300% of the recommended amount of sodium per day.

524
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:43,240
Let's do a smart goal for this based on this statement.

525
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:48,390
So the Ardi and the patient identified a goal that the patient will limit daily,

526
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:54,170
daily sodium consumption to not exceed 3000 milligrams by the next encounter.

527
00:56:54,190 --> 00:57:01,809
So we're not going like crazy and trying to get well below, you know, at the two gram or even less.

528
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:07,390
We're trying just a gradual reduction. This will probably still be a significant reduction for the patient.

529
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:11,800
But again, we're we're going to shoot for like 3000 milligrams a day by the next encounter.

530
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:20,430
And so this would be appropriate because her appetite is good. We can focus on some good dietary interventions, some physical activity.

531
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,620
This patient is not malnourished at this point.

532
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:29,980
So these this is kind of the appropriate phase where we do want to implement some good dietary interventions.

533
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:38,439
So what that might look like in terms of meals and snacks. So modify the composition of her meals and snacks, recommended two grams sodium,

534
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:43,659
restrict diet or working toward that know we can change that 2 to 3 gram at first,

535
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:50,170
but eventually we're going to try and get to that two gram level and then whatever the fluid restriction was ordered based on the position.

536
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:56,170
So we're going to provide some nutrition education. Think of this as like an outpatient type of situation.

537
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:05,020
Educate the patient on sodium and fluid. Restrict diet. Help the patient distinguish between food sources that are high and low in sodium.

538
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:08,860
Discussed nutrition label reading to limit intake of sodium.

539
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:15,429
Guidance of foods to avoid with greater than 200 milligrams per sodium milligrams of sodium per serving.

540
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:23,080
Sometimes that's a good place to start. So like if you're looking at a food label and it has to over 200 milligrams per serving,

541
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:29,170
let's try and find a different option because that eventually is going to lead to probably high intake when everything is added up.

542
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:34,360
Use of herbs, spices, potentially other salt substitutes.

543
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:39,729
Well, we'll have to be careful with the use in certain populations.

544
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:43,600
Sometimes salt substitutes replace salt with potassium.

545
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:47,740
So that's not going to be appropriate for like our renal patients that retain potassium.

546
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:55,809
But also we talk about, you know, lemon juice, vinegar and all those things can enhance flavor when cooking and offer guidance on

547
00:58:55,810 --> 00:59:02,140
managing sodium consumption while dining out because dining out restaurant meals,

548
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:06,280
packaged, processed foods are huge sources of sodium.

549
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:18,009
Okay, so what should we monitor to assess for adherence of diet and fluid goals where we want to monitor her sodium intake in 24 hours?

550
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:25,150
So let's see. A patient can reduce daily sodium consumption by at least 50% on average by the next encounter.

551
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:34,209
So have her tracker intake. Or at least sometimes I'll do like a three day food diary and have them send it to me between visits and we'll say,

552
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:38,200
okay, look, you know, our goal is to kind of cut down by 50%.

553
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,889
That's a big drop. So maybe we even do that a little bit more gradually.

554
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:48,790
But we're not we're not doing like it may not be appropriate to do a big, drastic goal,

555
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:54,760
but maybe something that is gradual and achievable by that next encounter with the dietitian.

556
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,989
Fluid intake limit daily oral food consumption to two liters.

557
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:08,889
And we can monitor that by again, by a patient tracking their intake weight change really important in terms of monitoring in this population.

558
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:15,370
I know hopefully this has kind of been reinforced throughout the semester, but especially in this this population,

559
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:23,829
the waits are helpful for more than just, you know, has a patient gained or lost, but it can be a reflection of their fluid retention.

560
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:31,960
So daily weights, we don't want to exceed about a half a pound weight gain in 24 hours and also monitor for physical signs of edema,

561
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:40,000
swelling in the ankles, you know, in the legs, in the feet, electrolyte and renal profile we would monitor.

562
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:46,390
So looking at those serum sodium levels to be maintained within normal limits and then physical activity,

563
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:52,150
even just a small amount, you know, being physically active for at least 10 minutes per day,

564
01:00:52,270 --> 01:01:00,490
monitoring for signs of fatigue, all of these things are kind of part of our comprehensive care of these patients and can be really, really helpful.

565
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:05,469
So these are just some suggestions for a patient like this that is relatively stable.

566
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:13,690
It's a new diagnosis. Appetite is good where we can really implement some some dietary changes, lifestyle changes that can be very helpful.

567
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:18,400
So that's all I have for today. On heart failure.

568
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:25,120
If you have questions on anything discussed, of course, please feel free to email me.

569
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:35,140
Make sure you do watch the disease process lecture as well, and then we can go over any any questions about this population in class as needed.
