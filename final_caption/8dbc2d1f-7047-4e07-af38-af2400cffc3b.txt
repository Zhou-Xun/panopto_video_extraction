1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:07,110
Anytime on Thursday. If you do have for some reason something that's popping up, it's going to make it difficult to do on Thursday.

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,070
Just shoot me a note. There have been a couple of folks that it's just reached out for whatever reason.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,150
Can I have a little bit of time to do this? Yeah, that's fine. I promise it's not a big deal.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,620
All right. Any other questions for the good of the car as well?

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:28,100
I get back to this. And I'm sorry, I just posted this saying I realized that I was trying to advance times at the time.

6
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:36,470
So the last three weeks we have been talking about the foundations of regression and multiple regression, which and I promise you,

7
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:42,160
I told you everything that we were going to be learning the last three weeks we were going to build on in the future.

8
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:48,490
In particular last week when we were going through all those different assumptions about whether or not we can trust the results of our model.

9
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,670
Are the findings valid? Those are important things to do.

10
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,370
We're going to be checking our model assumptions any time we want to run a regression model so that we can be confident in our results.

11
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,800
The rest of the semester, in its own way, it's some kind of special, endearing way.

12
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,920
We're going to start violating those assumptions one at a time.

13
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:13,309
So what happens when we take some of those and I guess those kind of foundational assumptions

14
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:18,230
that we think make our regression model tenable and then start to tweak them a little bit?

15
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,270
And our first example is going to be that very first assumption that I asked you to think about,

16
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:28,760
which is don't call it the linear relationship between our predictor variables and our own variables.

17
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,860
What happens when there is not a linear rela relationship?

18
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:39,950
What happens if it's curvilinear, or what happens when it varies by as a function of some other variable?

19
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,980
So that's what interactions are all about.

20
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:53,420
I was on a call this morning with some colleagues who are writing a chapter about gun violence, but it's a public health approach to gun violence.

21
00:01:53,780 --> 00:02:00,320
And the reason why I like today, this week is when you start thinking about the way we approach problems in public health,

22
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,600
it's rarely a straightforward bivariate relationship or even a multivariate relationship.

23
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:13,910
We're usually looking for some sort of nuance and some sort of mechanism through which we think there is some sort of cause and effect relationship,

24
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,059
right, for interactions. These are our interventions.

25
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:23,570
How does our intervention change associations between, for example, risk factors and our outcome variables?

26
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,580
This is how we're going to test right is rarer than some of the work that we do in

27
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,350
public health can be boiled down to kind of your simple multiple regression equation.

28
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,969
So and then when we get into mediation later on in the semester where we start talking about some of

29
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,740
those intervening variables and how we can first manipulate those which then turn into the outcome,

30
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,220
then that's some of the exciting stuff that feels like public health,

31
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,569
that feels like where we want to be moving on, especially as our modeling gets more complex.

32
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:56,020
So that's this week. I should have had this slide up while I was talking through some of those things.

33
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:04,670
This is less in concert, but then just transpose these to like, oh know.

34
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:12,410
Oh, that's right. So this is really the only point of this slide is to say that when I think about nonlinear regression,

35
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,440
you can absolutely model things like kind of polynomials.

36
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,749
So think about what your quadratic curves and stuff like that. We're not going to cover that so much this week.

37
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,389
We're going to do that when we get into growth modeling later on,

38
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:30,410
because that's one of our standard kind of polynomials that we're looking for in when we're trying to model change over time,

39
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,770
we're really going to be focusing on interaction terms.

40
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,820
So this is an actually I'm asking you to tell me what interaction terms are for,

41
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:44,450
but that's where our focus is going to be this week and then come week, whatever it's going to be later on in November.

42
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:50,600
And we get into modeling change over time, that's going to be a great place to introduce nonlinear change.

43
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:56,839
So that's relevant. But first today, we're going to let's see here, what are we going to do?

44
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:03,950
We're going to recap a couple of ideas. We had some questions around missing data last week that just were kind of naturally popping up.

45
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,780
So I want to spend a little bit of time.

46
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:13,370
We can either do this first or second, going through some missing data examples, and then finally we'll get into interaction terms.

47
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:18,620
And so the order of this, I think, is going to be contingent on how folks are feeling about the content from this week.

48
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:24,860
So I'm asking you to be very honest with me about whether you watched the video and whether you have questions about interaction terms,

49
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,140
because these are complex. If it wasn't just like an automatic deal, yeah, I get this.

50
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,340
Don't feel bad. It takes a long time to really kind of understand what's happening behind the scenes.

51
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:40,460
So that's kind of where we are. Questions so far.

52
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,030
Before I get started with our recap of questions from the weekend's content.

53
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,590
The readings are going to videos. I was them up here.

54
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,860
I won't answer them right. Right now. They're just so you that I touch on.

55
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,490
Then we watch the videos and how are we watching the video game or.

56
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,080
Yeah, that's a pretty general question.

57
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:14,490
Talking about interaction terms, is that only like the moderator for others?

58
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:29,670
Okay. There's.

59
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,730
Just one question I'll ask again.

60
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,569
I think you sort of talked about it in the video, but also when you're looking at clients and looking at their lines,

61
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,610
whether they're parallel or not, and there's you mentioned figuring it out.

62
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:02,990
And mathematically, if there's actually an issue versus trying to figure out if there's pricing at some point.

63
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:09,620
Mm hmm. Okay. Yes.

64
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:19,629
I need. I need a reminder of, like what? Depending on the type of there you have variability.

65
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:25,240
You have what functions you're using. Like whether there's a factor when it's.

66
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:36,179
This is a problem. I forget what part of the neighborhood. So they're not necessarily functions.

67
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,040
But right now, depending on what type of variable you have variable classes.

68
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:52,259
Okay. You know what? There are a couple of times you had to change how we were telling Arthur, but I'll tell you what that was.

69
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:57,980
That also when we were talking about like simple slopes and we kind of broke down a factor five levels, maybe.

70
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,980
Maybe. That's all right. Okay, we'll see what else.

71
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,290
This is only so. I remember. I feel pretty shattered out now.

72
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:17,040
And. Good. Some do this here.

73
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,680
I know. What better way to enthusiasm than to talk about regression assumptions?

74
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:29,040
Where the plot. There's a promised plot. What's wrong with what?

75
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:45,180
This is a residual plot. At this point, we're like the mountain lions.

76
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,680
I like the first term. Yeah. What's wrong with the variability here?

77
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,520
Quite far away. Where is it? Quite far off.

78
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:10,500
Towards the end, you know. But then what about over here? And not that far off, is it?

79
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,160
Well, it is. What we have is we have a little bit of variability.

80
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,210
A little bit. A little. A little bit more. A little bit more. A little bit more. A little bit more a little bit more.

81
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,760
The the more what a violation are we know or we examined here.

82
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:24,480
Where are we noticing here? Okay.

83
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:34,740
This is Pedro's. Good answer. Yes. I mean, this is a header is going to ask, why do we have a violation of our homogeneity of variance?

84
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,620
Right. So we as we are assuming in a perfect world that across all values of our X variable,

85
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:45,930
these kind of residuals should be more or less even across the whole range of X.

86
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,670
There is a fairly clear funneling that's happening here as we go from right to left.

87
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,170
And that's a that's a problem.

88
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:59,010
This probably means that we have a lot more precision with our measurement on this side relative to many fewer observations there.

89
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:05,220
Or there could be some factor that just kind of keeps people all kind of saying the same thing about your variable here,

90
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,400
but then have a lot of variability towards the higher end of the scale.

91
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,350
And so it's difficult to necessarily just pinpoint it with that, just looking at a residual flow.

92
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:23,760
But there is something that we need to account for here in terms of that the variance that we see in the residuals you probably saw

93
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:30,990
in the data there is there's often like kind of a cut off and it looks like there's just a like a line kind of a slanted line.

94
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:38,850
And that's because we use scales that people will just say the lowest value to everything, kind of anchor on one end of the scale.

95
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:46,380
And so there are there's a lot of there's there's not as much variability down here by the zero and by the ones like a low and nzd.

96
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:51,830
But then when you get up to the signs of anxiety or whatever, you see a little bit more variability.

97
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:56,340
Just the basic questions about this.

98
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,750
Not as easy to see in empirically.

99
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:08,690
We you can use the 11 means tested we need to but it's going to force you to have some sort of factor variable.

100
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:14,490
Most of our predictor variables are continuous and so that just has maybe a little bit more limited utility.

101
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,720
So we can use plots to just to see if we think this is going to be an issue.

102
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:27,870
Uh, let's hear also from last week. Um.

103
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,340
Folks were testing, asking me about when and how you needed to plot.

104
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,970
Every single predictor, variable or run test for every single predictor variable.

105
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,930
I don't think it's the worst thing in the world to do that by very low level.

106
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:46,900
But really what we're talking about is the residuals after you're running your final model.

107
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:52,690
So when you have that, you know that model three, you think it's better than model two and one.

108
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,750
That's when I'll typically do a more intensive examination of those residuals to make sure that my preferred model,

109
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:04,720
based on my change in R squared or based on the coefficients or whatever, is the model that I want to move forward with.

110
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,050
Now, let me check some of those assumptions and make sure that it's still compelling.

111
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:15,610
You know, if you have all the time in the world, maybe you're still building your small one check residuals right now to send back to the Model three.

112
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:23,680
But in practice, I typically look at the N1 and that reminds me, I will get your video about the homework and even moving forward.

113
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,990
My Camtasia broke so I had to get a new license, but I have it now, so I should go make that video.

114
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,140
Questions about this, I mean,

115
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:42,220
this really is more your kind of decision about how much word you want to put into these examinations and how much you want to do it by variable.

116
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:50,290
I will say that sometimes it's a little easier to pick out errors or flaws or problems when you have just one or two variables in your model.

117
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:55,570
The more you have, the more likely things are to be kind of masked or confounded by other variables.

118
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:00,520
So it's a little harder to tease out which of these variables is starting to, you know,

119
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:06,489
mock up my model fit or the residuals are starting to wear out of alignment or something like that.

120
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:12,100
So you can think about kind of like stepwise either addition or deletion approaches.

121
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,380
So one variable at a time as you're, as you're making your new models or subtracting one variable at a time.

122
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:24,550
And so you get to a model that you feel doesn't have, you know, issues with some of the assumptions or something like that.

123
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:34,170
Question. All right.

124
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,040
Now we're going to show our shift for you today.

125
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:46,290
Uh, tell me, why are meaningful zero values for predictor variables really important when we want to create these interaction terms?

126
00:12:51,980 --> 00:13:01,250
You need that kind of anger. So when we're using interesting variables, we're no longer able to say a direct association.

127
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,430
So by scaling your. It's like giving meaning to zero so we can.

128
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,450
So. Relationship assessment. Yeah.

129
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:23,520
I mean, essentially, this is there are there to interpret what I'll call the conditional manifests.

130
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:31,320
So when we run our standard regression equations and it's just a bunch of predictor variables predict, I know an outcome variable.

131
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,060
Those are what we call kind of main effects, the main effect of sex,

132
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:46,440
the main effect of reducing the effect of at a future orientation and the average effect across everybody has future orientation related to anxiety,

133
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,130
holding everything else constant. Okay, main effect.

134
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:59,940
When we have an interaction term, we have our interaction term that is literally that multiplication of two variables.

135
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:07,230
Right? And then we have those variables by themselves also in the model.

136
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:18,540
So I figure with my the examples would be here for generic, but if we had it was like feature orientation, interacting with sex,

137
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:25,680
predicting anxiety, we would have an interaction term that would include the multiplication of sex and teacher orientation.

138
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:32,970
But then typically standard practice is to also include determination by itself and sex by itself.

139
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:42,780
Those are what I call conditional main effects. When anything is, when you have a meaningful zero value for either of both or both of those terms,

140
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:50,040
you can find instances at certain levels of one variable where the interaction term will reduce out to zero.

141
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,300
Basically, anytime you multiply something by zero, you get a zero, right?

142
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:02,490
That leaves an interpretable, conditional main effect in your model that you can talk about in relation to the outcome variable.

143
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,530
And I'll give you an example of that, but this is why it's important. It's a little bit like The Intercept.

144
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,679
We're trying to get to a certain level of interpretability, and we can do that when,

145
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,180
for example, our energy interaction terms have a meaningful zero, right?

146
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:24,480
So we are either going to use factor variables which will have a zero value because of the domain coding.

147
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:31,580
Or we can think about the scaling of our continuous variables.

148
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:39,240
So we can do things like centering a variable so that when we talk about a meaningful value of a centered variable, that's the mean.

149
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:43,920
For example, the mean in future edition course.

150
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:51,540
Remember that from the value of my position, we'll spend a little bit of time today,

151
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:58,319
but that's sure to try to just kind of keep that in your head that it's really about interpretability we're trying to make forward,

152
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,930
you know, that equation, I don't know. I use into the equations too often we're trying to find situations where it's helpful

153
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:10,320
to have one of those values be zero and factor variables actually make for nice,

154
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:16,290
nice examples of that. Interactions and mediation each require three more variables.

155
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:23,040
What is the difference between the two approaches? Don't.

156
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:38,300
I remember mediation is like the causal link that shows acts, causes the moderator and which causes why the mediator.

157
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,819
When you go to the right, yeah. So usually, I mean, is that kind of an interface?

158
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,380
The example is something like this.

159
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:58,490
You know, and interaction is like two variables that causing one and I'm not sure if they look different from that.

160
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,060
Yeah. Want to help. I mean.

161
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:17,529
I can't see to somebody to answer. So I think the difference is that in the second one interactions X has a relationship with

162
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:22,300
Y and the interaction has some effect on that and the [INAUDIBLE] that's already there.

163
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:26,440
Exactly. So in this case, with an invasive mediation,

164
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:35,280
as the ways that are variable is first changing or explaining variability and or mediating variable, which in turn affects the outcome here.

165
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:41,200
Right. So in order to effect y, x is first doing something to M.

166
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,050
It is very much in this kind of causal framework.

167
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:52,839
There is a flow to the effect here and you can decide whether or not there's still kind of what they call a direct effect and versus indirect effect.

168
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,680
And what is the kind of relative proportion of indirect versus direct?

169
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:06,550
It's quite a set in moderation. The third variable is affecting the association or the relationship between X and Y.

170
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:12,250
So it changes the strength or direction of the relationship between these two variables.

171
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:21,260
It makes it stronger. And I said weaker or it changes by some level of this third or fourth sign or something.

172
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:29,350
My definitions are very might be so different sort of mechanisms operating there, different sorts of questions typically.

173
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:39,760
Again, our interventions, our moderators, right, we provide some additional training or curriculum or we expose people to some positive thing.

174
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,410
It changes to the strength of the relationship between the risk factor and the outcome there.

175
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:52,630
Right. The there's less anxiety and substance use.

176
00:18:52,900 --> 00:19:01,389
Right. Anxiety predicts substance use. Well, we have some substance use intervention, perhaps that changes the relationship between the two or,

177
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:08,500
I don't know, future orientation intervention. Right. So the future orientation intervention is designed to change the risk their relationship,

178
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:15,159
those who are exposed to intervention, their relationship between substance use and anxiety and substance use actually.

179
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,889
Right. So if we attenuate something by trying to introduce people to thinking about the

180
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:26,950
future perspective and versus our intervention is rarely going to be a mediator.

181
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:31,300
People don't change or intervention, which then in turn changes are often variable.

182
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,900
Right. This is usually more kind of mechanistic descriptive.

183
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:39,910
I'm trying to describe some, some pathway through which people's behavior changes.

184
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:49,030
Uh, intervention changes.

185
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:58,929
Your belief that you can do a behavior which changes the behavior and maybe wants to shout out their own intervention?

186
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,960
That became quite a bit about this.

187
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:11,320
Yeah. So when we're doing our analysis.

188
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:18,850
Are we also running for office or are we?

189
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,620
Trying to assume that our intervention isn't the moderator.

190
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:32,780
So it's a great question and it comes down to how you're trying to conceptualize in your model, how you think things are related to each other.

191
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:40,610
I guess the last visit, the last model that I can put in here is what is really more of your kind of standard regression model.

192
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,030
So I'll just say this is either kind of a control or confounding variable.

193
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:53,780
Yeah, you're exhalation is breaking y and then you have these other variables that are kind of ability to access.

194
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,080
They're independent, but we also know that they affect the outcome variable.

195
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:03,800
So what we're trying to figure out is what's my relationship between X and Y after kind of controlling for or accounting for this variable?

196
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,580
So you have four variables that you want to include in your model.

197
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:13,070
How they kind of map on to these different examples is entirely up to you.

198
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,440
You can, believe it or not,

199
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:22,190
test indirect effects in every single one of the regression models that we ran this semester that has more than two thirds if you want it.

200
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:28,849
There's a big assumption there, right, that your one variable first explains variability in another variable,

201
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,200
which then in turn explains the outcome variable. But it can still be calculated.

202
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:40,940
Similarly, as you find out from video, you can create all kinds of crazy interactions true variable three variable for variable interactions.

203
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:48,200
And it really comes down to what can you justify? I mean, this is a supposed to be a model that kind of predicts frame rate.

204
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,980
This is a mathematical tool to represent the data or the reality that we see.

205
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:53,900
How are you going to do that?

206
00:21:53,900 --> 00:22:04,340
How are you going to explain or justify why you feel that participant shoes should interact with height and therefore predict substance use?

207
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
I don't know what data is available to you.

208
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:14,510
I mean, there's lots of stuff in our data sets that could or could not be operationalized through these different forms of models.

209
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,160
Multiple regression interaction. Moderation, mediation.

210
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,220
Am I the only one who thinks this is really exciting stuff?

211
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:42,680
As her said her. Can we go?

212
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,200
Let's do interactions first and then. Well, then we can spend some time with missing the.

213
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,930
Okay. I want to make sure that folks are okay with that.

214
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:58,760
There there is. And it is kind of I have just it's a script file that I put on canvas and it's I mean, we can.

215
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,880
It's it is kind of like kind of walk us through just a couple of examples.

216
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:06,959
But if you want to make sure that folks are comfortable with this, this pops up with the residuals.

217
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:15,320
Their friends should do the same, which means they are wi fi. But the in particular, if you were trying to save files at different lengths,

218
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,700
this is one of the reasons why I want folks to understand how we handle missing data.

219
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,880
And it's good to know anyways. But. All right.

220
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:28,490
But let's go and let's try to spend some time in our interactions here, and then we can return to that example testing interactions.

221
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,580
This is the way that I like to do it. Doesn't mean this is the way you have to do it.

222
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,010
But what I like this.

223
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:45,080
I kind of start with anytime that I have some data, even if I know in my head I'm ultimately going to get to something that looks like this.

224
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:49,490
I'm still going to spend some time mucking around with my binary data.

225
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:56,509
I just think it's a good idea. Why? Because you're going to see what the relationships between your outcome variable and each of your

226
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:00,800
independent variables is going to be when there are just two things that we got to worry about.

227
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:12,340
I think this is good because as soon as you start creating multiplicative terms, you can lose some of that kind of kind of guiding light.

228
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:19,310
If you know that there is a strong positive correlation between what are your independent variables and your dependent variable,

229
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:23,840
and then all of a sudden you include some additional variables in your model or some interaction terms in your model.

230
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:28,040
And those signs start to flip or get much smaller or get much larger.

231
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:34,670
That does suggest that there's probably some interaction happening or could even indicate that there's some mediation or confounding happening.

232
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,480
So having a sense of where we are was just to.

233
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,590
Right. Just too can be helpful. Right.

234
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:47,660
Questions about model one or step one.

235
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:55,280
You know how to do step one if everyone feel comfortable generating a correlation matrix at this point.

236
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,089
Okay. Make a note if you don't see Justin.

237
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:08,180
I know Justin. I'm not quite sure I'm comfortable running correlation making to this point.

238
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:17,510
When we go over step two now we're going to move out of the boat over by the end zone and into kind of a multiple regression.

239
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,230
I call this main effects. Average effects.

240
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:27,470
Main effects model. These are all the predictor variables, all the independent variables by themselves.

241
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:33,710
This allows us to run a model like this where we get to say something like, you know, you didn't change an X.

242
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:45,770
Controlling for all these other things is associated with a beta coefficient change in or this is what we did two weeks ago or last week.

243
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:54,979
I think, yeah, you did the midterm for three weeks.

244
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,280
Two weeks? So how we do it? All right.

245
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:05,090
No problems. No problem. No problems. The next, we now introduce our interaction term.

246
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:14,120
You watch the video. This is incredibly easy to do in our software, which is a it's a positive thing.

247
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,120
And it can also be a little bit of a negative thing when it's too easy,

248
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,890
when it's just when you can start throwing around too many interaction terms really quickly.

249
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,520
We can lose sight of what the question is that we're really trying to answer.

250
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,989
So I would not suggest adding interaction terms unless you have a pretty good reason to believe that there's something about one

251
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:41,240
of our third variables that should change the strength and the direction of the relationship between X and the outcome variable.

252
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:48,920
Then we just revert back to week five, whichever model for the assumptions.

253
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,960
That's not going to change with our interaction model, right?

254
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,180
Especially with the kind of interaction models that we typically run which are still

255
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:01,160
assuming linear relationships at different levels of our moderating variable.

256
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,110
And the outcome variables are the very good.

257
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:11,720
So whether we're talking about a number one, two, three of this moderating variable,

258
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:16,430
we still assume that there is a linear association between X and Y.

259
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:23,570
So there are some basic assumptions that we covered last week that still pertain here.

260
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:33,960
Finally, if we do have a significant interaction, we are going to take a look at where that interaction is sort of happening.

261
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:38,930
And that's this kind of simple slopes idea. So we know that there is a significant interaction.

262
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:43,820
Ah, our multiplicative term has some stars by p value, less than point of fact.

263
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:52,670
All right. Now let's break down this moderating variable and check out what this association looks like at different levels.

264
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,010
That's what I mean when I say simple.

265
00:27:55,010 --> 00:28:02,810
So you're now taking different levels of a moderating variable and looking at the exact same association across those different levels.

266
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,580
And there's going to be some nice visuals of that, too.

267
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,710
But those are the five steps.

268
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:17,000
If I ask you to do this in your homework assignment, if I ask you to do this in the in the midterm, I would expect something similar to this.

269
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:22,880
At the very least, you're running in this, then this.

270
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:31,610
You should listen, but and then definitely get the main effect model.

271
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:36,470
So that's the equation. Without the interaction term, what does it look like when you have the interaction term?

272
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:44,280
And then assuming this is significant, let's look a little bit deeper into that interaction and then studious work.

273
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:54,050
All right. If you leave today remembering nothing else, this is the slide I want you to remember.

274
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:02,270
And I'm sorry. It has to be an equation slide, but all it's doing is kind of breaking down an interaction equation.

275
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:09,830
Right? So this is our intercept x1x2x1 times two folks.

276
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,240
Okay, you recognize this now? Is is moderation interaction synonymous?

277
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,730
Same thing. Good.

278
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:29,630
All we're doing here is reorganizing a little bit to kind of show or use the language so that we can talk about when we have a third variable,

279
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:35,210
how it changes the strength or direction of the association between X and Y.

280
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:41,390
Like I said, okay, I kind of pick out one variable.

281
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,410
One manages to like this to be the moderator, right?

282
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:57,770
The one that I'm going to talk about. So which one of X or x one or x two is going to be kind of my focal variable that changes the relationship?

283
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:05,930
And the reason why that's important is because we can use kind of a reorganization of terms.

284
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:11,990
All right. We're just taking the equation of book and changing it down here.

285
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:24,170
What I want you to focus on is this piece. They want times next month that they don't want.

286
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:27,190
Is the effect of X on the outcome here?

287
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:33,120
Right. There's nothing that. Right.

288
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,749
Okay. And then just just the reason why this is important is because we've now shifted things.

289
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:44,430
We're inside this bracket that becomes a new baby.

290
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:52,380
That becomes a new effect. What we've done here is we've combined information from Beta one.

291
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:58,560
We've added the effect from the interaction term.

292
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,900
Okay. Is there three? You really add that here.

293
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:11,340
We've factored out our drawing.

294
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:20,070
We factored out the experience. The reason why this is really, really important and why I want you to remember this slide,

295
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:27,960
this chunk right here represents the effect of x one on our algebra.

296
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:36,380
What's different about this data?

297
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:40,299
One, the effect of a vaccine Y versus this.

298
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,620
Now, with the interaction term,

299
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:58,930
what's inside this bracket varies as a function of X to depending on X to what's inside this bracket gets bigger or smaller,

300
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,330
depending on whether this gets bigger or smaller.

301
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:09,080
The effect of X on our outcome variable changes.

302
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:22,030
That's the essence of moderation. And that's what I need you to have to remember that the effect of X and Y changes as a combination of itself,

303
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,590
as well as that second variable, that moderating variance.

304
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:32,860
And if that's true, believe or not, it's reduced down to a couple of numbers here.

305
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,650
But that's huge. That is huge.

306
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:45,370
Think about the variables in your world that matter and imagine that the effect of, for example, your program.

307
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:54,460
Right? My program's effect on y. Imagine if that varies by some function of another variable.

308
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:05,799
Who is it? Who attends my program? Some of the conditions that my program is operating in right are policies that are in place,

309
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:13,360
are not in place, all of which could have a major effect on how well my program predicts myself.

310
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,600
And that's the strength of interactions.

311
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:23,860
We can test some of those more nuanced relationships, and that's public healthy stuff that's go blue.

312
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:25,910
I like this. Right.

313
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:34,660
We want to think about, you know, not instead of just holding other things constant, what is the interplay between my predictor variable,

314
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:39,639
my focal predictor and some third extraneous variable that I know is coming in and

315
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:44,410
having an effect on the strength or direction of my whatever I think I do is so,

316
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:53,700
so important. Right. So in this case, I've kind of pulled out ex to somewhat arbitrarily because it's all reciprocal, right?

317
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:58,870
So interaction term, they don't care. There's not really an order. So you could have done the same thing over here,

318
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:09,610
but I've kind of pulled out X as my focal moderator because the relationship between x one is changing and different levels of x two.

319
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:17,620
But we could have easily done this where x two is the kind of key for a variable that changes as a function of an x.

320
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:29,110
Now, I'm sorry to spend 3 minutes yelling at you about an equation, but I needed to just kind of hang with this slide for a second,

321
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:35,620
a minute or whatever people say, now let's just give it a second to let it kind of sink in.

322
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:45,250
But if you can, nothing else. Today you got this bracketed term that represents the effect of our predictor variable on the outcome and that effect,

323
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:49,280
that association, that relationship depends on some third.

324
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,970
Do me a favor. Go home tonight or this afternoon.

325
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:59,440
Find a buddy, find a friend, grandparent, parent, friend, whomever, and just try to explain.

326
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:05,290
This doesn't have to be in with equations, just in your own language,

327
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:14,479
what it means to have a moderated relationship and maybe even to try to insert some of the variables that you care about into these equations.

328
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:23,320
And you can say, Well, what's really happening here is my I'm really bad at coming up with examples on the fly that are not from like a pass.

329
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:30,940
If anybody wants to just shout out a couple of variables cold weather and sweaters.

330
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:46,890
The relationship between cold weather and the likelihood of wearing this way could vary as a function to your how much fairness and your hipster ness.

331
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:54,700
Hipster ness? Yes, sure. So low level hipster ness might change thoroughly.

332
00:35:54,700 --> 00:36:06,090
I mean, the the likelihood that someone when it's on our list would flip because I like hipster ness predicting sweaters and hipsters burning sweater.

333
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:10,330
This might vary as a function of how cold it is outside, right?

334
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:17,590
So typically at low levels of cold, 32 degrees, it doesn't matter how much of you answer you are you trying to wear sweaters?

335
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:29,200
Come on, let's go. But as it starts to warm, we might expect those with maybe less hipsters to say, you know, I'll forget this sweater.

336
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,530
I'm going to go ahead and. Just stop working.

337
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,150
And we're not talking about the economy so completely variable, which is really weak, seven or eight, but that's okay.

338
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:42,360
But as we start to see more and more, as the heat starts to go up and up and up and up,

339
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:49,760
the fact that you have this desire to wear your sweater versus not those things are not independent of one another.

340
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:54,960
We think that there's something about one that's informing the other that that is kind of predicting our relationship.

341
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,920
Try to it sounds goofy, I know, but try to explain this to somebody outside of this room.

342
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:08,310
Try, if you can, to think through just the numbers, but then absolutely trying to talk through the variables as well,

343
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:15,270
because this is the interesting stuff and it doesn't have to just be the interact and hear the intervention if you're interested or you're moderate.

344
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:21,850
I use lots of stuff in my work that's not an intervention, but I'm still looking at that.

345
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,630
Doesn't get moderated relationships, right?

346
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:33,420
Demographic variables are all often, very often levels of stress levels or any levels of socioeconomic status, urban, rural, suburban, right?

347
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:39,520
All of those things could be impacting or interacting with other terms, right?

348
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:44,760
And you start to see that multiple levels we can think about multilevel interactions.

349
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:51,450
So grouping variables that interact in individual variables will use these things quite a bit in this class or.

350
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:58,560
Questions. All right.

351
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:07,680
So the rest of this, I think, was to try to walk through an example I have here, the relationship between depression and emotional support.

352
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:26,410
Is that top variable in the interaction and that tops this and says now you're in that top sense relationship between provision of support,

353
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:30,590
social support and depression. This is a direct relationship.

354
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:35,499
In this case, it's a binary relationship. Also doesn't hurt to start talking through something you see.

355
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:41,680
Sounds like this. How would I model this? Hmm. All right, so we think that there's a relationship between these two variables.

356
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:54,010
Now, all of a sudden, we want to see whether or not age and sex change the strength of the relationship between social support and depression.

357
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,149
We think that there is no we don't have a hypothesis here.

358
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,389
But what's your hypothesis? You watched the videos crunching.

359
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:04,540
That's okay. What's the relationship between sessions for depression?

360
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:13,760
Positive, negative, marginal. No right.

361
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,480
As your social support goes up, maybe your pressures goes down.

362
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:23,950
This cross-sectional data could be possible that folks that are at the heart have higher levels of preferences for social support.

363
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:28,450
I don't know. But I think the way that we're kind of setting this up is more social support, less depression.

364
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:35,230
But we want to know whether or not two demographic variables might change the strength or direction of that relationship.

365
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:40,780
All right. My so we're not to we're going to skip that first step, that correlation step,

366
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,160
but to jump right to this is what I call, again, that main effect model.

367
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,530
Main effect model has no interaction terms. We're just trying to figure out kind of what is the issue, if you will,

368
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:56,380
kind of a baseline of the associations between these variables and the outcome variable.

369
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,830
And I didn't say in the video, I apologize that we had to use this.

370
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:05,590
I could have used an example from a pre-fab dataset, and actually I think I have one later on.

371
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:11,980
There's always work when you try to run interaction terms in practice with actual data, a lot harder to make them work.

372
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:18,879
So the only way that I could make this work was to include this substance use variable not only included,

373
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:24,940
but included as basically ordinal variable, which is why you have like one, two, three, four, five, six coefficients here.

374
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:33,430
So the only reason why this is really in here is so that the interaction term would be significant, but we can still interpret this.

375
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:42,610
Everyone, just give me a quick rundown of what you find here, what's jeopardizing this output?

376
00:40:52,550 --> 00:41:05,280
Once they're gone. And people. Nonetheless, the relationship between sex and a depression.

377
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:27,650
Depression. But we want it to end.

378
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:33,890
Okay, so it's. Positive.

379
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:40,590
Yeah. Well, what does that mean for a variable like sex is due to the two of us.

380
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:49,560
Also isn't female and male. Yep. I think that means.

381
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:57,720
You have higher levels of depression in the sample, males and females compared with that.

382
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:02,520
Who has higher levels of depression in the sample? Males are females. Female Yeah.

383
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,360
So this is what our positive coefficient says relative to our referent category.

384
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:12,629
Males right. Our curator coefficient says it's a positive 26 and this is significant.

385
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:19,470
So relative to our standard error, a one year change in sex in this case, which is just moving from male to female,

386
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,210
is associated with about a 0.26 predicted difference or change interaction variable.

387
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:31,360
Good with that given that yes or no, you're mid-terms in two weeks.

388
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:41,880
So yeah, that's not important in this case. That is in this case it would you would I guess interpreted slightly different because of the interaction.

389
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:47,580
Oh interesting. There's no interaction here. Oh there's no interaction here.

390
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,659
Oh I it now we'll get there.

391
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:56,819
We'll get there and you're right but this is a main effect models them all to actually run correlations I mean

392
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:04,770
effect model interaction model you're missing check your assumption you should you really should remember.

393
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,160
Yeah.

394
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:20,280
So just to clarify, this is looking at like the effects of age and depression and then controlling for rate sex and differences in social support.

395
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:23,490
Yeah. And all this is model regression.

396
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:26,760
This is reinforcement based. You got this down right graph.

397
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:39,190
Yeah. What does this model explain? How much variability. Have you figured out what that means for square feet?

398
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:40,120
That's correct.

399
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:47,710
Explain about 13% of the variability or if you want to be conservative, about 12% draw with the effect of social support on depression.

400
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:02,670
But for the soldiers who worked through the evacuation, surrender.

401
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:09,080
So the negative correlation to a negative. Yeah. How would you say that?

402
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:19,959
Kind of formally when it came that that's sort of where you change in social support.

403
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,650
We predict about a .13 decrease in your brain, your reported depression.

404
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:31,910
Questions about this and the appearance of seems really unfamiliar.

405
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:39,740
Aside from the substance use variable, which is just another way of thinking like an inner or a factor, right?

406
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:44,660
So any of these would be interpreted relative to our referent category, which is no use.

407
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,290
So I drink one or two times a week relative to overeating.

408
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:51,770
Depression goes up, depression goes up and one down.

409
00:44:52,820 --> 00:45:02,630
So all of these enter all of these terms because this was an important variable that we read in and that already has a factor.

410
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:10,160
It's a random thinking of like 1364137. It's just these are six categories relative to their referent category.

411
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:17,300
And again, normally I would include in here. Here we have another factor variable and it's just three levels.

412
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:25,350
Is there a race variable? No differences in depression based on race. Questions about this?

413
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:37,410
Uh, yeah. So you said you included in those terms, you get a significant you know, it's just from down here.

414
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:43,499
Yes. Who would we ever run into situations where we wouldn't want to do that for a date?

415
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,980
Or is it something that you just like? You know, and it's it's not my thing.

416
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:55,319
Like, ideally, if if I if it took me, I would like like I would like to see an interaction with just the variable as it was.

417
00:45:55,320 --> 00:46:00,360
I wanted to include substance use as a as you can control variable if your mind is changing

418
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:06,570
a bunch based on the way that you operationalize or put in a couple of different variables,

419
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,500
that's not good. You want some stability across your coefficients.

420
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:18,090
You would expect that the effect of sex on depression to be fairly consistent no matter what else you put into your model.

421
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:24,000
If it's flying around, if it's getting really big and really small to a significant non-significant,

422
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:29,790
that's kind of a flag that there's something else going on and you're probably not capturing the data well.

423
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:39,660
So in this case, I would be a little dubious about this term that it took, including this variable as a factor,

424
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:45,240
when in reality I probably wanted to include it as a continuous variable in order for the interaction term to work.

425
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:50,099
Yeah. I have a question about the multiple R squared.

426
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:56,339
So, so when you convert into a percent that that is a like the model accounts for

427
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:05,820
13% of the variability so that low and what do you think seems kind of low.

428
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:14,820
Well so this and this is a straight set so we get to compare it to other models and I explain 20% or 30% the outcomes depression.

429
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:24,300
So if I can explain about a sixth or seventh of someone's depression levels, I mean, that's not too bad, but that's my field.

430
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:29,490
If you're in different fields, an effect size 2.13 might not be that great.

431
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:38,220
It's kind of like it is very much a clinical, practical, statistical significance type of question, rather, but it's a fair way of saying.

432
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:46,190
And what I'd be looking for is if I mean, which of these variables I mean, this is where I know who can kind of tell us a little something right away.

433
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:49,920
Which of these variables is really contrary, is contributing to some of the explanatory power.

434
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,510
If we can drop two or three of these or in particular my social support variable, that was what the question was.

435
00:47:54,510 --> 00:48:01,590
Although if I drop this down, this goes down 2.1 to maybe my social support variable doesn't mean that much.

436
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:09,390
But if I drop this term out and it goes 2.6 or .06 and then I think I'm in business and I do have something that means something for depression.

437
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,489
Anything else about this table. Okay. What is this?

438
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:23,760
Dinner. Not very well.

439
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:39,469
Probably not. Why not? I think if you like presenting variables and not quite how do you interpret this intercept?

440
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:43,190
This is the this is what predictive value of Y when yeah.

441
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:56,540
When I'm calling everything else I'm saying here that with the intercept just all come to like whatever the correct impression is that we find.

442
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:04,679
Yes, absolutely. That's exactly what her intercept is. And to your point, the meaningfulness of that, probably not.

443
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,080
So because age, we're never going to have a real zero.

444
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:13,469
The dummy variables, yes, we'll have meaningful zeros, but social import will not have a meaningful zero unless, for example,

445
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:18,690
we center some of these things and very similar in concept of centering at this point because to do it here,

446
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:24,870
I'm behind the scenes, we know what it means. The center. Yeah, very similar to standardizing.

447
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:29,100
Yes. So standardizing actually centers variables at the same time.

448
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:33,120
Basically, we're we are they're just we're just going to be subtracting the mean from every

449
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,680
year we're doing a linear transformation where we're subtracting the same number.

450
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:44,910
In this case, the mean every variable. What that will do is and we end up with a zero value that is rate at the mean.

451
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:49,169
And there are other ways that we can consider center and we can center across the entire variable.

452
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:54,450
We can think of groups. So but for the context of most interaction terms,

453
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:59,430
what we're doing is we're creating a meaningful zero value to this point from earlier today

454
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:08,729
and standardizing would do the same thing you're going to subtract from every variable,

455
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:18,520
but then you're just dividing by nation and it would mean a zero and standard or standard or of a variance of that percentage.

456
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,030
So if you just center and you don't create so standardized variables,

457
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:28,500
you're going to keep the same level of variability in whatever your measurements.

458
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:34,380
And that's the difference in this example.

459
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:43,050
If you assume that you are if you're going to be covered, I do use I do standardize instead of just centering the scale.

460
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:50,680
It's just a personal choice. It should not. This is another example of a scaling decision like centering versus not centering versus

461
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:56,070
or centering versus using standardize or these scores should not change these too much.

462
00:50:56,610 --> 00:51:04,800
If they do, that's a red flag for me. Somehow when I don't standardize and I just leave the terms in their original units, I get a significant value.

463
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:08,219
Or if I may not, that shouldn't happen.

464
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:14,390
But if I just center and it's in the original units versus standardizing, I get a significant value.

465
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:20,820
All those should be a little bit of a red flag because these are just small changes to the data to enter interpretability.

466
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:24,299
They should not be affecting relationships, right?

467
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:28,920
The significance of relationship shouldn't happen because of some of those small decisions.

468
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:36,460
Because that should be the variables after your meta.

469
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:45,260
Oh, yeah. That's when I would say the reason why is because here we're still in our kind of original units.

470
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,059
And I can think about one unit change.

471
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:55,340
I mean, it doesn't actually matter because you're just subtracting the same value from every single social support score.

472
00:51:55,790 --> 00:52:00,410
You're going to get the same, um, you're going to get the same estimate.

473
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:06,960
And the correlation won't change based on just subtracting me.

474
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:14,760
Yeah. And you said you're doing this behind the scenes to center variables.

475
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,900
Do you. Did you think you had a center?

476
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:25,290
Uh, that's a good question. So it's going to make it easy for us.

477
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:29,460
There's a function called scale, and it's going to give us two options.

478
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:36,210
Or it's going to be, I think, two arguments. The first one is just going to follow and it is just going to say what variable to center.

479
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:41,700
And then the second of the second arguments is going to be that I want to standardize it or not.

480
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:58,010
So I can pull it up. So it's a handy little thing to know about because sometimes you might want to center it for whatever reason.

481
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:06,730
Sometimes you want to use these scores. The nice thing about centering without using the Z scores is you're still in the original units.

482
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:21,160
And I've said before, I like having the original units because the interpretability for me is just that much easier, uh, right around here.

483
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:33,690
Sorry. This is one of those happy functions that to me makes a lot of sense.

484
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:43,290
You know. Very well.

485
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:48,120
I'm adding a Z because I wanted to just indicating that center. You don't have to do that.

486
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:51,960
You can say, Well, we're just not free to just take over the function of scale.

487
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:55,470
You mean the actual variable that you going to change?

488
00:53:56,790 --> 00:54:03,300
Center equals true scale is where we can decide whether or not we want it to be a Z score or not.

489
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:07,560
If we had that false, it would just center this. It would just subtract the mean from every single value.

490
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,170
So if it's true, then it's this in here.

491
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:24,270
The difference between this. Yeah. So the difference between this one.

492
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:36,960
So I'm 130 is creating these scores for every single one of my age values.

493
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:46,470
It's going to subtract the mean by my senior deviation. The one below it is just going to center my age value.

494
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,969
It's going to subtract the mean. And is it so?

495
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:55,630
The mean age in our sample is like 15 something. No, I have 14 somethings.

496
00:54:56,010 --> 00:55:04,500
It would just take everybody's age, subtract 14 something, and what you ultimately get is the exact same distribution, same exact order.

497
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:09,570
Everybody who is younger stays younger. Everybody who is older stays older.

498
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:19,200
The difference is, instead of having a mean of 14.9, you now have a mean of zero because we subtracted 14.9 from every single value.

499
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:23,009
Do it. Do some arithmetic on your on your little pad.

500
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:31,770
If you need to like take a value of six and subtract eight from ultimately have one, two, three, four, five, six, one, two, three, four, five.

501
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:39,060
Take a value of one, two, three, four, five. You mean is three? Subtract three from every single day.

502
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:43,760
That's. That's an example of center. Yeah.

503
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:49,930
Why? To do these words that are something completely arbitrary.

504
00:55:51,070 --> 00:56:00,750
Completely arbitrary. And so the only way or indeed the only thing you really need to do according to change in this century versus these scale are.

505
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:10,370
Yeah. So like one in 14 or just centered age instead of instead of standardizing general terms,

506
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:14,820
it would therefore be a situation where you would make a Z score,

507
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:21,350
where you would want to make a B score or just some do, or are they kind of interesting?

508
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:29,910
So we saw when we saw last week that ultimately I like to find myself in that one data command space,

509
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:35,400
right where we're looking at standardized data coefficients across all model,

510
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:40,379
which remember too that we took the regular model with the original coefficients,

511
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:46,680
we ran it elevator command and standardized every single coefficient in the model so we can directly compare those coefficients.

512
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:53,730
This making and including everything as a Z score to begin with is the exact same process.

513
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,630
So really in my mind, we're just getting to the same type of thing.

514
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:05,080
So the. I dropped out.

515
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:10,900
If you took standardized predictive values and standardized outcome variable, that's our standardized equation.

516
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:16,450
Those are those are the one beta values that we compared after the fact and we forward.

517
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:23,390
Right. That's essentially what Line 113 is starting to do already for me.

518
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:27,310
So I could have included just the centered values.

519
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,410
It really should not make a difference. If it does, that's a problem.

520
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:38,780
And the reason why is because this is a scaling decision. It's not actually it shouldn't be impacting relationships across variables.

521
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:45,290
That's a flag for all of us. When you make these little things that shouldn't change, it doesn't change again.

522
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:52,420
The order either centering or standardizing does not change the order of all your different values in the dataset,

523
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:59,360
like a relative position of everything that stays the same when we make decisions like this.

524
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:05,270
So you can still like very different variables on the same scale.

525
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,820
You just don't know.

526
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:15,080
But yeah, the advantage I guess in centering is when you're still talking about units, now you're talking about your change in edge.

527
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:20,629
That might be better for you interpretability wise, and probably that's fine.

528
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:25,340
I will make the change. I will go back, I will make some decisions.

529
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,020
I mean, it really shouldn't matter, but it's,

530
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:36,709
it's whatever is going to work for your mind to kind of think through what I'm interpreting here, what I think for interactions.

531
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:42,470
I mean, part of the other reason why it's me, it doesn't matter quite so much is because what we're really looking for at

532
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:46,970
this point is this and I know I didn't want folks just focusing on a p value,

533
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:52,940
but all I really care about because it's not so easy to interpret an interaction term directly is whether or not

534
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:57,920
we have something significant so that I can start to break down and really look closely at the simple source,

535
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:07,430
which is that stuff that we do after this is done. And I'm sorry if it doesn't sit super well.

536
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:17,450
But it is part of our world in the sense that that just isn't right, but it is part of our world,

537
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:20,990
and that there's lots of this stuff that kind of happens behind the scenes that's just going to be up to you.

538
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,420
Right. The goal would be to kind of document it, include your score file or whatever.

539
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:33,860
And again, be cognizant of when you are making changes or decisions that don't that shouldn't matter versus ones that really couldn't.

540
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:50,740
So the only difference here now is this. I want to just be mindful of two things coding an interaction and ah, it's actually quite easy.

541
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:54,730
As you can see, this colon just means multiply these two together.

542
00:59:56,050 --> 01:00:00,760
The only reason why I have these scores here or sentence scores is for interpretability.

543
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:04,860
I could have just as easily multiply these two together in their original use.

544
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,340
Okay, there's nothing wrong with that. It's just. It needs interpretability.

545
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:16,210
If you want a little shortcut, you might see from time to time an asterisk instead of a colon.

546
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:22,270
An asterisk is this age and so sort.

547
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:38,340
This is equivalent to including marriage, including our social support and including.

548
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:53,580
The two year. So if I ever if I ever forget, if you do this, it will automatically populate your model with the conditional main effect,

549
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:03,990
the conditional main effect and the interaction term. That's just including the asterisk instead of the know all the three terms by themselves.

550
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:08,250
And it can be a helpful reminder because then it is automatically going to include these two.

551
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:18,600
Right. So all I've done here from the left, the last model, I did make that centering decision and now I've included the interaction term.

552
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:26,940
If I made this assignment, asked if I made the scenario decision before before I ran this model, the only thing that should change.

553
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:32,820
And you can check this out. This should be the exact same. The relative position of everybody in the sample is the exact same.

554
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:38,430
We're not doing anything to the relationship between variables. What's going to change is our scaling metric is their intercept.

555
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:46,320
That's what changes Y, because the intercept is the predicted value when every single other value is zero.

556
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:50,340
Now we've changed what a zero means for this particular term.

557
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:56,880
That makes sense. All right. So here's our interaction term.

558
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:08,250
Significant life is good. We now can say that sex or age and social support interacts in some way to affect depression based on what you see.

559
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:20,920
What's our relationship like? Yeah.

560
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:25,320
Well. Tell me about the interaction. How are these things or what's the interplay with like?

561
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:32,440
How does age moderate the association between social support and depression?

562
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:38,910
Yeah. I'm sorry.

563
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:48,340
It's doable and I would be super, super impressed.

564
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:54,879
But I don't do this. This is really difficult to just look at an interaction term and a bunch of conditional main effects and say,

565
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,330
this is what's happening, which is why we like to break things down.

566
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:02,590
What we've seen here is we have this significant interaction term. Life is good.

567
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:07,720
We can look to see that r v r squared exchange rate went from 12 to 13.

568
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:15,310
So our actually term is or was inverted 13, maybe one of 3.0042 is how to see it.

569
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:18,100
I mean, we can look to see if the ANOVA says it's a significant change or not.

570
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:25,180
But basically, you know, it explains a little bit of additional variability. So now we're going to do is called probing interaction.

571
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:32,950
We're going to try to look to see kind of at what levels are moderating variable h are

572
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:37,180
do we see these changes in the relationship or association between social support,

573
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:41,290
interact and the right to do that?

574
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:47,880
Uh, I guess we are gonna be watching this difference.

575
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:57,790
So this is the actual interpretation of conditional main effect here because we

576
01:03:57,790 --> 01:04:03,550
center there are now going to be times when this interaction term will be zero.

577
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:12,700
This interaction term would be zero when you when someone ages is at the mean or when someone's level of social support, is that the mean?

578
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:21,250
We can only interpret what I call conditional effects when this interaction term is zero.

579
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:32,650
When you have a higher order term in the model, the only way to continue to report this or to to interpret these conditional main effects,

580
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:36,430
age and social support is when this interaction term is here.

581
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:40,000
The rest of the variables in the model don't change.

582
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:45,190
This is still the association between sex and the outcome variable, holding everything else in the model constant.

583
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:49,270
This is still the association between race and the outcome variable.

584
01:04:49,360 --> 01:05:01,239
For everything else new there in the model constants. So this is now the association between social support and depression when this

585
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:06,760
interaction term is zero or for people who are at the mean age in the sample.

586
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:15,660
Does it work the same way with age? Yep. Okay. They are completely.

587
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:19,950
There's no, like, true order there.

588
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:29,129
So this is now the effect of age on depression and this interaction term is zero or when social support.

589
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:34,170
So. So people mean social support. This is the effect of age on.

590
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:43,980
So the biggest thing here is that we can no longer talk about age or social support by themselves.

591
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:50,340
It's now always thinking about when we're at a given level of that third variable.

592
01:05:51,000 --> 01:06:00,120
We're only talking about social support at different ages of people in the sample when they're older, middle age, or indeed younger.

593
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:03,960
However, we want to think about it, but we can't think now to be models this way.

594
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:07,590
We can't think about social support, holding everything else constant.

595
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:15,270
That's a big shift for us. We can only think about social support in context when we know someone's age.

596
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:20,369
And that's kind of cool because what's going to happen is we're going to see

597
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:25,170
how that association with the relationship between social support changes,

598
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:29,420
given how old somebody is. Interesting question.

599
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:36,209
But do folks kind of also see the reason why it's not helpful?

600
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:47,250
This was Amy's point of beginning, why it's helpful to center. It's just to make these two terms by themselves in a model like this or otherwise.

601
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:51,600
If this could never be a zero, we wouldn't really be able to talk about those terms.

602
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:59,790
And maybe there's still I mean, there's limited utility to talk about the conditional effect here, but at least we can say something that,

603
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:04,859
you know, for the average person in the sample, this is the relationship or the average age person in the sample.

604
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:13,160
This is the association between social support and now. Oh, which.

605
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:19,840
This is just taking some of those turns like we did in that very first slide.

606
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:25,830
Remember the one that I want to see that I hope Netflix remember and this is just an example of doing so.

607
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:33,360
We can take the information from the conditional main effect and the outcome here and the interaction term.

608
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:45,450
And this is going to tell us how the association between social support and depression changes depending on your age.

609
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:53,530
So right here. Our new affect of social support.

610
01:07:53,890 --> 01:07:59,020
This would be the brackets. We've taken the conditional main effect.

611
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:04,030
We've taken the interaction term, both of which have a social support in.

612
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:09,399
Okay, here they are. And I know this is a simplification.

613
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:15,250
We don't have anything else. We are factoring out the social support rate.

614
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:18,790
Remember, we take this out and we take this out to the common factors.

615
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:21,850
We put them on the outside. If I took this and I multiply them back in.

616
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:27,219
We get right back up there. I'm not doing any sort of magic here right now.

617
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:38,680
This. This is how the effect, like numerically, empirically, this is how the effect of social support on depression, changes based on how old you are.

618
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:45,110
So tell me, without looking at the next slide, how is the effect of social support going to change by age?

619
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:50,980
What's happening is someone who gets older or younger who can give me just a take a shot, it decreases.

620
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:55,000
So they are put they have like a cut of turn. It is decreasing.

621
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,710
So as you get older, what you have less compression.

622
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:05,740
Less effective social support on your depression. That's what's happening here.

623
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:13,600
For older students, the effect of social support on depression gets smaller and smaller.

624
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:18,940
Right. Because, you know, a friend is this age goes up.

625
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:25,239
This is going to subtract a little bit away or very little, I guess smaller or small in this case is actually larger.

626
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:30,160
The effect is actually going to get bigger, but more negative because there is the way in which we talking about this, right?

627
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:35,680
This effect is going to get more and more negative as people get older.

628
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:45,650
So it's actually the effect is increasing. But the the the the the actual term is getting smaller and smaller.

629
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:48,400
Right. So you can play any values in here.

630
01:09:52,450 --> 01:10:00,520
And as the value you multiply those the age value by whatever these are and then combine with this information and

631
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:07,120
we're going to see how this coefficient changes that we then multiply by somebody given the whole social score.

632
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:12,220
So I think I do this next slide here. Yeah.

633
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:19,020
That's for. But the most important thing to think about now is when you have this interaction term.

634
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:24,570
The effect of social support now depends on how old somebody is.

635
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:33,950
We can do the same thing for a dichotomous variable or any other factor variable.

636
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:38,930
In this case we use females so we have social support multiplied by female.

637
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:46,100
Before we saw that females were just the mean and the mean levels were higher for females than for males.

638
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:53,900
When we multiply the two together, we now have another significant role model marginally similar to the interaction term.

639
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:59,180
We combine to combine the same information. Now our moderating variable is no longer age at sex.

640
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:04,730
We take the conditional and if it were to go right here,

641
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:12,190
we take the interaction term with a little bit different about a dichotomous variable or a factor variable here.

642
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:23,240
We have zero and one zero is our dummy variable ones are out there or too variable or whatever we want to call for females who are one,

643
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:27,080
we kind of we get to multiply them by one. This term stays in.

644
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:35,660
We combine this information. This is the effect for females because this term would be zero for males.

645
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:39,620
This drops out. This is actually the effect for males.

646
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:47,810
Right. Because if you if you're a female in the sample, we give them a zero value for here multiplies out to zero.

647
01:11:48,140 --> 01:12:01,370
That's our effect for males. For females, the effect of social support on depression is almost twice the size, twice the size.

648
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:07,110
And that for males. That's interesting stuff.

649
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:21,030
That's really interesting. In both cases, though, the association between social support and depression varies as a function of some third variable,

650
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:24,810
whether it's age or the participant sex.

651
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:33,050
Kind of cool. But we could do this with any of these interaction terms, right?

652
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:37,120
We can take the combined information, but one more time. And also like a broken record.

653
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:40,760
What you can't do is interpret now social support by itself.

654
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:45,970
It's always going to be in the context of the third year, the levels of that third variable.

655
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:51,900
It's not just the first quarter.

656
01:12:52,300 --> 01:13:04,300
The interaction value is set at 0.0, and that is concerning to us because it's kind of going, Yeah, throw it.

657
01:13:04,690 --> 01:13:10,809
Yeah. But first they get it, right?

658
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:16,330
So you can make a decision about whether or not you'd want it from this interaction because it is, you know,

659
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:24,040
technically is not significant based on a point of like cut off if you really felt it that females or whatever sex is going to be important.

660
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:33,160
MODERATOR Here you know it kind of to you but you're is probably wouldn't have questions about these two like if you can get these two ideas down.

661
01:13:34,930 --> 01:13:40,110
And again they go back to that the slide that we spent some time on earlier that's that's

662
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:45,370
got a heart of interactions and all it saying is that you have this third variable,

663
01:13:46,210 --> 01:13:53,980
this third variable here that's kind of combined so that you can think about social support by itself that kind of like this one bit.

664
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:59,950
And you can see how this term changes based on how old you say you are or in this case,

665
01:13:59,950 --> 01:14:05,320
you see how this term changes based on whether you say you're a male or female.

666
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:15,560
All that's kind of hidden in there. I think it's hard to see just looking at the output like this, but you could do this if you wanted.

667
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:22,040
I think in the video I kind of show you how to break it down with some.

668
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:29,270
Or maybe it's like I said in the our script, how you can know,

669
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:36,410
you can model some of these things or you can plot some of these things because I think it's a little bit easier to show how,

670
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:41,360
you know, different levels of one of our predictor variable or of our moderating variable.

671
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:46,950
That relationship has changed. But you can do it numerically and.

672
01:14:53,810 --> 01:14:57,200
This is what we're going to do on Thursday.

673
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:04,120
So, again, not trying to do the missing data stuff right now. Maybe we can split that.

674
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:11,030
Maybe we can start with this for about 45, 50 minutes on Thursday, for only about 15 or 20 minutes to show, you know, the missing data piece.

675
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:15,210
It's really just one command an hour, which is nice. It's just an hour.

676
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:22,180
But the goal would be to take an analysis like this and see if you can replicate that.

677
01:15:28,770 --> 01:15:35,130
This is to show you what happens when you have a factor with more than two levels.

678
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:47,550
Um. We don't have a lot of information.

679
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:51,850
All right. We can talk about this on. We've talked about this under.

680
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:55,830
If you want. It's from that prestige data.

681
01:15:56,250 --> 01:16:00,360
So it works perfectly. I mean, it's like a beautiful interaction that you can see in a broad.

682
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:06,150
But we can talk about how we can break it down using the same kind of the same kind of interpretations.

683
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:10,830
But I'm going to go one more time. Why? You're just leaving the door before you walk out of here.

684
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:17,280
All right. Now you can pack up and go about your merry way. But if you have a question about this, please let me know.

685
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:20,610
But this is interaction. You've got this. You've got interactions.

686
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:26,490
Yes. Are you going to repeat that later this week or.

687
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:33,900
Yes. Thursday. Unless you want.

688
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:46,070
It's just this and know you go back or you go forward and describe that.

689
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:55,670
So the like the place so that the lab where all the other team members what comes into that.

690
01:16:56,060 --> 01:17:06,110
Yeah that's that's your actual value of social support. So that's that final number that you did when you said that for females, males,

691
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:13,010
that number, that negative one, six, eight and then also that that that final value.

692
01:17:14,210 --> 01:17:17,990
So this one, this would be multiplied by someone's social support.

693
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:22,549
So for females, this is the effect of social support. So it's still there.

694
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:25,790
There should be like a Times poster. Okay. So that's still.

695
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:26,790
Yeah, yeah.
