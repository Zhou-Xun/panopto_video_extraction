00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,250
Welcome to Epit six 34 is module on the S3, our model Part two and DEMICK conditions.

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:17,520
This module is part two of the learning of learning about S.A our models and focusing on endemic conditions.

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,030
To understand the endemic dynamics, we need to calculate and draw noke lines.

4
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:34,170
As with the SARS model setting the SDD equation to zero results in the SNL climb, that is governed by the following function.

5
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:44,160
His function is monotonically decreasing as I increases. Analogously, the I know Kaline DADT equals zero results in two solutions.

6
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:55,380
One where I equals zero. That's a vertical line on the Y axis and the other where X is equal to Delta plus mbewe over Beda a horizontal line.

7
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:02,460
So here we have one SNL Klein and two. I know Clines.

8
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:09,750
Our next step is to plot these knock lines to see where the S and I know Clines intersect.

9
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,640
That is where DST equals DADT equals zero.

10
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:22,100
Here is the S No. Klein. This function starts at I equals one.

11
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:30,810
S equals one. When I is equal to zero and decreases as s eyes, I increases.

12
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:39,120
And here are the two I know Clines one again on the Y axis and the other a horizontal line.

13
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,040
S equals Delta plus mbewe over bita. Yes.

14
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,400
And I know claims to intersect that two points analogous to the ISIS model.

15
00:01:50,400 --> 00:02:02,020
This is our. So this in total is our phase portrait for the FSA, our model, which again tells us a lot about the properties of this model.

16
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,610
So in summary, we see that endemic properties of the S.

17
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:14,510
S. S. Our model is completely analogous to the S.A.S. model.

18
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:21,770
So here we have two equilibrium points. First, that as equal one and I equals zero.

19
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:31,780
This represents elimination or no infection. The second represents the endemic state.

20
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:45,190
Again, as equals one equals zero. His unstable and the S equals Delta, plus me over Beda and I infinity point is stable.

21
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,840
So under the conditions that Delta plus me over Beda is less than one.

22
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:59,800
We predict that the infectious disease will be endemic. We can also predict the level or prevalence of the infected individuals here.

23
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:08,000
It's shown as mbewe over EBITA times, beta over Delta plus mbewe minus one.

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,700
What is Delta plus me over Beda is greater than one. Now we have only one equilibrium point.

25
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:20,360
S equals one equals zero. This represents elimination.

26
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:27,830
We interpret this endemic threshold condition like we did for the SARS model, a pathogen is eliminated.

27
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:37,640
If the rate of leaving the infectious state Delta plus new is greater than the rate of entering the infectious state data.

28
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:47,570
So in summary, the system exhibits either one equilibrium point or two equilibrium points,

29
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:54,170
depending on whether Delta plus mbewe over EBITA is greater than or less than one.

30
00:03:54,170 --> 00:04:00,370
This is once again analogous to the endemic properties of the S.A.S. model.

31
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:09,950
And by taking the inverse of this ratio, we can reformulate the criteria using the are not our reproductive numbers statistic where are not

32
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:19,150
greater than one is the criteria needed to sustain transmission and have an endemic condition.

33
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:25,840
When analyzing the endemic properties of the SARS model, we are interested in long term dynamics.

34
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,400
We must include the birth and death population processes.

35
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:42,260
So to summarize, CSIR model properties, epidemic properties are driven by both the parameter values as well as the initial condition of susceptible,

36
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:49,830
as there is a threshold number of susceptible is needed to sustain epidemics.

37
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:57,810
The endemic properties, on the other hand, are driven only by parameter values and are independent of initial conditions.

38
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:04,491
And the criteria for intensity is driven by to are not statistic.
