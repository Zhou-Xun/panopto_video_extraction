1
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,820
yeah

2
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,940
yeah you have a lot of insight particularly with Kerry vascular factors right now it is a purple

3
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:52,760
area area okay. night. I thought I'm sorry about that

4
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,060
when the phone. yeah those are so I'm

5
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:09,057
sure that was

6
00:01:09,057 --> 00:01:14,357
I was reading in the country but

7
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:21,317
yeah. er marine dimensionally as a whole different

8
00:01:21,317 --> 00:01:27,777
files which I was I was gonna ask you because I don't remember from the lecture

9
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:33,517
the pressure differences in the best health care flow back and forth.

10
00:01:33,517 --> 00:01:38,717
yeah and it helps if you're line. I think laughing helps keep them

11
00:01:38,717 --> 00:01:46,577
inflated because I've read studies on the bed you know

12
00:01:46,577 --> 00:01:51,657
because of the pressures. so when

13
00:01:51,657 --> 00:01:58,357
you're done anything. so she was always there for reading about the folder.

14
00:01:58,357 --> 00:02:03,500
yeah that's obvious set right high pressure blood pressure and then

15
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,600
atmosphere and with the pressure but they're

16
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,660
not. things are would have any consequences yeah the person they are

17
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:19,040
not related to the movies or do they just have more long over long capacity

18
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,320
either I thought like Michael Phelps has enormous capacity. greatest

19
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:31,360
one was holding a woman

20
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,820
that's amazing. yeah. so I

21
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:58,763
him from when you're yeah

22
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:04,163
batteries yeah oh that in the front.

23
00:03:04,163 --> 00:03:09,203
yeah I think everything on the person that

24
00:03:09,203 --> 00:03:16,843
I guess he was

25
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:22,083
waiting for it because

26
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:27,243
I mean it's like yeah many how of open

27
00:03:27,243 --> 00:03:34,223
their high school and this a is possibility.

28
00:03:34,223 --> 00:03:39,423
oh yeah yeah I mean yeah I think

29
00:03:39,423 --> 00:03:46,223
there's like a kind of the time yeah hi yeah better than do it. yeah. oh okay

30
00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:53,583
yeah great grand thing.

31
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:59,095
are you familiar with all the time

32
00:03:59,095 --> 00:04:04,635
to a home and I never heard are you.

33
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:09,735
I thought we mountains funds wanted to do it while you were gone. oh yeah

34
00:04:09,735 --> 00:04:15,715
that okay hey I did receive a confirmation well. okay. okay. okay.

35
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:24,395
okay. direct line you said the past. I mean the amount of your life. good a

36
00:04:24,395 --> 00:04:30,715
thing for the collision.

37
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:36,135
everything

38
00:04:36,135 --> 00:04:41,795
was.

39
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:59,553
okay. s. professional

40
00:04:59,553 --> 00:05:05,433
hi I'm automatic revolver and I hope you had a raffle. and I'm feeling retired

41
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:10,853
and excited about well. um we're gonna talk about the central nervous system today.

42
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:17,313
but the first looking we talked about last time you remember going all

43
00:05:17,313 --> 00:05:27,553
three primary purpose.

44
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:32,813
we're closer that the first.

45
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:38,733
yeah I I oh are

46
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:43,933
also operating he not love the

47
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:49,633
other way. but

48
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:54,893
one. um here

49
00:05:54,893 --> 00:06:01,445
it is one

50
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:06,685
right

51
00:06:06,685 --> 00:06:11,965
you're certainly long on

52
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:17,625
that.

53
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:22,705
yeah it was a limited to the jury I'm sorry out the sentencing was

54
00:06:22,705 --> 00:06:27,905
going on and in talking to you Lewis um they're releasing

55
00:06:27,905 --> 00:06:34,541
a Federal savings form on hold for six more months. was on the other end

56
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:39,581
okay so they're um regulators on your breathing and the releasing hormones

57
00:06:39,581 --> 00:06:45,181
that are talking to other other words a little other end of the family is that you're

58
00:06:45,181 --> 00:06:51,641
easy

59
00:06:51,641 --> 00:07:04,081
new the Corvette are you learn how old are you need another

60
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:09,441
yard my room. I remember when I was thinking about

61
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:15,401
a hard fire fire I don't really I had deficiencies

62
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:20,501
you know I remember borders all the little portable strong

63
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:30,601
response was another article in yeah.

64
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:35,834
going our router so there were any reproductive forms

65
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:41,754
in life including not anymore mom almost a million wanna our body.

66
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:46,834
um there are there is also one other word I don't know sure

67
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:51,834
we have done right fourteen. well here comes on and

68
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:56,974
on it has to move all the time. I heard people

69
00:07:56,974 --> 00:08:03,074
talk about the lecture I don't know what you're gonna have the standard

70
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:09,794
and the other part of the patriot. this is what he more

71
00:08:09,794 --> 00:08:15,174
useful it is important for what little regulation

72
00:08:15,174 --> 00:08:20,714
specifically is Lori Mountain. okay. my husband 's liner.

73
00:08:20,714 --> 00:08:27,474
siblings operate properly. feel

74
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:33,486
including a prior prior condition

75
00:08:33,486 --> 00:08:42,626
we talk about how we can measure the difference in the morning the measurements and

76
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:49,746
you know the urinary track through the matter of hormones and some form of the towel a

77
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:54,886
lotta love for their entire life and our hormones are being

78
00:08:54,886 --> 00:08:59,986
transported of recently um I would talk about how I

79
00:08:59,986 --> 00:09:05,306
new simulation topic you know instructors the present to figure out

80
00:09:05,306 --> 00:09:10,666
is the standard rule and um hyper conversational motion and you won't result

81
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:15,846
I am trying to figure out who monitors in the city

82
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:26,606
I live um three

83
00:09:26,606 --> 00:09:41,948
movies. I oh

84
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:53,908
yeah yeah um

85
00:09:53,908 --> 00:09:59,468
yeah I actually there's a little little bit on my leg and it influence to do

86
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:04,868
but ours are available uh that I would I do it. it's not hard

87
00:10:04,868 --> 00:10:10,388
when I don't move a lot further claim. so currently

88
00:10:10,388 --> 00:10:15,408
understood last name or my husband will have a sixteen mobile choice. she's

89
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:38,150
also a Chinese friends and know me evenly distributed

90
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:44,010
yeah I was waiting on over uh I and um I would

91
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:49,270
really I don't think only have till it's gone through the you

92
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:54,810
know our humor gonna find a little who concerns about this activity but

93
00:10:54,810 --> 00:11:00,310
then I did the long run to the bottom line

94
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:06,150
um you know first proper survey for

95
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:11,210
them they do have the little town a know

96
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:16,290
times less like you know that specific time watching

97
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:23,030
measures there. um and uh and a lot of the time.

98
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:52,418
so you can think about budgeting.

99
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:57,478
I here some of the research questions a lot of high like I think um with other suitably

100
00:11:57,478 --> 00:12:02,538
with well written uh they were they were not up on the time we are pulling questions but but you

101
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:07,958
guys had really interested in long lines are interested in different regions of the country are different

102
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:13,358
interested in different um and disrupting hormones are interested in different stressful situations

103
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:18,518
and what are the responses that people are experiencing arts or

104
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:23,958
learning objects yesterday were gonna be talking about the central nervous system and

105
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:29,198
my goals are to have you be able to tell the difference between the fence alert system and the peripheral nervous

106
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:34,518
system what are they for. um I wanna be able to talk about. I was all our members wanna talk about

107
00:12:34,518 --> 00:12:39,824
the structure function um we want to know how the wrong

108
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:45,004
signal each other uh how do how do on who keys

109
00:12:45,004 --> 00:12:50,024
in the place and then I would all my heart. um we're gonna talk about how

110
00:12:50,024 --> 00:12:55,284
to measure all this. um this is one area with that's particularly

111
00:12:55,284 --> 00:13:00,284
challenging measurement what we'll see about how we tried to approximate it. um I never will

112
00:13:00,284 --> 00:13:05,464
talk about some uh disorders of the system including a developmental disorder or psychiatric

113
00:13:05,464 --> 00:13:13,666
disorder and your orders. okay

114
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:19,586
time right type about the nervous

115
00:13:19,586 --> 00:13:24,646
curve in the function of the nervous system is to work in coordination with the underground system these issues

116
00:13:24,646 --> 00:13:29,906
some um. and we want to be able to injury or cell

117
00:13:29,906 --> 00:13:34,946
tissue functions. we want ourselves to to use communicate well of each other. um so our

118
00:13:34,946 --> 00:13:40,226
working operating. we saw that and system

119
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:45,426
has a formal um which can last for hours

120
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:50,466
longer. okay. nervousness.

121
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:58,326
we have closer.

122
00:13:58,326 --> 00:14:03,426
um but my animation flipped about the central nervous system is the suburban one on the last

123
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:08,819
um where that includes your brain and your smile huh

124
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:13,979
um I know it's protected by us um balls or not I already have

125
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:20,399
balls or not I either so I

126
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,639
don't know if they have the protection system and then our first real nervous system are these ones

127
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:30,779
in teal. we noticed that they run all the way throughout the body um with the exception

128
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:36,379
of largely up in your brain. so they're in different areas and they're

129
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:41,859
running all the way throughout

130
00:14:41,859 --> 00:14:46,939
our nervous system altogether how the house of sixty thousand miles an hour I don't

131
00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:52,039
know um I routinely Hannibal Lee has known people in

132
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:57,279
my office and nothing is only about this long. so it's amazing I have fifty thousand

133
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,299
miles an hour. you know where you. if you were to put all of these

134
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:07,619
strips and to answer I go around direct way so inside her body

135
00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:13,039
we have a complex and Italian network signaling highway

136
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:18,419
going through all of our nervous system.

137
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:23,659
right. so we'll talk about the peripheral nervous system for some of the vocabulary. um

138
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:28,699
I well if you like it with things and business. so one of the bins of front the system the system

139
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:33,899
that we learn the work so hot before first one somebody. so this is something

140
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:39,119
that in dealing with issues around your body it was the sensory um

141
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:44,279
I never found in your motor. so that's how I feel you'll find us and

142
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:49,479
time something about as well how my muscles symbols

143
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:54,639
of those and as you might imagine those two functions

144
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:00,019
either something movement have their own book so after it is the sensory ones

145
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:05,019
and I rent is the motor one. I don't have a cute way to memorize it it's just I

146
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:10,883
think I friend I think of the fact and like. so I'm gonna have some kind of a with my muscles

147
00:16:10,883 --> 00:16:16,663
you guys might have may have a better better idea for how to keep those two straight

148
00:16:16,663 --> 00:16:21,723
on the other major and other peripheral nervous system is our auto autonomic user of the things I

149
00:16:21,723 --> 00:16:26,963
think are happening like we don't have to concern ourselves with

150
00:16:26,963 --> 00:16:32,183
how conscious thought about moving them you know things that are happening

151
00:16:32,183 --> 00:16:37,203
in the background things like regulating are hardly in our snooze muscle

152
00:16:37,203 --> 00:16:47,143
where they're smooth muscle mostly.

153
00:16:47,143 --> 00:16:54,023
we have a little bit in particular I was thinking about wanting. yeah.

154
00:16:54,023 --> 00:17:00,143
so sometimes when Iraq energy our muscles. we wanna take away from.

155
00:17:00,143 --> 00:17:07,027
um I am a believe and I guess and then other

156
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:12,387
these yeah. our plans are also regulated by I. don't know it never system and then there

157
00:17:12,387 --> 00:17:18,007
were in also humans which will talk about more details. the sympathetic version and the pair sympathetic.

158
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:23,567
just giving her vocabulary straight. and I like the pictures that kinda puts it together so we've got nervous as stuff

159
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:28,707
or central nervous systems and purple. our personal nurses and the balls of genteel and here is

160
00:17:28,707 --> 00:17:38,987
the largest hierarchy autonomic versus matter. and then within each of those they have their own thing.

161
00:17:38,987 --> 00:17:43,987
you guys think that the sympathetic division of the I don't know I don't know I make nervous system is

162
00:17:43,987 --> 00:17:49,127
this one over here of the one I've also called fighter flight number from the previous

163
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:55,527
line. yeah. 's

164
00:17:55,527 --> 00:18:01,047
versus this one which is gonna call me down and it's gonna direct more energy your towards digestion

165
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:07,485
other other vehicle background assumptions

166
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:12,565
so here are focusing and looking at I don't know I'm nervous system to sympathetic. what

167
00:18:12,565 --> 00:18:18,005
it's gonna do it's gonna increase your heart rate. so these are which are sitting on your heart.

168
00:18:18,005 --> 00:18:23,065
you know they're signaling your blood pressure to go up because we wanna

169
00:18:23,065 --> 00:18:28,465
make sure all of that those factors are working out for you about who's in concert

170
00:18:28,465 --> 00:18:33,685
it's going to tell your people and like what do you think if people wanna die only when you're around

171
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:38,885
whole conversation. he more like a more alert you're

172
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:43,925
something more of your surroundings him um your brunch you'll gonna wear

173
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:49,005
our grandchildren on long blue ski more air

174
00:18:49,005 --> 00:18:54,005
comedy. so we're matching our respiratory rate are

175
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:59,285
pretty bad. and it's wanted to record blood always for the guy

176
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:04,405
it's going to drive walk away from the whole uh and so

177
00:19:04,405 --> 00:19:09,463
that would was reading all of our uh I don't interact pretty flexible to

178
00:19:09,463 --> 00:19:14,483
to our abilities to run out a way to to um respond to a

179
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:19,503
potential threat versus our parents um branch. this is also

180
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:24,783
important we need to be able to go to the movies go to the rest and sleep and hoses

181
00:19:24,783 --> 00:19:29,943
branch of the nervous assignment is going to decrease her heart rate and he preserve blood pressure. it's

182
00:19:29,943 --> 00:19:35,023
going to intelligent people so constricting yeah um I was gonna send blood to the GIs track so

183
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:40,603
that that we operate optimally. um I said I pay increase rendering gland secretions.

184
00:19:40,603 --> 00:19:46,003
so everything is a movie house

185
00:19:46,003 --> 00:20:00,565
working up Conner. yeah. so love the overall

186
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:06,005
all right so what are these neurons that are conducting all of this he's actually

187
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:11,045
um the functional primary functional units of the nervous system. our number on on

188
00:20:11,045 --> 00:20:16,185
and here we can see a picture of three here is the cell body. I'm

189
00:20:16,185 --> 00:20:21,605
in on in the cell body other neurons contains all of our major or you know.

190
00:20:21,605 --> 00:20:27,645
we had all of the I don't know C you along the wall the Iraq

191
00:20:27,645 --> 00:20:32,785
country. this is a very wonderful mom.

192
00:20:32,785 --> 00:20:37,965
um then right yeah all around the cell

193
00:20:37,965 --> 00:20:42,985
body her you know the seating going

194
00:20:42,985 --> 00:20:53,986
on or about fifteen to talk to each other. but never even

195
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:59,066
okay so it's different functions are happening in different places here in the cell body is where all the producers

196
00:20:59,066 --> 00:21:04,286
are going to be mean and then there's one big branch that comes off of it. our ask on to

197
00:21:04,286 --> 00:21:09,506
look and most around have only one ass on that comes out and this is this long

198
00:21:09,506 --> 00:21:16,506
transmitting segment. so that's where we got most of our trees in our

199
00:21:16,506 --> 00:21:23,226
where one along

200
00:21:23,226 --> 00:21:28,846
and boom boom messengers that are developed.

201
00:21:28,846 --> 00:21:34,686
the news in the cell body and pass them along. a that on

202
00:21:34,686 --> 00:21:39,686
and then the mobile branch points or synapses that come off of the axon on so

203
00:21:39,686 --> 00:21:44,746
that other cells are able to receive those. so this is the

204
00:21:44,746 --> 00:21:49,946
part down at the bottom axon that's responsible for passing the signal for the night so then

205
00:21:49,946 --> 00:21:55,226
the next self it's generated overseas think so the messages

206
00:21:55,226 --> 00:22:00,466
always go down there and then talking to each other and. nineteen

207
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:05,506
I'm you can see in this example was this stretching all the way out and to talking to muscle fiber

208
00:22:05,506 --> 00:22:13,326
and tell you what do you guys notice is coding accent.

209
00:22:13,326 --> 00:22:18,566
yeah the it is mileage see if it's produced by a course um and this

210
00:22:18,566 --> 00:22:23,586
will see why this is important but largely this is um a

211
00:22:23,586 --> 00:22:29,706
some live in or fact that is how old are celebrating the

212
00:22:29,706 --> 00:22:34,806
same way that will put a rapid wire.

213
00:22:34,806 --> 00:22:42,806
um who who line you

214
00:22:42,806 --> 00:22:48,046
so little bit about our peripheral neurons they have similar structures. so this

215
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:53,499
would be a motor neurons. it might have its cell body resting

216
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:58,599
on the top in your class mama and then might come a

217
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:04,739
long time. all the way over here

218
00:23:04,739 --> 00:23:10,658
um in particular I injuries a lot of my gosh it's hard to agree

219
00:23:10,658 --> 00:23:16,239
totally learn that happened from the sign on their shoulder or elbow

220
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:21,438
through the your accident control the movement of the need. so I can't

221
00:23:21,438 --> 00:23:26,719
feel anything on the back my hands because of the location of my uh

222
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:32,578
my nerve injured. so there's anything weird. they

223
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:38,458
are working in association and have a

224
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:43,739
fear out where where injury might be located relative to it and then here's

225
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:49,795
one of those sensory neurons which is similar to the one that I have injured. so we see they have a little bit different orientations

226
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:55,055
where there somebody might be located in a little bit further and they have these projections that's all

227
00:23:55,055 --> 00:24:02,255
the way up and to the skin where they can do some kind of something up

228
00:24:02,255 --> 00:24:07,455
such a nursing only very every buck which I think is helpful to see

229
00:24:07,455 --> 00:24:23,315
them in animated form see how these signaling are happening.

230
00:24:23,315 --> 00:24:33,354
just

231
00:24:33,354 --> 00:24:38,375
moved recently.

232
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:45,115
's. mobile so he

233
00:24:45,115 --> 00:24:51,151
well she refuses

234
00:24:51,151 --> 00:25:00,091
to

235
00:25:00,091 --> 00:25:05,271
work Saturday mornings and she'll be changed as long

236
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:13,110
since we've last had horses been

237
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:19,010
moved close. 's coffee

238
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:24,051
which changes for thirty oh.

239
00:25:24,051 --> 00:25:29,891
's. slash teams that we may

240
00:25:29,891 --> 00:25:36,531
call legal authorization

241
00:25:36,531 --> 00:25:41,931
for the first

242
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:48,057
reason same the

243
00:25:48,057 --> 00:25:53,177
well this is so you know the

244
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:59,817
relationships were following the same fashion

245
00:25:59,817 --> 00:26:05,957
so close to them they said you know

246
00:26:05,957 --> 00:26:11,336
the motivation and then they can go Fire compassion is essential.

247
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:16,937
I had efficiency we had to stay

248
00:26:16,937 --> 00:26:28,716
home the same.

249
00:26:28,716 --> 00:26:35,148
also he he

250
00:26:35,148 --> 00:26:40,828
exactly how easy

251
00:26:40,828 --> 00:26:47,308
it was one four oh

252
00:26:47,308 --> 00:26:53,028
I don't know who they are Fire systems

253
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:58,268
say call. my

254
00:26:58,268 --> 00:27:04,888
favorite is just very bad

255
00:27:04,888 --> 00:27:10,128
God that she's a model and she

256
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:16,469
she's actually a small fashion was

257
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:23,208
because the schools I I have to wear glasses

258
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:29,048
signed up for some great movie lap

259
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:38,420
that yeah

260
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:43,420
you a have feeling that's helpful to see how the they're working kind in sequence in France

261
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:49,040
with each other and we'll talk about excellent action potentials in a minute.

262
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,280
so when you have a more than one nurse on kind of bundled

263
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:59,740
together. uh in your body is put in. um so these are

264
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:05,240
um plans that are um uh

265
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:10,440
in. so if you would be an individual act huh. and this yellow point

266
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:16,440
and we can see that there in the whole cluster of multiple acts on this house body keeping

267
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:22,600
him he'd handle. we're needed. so this is the way organizing are wrong

268
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,660
um nerves

269
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:32,798
or collections of axon on and they've me have both the

270
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:38,038
censoring in the motor axon 's all located together and similar

271
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:43,398
bundle and we see that I'm your development

272
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:48,718
of these factors is ongoing pools and easily happens and chances you guys think all around

273
00:28:48,718 --> 00:28:57,178
my loneliness.

274
00:28:57,178 --> 00:29:02,178
yeah. um all statement but I this is

275
00:29:02,178 --> 00:29:07,918
something that I I don't have that all around amount but it turns out I am

276
00:29:07,918 --> 00:29:12,918
really going on around here are the ones the with one signal very quickly. um member my is

277
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:18,578
a lot of those like uh yeah I know I think you know

278
00:29:18,578 --> 00:29:23,878
movies have moved TV TV the article

279
00:29:23,878 --> 00:29:29,432
on I think a lot of and some of um

280
00:29:29,432 --> 00:29:34,652
well the only reason he's leaving on some kind see if you lose

281
00:29:34,652 --> 00:29:39,952
all have something you know

282
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:47,652
um were thinking just about a classic and around in the brain that has the fire very quickly.

283
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:53,012
yeah so um in our nervous tissue. our neurons are not. I'm reading a lonely

284
00:29:53,012 --> 00:29:58,552
I on hold support the so I'm really not around results.

285
00:29:58,552 --> 00:30:03,552
um uh they need me and if you need a lot of help. so in her first real

286
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:08,812
nervous system. we have cells which helps. I mean the cutest one cell which

287
00:30:08,812 --> 00:30:14,512
are the ones that will wrap my line around Iraq Sunset need it. um we also have satellite cells

288
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:23,032
that's around around a lot and they you know I don't know why I prove

289
00:30:23,032 --> 00:30:28,124
history and it well well

290
00:30:28,124 --> 00:30:33,484
for her older than her on um. somebody's happy and have

291
00:30:33,484 --> 00:30:38,544
have all of the environmental conditions that these are the stronghold are helping keep back on happy and

292
00:30:38,544 --> 00:30:43,984
the satellite cells are helping keep the cell bodies happy of the peripheral nerves and then we have

293
00:30:43,984 --> 00:30:49,264
a course on cell types that are very similar in the central nervous system. but just make it come up

294
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:54,424
they had they got a slightly different name. so the analog stronghold in the central

295
00:30:54,424 --> 00:30:59,504
system. all the underside flew the ones that are running own my she in

296
00:30:59,504 --> 00:31:04,864
the central nervous system. pasture side in the central nervous system

297
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:11,644
than a lot of the satellite cells they're providing support to the small body you know

298
00:31:11,644 --> 00:31:22,524
like the role in regulating very or maybe a

299
00:31:22,524 --> 00:31:27,744
we also have more cells in the central nervous system. we have primary

300
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:33,424
residential immune cells called my personally asked why you think we don't mean immune cells for

301
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:40,364
specifically for programmers

302
00:31:40,364 --> 00:31:45,924
because you know we keeping are the boxes all the other party have a right to use all their

303
00:31:45,924 --> 00:31:50,944
movie different movies and the various issues of the body but in our brain we got my

304
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:55,964
food um um he's fabric Excel he's active he

305
00:31:55,964 --> 00:32:01,044
said you for them so um. and if you play a really key role in the brain in particular

306
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:06,224
because you nobody can't even we can agree on who we need they need to uh

307
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:11,844
play movie roles user protection.

308
00:32:11,844 --> 00:32:17,064
a brief issue and save us a lot of work.

309
00:32:17,064 --> 00:32:22,257
I'm they're also responsible for cleaning up. I miss folding proteins

310
00:32:22,257 --> 00:32:27,417
well so um they're they're dealing with a

311
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:32,557
little brain factors that are either old or damaged. I know even

312
00:32:32,557 --> 00:32:37,578
other sub- specific to the central nervous system either call up kind of themselves and their mind

313
00:32:37,578 --> 00:32:43,078
blower eager get into that more details but those um I mention that the bring the link that

314
00:32:43,078 --> 00:32:48,777
you know volumes it doesn't have a specific way of keeping

315
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:54,037
him a nice room in the blood and other

316
00:32:54,037 --> 00:32:59,897
those effectively leading out of Fire this delivery control and regulate

317
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:05,497
what some of them are allowed to cross over into the breeze.

318
00:33:05,497 --> 00:33:10,627
I'm in either any producing our cerebral spinal fluid which will also talk about

319
00:33:10,627 --> 00:33:15,767
all right so here's a picture of some of these um they're real cells working

320
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:20,867
together. we can see over here would be seen cerebral spinal fluid. we see can our kinda most

321
00:33:20,867 --> 00:33:26,907
all of these are affiliated you know online

322
00:33:26,907 --> 00:33:32,188
we'd have our um this is the capital area here and after

323
00:33:32,188 --> 00:33:37,328
are sides helping regulate here. this is in purple is the nurse on him

324
00:33:37,328 --> 00:33:42,688
and we can see the mileage she's down here. oriented with all another site supplying

325
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:47,708
us what else we have we have I currently in the area. so we see that there's kind of this action at

326
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:54,088
work. um so

327
00:33:54,088 --> 00:33:59,127
talk about synaptic transmission and that's will be a little bit of a recap of what we talked about.

328
00:33:59,127 --> 00:34:05,568
I'm with actions pencils in which issue have we seen action.

329
00:34:05,568 --> 00:34:10,957
also specifically much

330
00:34:10,957 --> 00:34:16,257
yeah very because I her my in a specific region that

331
00:34:16,257 --> 00:34:21,297
is able to generate some actions and school. so as by way of recap

332
00:34:21,297 --> 00:34:26,517
our action credentials remembering potential has to do with the fact that

333
00:34:26,517 --> 00:34:31,636
abstract. most sellers are polarized. what I mean by polarized time you know they have different

334
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:39,717
charges in Iraq the seller negatively charged on the inside. probably

335
00:34:39,717 --> 00:34:44,757
some kind of stimulus happens whether it's a pain stimulus or in

336
00:34:44,757 --> 00:34:50,437
impetus to move some kind of stimulus happens in the cells open they're

337
00:34:50,437 --> 00:34:56,156
approaching games that are lining the cell membrane. so for example the my allows

338
00:34:56,156 --> 00:35:01,257
sodium in the store all the sodium comes flooding in and all of a sudden these

339
00:35:01,257 --> 00:35:06,965
older people are no longer how

340
00:35:06,965 --> 00:35:12,445
so the sodium comes flooding and because it's moving downstream it's concentration concentration

341
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:18,865
gradient then I mean it experiences this is the threshold. um

342
00:35:18,865 --> 00:35:23,985
and then the recovery happens and we got the polarization and

343
00:35:23,985 --> 00:35:29,005
read polarization happens next. so now we got our covering.

344
00:35:29,005 --> 00:35:34,025
what we is need that initial people relations really fast and

345
00:35:34,025 --> 00:35:39,745
I think a little bit more a lot.

346
00:35:39,745 --> 00:35:48,885
Fire

347
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:53,965
here's what that looks like. so here in Mass. and measuring not charge difference and Milly

348
00:35:53,965 --> 00:35:59,045
bowl and we see it peaks up and then here's that recovery. and goes

349
00:35:59,045 --> 00:36:04,084
back to the resting potential there are meals but

350
00:36:04,084 --> 00:36:13,496
we're not you

351
00:36:13,496 --> 00:36:19,516
other research is they're helpful to understand this process in greater detail.

352
00:36:19,516 --> 00:36:24,636
but the main thing here is that all or nothing Bank you can't just fire a little

353
00:36:24,636 --> 00:36:29,736
bit uh these channels either open all the way or not at all. um

354
00:36:29,736 --> 00:36:34,776
and they only go in one direction. so that neurons only signal down the

355
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:43,356
axon. they're not able to swing on the reverse direction.

356
00:36:43,356 --> 00:36:48,616
what do we mean by what signaling here some of the molecules that are important

357
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:53,717
for signaling and then this is not personally

358
00:36:53,717 --> 00:36:58,896
losses or call us Mormons are um signaling molecules are called

359
00:36:58,896 --> 00:37:03,937
neurotransmitters. I mean because you know they're made out of the lot of the similar factors. so they're

360
00:37:03,937 --> 00:37:09,049
made out of them you know after the pep type. just like warm um or they're made out of my own

361
00:37:09,049 --> 00:37:14,489
means which are structurally quite similar and so these are the molecules that are gonna travel

362
00:37:14,489 --> 00:37:20,249
across in a

363
00:37:20,249 --> 00:37:25,328
very small travel

364
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:30,509
all the other um mom loser process

365
00:37:30,509 --> 00:37:35,588
and falls Road modulator that can either enhance or depress the

366
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:40,588
receptor ability to act I where there's nerve traffic factors.

367
00:37:40,588 --> 00:37:46,868
one important one we study a lot called bring in driving around traffic

368
00:37:46,868 --> 00:37:52,088
for him after that help stimulate neuronal in on our own selves

369
00:37:52,088 --> 00:37:57,289
either proliferate which means to buy or to differentiate

370
00:37:57,289 --> 00:38:02,469
into a more specific cell types or to just survive. so we've even

371
00:38:02,469 --> 00:38:07,529
in culture that um you can make your girls a lot more happy like getting a

372
00:38:07,529 --> 00:38:12,802
hold of you um more satisfying

373
00:38:12,802 --> 00:38:18,062
environment. so the primary signaling molecules are all here transmitters and then er modulator

374
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:26,663
is not terrific factors um can help influence the efficiency

375
00:38:26,663 --> 00:38:31,683
use a little bit about what what that looks like we've got the in video but here would

376
00:38:31,683 --> 00:38:36,722
be the end of an axon coming down um and

377
00:38:36,722 --> 00:38:42,603
we're coming down to a nerve impulse one of those electrical signal. we're becoming gosh

378
00:38:42,603 --> 00:38:48,583
and one side of signals get um then that's pre- synaptic Nora

379
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:54,363
is going to have all of these tiny bicycles full of nerve transmitter.

380
00:38:54,363 --> 00:39:00,083
we're where the vegetables probably coming from what part of the cell do you think of making these bicycles.

381
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:08,222
any pro team.

382
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:13,302
yeah swim in the cell bodies or if this is happening up and like a flash my

383
00:39:13,302 --> 00:39:18,462
particular area. and so you know the whole times for for time to travel all

384
00:39:18,462 --> 00:39:24,282
the way down there and then we have these these medical school neurotransmitters and

385
00:39:24,282 --> 00:39:30,022
and one of signal palms bicycles along our transmitters fuse

386
00:39:30,022 --> 00:39:35,402
here with the and edge of the membrane and they start releasing the contents. so they release

387
00:39:35,402 --> 00:39:40,742
contents into the space. so you notice that the actual

388
00:39:40,742 --> 00:39:50,973
distance the synapses quite small have

389
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:56,073
including anyway the way

390
00:39:56,073 --> 00:40:01,153
he said this is really high on um mean I both

391
00:40:01,153 --> 00:40:06,292
those of views with us on my brain and they release all these tiny nerve transmitters into the space and

392
00:40:06,292 --> 00:40:11,292
then the downstream the post synaptic done right picks him up in these receptors so

393
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:17,333
we can see here here's our um our remembering here's a

394
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:22,573
trans membrane protein like an eye on channel one of those sodium potassium channels that was important

395
00:40:22,573 --> 00:40:27,693
for changing the charge. also oversees the receptor when a nerve transmitter finds

396
00:40:27,693 --> 00:40:32,853
the receptor. this channel is gonna open itself up. so

397
00:40:32,853 --> 00:40:38,292
here we see the nurse about some other channel open and our sodium slows

398
00:40:38,292 --> 00:40:43,733
right now. okay. so all of these other channels opening in the changing of charge

399
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:48,893
it because these air transmitters are traveling across the short distance in telling this

400
00:40:48,893 --> 00:40:56,465
downstream around to open the gate

401
00:40:56,465 --> 00:41:01,685
then we got a clear clear it up. we gotta clean it up so you can't just have a loaner transmitter hanging out there

402
00:41:01,685 --> 00:41:07,005
for a long time because that will signal the downstream neurons to fire

403
00:41:07,005 --> 00:41:12,045
too much water they um who need to clear out there you know

404
00:41:12,045 --> 00:41:17,285
what it was in the barrel around like with an emphasis on once we're done without harm

405
00:41:17,285 --> 00:41:25,185
I mean I don't hear very morally we need to out the parents.

406
00:41:25,185 --> 00:41:30,565
we need to clear out. been trying to have a couple options for how to clear out and a transmitter

407
00:41:30,565 --> 00:41:35,665
one is to have a pre- synaptic neurons take it back up. this is

408
00:41:35,665 --> 00:41:41,705
like recycling. so that on so I don't have to build another one.

409
00:41:41,705 --> 00:41:47,085
so I

410
00:41:47,085 --> 00:41:52,305
am in another way is if you know you're we can see that some of the nerve transmitter

411
00:41:52,305 --> 00:41:57,840
do you just diffuse out and um then I think on one of the nearly

412
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:03,720
all of those responsibilities to deal with it starts getting away from Enron or oh

413
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:09,860
we see that I can get broken down into the decision the tabloids. so they might

414
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:14,880
need a smaller movie that nursing

415
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,400
is. I also see that you have problems

416
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:28,400
or you have or

417
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,660
do you have questions about synaptic transmission how those things happen so it's a combination

418
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:48,340
um changing action potential for the signals change. actually

419
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:53,640
alright we'll talk about how these individuals Segal cells

420
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:58,772
community uh mine are

421
00:42:58,772 --> 00:43:04,012
more massive structure system. so here is

422
00:43:04,012 --> 00:43:09,412
a cartoon image of our brain we see it's kinda wrinkly it's uh

423
00:43:09,412 --> 00:43:14,572
got a lot of holes um it has um a lot of these funny

424
00:43:14,572 --> 00:43:20,032
words for different parts of it but we have three means

425
00:43:20,032 --> 00:43:25,272
bins for cruises. I agree.

426
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:30,612
we've got in Brandon. we've got four rains in the for rain is the biggest part

427
00:43:30,612 --> 00:43:35,712
over the top all that wrinkly stuff and uh we kinda figured out what was different

428
00:43:35,712 --> 00:43:41,012
part other agreed people who are bringing

429
00:43:41,012 --> 00:43:49,972
on just it by reading. injury one of the rooms. oh

430
00:43:49,972 --> 00:43:55,640
raised any without reason to do

431
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:00,920
we are we are working in dark the for for many years now we have much better idea of mapping all the different

432
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:06,540
parts of the brain are responsible for for the high marine life partner. I could be

433
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:12,820
this is kinda the most user-friendly Brandon is a breeze down region.

434
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:17,840
so this includes um. are you sir

435
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:22,960
out here. that's kind of like low a that comes out the back and as well as

436
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,720
you. region. I'm almost the exact then it controls whole the lot of money. our

437
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,780
we're not reading seems like our heart

438
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:38,880
rate. um reflexes to cough and swallow things that you don't have to be conscious

439
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,240
about how your body is doing the background without thinking about it. also links

440
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:49,520
to different nerds that are gonna travel elsewhere out about the body um

441
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:54,920
and actually the important role in this is the hard reason I mean

442
00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:00,022
whether they did that see I mean I'm need really

443
00:45:00,022 --> 00:45:05,862
versus somebody afraid that mean Missus

444
00:45:05,862 --> 00:45:13,302
almost burgers made a motion about um

445
00:45:13,302 --> 00:45:19,602
terrorism mean I and he I'm following on these kinds of factors.

446
00:45:19,602 --> 00:45:24,622
your mid green this is kind of small area that I I don't usually work with

447
00:45:24,622 --> 00:45:30,062
a much because it's um this connection points so with the intersection

448
00:45:30,062 --> 00:45:35,122
between a lot of these factors going together and it is going to be in charge of a lot of your

449
00:45:35,122 --> 00:45:40,722
reflex reaction so if you're having and I last read

450
00:45:40,722 --> 00:45:45,762
two like once many foot lane here I am sorry if you're having reflex to sound

451
00:45:45,762 --> 00:45:50,902
pompous your mid brain is gonna be entering and then the big of part their brain

452
00:45:50,902 --> 00:45:55,902
refund the most time studying because this is the most unique to us as humans is huge you for

453
00:45:55,902 --> 00:46:01,674
reading you know that's kinda covering the whole structure um and so we think about

454
00:46:01,674 --> 00:46:06,674
three main reason regions of the more rain but of course there's times regions of the four grams which

455
00:46:06,674 --> 00:46:11,974
one of you have we seen before

456
00:46:11,974 --> 00:46:17,114
we seen the hype found them before their undercurrents of the ranks that are sensing region.

457
00:46:17,114 --> 00:46:22,574
so here we got over that controls that I mean when it's trying to keep your body to maintain

458
00:46:22,574 --> 00:46:28,008
Julio Cesar Martin um. seeing to be at a normal level only really want to maintain

459
00:46:28,008 --> 00:46:33,568
normal temperature. you normal time on signaling. okay. - Dallas the sentencing

460
00:46:33,568 --> 00:46:38,748
and then we also have our salmon which is very close by this is our our switchboard or relay

461
00:46:38,748 --> 00:46:43,808
stations and we'll see this is involved in an other factors in a minute and then we have

462
00:46:43,808 --> 00:46:48,888
this big cerebral over the top. so the surgery room this this

463
00:46:48,888 --> 00:46:54,088
for Renee. it gets more minutes to so there's forming a

464
00:46:54,088 --> 00:47:02,848
here a little longer. are. so we

465
00:47:02,848 --> 00:47:07,888
got. we're also hearing and then occipital lobes

466
00:47:07,888 --> 00:47:15,648
over here in the back which is a lot with. division

467
00:47:15,648 --> 00:47:21,728
there is a lot finer resolution then just these for gross regions.

468
00:47:21,728 --> 00:47:27,491
there's a lot of mapping work that has been done to figure out which specific

469
00:47:27,491 --> 00:47:40,331
neurons in which specific area are responsible for which specific person thing in body your for example

470
00:47:40,331 --> 00:47:45,331
there's an interesting area including type of balance on salmon three

471
00:47:45,331 --> 00:47:50,951
in the middle. so this is kind of if you're just looking at a whole range this is hidden from you.

472
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:56,311
even the time every um and is involved

473
00:47:56,311 --> 00:48:02,011
in these key aspects promotional proper thing as well learn learning and memory source Alice

474
00:48:02,011 --> 00:48:07,111
is going to be doing all of our emotional processing. helping us regulate our emotional state

475
00:48:07,111 --> 00:48:13,151
like nervousness or our fear. all of these contractors

476
00:48:13,151 --> 00:48:18,311
and our hippocampus is the ski region right here for learning and memory.

477
00:48:18,311 --> 00:48:24,311
it's kinda she's like a banana model for very small things

478
00:48:24,311 --> 00:48:29,603
are hearing well door the to remember is

479
00:48:29,603 --> 00:48:34,963
a small. but as well.

480
00:48:34,963 --> 00:48:40,083
yeah it is interesting we release networking area. I'm not involved

481
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:45,683
in in integrating emotional processing as well as learning and memory.

482
00:48:45,683 --> 00:48:50,803
do you guys have a which part of the brand is gonna help you maintain our functions like breathing

483
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:56,063
or functions like her grave and functions like digestion and I'm so excited the flight

484
00:48:56,063 --> 00:49:09,283
is working.

485
00:49:09,283 --> 00:49:35,203
it's

486
00:49:35,203 --> 00:49:40,863
you guys are pretty strong agreement I'm Brandon this is the reason regions and Missus control

487
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:51,683
of our most basic functions I mean you don't have to consciously think about

488
00:49:51,683 --> 00:49:58,203
um and then I just wanted to point out this other thing that our brain is not a

489
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:03,303
homogeneous throughout the is number closer. we are also

490
00:50:03,303 --> 00:50:08,323
a lot of clusters where all that. we have

491
00:50:08,323 --> 00:50:15,343
two colors. we we call them in the rooms we have greymatter

492
00:50:15,343 --> 00:50:20,403
out here. these these darker regions that covers outside and then we have the

493
00:50:20,403 --> 00:50:25,483
white matter which is in the inside and the room matter.

494
00:50:25,483 --> 00:50:31,189
we're also a lot of them are in the way marriage track

495
00:50:31,189 --> 00:50:36,249
so you see mostly in the real the time and all that together

496
00:50:36,249 --> 00:50:41,749
and literally in the dirt. and I am waiting to see whether are

497
00:50:41,749 --> 00:50:46,909
areas were all back on right the direction. we can be sure that all

498
00:50:46,909 --> 00:50:54,089
cross and thing not really sure what are your

499
00:50:54,089 --> 00:51:02,729
hobbies here this is a cross is section three. we're just looking.

500
00:51:02,729 --> 00:51:08,029
we can see here in the middle we've got things like I Thelma Center type soundness rate and even the middle

501
00:51:08,029 --> 00:51:14,749
creek crossing the middle of the brain.

502
00:51:14,749 --> 00:51:20,229
one thing we we've started to notice across from any of our organs so we've seen this before

503
00:51:20,229 --> 00:51:25,389
with our um respiratory system. our part of our system is a lot

504
00:51:25,389 --> 00:51:30,457
harder delicate work are covered in misery right so or move

505
00:51:30,457 --> 00:51:38,457
on to my room pressure.

506
00:51:38,457 --> 00:51:43,517
Louis area. remember either I or one of those members

507
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:48,637
of the drug matter. this is really strong connective tissue and can we see here

508
00:51:48,637 --> 00:51:54,257
is right below the bones. so this is gonna help protect the brain

509
00:51:54,257 --> 00:51:59,697
below that we haven't delicate cataract Aykroyd my that's waterproof

510
00:51:59,697 --> 00:52:06,397
and this is gonna be used to help you first last movie

511
00:52:06,397 --> 00:52:11,997
then we have another member in my mother. matter and this

512
00:52:11,997 --> 00:52:17,037
part we can see goes into all those little delicate falls in the breeze to the

513
00:52:17,037 --> 00:52:22,157
pure matter is here the closest to the brain tissue and then it's going to

514
00:52:22,157 --> 00:52:27,317
you in case um service is a breeze. I love the blood vessels are gonna be running on top

515
00:52:27,317 --> 00:52:32,383
of it. okay. so so all of our structures are a common

516
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:37,723
memory and scarring on for various purposes related to protection. well here we're seeing him

517
00:52:37,723 --> 00:52:42,943
for waterproof feature in terms of keeping the cerebral spinal fluid team we'll

518
00:52:42,943 --> 00:52:48,243
see it later in the lecturer an example of how that could be a problem um because

519
00:52:48,243 --> 00:52:58,903
son he's you and

520
00:52:58,903 --> 00:53:04,421
so we have all kinds of ways to measure

521
00:53:04,421 --> 00:53:10,541
this nervous system. it's a little bit uh

522
00:53:10,541 --> 00:53:15,601
uh indirect because you're on the outside looking in the

523
00:53:15,601 --> 00:53:20,741
room. um but we have a lot of factors in terms of our clinical assessments

524
00:53:20,741 --> 00:53:26,561
we'll talk about first. so these are assessments I can be contacted by pollution the know so that

525
00:53:26,561 --> 00:53:34,041
I can go to the movies there's and a lot. um well the only

526
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:39,361
producer in order we

527
00:53:39,361 --> 00:53:44,461
are we're very very easy

528
00:53:44,461 --> 00:53:49,741
the questionnaire and I mean targeted him for testing

529
00:53:49,741 --> 00:53:54,781
your motor skills or sensory perception you're hearing your vision and your motor your

530
00:53:54,781 --> 00:54:00,141
speech or coronation your balance. your mental Satish movie here so there maybe specific assessment

531
00:54:00,141 --> 00:54:05,301
based but administered to someone based on their symptoms are I'm portraying or based on

532
00:54:05,301 --> 00:54:10,368
your outcome of interest for your study you might have specific tools

533
00:54:10,368 --> 00:54:15,388
that you might need to help improve the assessment quality uh so that was kind

534
00:54:15,388 --> 00:54:23,648
of a lord. a lot of our problems and values issues.

535
00:54:23,648 --> 00:54:28,708
you know uh um I know

536
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:34,048
I a little in the matter our new technology um

537
00:54:34,048 --> 00:54:39,188
my manager are we able to

538
00:54:39,188 --> 00:54:44,468
you know do I funny but um we have more integration of electronic medical records

539
00:54:44,468 --> 00:54:49,488
are able to extract some of these images or other services. so there

540
00:54:49,488 --> 00:54:54,488
is a a real. a holidays

541
00:54:54,488 --> 00:54:59,728
are available so I don't remember all I have

542
00:54:59,728 --> 00:55:05,588
every reason. oh. uses it looks close.

543
00:55:05,588 --> 00:55:10,690
I have Rudy um we can

544
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:16,290
do that as long as it was wonderful region. um. technologies

545
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:22,170
like yeah yeah or

546
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:27,350
um movies is all using a real live also real active label

547
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:32,450
that he should either be inserted you know usually drink beforehand

548
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:37,490
on and I don't know to how swim team and they should be able to see particular

549
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:42,950
models and for example it very much free label used for all these

550
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:48,530
unknowns and because the of findings specifically to the Amway cookies that in the

551
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:53,670
diagnostic. so we don't know if the ceiling is one of the time around half

552
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:59,710
dollars but this is a very specific um diagnostic criteria for

553
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:05,250
using one of those pet images. we have a line or

554
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:10,480
a lot longer you might had use pictures were people have

555
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,480
well I don't censor know so I don't always um know you they're kind

556
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:21,080
of like full neural net a match

557
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:26,140
other people can buy um technology is developing really quickly but this

558
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:31,220
is a way up on from the outside of her grandma can how closely are some of these

559
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:36,620
actions will change in and there are very ones that are developed for either the premium more probably

560
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:41,660
are some that are developed to be used on your muscles. so my offer if you wanna second one. there's

561
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:46,940
other ones that are able around I am we're looking for specific

562
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:52,740
teams neurological or having injuries. so we got various electrical activity monitors

563
00:56:52,740 --> 00:57:02,260
on regions specific the bases season and brought electrical activities are happening.

564
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:07,340
we also have available several biomarkers function and disease. we might use things

565
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:12,574
like Sussman um what are the contents of your cerebral spinal fluid

566
00:57:12,574 --> 00:57:17,874
was I mean I guess where you accessory rose food from you know

567
00:57:17,874 --> 00:57:22,974
take that from home loans for him to response without required expertise

568
00:57:22,974 --> 00:57:27,974
to collapse and it's supposed to be quite useful and the patients this is not something

569
00:57:27,974 --> 00:57:33,414
that's why user the I many you know logic studies like for proposal full. um

570
00:57:33,414 --> 00:57:38,994
trying to identify biomarkers. I've seen that used and in various various um

571
00:57:38,994 --> 00:57:43,994
the case I'm follow-up studies. so

572
00:57:43,994 --> 00:57:49,394
that is has been used so for example there are folks looking for

573
00:57:49,394 --> 00:57:54,454
your levels of that hemorrhoids approaching I mention for Alzheimer disease in your cerebral spinal fluid

574
00:57:54,454 --> 00:58:00,174
and trying to see if a lot of that her keys were a lot

575
00:58:00,174 --> 00:58:06,726
easier for

576
00:58:06,726 --> 00:58:11,906
um I've also genetic tests that are available for many inner logic disorders um most

577
00:58:11,906 --> 00:58:17,786
certain neurological disorders how about fifty percent here in ability. so

578
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:23,366
you know a couple times some people who are after uh

579
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:28,606
all of this is available disorders and it's more clinically

580
00:58:28,606 --> 00:58:34,086
diagnostic for um particular traits like something things in news which is highly

581
00:58:34,086 --> 00:58:39,446
genetic um and you know some insight. I asked the number of repeats

582
00:58:39,446 --> 00:58:44,486
and your genetic sequence and then there's also interested in biomarkers

583
00:58:44,486 --> 00:58:50,206
development and more easily accessible. circulating lose like in your blood so

584
00:58:50,206 --> 00:58:55,686
a lot of us obviously these other um um cerebral spinal fluid markers

585
00:58:55,686 --> 00:59:00,866
or more. there's a lot of hope and optimism but I mean you know I guess for little

586
00:59:00,866 --> 00:59:06,122
more so. a tissue so that we can apply the form broadly

587
00:59:06,122 --> 00:59:11,242
here for example of the FEMA study and Alzheimer's disease where they're

588
00:59:11,242 --> 00:59:17,302
looking at Corliss many biomarkers across multiple

589
00:59:17,302 --> 00:59:22,722
uh spectrum so here would be um how abnormal your bar marker.

590
00:59:22,722 --> 00:59:28,822
I mean we could see that earliest you got to reverse my absolute humanoid accumulation.

591
00:59:28,822 --> 00:59:33,822
then you would get accumulation on that brain imaging stands. um

592
00:59:33,822 --> 00:59:39,062
then he would get through the spinal fluid accumulations another fricking. townhouse um. so

593
00:59:39,062 --> 00:59:44,414
a very different kind those and are

594
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:55,914
Florio and shoes and glasses farmers.

595
00:59:55,914 --> 01:00:01,054
let's take a break and I come back we're gonna talk about a unique feature of the brain in terms of how

596
01:00:01,054 --> 01:00:39,154
much blood supply and demand from party. 's is

597
01:00:39,154 --> 01:00:47,334
on the. yeah. so you're true good

598
01:00:47,334 --> 01:00:53,294
God God. I know

599
01:00:53,294 --> 01:01:04,714
yeah but yeah see I have like a area with one of

600
01:01:04,714 --> 01:01:09,834
the reasons of the

601
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:18,534
killings

602
01:01:18,534 --> 01:01:28,094
yeah well and I mean things never change in the radio and

603
01:01:28,094 --> 01:01:35,054
someone did

604
01:01:35,054 --> 01:01:40,114
I am reading that

605
01:01:40,114 --> 01:01:50,574
that's on the outside. you know whether most

606
01:01:50,574 --> 01:02:00,634
of the cleaning estimate how much you like.

607
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:12,554
okay well like a pressure alarm.

608
01:02:12,554 --> 01:02:18,294
's. yeah this not is a meeting.

609
01:02:18,294 --> 01:02:23,314
actually you know I mean

610
01:02:23,314 --> 01:02:28,314
that's yeah

611
01:02:28,314 --> 01:02:35,914
yeah yeah

612
01:02:35,914 --> 01:02:58,454
like I have heard

613
01:02:58,454 --> 01:03:04,074
yeah

614
01:03:04,074 --> 01:03:10,594
yeah and we see that run the day like I usually I'm not available

615
01:03:10,594 --> 01:03:24,994
maybe go to the else

616
01:03:24,994 --> 01:03:33,894
for a while.

617
01:03:33,894 --> 01:03:40,574
other. oh

618
01:03:40,574 --> 01:03:50,254
yeah and sleep eating and then there's the. hi rather still

619
01:03:50,254 --> 01:03:55,294
trying to

620
01:03:55,294 --> 01:04:02,774
figure

621
01:04:02,774 --> 01:04:08,934
well yeah because you have to yeah. that secondly. amenities.

622
01:04:08,934 --> 01:04:30,334
a lot of times passes away.

623
01:04:30,334 --> 01:04:57,557
mhm yeah I don't know if you know

624
01:04:57,557 --> 01:05:55,017
yeah

625
01:05:55,017 --> 01:06:07,077
all right that's like or do you feel about the blood supply and the fluid that you're

626
01:06:07,077 --> 01:06:12,617
free. the flat

627
01:06:12,617 --> 01:06:19,737
tire and I learned a lot um it was hard to move over there and

628
01:06:19,737 --> 01:06:25,017
yeah okay um your agreement where seventy seven hundred

629
01:06:25,017 --> 01:06:30,397
fifty milliliters per minute blood and I was having trouble picturing how much fluid

630
01:06:30,397 --> 01:06:35,617
is seven hundred fifty milliliters. mean I it turns out that that is

631
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:40,977
your standard bottle of wine. so this is how much fluid your brain required so much blood

632
01:06:40,977 --> 01:06:45,997
your brain requires every single minute in order to keep itself without a quick

633
01:06:45,997 --> 01:06:51,497
oxygen supply and keep itself with adequate gossip. here so is that we

634
01:06:51,497 --> 01:06:57,477
peel back. um some of those men in jeans glared we can see that there's a full network of

635
01:06:57,477 --> 01:07:02,577
blood vessels that are on top of the brain and we can see the blood flow is

636
01:07:02,577 --> 01:07:07,677
coming through this major artery often or not the carotid artery is and

637
01:07:07,677 --> 01:07:12,957
comes up and branches and supplies also blood for her brain.

638
01:07:12,957 --> 01:07:19,160
we know that our brain is only about two percent of our whole body weight but it punches above its weight in turn

639
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:24,620
give me and so it requires about fifteen percent of older heart cardiac output

640
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:29,640
about twenty percent of all the blood supply of oxygen. so we have a

641
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:34,700
high degree of metabolic demands going to bring housing and keep our brain. nice happy

642
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:40,080
and full of energy and oxygen when there's an interruption

643
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:45,160
and not blood flows up to the brain. that's what we call a stroke. um

644
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:50,220
it's also heard it called a green account. um this is one the blood flow was cut off to

645
01:07:50,220 --> 01:08:05,640
an area to bring either Little League or what's involved in your blood and those

646
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:10,640
are part of um that was on a

647
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:15,840
shopping love Lucy or Renee. um. always great either examples of

648
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:21,625
what happens

649
01:08:21,625 --> 01:08:26,625
um. so we have religious leaders of one is called a hammer around

650
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:31,984
next room. this is when a blood vessel ruptured and then you have bleeding happening in the brain

651
01:08:31,984 --> 01:08:37,944
and clearly the cells that are downstream of that we do are not receiving their supplier

652
01:08:37,944 --> 01:08:42,964
plus the plus the other flavor of the structure you can have an even stronger and that's where the

653
01:08:42,964 --> 01:08:50,744
level of water. we have you know down the screen. so

654
01:08:50,744 --> 01:08:55,924
we have a couple different types of if you make sure if you guys mind of her and um she

655
01:08:55,924 --> 01:09:01,625
got a stranded. if you make a tax which are very common in older age fees are individually

656
01:09:01,625 --> 01:09:06,784
not very serious but they can be really signs that you might have a large insured later. um you might

657
01:09:06,784 --> 01:09:14,145
have a large muscle stroke was a little plot or a smaller vessel blockage.

658
01:09:14,145 --> 01:09:19,168
so you're not that first type that number and extract this is one of muscle ruptures

659
01:09:19,168 --> 01:09:24,188
so this is also called an aneurysm patient my

660
01:09:24,188 --> 01:09:29,289
experience and all all the sudden very severe headache may or may not come with knowledge

661
01:09:29,289 --> 01:09:34,309
and vomiting and then there and other other types um they have round a of

662
01:09:34,309 --> 01:09:40,968
strokes and he can come with serious contribution.

663
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:46,468
here um there maybe a a damage

664
01:09:46,468 --> 01:09:51,488
and the downstream tissue for us give me a hassle cut off the blood flow and there could

665
01:09:51,488 --> 01:09:57,289
be a whole bunch of widespread consequences in the brain for the him some projects

666
01:09:57,289 --> 01:10:03,048
for the scheming I just give me this time we've talked about previously we talked about first the one

667
01:10:03,048 --> 01:10:08,249
you yeah. uh the seller comp a lot.

668
01:10:08,249 --> 01:10:13,528
um and what happens there is that they have a depletion of energy so they're not

669
01:10:13,528 --> 01:10:18,580
uh they don't have much and uh who goes available to them and what

670
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:23,780
happens here is uh we end up with.

671
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:29,080
so in this example also here might be a situation where there's damage

672
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:34,320
and then there's this whole zone that's downstream of the damage and it's receiving

673
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:39,360
consequences of that. reduce blood flow. it can cause

674
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:44,460
changes in your your blood constituency so it could

675
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:50,400
either become sludge like half class I come downstream

676
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:56,560
and we've also learned previously about one blood flow was cut off. um we also have

677
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:02,320
and what happens once all possible. they better

678
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:07,980
um you know just right. um we see that the real big metabolism subsidies

679
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:13,560
producing as much a teepee. so those um sodium and potassium

680
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:19,290
huh to react. I does not require a lot of energy

681
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:28,010
to three hundred degree. now he's not available.

682
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:33,170
um not able to read full ride then we end up moving towards anaerobic

683
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:38,290
metabolism which we know is less sufficient increase if you were a few people are sure how feels so we're gonna

684
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:43,470
run out of sugar quickly. um and it also produces byproducts like lactic acid

685
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:48,510
then that has other consequential downstream damages for false records so this this

686
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:53,830
is reasonable to have any problems not just as a blood vessel but in all of the tissues downstream.

687
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:59,330
um there's also another major challenge to us. yeah and have a hobby

688
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:04,470
and the brain and this is a feature politics I don't talk to city.

689
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:09,950
so if you got to much you know much blood flow cut off. um the cells

690
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:15,174
and start releasing Louise neurotransmitters um inappropriately not in a controlled

691
01:12:15,174 --> 01:12:20,474
way so that all of a sudden our neurons are over firing him in ways

692
01:12:20,474 --> 01:12:25,534
that they're not supposed to do for him and this creates a whole calcium task in which we saw again in

693
01:12:25,534 --> 01:12:30,614
the cell structure lecture week one. um and I love you never want

694
01:12:30,614 --> 01:12:36,434
to get to the whole downstream part where we're having brings all nutrients the and even cellular dot

695
01:12:36,434 --> 01:12:41,494
but so this is a type of cell injury that's particularly um how

696
01:12:41,494 --> 01:12:47,974
the grammar sponsors Kenya where we got too much release of your transmitters

697
01:12:47,974 --> 01:12:53,194
you guys remember which few substances in the mitochondria country needs are pretty easy oxygen

698
01:12:53,194 --> 01:12:59,938
live in harmony outside they look up and accident. this look on the family

699
01:12:59,938 --> 01:13:17,718
well you're bringing

700
01:13:17,718 --> 01:13:23,098
you guys once again are in perfect agreement right. so any an order to do a road

701
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:37,178
house. you know if I was his last

702
01:13:37,178 --> 01:13:42,418
stroke is pretty common time because he is in the US. uh it happens

703
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:47,578
about almost a hundred thousand times per year we notice that a lot of these our first

704
01:13:47,578 --> 01:13:52,678
wrote him is associate with a high rate of mortality. is a mass

705
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:58,038
majority of strokes are extremely sure as well right

706
01:13:58,038 --> 01:14:03,078
Roger um and there's all kinds of important bridge factors to keep in mind one is the fact that

707
01:14:03,078 --> 01:14:08,157
once you've had a first Roman once you have one of those. human taxes much more likely

708
01:14:08,157 --> 01:14:13,578
to have another show um. so they want to put you on um a

709
01:14:13,578 --> 01:14:18,737
tertiary prevention to keep you from having another recurrence of it. um we also see

710
01:14:18,737 --> 01:14:23,737
there's a difference in important differences with demographic factors.

711
01:14:23,737 --> 01:14:28,958
we see there's for instance um connection with the high blood pressure makes sense

712
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:34,598
if you have if I was married maybe more lazy. two years number of

713
01:14:34,598 --> 01:14:40,578
little fires throughout the entire. um don't know that

714
01:14:40,578 --> 01:14:45,877
you members of the washrooms are you have a lot of cholesterol

715
01:14:45,877 --> 01:14:52,098
clock. your solution. so a lot

716
01:14:52,098 --> 01:15:00,897
yeah. words is good.

717
01:15:00,897 --> 01:15:05,997
here's a massive stroke death rates in the US and we noticed

718
01:15:05,997 --> 01:15:11,717
that this is not randomly distributed throughout the the country.

719
01:15:11,717 --> 01:15:16,817
give me very a this region. stroke belt before him to the southeastern US is

720
01:15:16,817 --> 01:15:21,857
a spot spot for him. a higher likelihood of dying due to stroke

721
01:15:21,857 --> 01:15:27,017
and there's a lot of interventions and strategies to try to mitigate this and try to understand

722
01:15:27,017 --> 01:15:36,217
what the physiological factors.

723
01:15:36,217 --> 01:15:41,557
there's also been some interesting imaging strategies that people

724
01:15:41,557 --> 01:15:46,597
uh and you know answer anything I see a lot of Hebrew balding white matter for cities

725
01:15:46,597 --> 01:15:51,977
um to try and understand the precursors

726
01:15:51,977 --> 01:15:57,166
um movies are um images you're able to get from the CT yeah

727
01:15:57,166 --> 01:16:02,166
that are looking at changes in the water food so here

728
01:16:02,166 --> 01:16:07,686
in the little white sox are these white men are hyper intensities so even people who haven't had a stroke.

729
01:16:07,686 --> 01:16:13,806
you maybe able to identify these little you know that are indicative

730
01:16:13,806 --> 01:16:18,925
these of um. a free clinical outcomes that are able

731
01:16:18,925 --> 01:16:25,186
to look at and identify people early and upstream of for long stroke.

732
01:16:25,186 --> 01:16:30,326
so here for example is a matter now since across who I don't know

733
01:16:30,326 --> 01:16:35,366
fifteen studies and we have the on the

734
01:16:35,366 --> 01:16:40,826
acceptance is your hazard ratio. um. um incident struck

735
01:16:40,826 --> 01:16:45,945
still a new stroke case. given the presence of white matter hyper

736
01:16:45,945 --> 01:16:51,105
intensities. so can anybody heard Brett. let's say the very first

737
01:16:51,105 --> 01:17:07,017
year. anyone is the first row for me

738
01:17:07,017 --> 01:17:12,458
you certainly how they're easier for that matter. a uh you

739
01:17:12,458 --> 01:17:17,757
when you're looking for a ten ounces without proper but

740
01:17:17,757 --> 01:17:23,978
that's uh it's just see how we are true.

741
01:17:23,978 --> 01:17:29,297
you then. um. what they saw

742
01:17:29,297 --> 01:17:34,417
reading and what about the mall over your time was the

743
01:17:34,417 --> 01:17:46,697
house. I'm way God.

744
01:17:46,697 --> 01:17:51,757
yeah I feel like um hearts models maybe aren't covered until a year to ensure one

745
01:17:51,757 --> 01:18:04,907
six

746
01:18:04,907 --> 01:18:10,987
yes and this first study recently that um

747
01:18:10,987 --> 01:18:16,067
out a study five million six hundred thirty seven people. these are

748
01:18:16,067 --> 01:18:21,547
people with white matter hyper intensities had also a five fold increase likelihood

749
01:18:21,547 --> 01:18:26,647
of experiencing a stroke over the follow. that's really high increasing

750
01:18:26,647 --> 01:18:32,927
risk. okay. um and does this seem to be relatively

751
01:18:32,927 --> 01:18:39,067
similar across different studies.

752
01:18:39,067 --> 01:18:46,307
you think

753
01:18:46,307 --> 01:18:51,367
in general are the white matter hyper intensities associate with high risk lower risk and

754
01:18:51,367 --> 01:18:56,891
all hi Rick most of the times this is to line and learn all

755
01:18:56,891 --> 01:19:03,031
and most of them are at high. risk we see most studies don't have a ton of people.

756
01:19:03,031 --> 01:19:08,631
I mean they're using breeze games please get up to a couple thousand. um

757
01:19:08,631 --> 01:19:13,651
there doesn't be the weights on the side or some in option you can do when you're doing a med analysis

758
01:19:13,651 --> 01:19:21,571
and that's two four years. I mean.

759
01:19:21,571 --> 01:19:26,651
if you notice that most of the weight is coming

760
01:19:26,651 --> 01:19:32,071
from some of the bigger studies with over a thousand people and then

761
01:19:32,071 --> 01:19:37,543
we have the overall view which is somewhere in order of back

762
01:19:37,543 --> 01:19:44,104
so this is a interesting um

763
01:19:44,104 --> 01:19:56,323
okay. you were younger people like hire.

764
01:19:56,323 --> 01:20:01,323
they also looked at some other outcomes in addition to whether you had a stroke this

765
01:20:01,323 --> 01:20:06,644
first panel is whether those type of intensities were supposed be with the men shops and again we see mostly

766
01:20:06,644 --> 01:20:12,124
arrest factor for dementia and then they did are they associate with mortality. we see. yes.

767
01:20:12,124 --> 01:20:17,124
he's also associate with Charlie little by the file. so there's there's many factors

768
01:20:17,124 --> 01:20:23,483
many options that these might be relevant for

769
01:20:23,483 --> 01:20:29,184
us to talk about the blood brain barrier a little bit less less um talk about it little more explicitly.

770
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:34,963
um so we know that brand needs higher amounts of food goes on oxygen. um

771
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:41,648
you know that there are about including outside of reading the Bible don't make their way

772
01:20:41,648 --> 01:20:46,668
instead. our brain um have the vessels are on the outside and the fluid

773
01:20:46,668 --> 01:20:52,188
out of passing through the room the cerebral spinal fluid and we have a very

774
01:20:52,188 --> 01:20:57,488
systems to keep unwanted materials out of our brain so we know blood

775
01:20:57,488 --> 01:21:02,628
like have a fact. our what might have a problem

776
01:21:02,628 --> 01:21:07,889
I have any universities in a very

777
01:21:07,889 --> 01:21:13,749
specific translation like.

778
01:21:13,749 --> 01:21:18,849
um. so the calories users are feeling in the brain how are aligned

779
01:21:18,849 --> 01:21:24,048
with that but feel we also have heard I. so there's not a lot of space between those

780
01:21:24,048 --> 01:21:29,869
things to sneak through him and for molecules to make their way out the capillaries.

781
01:21:29,869 --> 01:21:35,208
they have to be um permissible to pass by through the Asher site for the Asher

782
01:21:35,208 --> 01:21:40,458
site is gonna be responsible for regulating that and

783
01:21:40,458 --> 01:21:45,479
importantly there are some small molecules some live feelings molecules

784
01:21:45,479 --> 01:21:50,719
that are able to capture the membranes rights things that are uh …

785
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:56,479
Miller. we'd be happy remembering really small and this is no.

786
01:21:56,479 --> 01:22:02,339
small fool with those molecules can if I have a brain

787
01:22:02,339 --> 01:22:07,779
we take advantage of that. season so out of all the of small

788
01:22:07,779 --> 01:22:13,199
business uninhibited nicotine here in a lot um some the views

789
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:18,239
are able to bypass the system because those are kind of structure to

790
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:25,179
make their way from the bloodstream and just in the swing

791
01:22:25,179 --> 01:22:30,539
nursery real spinal fluid is the fluid that has basically needs

792
01:22:30,539 --> 01:22:35,557
out of the castle area. um so here we have an artery you're the capital

793
01:22:35,557 --> 01:22:40,977
area near the man and the fluid that we saw the capitol area and guess permitted

794
01:22:40,977 --> 01:22:46,096
to pass through by that the file else else and we have the full series

795
01:22:46,096 --> 01:22:51,477
of entry calls and the reason for a a women's

796
01:22:51,477 --> 01:22:57,396
kind of the policy. um but then there is this process where the fluid makes its way

797
01:22:57,396 --> 01:23:02,997
slowly passing through the ventricle of the makes his way back to the bloodstream hearts so there some circulation

798
01:23:02,997 --> 01:23:08,437
of liquid data loss through the through um back in the bloodstream

799
01:23:08,437 --> 01:23:15,096
those who are needing a little

800
01:23:15,096 --> 01:23:20,356
and here in purple and basically the flow of cerebral spinal fluid making

801
01:23:20,356 --> 01:23:25,457
it for the brain so it's not like there's not it's not like it's like palm banks further in

802
01:23:25,457 --> 01:23:30,537
the direction of flow that's happening in this purple fluid. 's reverse spinal fluids

803
01:23:30,537 --> 01:23:35,629
making his way on the brain kinda through the spaces and it's being held in place

804
01:23:35,629 --> 01:23:40,989
um by that uh by that water. I remembering around the screen

805
01:23:40,989 --> 01:23:46,188
through the spine and fluid um and then we see that it passes also down your not into

806
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:54,969
your file minutes also be then your spinal column.

807
01:23:54,969 --> 01:24:00,249
so what we know if you're not another alternate view of that purple cerebral spinal fluid.

808
01:24:00,249 --> 01:24:05,389
so what we noticed here is we have a system where we have something very hard

809
01:24:05,389 --> 01:24:10,949
on the outside for universal which is flexible. we had agreed to.

810
01:24:10,949 --> 01:24:16,429
we have a little. what do you think happens is we got bill. Louis

811
01:24:16,429 --> 01:24:21,449
green room go now when you have a

812
01:24:21,449 --> 01:24:28,289
build out a would like to know where to go to the front.

813
01:24:28,289 --> 01:24:33,309
okay. press to see issued to be a challenge. so what we

814
01:24:33,309 --> 01:24:38,413
do have is this kind of spongy pool space was

815
01:24:38,413 --> 01:24:43,513
able to accommodate some flexes in fluid but of course you can

816
01:24:43,513 --> 01:24:48,712
exceed that under under situations but so we've got our brain tissue we've got blood in the freezer got

817
01:24:48,712 --> 01:24:54,172
cerebral spinal fluid in the space. so we have some give in the mechanism but there's challenges

818
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:59,172
where our pressure can you get to grips and so here's what happens. if here's

819
01:24:59,172 --> 01:25:04,393
our volumes and here's the pressure. so your brain can't handle quite

820
01:25:04,393 --> 01:25:09,592
a bit of increasing fluid increasing volume before the pressure goes up but then it has the tipping

821
01:25:09,592 --> 01:25:16,712
point and your pressure gets really high in your brain and we don't have

822
01:25:16,712 --> 01:25:22,552
a hard tissue damage. so your your brand your school is able to

823
01:25:22,552 --> 01:25:27,632
compensate either. it's only options are to either decrease your brain teaser tissue decrease

824
01:25:27,632 --> 01:25:32,933
the cerebral spinal fluids decrease your blood volume and so

825
01:25:32,933 --> 01:25:38,010
in a certain point you end up with um damage and like

826
01:25:38,010 --> 01:25:45,090
uh you got changes in the shape and the structure of the.

827
01:25:45,090 --> 01:25:51,831
so long well right well I was asked him

828
01:25:51,831 --> 01:25:56,990
to be a serious life threatening situation um and increasing pressure can

829
01:25:56,990 --> 01:26:02,490
come up across the class of track brain injuries um through review compulsive injuries.

830
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:07,650
um sort of primary injuries. um I mean you do you to somebody a contusion would be like

831
01:26:07,650 --> 01:26:13,450
a bruise the skis on your brandy. um I can compound

832
01:26:13,450 --> 01:26:19,240
concussion or you might get a secondary injury so you might get um

833
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:25,880
a swelling in your brain a whole downstream fashion

834
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:35,601
going on in your body um.

835
01:26:35,601 --> 01:26:40,720
so there's for example there are various criteria I used to classify the severity

836
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:45,780
of your dramatic brain injury. beside your duration of your loss of consciousness based on your

837
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:54,940
duration of the amnesia. I'm in and and other additional assessment metrics are available.

838
01:26:54,940 --> 01:27:10,840
if you guys think it was sure Foster member does increase in your crayon pressure result in a primary brain injury.

839
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:21,658
the primary thing is secondary

840
01:27:21,658 --> 01:27:27,058
this is gonna be secondary lives the rental and the swelling in the edema

841
01:27:27,058 --> 01:27:32,058
or even just a fancy word for swelling. um salon everything is well and I'm then I get

842
01:27:32,058 --> 01:27:39,518
the impression that

843
01:27:39,518 --> 01:27:45,138
I'm at a particular example when your breathing is the schooling and

844
01:27:45,138 --> 01:27:50,558
this is a situation where you're getting a collection of blood vessels. um

845
01:27:50,558 --> 01:27:56,317
this is not optimal. so there are classifications

846
01:27:56,317 --> 01:28:01,438
of human trauma based on the location of the blood accumulation

847
01:28:01,438 --> 01:28:06,737
free I haven't been I've been dear else. so in artery supplying them and injuries that

848
01:28:06,737 --> 01:28:11,998
might have specific phenotype. if that happens in the dry area. um this

849
01:28:11,998 --> 01:28:17,254
might be more of a slow onset and more difficult to identify

850
01:28:17,254 --> 01:28:22,694
the might not have that excuse if you know type and here examples where you can look and see

851
01:28:22,694 --> 01:28:28,313
evidence of the brain bleed in various areas of the brain

852
01:28:28,313 --> 01:28:33,514
can help with the diagnosing and treatment for those areas. alright so those

853
01:28:33,514 --> 01:28:38,794
that. I brief overview of the blood supply a lot of room as well as only

854
01:28:38,794 --> 01:28:45,014
gets this remote spinal fluid which is providing um a a lot of food and nutrients and

855
01:28:45,014 --> 01:28:50,914
oxygen food package. what happens

856
01:28:50,914 --> 01:29:02,374
um when that's disruptive to get things like strokes we get things like swelling in the brain injuries.

857
01:29:02,374 --> 01:29:12,874
alright talk about the road development.

858
01:29:12,874 --> 01:29:18,476
so this is where we all come from. we were into. I won't bite

859
01:29:18,476 --> 01:29:23,655
such embryonic stage twenty one. we were just a little too blood vessels

860
01:29:23,655 --> 01:29:29,135
had and then we started a along a day twenty two

861
01:29:29,135 --> 01:29:34,275
and then between reality of twenty seven and twenty eight. so this is before women

862
01:29:34,275 --> 01:29:39,315
most women even are aware they're pregnant on the to close. okay and where are

863
01:29:39,315 --> 01:29:44,575
we wanna have one of your

864
01:29:44,575 --> 01:29:51,396
readers and people um

865
01:29:51,396 --> 01:29:56,416
and so that we know exactly when during development this occurs.

866
01:29:56,416 --> 01:30:01,416
I mean here's another view of it. so that cube is actually kind of curvy here is

867
01:30:01,416 --> 01:30:06,635
gonna go on to become our brain we can review this big fluffy pardon and we are for rain here

868
01:30:06,635 --> 01:30:11,735
is gonna be our membrane here is gonna be hired to bring in here from your spinal cord and we want that to to

869
01:30:11,735 --> 01:30:16,738
close sooner on to

870
01:30:16,738 --> 01:30:22,158
be back. our a public health towns worldwide. um

871
01:30:22,158 --> 01:30:27,238
and as a result our US Centers for Disease Control. um instituted

872
01:30:27,238 --> 01:30:32,357
a um a sort of education system. commercials and

873
01:30:32,357 --> 01:30:37,678
system um to help people maintain a

874
01:30:37,678 --> 01:30:43,138
full guy needs dealing because with they observe that people are much less likely

875
01:30:43,138 --> 01:30:48,698
to have one of these abnormal closures and if they have adequate so look after

876
01:30:48,698 --> 01:30:53,778
him so now everybody receives for like I said in our food supply. um in

877
01:30:53,778 --> 01:30:58,917
an attempt to prevent the use of a European defect

878
01:30:58,917 --> 01:31:03,978
because uh was it found that that would be a more effective strategy rather than trying

879
01:31:03,978 --> 01:31:09,058
someone for the news or from it. so here is uh here in

880
01:31:09,058 --> 01:31:14,198
the strategy where everyone is giving to look outside there's a lot of heterogeneity across

881
01:31:14,198 --> 01:31:19,246
countries and um the implementation of this for example many European countries do

882
01:31:19,246 --> 01:31:24,505
not include forecasted for education but this was seen as

883
01:31:24,505 --> 01:31:32,025
effective an public health a mission where

884
01:31:32,025 --> 01:31:38,885
you are usually

885
01:31:38,885 --> 01:31:43,905
but you might ask what are some other downstream health effects as a result of this. 's

886
01:31:43,905 --> 01:31:48,965
Ford fusion strategies. we're kind of experiencing now in a population scale you guys might have questions

887
01:31:48,965 --> 01:31:53,985
about that but so beyond that. I don't have to promise um

888
01:31:53,985 --> 01:31:59,025
I also have some really mean there. uh this is like

889
01:31:59,025 --> 01:32:04,286
happening in money so in the third trimester of pregnancy. a baby is growing twelve

890
01:32:04,286 --> 01:32:09,666
thousand new on the person is which astounding agree.

891
01:32:09,666 --> 01:32:16,146
I think I'd really rather have around television. um you know early movie.

892
01:32:16,146 --> 01:32:22,047
um but he was always over how um

893
01:32:22,047 --> 01:32:28,887
what are then the online

894
01:32:28,887 --> 01:32:33,967
connections between movies are sold

895
01:32:33,967 --> 01:32:39,527
already but they're forming new connections to these connection

896
01:32:39,527 --> 01:32:44,567
uh I mean he grew. and making all kinds

897
01:32:44,567 --> 01:32:49,647
of new connections between the existing and by age twenty we have over a hundred

898
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:55,001
billion neurons and each of those have between ten and

899
01:32:55,001 --> 01:33:00,321
a hundred thousand connection. so we here I was talking to many other things

900
01:33:00,321 --> 01:33:05,921
really intimate connection happening between the rooms

901
01:33:05,921 --> 01:33:11,042
and this. disposal you know. and early development. um

902
01:33:11,042 --> 01:33:16,122
your body goes through those are the main news not read through the

903
01:33:16,122 --> 01:33:22,321
way was it a

904
01:33:22,321 --> 01:33:27,341
great thing

905
01:33:27,341 --> 01:33:32,682
you know you goes away. so it's kind of creating on

906
01:33:32,682 --> 01:33:38,262
communication strategy between the different rooms by age twenty. we talk about how

907
01:33:38,262 --> 01:33:43,441
how much space we have so you might have um over a hundred and so on.

908
01:33:43,441 --> 01:33:48,521
um you know seem out there and just reflecting how

909
01:33:48,521 --> 01:33:54,035
to find

910
01:33:54,035 --> 01:33:59,155
really quite quite a sounding number of neurons number of connections between neurons

911
01:33:59,155 --> 01:34:04,314
and links of nine and so we we talk about

912
01:34:04,314 --> 01:34:09,455
how in that early days twenty eight. your neural

913
01:34:09,455 --> 01:34:14,495
tube is closing. there's also um I don't know where different

914
01:34:14,495 --> 01:34:21,055
features.

915
01:34:21,055 --> 01:34:27,354
where do have a.

916
01:34:27,354 --> 01:34:33,155
I don't here recently they don't stating what the original

917
01:34:33,155 --> 01:34:38,274
my around three. um we also have sent half the genesis of this is where

918
01:34:38,274 --> 01:34:43,415
it's creating new connections between neurons we see Cleo Janice this is where it's creating

919
01:34:43,415 --> 01:34:48,595
a support cells and then we see my own nation happens different. I do differently your

920
01:34:48,595 --> 01:34:53,648
time and then the pruning happens later so you can um kind of

921
01:34:53,648 --> 01:34:59,828
pinpoint where the development motor

922
01:34:59,828 --> 01:35:05,068
media disorder. one of these major league

923
01:35:05,068 --> 01:35:10,068
teams and we noticed that a lot of the stuff.

924
01:35:10,068 --> 01:35:15,309
so we know it's our time scale speeds way off out here you were getting week by week and now we go jump

925
01:35:15,309 --> 01:35:21,588
all the way worked from birth to adolescence to adulthood so a lot of these features are still continuing

926
01:35:21,588 --> 01:35:27,128
and we also see a quote to are more on the cognitive psychology

927
01:35:27,128 --> 01:35:32,628
side. they've noticed that there are observable skills acquisition acquisitions icon

928
01:35:32,628 --> 01:35:38,668
so there's not just um on the physiology side where we do the cellular changes there's also

929
01:35:38,668 --> 01:35:43,928
I'm dreaming and we have the skills development so we pick up a lot of hearing in touch and vision

930
01:35:43,928 --> 01:35:49,249
for sensory skills early and then our language skills and that are high order commission skills

931
01:35:49,249 --> 01:35:58,205
kind of come later. so there's a lot of

932
01:35:58,205 --> 01:36:03,424
I was here are some of the narrative about mental disorders. we recently

933
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:08,424
switched from classification sheet diagnostic and statistical manual

934
01:36:08,424 --> 01:36:13,625
version four two versions five and so

935
01:36:13,625 --> 01:36:18,884
you notice that we are still I think in a hill regarding Iraq.

936
01:36:18,884 --> 01:36:24,424
I am

937
01:36:24,424 --> 01:36:29,625
a clear cut. if got one thing you know what I got a whole bunch of disorders

938
01:36:29,625 --> 01:36:34,625
got him lunch under a chosen spectrum disorder diagnosis.

939
01:36:34,625 --> 01:36:39,765
seating views are not considered separate and distinct anymore either

940
01:36:39,765 --> 01:36:45,044
under a broader umbrella changed our language and update it

941
01:36:45,044 --> 01:36:50,205
for a lot of your developmental disorders

942
01:36:50,205 --> 01:36:56,070
and uh I I'm involved in some recent fraud look out consumer

943
01:36:56,070 --> 01:37:01,190
this is one of a nerd about mental disorder and highly heterogeneous and scared drive like I

944
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:06,291
said in your social and communication ability as well as restrictive and repetitive behaviors.

945
01:37:06,291 --> 01:37:12,010
we see it also is often so morbid with a whole bunch of condition such as sleep disturbances

946
01:37:12,010 --> 01:37:17,351
such as gastrointestinal. so so it seems to convert a lot of

947
01:37:17,351 --> 01:37:22,391
additional challenges and we see that it up in the spectrum disorder arises with a real

948
01:37:22,391 --> 01:37:27,650
range of symptoms as well as a real range of severity. okay. so

949
01:37:27,650 --> 01:37:33,311
there is not one to them. there's many many options

950
01:37:33,311 --> 01:37:38,730
and here is the interesting image. um. uh and ask on a

951
01:37:38,730 --> 01:37:44,030
child who is in her typical and last child with absolute spectrum disorder

952
01:37:44,030 --> 01:37:49,187
on the right and each one of these little nodules is the Cena and one

953
01:37:49,187 --> 01:37:54,687
thing that's been noted a few times is that in um children audible spectrum disorder.

954
01:37:54,687 --> 01:38:00,247
they established those initials and I was just fine and they have a lot of

955
01:38:00,247 --> 01:38:06,207
running away. so there's also information

956
01:38:06,207 --> 01:38:11,566
and form. I know the city auditorium.

957
01:38:11,566 --> 01:38:20,187
you know I do realize that you are

958
01:38:20,187 --> 01:38:26,887
experiencing access their own all the stimulation.

959
01:38:26,887 --> 01:38:32,066
I'm here some epidemiologic data top on of the spectrum disorder this is connected

960
01:38:32,066 --> 01:38:37,167
through the Adam network. it's not a network uh investigators around the country

961
01:38:37,167 --> 01:38:42,447
and that go into um public schools and survey all the kids easy

962
01:38:42,447 --> 01:38:47,546
so we have these reliable estimates of problem specific Crawford years. I'm

963
01:38:47,546 --> 01:38:52,772
on the eight -year-olds and what we notice I've got time we were up

964
01:38:52,772 --> 01:38:57,873
to a problem us with a good one and sixty eight. I'm now I think we're up to one in forty

965
01:38:57,873 --> 01:39:03,092
nine foot so we have um surveillance. uh techniques

966
01:39:03,092 --> 01:39:08,712
that are available to look at um changes in diagnostic

967
01:39:08,712 --> 01:39:17,373
patterns over time to look at susceptible populations as well.

968
01:39:17,373 --> 01:39:22,933
we talked about and some of the ways and measure neurologic disorders on that screen

969
01:39:22,933 --> 01:39:27,953
are really useful. this one particular screen for is called and chat. it's

970
01:39:27,953 --> 01:39:33,583
a parental administered screener. you can see the whole thing here. it's only twenty question

971
01:39:33,583 --> 01:39:39,762
uh-huh who's minister over the songs you. um when they're trying to make

972
01:39:39,762 --> 01:39:44,822
a a little little special soon um both

973
01:39:44,822 --> 01:39:49,962
of these questions apparently be able to answer and say yes or no does

974
01:39:49,962 --> 01:39:54,962
your child child try to copy what you do do if you turn your head to look at something

975
01:39:54,962 --> 01:40:00,083
that your child look around and see what you're looking at um so these are these kind of validated files.

976
01:40:00,083 --> 01:40:06,782
you have uh you know I was

977
01:40:06,782 --> 01:40:13,382
um

978
01:40:13,382 --> 01:40:18,942
one thing I notice and um when I first moved to Michigan and when I started working the field in Michigan.

979
01:40:18,942 --> 01:40:24,402
are. so these these Amtrak can be conducted by parents anywhere

980
01:40:24,402 --> 01:40:33,522
but there's only specific locations that are waiting for formal

981
01:40:33,522 --> 01:40:38,592
wear uh and uh I thought

982
01:40:38,592 --> 01:40:44,052
I'd thought time I think I did look at the start of class last year they're only twenty eight locations

983
01:40:44,052 --> 01:40:49,752
in Michigan you guys see any in the upper peninsula even

984
01:40:49,752 --> 01:40:54,832
know who some real regional challenges out to one of

985
01:40:54,832 --> 01:40:59,952
these uh clinics which validated is to perform the sunny here in Ann Arbor

986
01:40:59,952 --> 01:41:05,152
we have three. just in our town alone. so that's a good thing although the wait time

987
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:10,212
can still get quite trying here. um so what do you like see. talk to your neighbors

988
01:41:10,212 --> 01:41:15,272
for minute a and think about what do you think there's some implication if a family and their

989
01:41:15,272 --> 01:41:20,272
commission have to wait two years until the initial diagnostic than that and what do

990
01:41:20,272 --> 01:41:25,612
you expect there to be difference in outcomes for kids I know I read through your marks versus

991
01:41:25,612 --> 01:41:31,052
those that they get flagged

992
01:41:31,052 --> 01:41:36,152
maybe like your mom and us and talk to your neighbors about this access to

993
01:41:36,152 --> 01:42:15,090
services

994
01:42:15,090 --> 01:42:30,270
yes

995
01:42:30,270 --> 01:42:42,010
uh

996
01:42:42,010 --> 01:43:09,650
yeah right here yeah

997
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:39,414
what we're what were somehow they were the fact you to go are about

998
01:43:39,414 --> 01:43:45,333
yeah who do you admire that. he goes no

999
01:43:45,333 --> 01:43:55,253
family have

1000
01:43:55,253 --> 01:44:09,313
here um more

1001
01:44:09,313 --> 01:44:15,253
that was awful

1002
01:44:15,253 --> 01:44:20,493
lot to use a

1003
01:44:20,493 --> 01:44:27,013
minute or concerns followed either of those

1004
01:44:27,013 --> 01:44:32,113
online. you have other USAA

1005
01:44:32,113 --> 01:44:48,567
talk about the challenges you know

1006
01:44:48,567 --> 01:44:55,828
yeah mhm I have even more like here

1007
01:44:55,828 --> 01:45:04,368
immediately a you know better

1008
01:45:04,368 --> 01:45:16,027
word moving on to God I

1009
01:45:16,027 --> 01:45:21,768
trying to drive to work. so um. ultimately

1010
01:45:21,768 --> 01:45:27,027
I think yeah this is a helpful resource I doesn't to expose out to be able to

1011
01:45:27,027 --> 01:45:32,676
map and that through the throughout the throughout all that. like

1012
01:45:32,676 --> 01:45:37,736
groups have a little bit about psychiatric disorder so we're gonna you notice we're kind of moving along the age

1013
01:45:37,736 --> 01:45:42,956
spectrum. so we started with our development. we talk about psychiatric disorders we see here

1014
01:45:42,956 --> 01:45:48,596
um here in the psychiatric disorders reckon I see that um

1015
01:45:48,596 --> 01:45:54,196
through that I particular ones for investigation you if know there some overlap

1016
01:45:54,196 --> 01:45:59,196
and some are established through an early development on. but then there's also several

1017
01:45:59,196 --> 01:46:04,256
other psychiatric disorders. so I have on set home at a lesson on certain things like schizophrenia

1018
01:46:04,256 --> 01:46:09,656
and things like bipolar disorder and here some problem

1019
01:46:09,656 --> 01:46:14,688
statistics with like kinda floored me the first time I look at some of the so this is on the wire feeds

1020
01:46:14,688 --> 01:46:19,728
the prevalence percent of any mental illness among US adults in twenty

1021
01:46:19,728 --> 01:46:31,348
fourteen and what we see is the overall prevalence.

1022
01:46:31,348 --> 01:46:36,568
yes we've got a a few percent of adults in the US are experiencing one of those mental illnesses

1023
01:46:36,568 --> 01:46:41,848
on the previous page. um we noticed that there are some differences what are some differences you guys notice

1024
01:46:41,848 --> 01:46:56,388
among these different groups that are highlighted either sex and enjoy redundancies.

1025
01:46:56,388 --> 01:47:01,688
yeah was either tired or everyone. um what about her from you know versus mouth

1026
01:47:01,688 --> 01:47:06,848
and a overall individual disorder. I have set so for example I

1027
01:47:06,848 --> 01:47:11,911
don't spectrum disorder would be in about four to one um but a lot of

1028
01:47:11,911 --> 01:47:17,051
the other way around slash disorders like schizophrenia Fire

1029
01:47:17,051 --> 01:47:34,051
what's another difference books.

1030
01:47:34,051 --> 01:47:39,331
yeah this is this this group over here on not um has the highest overall level.

1031
01:47:39,331 --> 01:47:44,351
I mean also see there's a lower accident. I'm on hold it off. based on these

1032
01:47:44,351 --> 01:47:49,831
initial stages I am here specific is looking at depressive episodes

1033
01:47:49,831 --> 01:47:55,111
in the last year. um we see this about six percent of US adults and and we see

1034
01:47:55,111 --> 01:48:00,751
again or arrange an susceptibility across various groups. so different in particular.

1035
01:48:00,751 --> 01:48:06,171
I affect a lot of people. it's been a long young adults it's the

1036
01:48:06,171 --> 01:48:11,399
heaviest burden of disability and I know so do you can do an initial

1037
01:48:11,399 --> 01:48:16,519
screen online you have available um but it can be diagnosed with a physician and that

1038
01:48:16,519 --> 01:48:21,939
is defined as someone with depressive symptoms with the duration of over two weeks

1039
01:48:21,939 --> 01:48:27,439
there's all kinds of risk factors that been identified including family and personal history um experiencing

1040
01:48:27,439 --> 01:48:32,879
structures and there's various uh therapy and medications

1041
01:48:32,879 --> 01:48:38,299
available in you guys have here's a link to the University of Michigan cab service as well as

1042
01:48:38,299 --> 01:48:43,339
Megan the rule who's embedded in the school toll toll for appointments here. I mean here's the

1043
01:48:43,339 --> 01:48:48,519
pessimist among the problems of depression among medical students so surgeons that I am on

1044
01:48:48,519 --> 01:48:53,579
campus. so these really interesting study or if you can track the medical from

1045
01:48:53,579 --> 01:48:59,459
day one where they have the front of a problem um similar to the general population

1046
01:48:59,459 --> 01:49:04,539
preferred contractor schools and you might imagine it goes

1047
01:49:04,539 --> 01:49:09,539
quite a bit higher what does he see here and looking out the baby or the cross sectional your longitude

1048
01:49:09,539 --> 01:49:14,785
only that our problems are to go but we can see it's like

1049
01:49:14,785 --> 01:49:20,865
about twenty percent so it's quite a bit higher than the general population and he sees

1050
01:49:20,865 --> 01:49:26,005
that this is highest when you consider both the pre- clinical and clinical

1051
01:49:26,005 --> 01:49:31,545
time. and we found that this is true across many geographic region. so

1052
01:49:31,545 --> 01:49:39,765
I don't have a duty for grad school um burgers.

1053
01:49:39,765 --> 01:49:44,765
we encourage you guys to be compassionate to yourselves into peers.

1054
01:49:44,765 --> 01:49:49,865
I understand this is a challenging challenging environment

1055
01:49:49,865 --> 01:49:55,285
and I think it's a a lot of progress because I mean I'm trying to understand

1056
01:49:55,285 --> 01:50:00,625
what are some of that a pathological features on the line. um depressive

1057
01:50:00,625 --> 01:50:05,945
symptoms. um here for example is a highlight up here we've got our act on

1058
01:50:05,945 --> 01:50:11,155
we got our announcing previous on um here in our schools and I think

1059
01:50:11,155 --> 01:50:16,675
in on the end right and there are all kinds of

1060
01:50:16,675 --> 01:50:21,975
right but is

1061
01:50:21,975 --> 01:50:27,095
it is um looking at the action of pharmaceutical agent selective serotonin

1062
01:50:27,095 --> 01:50:32,155
we have pink and have grass SRI which works at the level

1063
01:50:32,155 --> 01:50:37,735
of the Akron. so what it does is it blocks the number on

1064
01:50:37,735 --> 01:50:42,795
from taking back its own serotonin. so we talk

1065
01:50:42,795 --> 01:50:51,895
about how that is one way and then

1066
01:50:51,895 --> 01:50:57,015
more Missus

1067
01:50:57,015 --> 01:51:02,335
you need to write some people release after used for several weeks. there's another class

1068
01:51:02,335 --> 01:51:08,075
um um a drivers which are um known as the strikes like live antidepressants

1069
01:51:08,075 --> 01:51:13,183
which work in slightly different ways and you can you have the different colors um these three are working on

1070
01:51:13,183 --> 01:51:18,363
the post synaptic non- level. so we can learn a little bit about the signal I probably

1071
01:51:18,363 --> 01:51:36,423
have here. am I understanding what I mean with

1072
01:51:36,423 --> 01:51:41,743
you that that's a lot. a surgeon really doesn't matter is associated

1073
01:51:41,743 --> 01:51:47,183
with a solution more happiness. um decisions.

1074
01:51:47,183 --> 01:51:52,303
if I him. he's anymore than other that having

1075
01:51:52,303 --> 01:52:00,743
more it's but a little bit

1076
01:52:00,743 --> 01:52:06,063
sister really and there's a lot of your individual and Saturdays from the house. this is a treatment

1077
01:52:06,063 --> 01:52:23,163
for. um. [INAUDIBLE] squared the more

1078
01:52:23,163 --> 01:52:34,103
yeah I mean certainly it is versus people.

1079
01:52:34,103 --> 01:52:39,203
so yeah this is um. we're still we know that this works

1080
01:52:39,203 --> 01:52:44,663
for some people but understanding how it works him or why do the work for all people is is

1081
01:52:44,663 --> 01:52:49,683
a really active areas of interest but knowing more about the physiology then

1082
01:52:49,683 --> 01:52:54,723
neurons in terms of which place is it working in. could help you guys design a better

1083
01:52:54,723 --> 01:53:00,203
study because you might have a more specific research questions based on understanding

1084
01:53:00,203 --> 01:53:05,303
the mechanism of action being trying to be curious about. hey what's going on in this particular

1085
01:53:05,303 --> 01:53:11,483
dream region or what's going on in this particular respect.

1086
01:53:11,483 --> 01:53:16,883
Bruce. had about three more slides from nerds nerds diseases. um but the

1087
01:53:16,883 --> 01:53:22,343
main idea there is talking about crime in the supplies and read

1088
01:53:22,343 --> 01:53:28,963
yet actually food about Carmel.

1089
01:53:28,963 --> 01:53:56,391
um I I asked a little bit you know
