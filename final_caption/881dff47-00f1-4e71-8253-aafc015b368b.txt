00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:15,860
Hi, I'm Peter Jacobsen. We're continuing on with our discussion of the health care delivery system.

2
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:22,460
And now we're going to focus in more detail on the health care delivery part of the system.

3
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:28,400
There are a number of different facilities where patients can go to be treated.

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:37,970
We can start with public hospitals. Public hospitals are the government owned and operated, has the better administration.

5
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:47,720
So what is the Indian Health Service? Public hospitals in New York City and other jurisdictions across the country.

6
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:57,900
I can remember from the heart in the last segment there are academic medical centers from the highly complex, continued supervision there.

7
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,900
But patients could also be referred to specialty facilities.

8
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,230
Remember in the last segment we talked about joint management.

9
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:15,200
So specialty facilities could be for women and children, but could also be joint venture for specialty hospitals,

10
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:23,750
where the sessions and health systems form a joint venture to provide cardiac surgery or cancer care.

11
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,410
Then there's a series of safety net clinics.

12
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:39,230
Safety net clinics are shown where people who are uninsured or underinsured can present for acute care or primary care needs.

13
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,950
And this in a variety of sources.

14
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,560
One is the Federal Qualified Health Centers or Q8.

15
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,670
What federally funded safety net providers?

16
00:01:53,030 --> 00:02:01,219
What's interesting about the F two in one area of agreement in an otherwise contentious

17
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:07,820
health policy environment between conservatives and liberals under the Affordable Care Act,

18
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:17,870
funding for F Q8 issues significantly and harms patients who may not have access to RFQ,

19
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,540
who can also present at free clinics where they don't have to pay anything.

20
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:33,860
Another form of safety net clinic in faith means clinics where the same level of care provided at the other safety net clinics,

21
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,450
but also normally some type of faith based activity.

22
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,080
In addition, patients can present at emergency department where under federal law,

23
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:52,069
the Emergency Labor and Treatment Act and TALA Hospital are required to screen

24
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:59,960
patients and treat unless they can't provide the service needed at that time.

25
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,280
Recently,

26
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:12,379
retail clinics and urgent care clinics have emerged to fill the gap where patients have had trouble getting access to their primary care provider,

27
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:25,370
their physician or nurse practitioner. Physician assistant retail clinics in particular are low cost and available in places like CVS and Walgreens.

28
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:36,830
Urgent care clinics provide a little wider range of care, and our staff usually buy for her or him, and both are in caring retail clinics.

29
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:41,390
Take insurance aside from acute care.

30
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,910
That would include the primary care we've been talking about in inpatient care,

31
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:58,610
and particularly who either are young and disabled and older toward the end of life with multiple health needs for and at nursing home,

32
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:09,230
most nursing homes are for profit and only a few very wealthy people can afford them in very expensive and long term care insurance.

33
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:20,300
Really. And fill the gap and help Medicaid actually is the primary financing agency for long term care.

34
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:33,250
To be eligible for Medicaid financing. However, patients must basically divest all of their assets for Medicaid will pay the types of nursing homes,

35
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:40,309
including the old nursing facility for those who need rehabilitation care assisted living,

36
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:46,530
for those who can live independently with some help and care centers and separate

37
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:54,080
rehabilitation facilities to use a rehab facility and to be covered by Medicare,

38
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:01,010
you must stay in the hospital for three days and then be referred to the rehab facility.

39
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:12,710
If you're eligible for Medicare, then the Medicare would pay up to 100 days of rehabilitation care for patients who are current from an inpatient,

40
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:19,580
somebody who still need what we call post-acute care that is ongoing care after discharge.

41
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:24,920
There are a couple of ways they can get it. Depending on how serious the care is.

42
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:38,390
They could go to a rehab facility known as a skilled nursing facility, or they can be treated through outpatient, physical and occupational therapy.

43
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:45,890
In some cases, medical services would be provided and durable medical equipment.

44
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:55,309
What's notable about post-acute care is that it's generally part of the monthly

45
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:01,790
payment for a managed care organization and part of your insurance coverage.

46
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:11,030
Under commercial care. You can also be eligible for home health care depending on your acute care needs.

47
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:20,210
One of the advantages of home health is that it allows patients to return home and get the care

48
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:28,520
they need and not to spend that much time in either a skilled nursing facility or the hospital.

49
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,590
And the idea is to provide care at the lowest possible level.

50
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,330
And that would be in the home. Intimacy.

51
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:44,540
Another part of the structure that deals with end of life care in a hospice.

52
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:52,670
Hospice care specifically for terminally ill patients in the last six months of life.

53
00:06:53,450 --> 00:07:05,120
In contrast to all of the above facilities where treatment is provided, the idea is to provide minimal treatment and maximal pain management.

54
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:15,710
The idea is to keep people out of pain as much as possible when there is no more medical intervention, that is advisable.

55
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,110
A lot of it is built around emotional and spiritual support.

56
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:30,820
Many families find that hospice care really helps them manage the end of life for one of their loved ones.

57
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,950
Let's turn now to look more in depth at the medical care workforce.

58
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:45,800
We can divide the workforce into two broad segments one physicians and the other non-physician practitioners.

59
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:56,389
Let's start with primary care physician. Primary care physicians are the point of entry into the system where you can have your

60
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:03,790
yearly physical or if you have a medical problem that you need to have diagnosed.

61
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,590
How you're fatigued. You present with your primary care physician.

62
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:15,250
In your primary care physician detect and things that require more specialized care.

63
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:25,310
He or she can refer you to a specialist, actually a cardiologist or an oncologist for cancer or a neurologist.

64
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:36,830
But there are also subspecialists. For example, some surgeons only specialize in surgery on hand, some only on fingers.

65
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,550
Other, more broadly, can be transplant surgeon.

66
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,260
Many have banded together in multi-specialty groups where you can have an array of

67
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:55,460
specialists contracting with the health system to provide all in the systems specialty care.

68
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:04,220
I mentioned before you can have independent practice associations that tend to be groups of primary care practitioners.

69
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:15,080
One trend that we see in that physicians are increasingly employees in in a house or some or in a hospital.

70
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:22,579
A major trend from 30 or 40 years ago where most physicians who are independent contractors

71
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:28,460
and have small practices are getting harder and harder to compete in the marketplace.

72
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:38,059
Unless you belong to a larger group affiliated with or employed by a certain medical care organization

73
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:46,670
like Kaiser Permanente have long employed their own surgeon who bought into the concept of managed care.

74
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:56,840
Preventive care, but increasingly large of health systems outside of Medicare are following that same model.

75
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,660
On the non-physician practitioner side, we have a number of different groups.

76
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:09,920
I first have nurses who provide all sorts of care in both acute and non acute,

77
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:24,110
having nurse practitioners on Henley nurses with higher level degrees and and tend to be holistic in how they provide care and treat patients.

78
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,310
Also,

79
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:37,670
another group similar to inpatient would be an assessment physician assistants who are trained and surgeons and tend to provide more technical care.

80
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,210
So carrying wound care, things of that nature.

81
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:46,940
But in many organizations, NPS and PR sort of substitutes for one another,

82
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:55,130
and both are quite capable of meeting most primary care needs that patients have and an organization.

83
00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:02,900
And some people will have their own panel of patients and their non practitioners include

84
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:13,240
nurse and that that was in all interests and midwives who were in in the birthing process.
