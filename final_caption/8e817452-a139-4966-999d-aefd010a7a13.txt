1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:09,750
Good afternoon, everyone. Today we're going to have Dominique lecture today for us, and she's going to be talking about racism in health.

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,010
So I'm going to turn it over to her and I'm just going to take a backseat.

3
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,219
Hi, everyone. Oh, yeah.

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:30,660
We're going to get started with racism today and I'll cover what is racism if you look at the history of racism.

5
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:43,350
And that, of course, is all about the models and interventions, and then we'll do an activity where I think we should.

6
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,640
So what is racism? So you're reading for this week.

7
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,110
The you know,

8
00:00:52,140 --> 00:01:00,810
these article discusses that there are a number of different ways that you can define racism and they typically fit into a few different categories.

9
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:09,750
One way that you can define racism is by focusing on the detrimental effects of racism, especially for nonwhite groups.

10
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:17,850
So Kennedy et al in 1997 defined racism as involving harmful integrating beliefs and actions strengthened

11
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:24,030
implemented by both institutions and individuals as linked to their membership in racially defined groups.

12
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:37,530
Another way is by highlighting privileges and also presence experienced through racism or widespread oppression of racism and guilty in 2011.

13
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:47,970
Added to the Kennedy definition in the meaning of the definition, he stated, Racism can be defined as an oppressive system of racial relations,

14
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:56,610
justified by ideology on which one will benefit by dominating another and defined self in others through this domination.

15
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,630
And then they act on the definition that I just mentioned.

16
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:08,220
Some definitions highlight the ideas of inferiority and superiority of racial groups or both.

17
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:16,950
I mean, in 1999 defined racism where any kind of action or attitude, individual or institution,

18
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:24,210
always describes it legitimizes a minority group as by automatically or culturally inferior forms.

19
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,760
The other way that people define racism is by actually defining the different levels of racism,

20
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,660
which you're reading, discuss, and we'll discuss that in a little bit.

21
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:47,670
And then lastly, some definitions simply just highlight that there are differential treatment of race by different people.

22
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,110
And this is more so along the lines of racial discrimination,

23
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:59,220
which is defined by James Jackson as the process by which a man or a member or members of a social,

24
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,010
socially defined group is or are treated differently because in his or her membership to that group.

25
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,990
So in your reading by David Williams,

26
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:20,530
he defines racism as an organized social system in which the dominant racial group is an ideology and they are already categorized in race,

27
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:29,760
people into social groups, car races and uses powers to devalue disempowered differentially, differentially allocate value to society.

28
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,720
Research causes an African to be defined as inferior.

29
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,980
And this group, this definition actually covers some of the different those different buckets that I just mentioned.

30
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,060
And in your reading, he also breaks down the levels of racism.

31
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,910
And there are many different ways that people can find different levels of racism.

32
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:08,549
But for Williams, he covers three primary levels, and it really just depends on the expert that you're speaking to.

33
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:20,220
So Dr. Williams discusses structural, cultural and interpersonal racism and using institutional and structural racism interchangeably,

34
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:28,319
while others may separate those two levels of racism and give them different definitions before this time,

35
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:36,390
which is go with how he is giving definition and he defined is institutional racism as the process of racism,

36
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,180
the processes of racism that are embedded in the laws, policies,

37
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:48,600
practices of society that provide advantages to racial groups deemed as superior by differentially oppressing,

38
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,100
advantaging or otherwise neglecting racial is viewed as inferior.

39
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,900
So as we're thinking about structural or institutional racism, can anyone describe in.

40
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,150
Example of sexual or institutional racism.

41
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:19,330
Oh. The zoning that they used to do for the housing areas.

42
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:27,540
Yeah. There's funding for the whole being based on like the tax, the tax like level of that neighborhood.

43
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:34,890
So yeah, those are basically some examples that I would have given as well,

44
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:42,239
which zoning can often be related to racial residential segregation and there's concentrated poverty.

45
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:50,880
So that plays into taxes and how that's allocated to education and other other things and resources that people can use to benefit their health.

46
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:57,690
Also, disproportionate unemployment rates and even like build infrastructure in nonwhite communities.

47
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,390
And there are many more examples, but those are just a few.

48
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:08,670
And then Williams then defines cultural racism as the installation of the ideology of inferiority in values,

49
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,860
language, imagery, symbols, and stated assumptions of the larger society.

50
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:23,490
So cultural racism is important because it can both reinforce structural racism by driving the policies that we see that leads

51
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:30,150
to the creation and maintenance of structures and allocate different resources and opportunities differentially by race.

52
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:40,140
But it can also lead to individual level racism in the form of discrimination or unconscious bias or even bias towards members of other races.

53
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,500
Can anyone think of a possible example of cultural racism?

54
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:58,120
So cultural expressions by yourself are very strong cultural expressions by minorities.

55
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,600
Great thing. Do you guys like inferior or like low quality?

56
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:11,770
Yeah. Yeah. So like the stereotypes that we have, the images that we see in media that just overall society views as culture.

57
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,730
But it may. It may be wrong or just may be an overgeneralization.

58
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:25,990
So like like he just mentioned, some examples can include like a misrepresentation of non-Western or nonwhite communities in cultures,

59
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:32,920
their values, whether it's in media, institutions, stereotypical norms, just overall within society.

60
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:38,739
Another example would be like implicit bias in the hiring process of coming across

61
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:44,470
a resumé that has an ethnic name and just bypassing it for something else.

62
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:55,560
And then lastly, interpersonal racism is also known as individual level racism and happens to an individual person.

63
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:00,160
Orbitz or like with an interaction between two or more people and this thing

64
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,290
takes place one in the forms of screen scoring acts against people of color.

65
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,050
So in your reading, he discussed that there are two forms of interpersonal discrimination.

66
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:18,850
One being where individuals in larger institutions, intentionally or unintentionally treat refugees differently,

67
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,520
resulting in inequitable allocation of resources and opportunities by race and ethnicity.

68
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,450
And this may often be referred to as major discrimination.

69
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:37,810
And examples of this will be like excessive denial of bank loans that are racially motivated,

70
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:45,339
job promotions, where two different people of different races of culture,

71
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,229
they may be doing the same level work,

72
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:56,860
but a certain group is more privileged in another decreased risk and maybe like racially minor minority concentrated areas and more.

73
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:04,569
The other form of discrimination is like self-reported discrimination where individuals

74
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:09,820
are aware of like the discrimination that is happening to them and it causes stress.

75
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,030
And this can be thought of as everyday discrimination.

76
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:21,790
So this involves the chronic, everyday occurrences such as being followed in store microaggressions or just being treated less courteously.

77
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:30,070
And both your Williams and your Paradise article discuss that discrimination.

78
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:38,050
Poor individual level racism is one of the most commonly forms of racism that is study.

79
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:52,090
But the parents article also discusses the structural racism is more commonly becoming a study in health and in health behaviors as well.

80
00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:02,980
So now we move on to how do we intervene on racism and was that start with individual level or interpersonal?

81
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:18,129
So typically people adapt theories and frameworks of interest by incorporating or incorporating racist theories to interrogate race or racism in

82
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:26,350
their models and interventions is typically the theory that they're adopting is maybe race neutral or just uses race as a modifiable variables,

83
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:33,040
not modifiable. Like you can change your risk modifiable and you can move around in your model.

84
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:41,290
So one common theory that many public health scholars love to incorporate in their work is critical race theory,

85
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:52,150
which you've probably heard a lot about in popular culture media these days, but it's actually a legal essential in legal studies.

86
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,890
And it was coined by Dr. Kimberlé Crenshaw.

87
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,240
In her legal work and stems from work with their bill.

88
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,190
But it involves interrogating the role of race and racism in society.

89
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:15,600
So there are key tenants that most scholars focus on that Kimberlé Crenshaw elevates in critical race

90
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,000
theory that people may apply to their work or to their interventions or to those research studies.

91
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:28,320
So first is the recognition that while race is not biologically real, it is socially constructed, is socially significant.

92
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:37,500
The second tenant is also analogy that racism is a normal feature of society and is embedded within our system in our institutions.

93
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:47,610
It's not just something that is abnormal or just happens a one off instance, but is continually manifested in our society.

94
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,990
And that happens through systemic and structural racism.

95
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,400
It also rejects claims of meritocracy or colorblindness.

96
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:00,090
And then lastly, one of the four keys in it.

97
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,679
It also recognizes the importance of bringing in people's everyday lives into scholarship,

98
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,440
in and challenges notions of objectivity that embraces the lived experiences of people,

99
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:22,439
people of color, including preserving like storytelling and even life policy to work,

100
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,880
getting that rich firsthand experience of the lives of people of color.

101
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:40,110
So I imagine critical race theory is commonly adapted and applied to many areas of scholarship, one being public health.

102
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:52,889
And in one example, Dr. Chanda Ford from UCLA adapts the Anderson access to care model and includes elements of critical race theory

103
00:12:52,890 --> 00:13:00,240
in order to address whether racism related factors were barriers to African-Americans obtaining HIV testing.

104
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,710
In this case, she said, the Anderson model of care,

105
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:17,700
which isn't a simple model that you may use for help and she finds upon intake tailored to her target population.

106
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:25,290
And you can see that in the way that she shifts some of the constraints that are mentioned in the Anderson model.

107
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:38,110
For instance, you may see that her exact external environments back now contains structural factors like segregation, poverty, unemployment.

108
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:43,470
And she does the same thing with the predisposing factors enabling families in need factors.

109
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:51,840
However, when it comes to predisposing factors, she specifically names perceived racism as a predisposing factor.

110
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:58,229
And here we see that she is this visualizing that she is interested in whether

111
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:03,870
perceived racism contributes to HIV testing when controlling poor patient satisfaction.

112
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,390
And so rather than adding race into her models, one might use,

113
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:22,800
as one might do with the Anderson model as a good demographic feature for other predisposing factors in her application of critical race theory.

114
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:30,960
Taking the belief of that since she that racism is embedded in structural and a normal part of society,

115
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:42,000
she then applies this specifically besides to apply the race of her target population only to her research.

116
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,870
So she removes race as a modifiable factor. But.

117
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,410
Allows her research to only focus on African-Americans.

118
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,070
And in this, it's aiding in the framing of her research,

119
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:04,410
shifting the focus of how black race may influence HIV testing but skew more so

120
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,550
how the racialized experiences of black Americans may influence HIV testing is.

121
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:20,580
Similarly, Dr. Ryan Anderson and Howard Stevenson also adapted the trans transactional models.

122
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,910
Jason Cummings and Sheila I learned about in this class,

123
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:30,510
and they incorporated the concept of racial socialization for the format formation

124
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:35,999
of their recast and conceptual framework and recasting for racial encounter,

125
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,990
coping appraisal and socialization theory.

126
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:47,340
And this theory serves as the backdrop for the intervention in which they provide a five week racial socialization,

127
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:53,730
intervention to parents and adolescents experiencing direct or vicarious racial strength and trauma.

128
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:05,520
And in this adaptation, their exposure to direct discriminatory racial encounters is named as their primary appraisal.

129
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,830
In this model, I like the perception of the threat.

130
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:16,950
Then they identify that the secondary appraisal as then identify the secondary appraisal as a parent

131
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:24,660
or child child's so kazi of coping with this discriminatory racial encounter or the racial threat.

132
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:32,070
They then add elements of racialized racial socialization as their moderating factors.

133
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:41,460
Essentially, one's ability to perceive racial stress coupled with knowledge, skills and competence to handle racial stress.

134
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:48,480
And they're essentially saying that that all matters in relation to how someone copes with a racially stressful event.

135
00:16:53,220 --> 00:17:00,000
So while there are no interventions per say that explicitly impact health on a cultural level,

136
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,470
like we're not doing cultural level racial interventions in public health,

137
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:12,600
there are shifts in culture happening, happening every day all around us and media that can help us to intervene on racism on a comfortable level.

138
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:19,370
Can anyone think of any examples that may be happening currently or have happened since?

139
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:27,780
Yes. Is it like having, like, Ariel not be a white person?

140
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:35,400
I feel like that's one way is like just having, like, figures be played by somebody of color.

141
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,960
It's crazy. Yeah. Yeah.

142
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:47,670
And we've seen that as well in I think I don't watch this back and watching Game of Thrones and like the new show Incorporated more people of color.

143
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,440
There was a big uproar when it came to Star Wars as well.

144
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:55,410
So, yeah, it's a good example. Any other examples?

145
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:06,000
I think of some different states implementing I'm sorry, I can think of like some different states implementing like the crown,

146
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,290
like under like anti-discrimination or gender discriminatory laws.

147
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:16,620
Yeah, that's true. Yes, I had a series, but I didn't have that.

148
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,639
So that that's a good, good example. Yeah.

149
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:29,850
What's the little what is the crown. The Crown Act is like a discriminatory policy to get to prevent like people from discriminating against

150
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:36,690
like natural protectors or African texters within like different professional settings in the schools.

151
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:43,830
So yeah, so that's a great example. Another great example is Ariel.

152
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:51,270
Another example which I thought had a lot of implications for public health is the show on Netflix?

153
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:59,909
Mo I don't know anyone who's watched that, but he goes through a lot of things that are related to public health.

154
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:08,310
He's an undocumented refugee, so. So you guys have a refugee population for your group projects.

155
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:16,440
He faces many challenges, including access to care, such as getting shot at a grocery store and being undocumented.

156
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:27,569
He's not able to go to the hospital. So what does he do? He goes to his friend who's a tattoo artist, and that is not good, you know, for health.

157
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:32,970
But that is one that's a fictional depiction of everyday life poor.

158
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,400
I'm not saying that this happens in real life,

159
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:45,420
but it could possibly happen the things that impact our health because of structural and cultural racism.

160
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:56,939
And I think a lot of times the cultural level examples are showing us the ways that there's intersectionality that is exist existing.

161
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:02,820
There are a number of health consequences to racism and all that stuff.

162
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:16,230
Another example may be like uber skinny, which I'm sure you guys have heard of anti-racism, these books, talking about anti-racist baby.

163
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:27,089
So not only are we thinking about ourselves and interrogating our own beliefs and our own biases about racism, race and racism,

164
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:33,330
whether we're a person of color ourselves, but we're also thinking about how we're raising our children in the next generation.

165
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:41,639
In culturally speaking, this is in a cultural like in a book.

166
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:51,030
So in the media this is a cultural example that is influence public health because the US sorry,

167
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:57,299
the Center for Social Policy has even adapted the social ecological model,

168
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:07,050
which is something that you'll be learning about soon, but it is that it adapts the social, ecological model and applied aspects of anti-racism.

169
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:13,710
So think about how we can intervene on each level in an anti-racist manner.

170
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,490
So another one of your readings is by Bayley in all,

171
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:36,030
and it defines structural racism as the total potency of ways in which societies foster racism discrimination through mutually reinforcing systems.

172
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:48,780
So these systems would be housing, education, health care access, quality employment, earnings, benefits, credit, criminal justice, etc.

173
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:57,370
So. For instance, you can see you can try to follow the areas impossible.

174
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:04,870
But for instance, a family's housing situation may ask you, is there an educational environment, environment for the children,

175
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:13,030
which then may influence exposure to the criminal to the criminal legal system in their adult life or adolescence,

176
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:23,950
if you like, which then has bearings on what type of benefits you are afforded by society and and employment that you have access to.

177
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:30,370
Employment did determines one's earning potential in health care access,

178
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:36,250
which most times because you obtain health insurance from your job or your parent's job.

179
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:46,360
Yeah, that's because. And then employment also impacts credit, which then determines what kind of housing you're gonna have access to.

180
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,370
So we're right back at square one and we see that each system is connected to one another.

181
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:59,170
So oftentimes it may be difficult for the general public to understand how racism relates to [INAUDIBLE],

182
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,840
especially when it comes to structural racism.

183
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:10,930
But there are many ways in pathways between structural racism and health, as you've seen in your daily article.

184
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:22,700
So some pathways can include economic and social deprivations and how that links to how can anyone think of an example of how that may sound?

185
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:39,439
Yeah. Well, the economic aspect is like your physical health, like being able to afford to go to the doctor's office,

186
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:47,899
to whatever services you need, then socially it's not good for your mental health to have isolation or to like structural racism.

187
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:53,540
If there are certain races being kind of segregated off into a not so safe area,

188
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:57,170
it's not good for your stress response to constantly be activated like that.

189
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:07,550
Yeah. Yeah. So how does residential segregation or any type of segregation, how does that impact our health and our stress and our mental health?

190
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:17,090
Also, how do jobs how does that give us access to health care or is that a barrier to health care?

191
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:24,300
There's plenty of barriers to health care, as we see in this class, your self efficacy, your motivation, all that.

192
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:34,870
But there are structural barriers that are at play even before we get the gumption to get up and make that decision to go to the doctor.

193
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:42,799
And then there are environmental and occupational health inequities that can link

194
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:49,520
between structural racism and health that I'm sure people can think of examples.

195
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:59,510
But those may be in air pollution and asthma rates and even chemicals which are concentrated animal feeding operations.

196
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:05,509
They've been found to be located in a lot of times in South Texas schools.

197
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,640
And then the children are experiencing.

198
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:19,329
Or asthma or any other diseases, some different kinds of health outcomes as a result of that, also governmental failure.

199
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:24,940
So we've seen here in Michigan the Flint water crisis, but they're still going on like in Jackson, Mississippi.

200
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:37,300
And that kind of talk talk about the psychosocial trauma, but that mental health stress, even of being in a residential segregated area,

201
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:44,620
but also there are racial discrimination, as you've talked about, microaggressions, there's even racist media.

202
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,400
Yeah. And then some other examples of pathways for speech.

203
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,800
Structural racism include inadequate health care or access to health care,

204
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:09,550
state sanctioned violence and alienation from property and traditional lands such as police violence,

205
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:17,589
force over renewal, genocide, and forced removal of indigenous communities, and then political exclusion.

206
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:21,579
So example would be like restricting voter access.

207
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:26,620
So like former felons, again, once they are out of prison,

208
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:34,479
they cannot vote even for matters that relate to their own life and then mount an active coping behavior.

209
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:44,080
We know a lot of times marginalized and racialized groups have increased tobacco and alcohol consumption.

210
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:52,360
There are also times where they can be targeted in the ads and all of a sudden in the areas that they live in as well.

211
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,530
So this can contribute to maladaptive coping makers.

212
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,340
And then stereotype threat. So. Stigmas of inferiority.

213
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:13,110
Physiological arousal. When you have a patient in doctor experience, you're scared that you're going to be stereotypes.

214
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:26,120
Of course that's a barrier. So you're. So some examples of how people have intervened on the structural level.

215
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:38,510
Two examples where the Moving to Opportunity Research program and it's also realizing that in New York City, low income housing boundaries,

216
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:47,780
where low income families are provided with the opportunity to move to a better neighborhood or obtain better housing.

217
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:53,720
And it's been shown to improve health and education, educational attainment in some of these interventions.

218
00:27:54,890 --> 00:28:03,920
Another structural intervention, and we just talked about, in your view, is the government alliance for Race and Ethnicity and Living Cities.

219
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:10,819
And there was a $3 million grant which racial equity in five cities was heavily focused

220
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:19,430
on with the thought that there is safe links between racial equity and health equity.

221
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:26,180
And these cities were given funds to prove racial equity, hoping that they could also improve on their health equity.

222
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,900
And so there have been a lot of push to mitigate the disproportionate criminalization of marginalized communities of color.

223
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:44,570
So there's been a lot of push for reductions in discriminatory sanctions on drug use and drug charges.

224
00:28:44,810 --> 00:29:00,880
And also, there have been plenty of band the box campaigns where it may be important for like our our our political figures for us to know,

225
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:06,380
you know, what kind of types of criminal activity they may have had in the past.

226
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:16,460
But oftentimes it's not the people in power that are that are banned from job opportunities

227
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:22,610
and banned from higher positions or employment because of things in their past.

228
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:28,880
A lot of times it's the marginalized communities, the lower communities that they have to disclose.

229
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,770
Oh, have you been to prison so that you can work at Walmart like you want?

230
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:42,290
A lot of people have been campaigning to ban the box so that it can just eliminate that stereotype,

231
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:49,070
eliminate some structural barriers to accessing employment, accessing an adequate.

232
00:29:50,870 --> 00:30:01,370
Living for yourself. Okay, so that is what I have for the lecture, but we're going to start with an activity.

233
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:04,819
So I uploaded the activity on to canvas.

234
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,240
So those have access to canvas. You can look at it on there.

235
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:14,390
I was going to say no sheet, so I'll just describe it first.

236
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:28,009
So this activity talks about the declarations of racism as a public health

237
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:35,660
crisis that many cities and public health organizations have made since 2020.

238
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:43,070
So in the midst of the early COVID 19 pandemic, we all witness country wide civil unrest such as racial injustice.

239
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,520
And it reverberated across the country.

240
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,329
And this intense time led to a number of organizations, universities,

241
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:57,560
states and cities to take a stance against racism and formally declare racism as a public health crisis.

242
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:25,260
I want to end this out once again. Okay.

243
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:37,470
So AJ has been documenting documenting city level racism as a public health crisis declaration since 2020.

244
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:48,420
Entirely over 200 declarations that remain in the embarked on analyzing the activities that have been taking place.

245
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:54,299
And as a result of these declarations and they link to other strategic plans,

246
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:59,130
initiatives launched through each city's commitment to health and racial equity.

247
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:06,450
So what is actually me I'm going to have you guys break into these groups.

248
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:19,470
You can break ins is my book. There's six cities in the US and essentially have you look at the initiatives and strategic plan

249
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:30,560
plans that are taking place and looking at all the six cities and we'll see how we get into groups.

250
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:58,780
Three things know I will focus on.

251
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:29,110
In which case I wonder if you want to talk about your work in that.

252
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:45,200
Oh, yeah. It was almost four years ago.

253
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,760
Maybe a year ago. Yeah.

254
00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:16,760
I wanted to ask you for calculator number for action for any adolescent girls only.

255
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:21,920
Okay. Yes, I know.

256
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:39,200
And even not being inside the city in one of these.

257
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:49,790
I know it's a little bit more complicated.

258
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:55,489
Okay. So go ahead and look over. You can look at the interactive map.

259
00:34:55,490 --> 00:35:05,400
I provided the link and look at the handout. But take a look at what these measures have done and answer the questions and we can come back to you.

260
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:27,350
Okay. Yes.

261
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:44,240
And I always like that because it's so awesome to see where us is right here.

262
00:35:46,190 --> 00:36:20,330
And I do think it's so cute.

263
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:25,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry.

264
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:43,010
I'm sorry. I'm just saying that Minneapolis police used to do worse.

265
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,750
I mean, that's just the way they look and to be polite.

266
00:36:51,150 --> 00:37:05,540
And so they all of a sudden, you're not going to the police rounded up.

267
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:12,830
You know, we're not going to talk to hundreds.

268
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:25,970
No, no. It was not supposed to be like, what are you doing?

269
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:35,420
Oh, okay. So. Oh, my goodness.

270
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:46,310
Yeah. I thought it was just like an equitable vaccine deployment strategy across the county has

271
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:59,640
always been one of the things that struck me as she got an idea what she's been working.

272
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:29,230
You know, he looks to me like a me so much like.

273
00:38:53,960 --> 00:39:06,870
My workplace and culture and language and change.

274
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:18,080
It still has to be able to say what it's like, you know?

275
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,880
No, not really. Yeah. Yeah.

276
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:53,389
And it's almost like that's going to require us to the point of like the idea is

277
00:39:53,390 --> 00:40:03,550
actually like sometimes you can't just look at a person and expect that to do that.

278
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:13,790
So, yeah, I'm very suspicious until we have to bring in something on what it's like to try

279
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:22,510
to build a better understanding vaccine equity organization that you're like,

280
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:27,680
Let me vaccine like putting it, you know?

281
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:40,250
Yeah, I don't think that's a good thing because if you just say specifically, I mean,

282
00:40:40,830 --> 00:41:06,890
you see a lot of just like it's like you say, you know, it's it's kind of like the world feels like it's better than nothing.

283
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:19,309
Yeah, actually, quite a lot of research in the sense I don't think it's that you like.

284
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,760
I think it's it's a little thing like, you know,

285
00:41:24,170 --> 00:42:17,030
I guess I could see it differently because she says it's interesting to see us here in the U.S. forces talking about what they want and all that.

286
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:38,150
Yeah, that that's different from like, you know, like they have like zoning problems to offer different options for us to like go out a spider.

287
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:58,990
Like I always thought there's no way I could do it, but I think it's diverting people from entering the stuff.

288
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:10,160
Yeah. I also said climate change was one of the ones and then I did interpersonal racism since they had like restorative justice programs,

289
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:33,290
which I describe as maternal and child health and environmental exposures, because like you said,

290
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:43,750
that they're the most like, oh, I was going to ask, did you get your driver's license every here?

291
00:43:46,910 --> 00:44:06,910
I think that's yeah, that's a good thing that comes out of the department and that's what we talked about on the corner.

292
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:12,400
And he went out, I guess he doesn't cost anything.

293
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:23,530
So it's like right now probably just like, you know what I think good.

294
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:29,320
You got the not so good. I don't usually like going somewhere else.

295
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:37,210
And I added like, what about my income, income inequality?

296
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:45,819
And they should be focusing on everywhere from here before I roll housing down.

297
00:44:45,820 --> 00:45:03,059
I know where you talk about that. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm closing five months to talk about the kind of stuff that's like dropping everything else.

298
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:12,129
Like, didn't mention anything about, like, easy phrases like there are there certain areas of the county where,

299
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:19,490
like, places they don't have, like in my neighborhood that they're not hired or things like that.

300
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:44,610
I guess it's more like I was going to say, it's like sort of environmental in a different perspective, same design sensibilities.

301
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:53,280
Yeah. Like I keep going there.

302
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:22,930
Yeah, exactly. It's like, you know, on well, I think they're clearly going to be like these are people like I had probably in 2011.

303
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:28,570
Like I said, why did they actually ask me?

304
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:34,450
Which I don't know if that's asking, like what did they actually make changes on or like when and they think it's time to intervene.

305
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:44,800
So I just wrote down some other interventions permanently suspended from climate justice and that's.

306
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:56,160
Then they got like it their criminal justice or not.

307
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:07,850
But diverting money to addicts should be the same question.

308
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:16,240
I didn't answer the top part of it. There's a lot of money on the line.

309
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,320
What could they do? That's what I'm saying.

310
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:24,920
Situation like during their arrest. What they can also be like more broadly.

311
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:33,500
I mean, that's what they do. Like all the things you mentioned you must do something about.

312
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:37,090
So it's actually a problem.

313
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:58,040
That's a great danger structures and they look like that answer about it because you're able to provide affordable housing violence intervention.

314
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:46,660
Yes. We don't appear to be able to provide social media with large scale policy changes like I heard that they have that you need to act on it.

315
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:55,600
I need to hear from them. I literally like this.

316
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:26,940
I'm just I'm very about I got something like this, which I think is going to be covered by video link somebody gets upset about like.

317
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:45,800
So I think there was a series in like that and tried to make that all that.

318
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:58,040
Know, I like I like to talk about it.

319
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:10,490
Yeah, I really.

320
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:14,640
Okay, cool.

321
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,840
Yeah, I was like, I was just trying to buy more.

322
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:24,350
Yeah. So. Yeah. It's okay.

323
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:33,030
You're really in class. I was, like, all your life and so on.

324
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:36,980
So you were like, it needs you to learn is sort of the last question down for now.

325
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:45,740
That's fine. I think it was like like you're looking at things like that.

326
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:56,580
It's like there's pieces of everyone. It's harder to find something.

327
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:03,160
Like I asked it and we've gone to like for four months.

328
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:09,440
I was like, okay, you go back to figure out what really happened.

329
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:18,350
So it was like an intervention.

330
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:25,310
Like some of those goes out, but like just like like anything's quits.

331
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:40,640
So that's why I make sure it does look like the gaps in their bodies.

332
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:47,510
And I think you saw the.

333
00:51:51,400 --> 00:52:01,090
Things that make you suddenly so controversial during my answer is a really.

334
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:29,980
It's just like something I need every time you go back to school and college.

335
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:50,709
So it's like but it is like it's related because like, I can't tell you where to go and what does matter, you know, to the resources.

336
00:52:50,710 --> 00:53:36,250
And they're like, okay, well, I just had to drive past my house to perform the cliff.

337
00:53:36,640 --> 00:54:01,800
Sounds kind of when you're having this discussion with like like they're not going to make you feel like you're.

338
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:07,180
So they're like, well, rather. So is that even possible?

339
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:22,870
I mean, like, I like telling the story.

340
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:34,570
You feel environmental conservation about it, but I don't know.

341
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:47,770
As I say, you know, I don't know.

342
00:54:47,770 --> 00:55:07,420
Kelly, thanks so much for that. I feel like it's like we're would be fine with my parents and you just can't prepare.

343
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:26,880
And so the larger plan you start with the questions in start with the 1521 seven, that's the household identity.

344
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:35,710
So I'll let you first tell us exactly what outcomes were their health outcomes.

345
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:53,710
And well, I just think about you or I'm calling and it's no one wants to volunteer.

346
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:59,259
Oh, okay. I could ask in taxes.

347
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:06,550
And I think the two big outcomes in Pakistan were having mental health programs and then also focusing on food safety programs.

348
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:11,410
And really, I mean, really, I think health outcomes,

349
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:18,040
they did declare racism as a public health crisis so that they should have recommendations for health and education.

350
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:24,249
But it wasn't really clear that they were doing because under health,

351
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:30,010
I guess one of the outcomes that they maybe should be focusing on was because of

352
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:37,620
the older policies that led to surgery and housing that are so effective today.

353
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:43,900
And so there's a lot of issues, certain areas having less access to health care and healthy food industry,

354
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:50,870
which is what they should be focusing more on it. What does it sound like?

355
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:54,540
They started something. Mental health and health outcomes.

356
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:58,199
So they started there. But there's always work to be done.

357
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:05,360
So yeah. Okay. Um, let's hear from one come North Carolina.

358
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:17,400
I mean, one question. All righty. So for our outcome, they wanted to talk about substance abuse.

359
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:23,920
We were talking and we felt like they're called for a very broad thing.

360
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,010
That's something that we want to look at for something.

361
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:32,730
Also just to say something, which is a good start. But you're not dead on that.

362
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:43,290
Okay. I like that you use in it because one day you guys may be the people working in these cities,

363
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:46,559
in these public health departments and part of these initiatives.

364
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:51,180
That is good to see what's happening, but also what can be improved.

365
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:58,050
A good job journalism in the group. How about Minneapolis?

366
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:06,950
All right. They looked at violence prevention society.

367
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:12,570
Sorry. I think they looked at violence prevention as well as police reform.

368
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:21,030
So like addressing police brutality. And then for the violence prevention piece they put in, like outreach workers conflicts in neighborhoods.

369
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:27,210
They didn't directly look at health outcomes, though. Obviously, those are related to poor outcomes.

370
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:39,180
And first, I thought that was a good focus to look at, especially given the events that happened in Minnesota in 20 2017.

371
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:57,510
Okay. How about or, you know, we had like separation of organs in minority groups.

372
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:10,560
Okay. So just you just want us to go over like question two in how they wanted to focus on trying to diversify their workforce,

373
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:14,880
prevent homelessness, criminal justice reform,

374
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:21,510
climate change, and having, like culturally and community specific care and kind of like the last group said,

375
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:25,350
they kind of those are a lot of really broad things that they did,

376
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:32,819
but there wasn't a lot of specific action like the health outcomes that they then

377
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:37,080
wanted to target was maternal and child health and environmental exposures,

378
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:48,570
but not that it would also be helpful if they focused on income inequality, affordable housing, urban planning and zoning as well.

379
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:54,299
Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. You guys want to go work there?

380
00:59:54,300 --> 01:00:03,100
And so you kind of have a bio in.

381
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:14,060
So we lost the main outcome or the main thing that the article focused on was police reform.

382
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:16,549
But at the beginning of the paper,

383
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:22,700
it talked about like how there's a lot of disparities in like birth outcomes and chronic conditions, diabetes, hypertension.

384
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:27,139
And then I just want to talk about what use of force policies and implicit bias training.

385
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:30,770
So we thought that maybe those like specifically physical health outcomes could

386
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:33,950
have been more like their giving a more targeted approach towards those.

387
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:42,320
Even though police reform was like a good start with, I think maybe even like skipping education funding other avenues as well.

388
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:47,230
Yeah. I mean, I think instances too, like it's like the police brutality,

389
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:53,600
it puts on the maps, the public health summit and where we're getting some work done.

390
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,650
But now there is more there's more work to be done.

391
01:00:56,690 --> 01:01:03,410
There's more things that can be done. Okay. We covered everyone except for Milwaukee.

392
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:14,350
So for Milwaukee, they focused on vaccines and increasing access to vaccines like vaccine equity.

393
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:18,920
But in the paper they talked about. Wisconsin.

394
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:22,260
I mean, Milwaukee is like one of the least healthy counties.

395
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:26,640
Infant mortality is really bad. It's very segregated and then a lot of poverty.

396
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:31,230
So it just felt kind of like, why do we skip over those and jump to just vaccines and COVID?

397
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:38,669
And yeah, those kind of like those major things. COVID, um, racial unrest.

398
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:45,060
It's like, okay, public health crisis. But we had all these underlying issues in public health, so.

399
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:49,440
Yes, it is public health crisis and we definitely have representative.

400
01:01:49,710 --> 01:02:00,540
Okay. So, um, I think you guys kind of answered questions and great responses.

401
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:09,090
I really heard a lot of chatter about candidates and seemed to be what you guys are thinking.

402
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:12,990
So let's hear from Boston.

403
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:20,910
If you were to be a public health consultant for the city of Boston and working on police reform,

404
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:26,790
what would your conscience be, your contribution to this incredible amount of.

405
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:42,220
We kind of talked about like we shouldn't change it.

406
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:49,390
Like I think it's like the actual call to action is like with regards to the police reform since they wanted to focus on that.

407
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:54,100
Like seeing if the people that they're trying to change are actually willing to work.

408
01:02:56,770 --> 01:03:01,190
So we talked about like perceived susceptibility and perceived factors.

409
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:06,790
So it's like can enjoy your readings and interview for jobs.

410
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:14,610
Okay. Michael, North Carolina, what about reducing infant deaths as a result of substance abuse?

411
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:20,880
Yeah. So I gave the HP perspective.

412
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:28,590
I remember one of the first people that I was talking about, and so I really was part of a medicaid expansion.

413
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:34,140
When they're talking about reducing infant deaths, I'm one of the few states that still didn't do that.

414
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:37,350
So that was the I thought you can start a positive perspective.

415
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:43,350
That was my first initial thought. Yeah.

416
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:52,980
So that's good. We have some new students going on. Well, you're from a disciplinary perspective, but I think you incorporate that.

417
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:58,610
What about HP? HP stands for our competitors.

418
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:14,410
The line is still in place.

419
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:21,490
Okay. Well, we will work on that. Maybe we should have a separate group project.

420
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:26,650
No, I'm kidding. Okay. We didn't move to Milwaukee.

421
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:42,500
What about increasing vaccine reflexes? I know you talked about the health beliefs model.

422
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:48,620
So like perceived susceptibility and severity and also like a history of racism as

423
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:53,029
well as probably important because like if it's a black community taking vaccines,

424
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:56,180
there's a history of like problems. So you need to address that.

425
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:01,640
Yeah. Yeah. So it's like vaccine hesitancy, like. Yeah.

426
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:08,990
Are you more like more or less likely to actually engage in any vaccine?

427
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:19,000
Okay. Minneapolis. And we talked about that.

428
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:22,550
They had also mentioned like cure, violence and prevention.

429
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:26,960
That was one of the TEDTalk options for our theory assessment last week.

430
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:31,339
And we applied the social cognitive theory to that one,

431
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:40,850
talking about like the violence interrupters and putting similar peers in a situation to model positive behaviors and learn from that,

432
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:44,659
but also from a social ecological model.

433
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:52,850
The policies that they were implementing around like police violence and things like that kind of encompass like the larger scope.

434
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:56,240
And then that cure violence brought the intervention down to the individual level.

435
01:05:56,570 --> 01:06:00,530
So they had a bunch of different interventions that kind of covered multiple levels over the social

436
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:10,190
ecological model and city intellectual model the whole semester wrapped up into one intervention.

437
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:14,240
Okay. Okay. What about us in Texas?

438
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:29,680
We talked about some of the perceived barriers and benefits, especially to some of the mental health resources that were being created.

439
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:40,270
And then for food safety, we struggled a little bit more because it's such a large topic and so it fits well into the social classical model.

440
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:53,530
But we also discussed kind of self efficacy and a ways to help people understand that small differences and everyone can have an impact.

441
01:06:53,790 --> 01:07:08,860
And even though it is like this really massive kind of end goal of community safety and it's like, okay and or money or independence of help.

442
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:14,860
So we really also looked at this in terms of social cognitive theory.

443
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:21,760
We thought that a lot of the constructs from aligned up well with maternal health because yes,

444
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:26,170
it is something that a mother goes through, but it's also a whole societal thing as well.

445
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:33,370
So certainly self-efficacy knowledge, you know, relating to existing resources, what's out there,

446
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:39,459
what's being done in terms of what they talked about in the actual program outcome expectations,

447
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:44,470
when you take advantage of those resources, are they going to be helpful or are they going to be supportive of you?

448
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:48,640
Also, just normative beliefs in what's going on in your community.

449
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:56,380
Certainly social support and also the opportunities and barriers to getting care and getting to those resources.

450
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:04,570
Okay. I really like that. You guys seem to have really ingested the material from the beginning of this semester.

451
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:11,650
You've really showed it in how you applied the constructs to these health outcomes.

452
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:17,410
But even as banal grades at the end of the semester and tell you about your theories,

453
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:22,870
you have all of these theories and concepts in your back pocket so that these guys are really impressed.

454
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:26,740
And so that is are happening today.

455
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:36,879
Do you guys have questions like, well, I won't do you won't see you guys on Monday, compadres.

456
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:43,960
I'm doing well. Right. And if you are on Wednesday, we have theories on Friday.

457
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:56,930
The reasons you may see this right now.

458
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:17,900
I feel like I was talking to myself now.

459
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:32,570
Yeah, this is bad. She made me do the speech.

460
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:41,030
Why don't you go so.

461
01:09:43,550 --> 01:10:05,600
I don't know which one. You know, there are some things that I really want to tell you again.

462
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:15,650
So I guess you just told me what she described yesterday.

463
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:20,210
That's just cause I had a meeting.

464
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:26,900
She's the only other person in the class has her name.

465
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:31,080
Okay. It's a guy. Sorry.

466
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:37,639
You know, she was making a joke about it, and I was like, oh, like, it's not like, I'm really sorry, because it's actually really [INAUDIBLE].

467
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:42,980
And, like, I know you're going to take that as a yes.

468
01:10:45,890 --> 01:11:01,070
I know what I was like and I was like, Okay, I see how, you know, suicide is for you.

469
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:35,960
So I look at my entire life like, Oh my gosh, you know, just because they're like, they are, you know,

470
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:52,550
they're happy about it because it's like, it's all for you to sound, you know, like the weather to like.

471
01:11:57,290 --> 01:12:05,440
Yeah. Oh, my God. This is not how you first meet them.

472
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:14,150
I mean, we got. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

473
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:24,020
How are the counselors using?

474
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:30,250
The situation from a couple are not the norm.

475
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:34,190
Yes. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.

476
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:40,700
Oh, yes. Got it right. Yeah. It was good.

477
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:43,700
It was? Yes. I'm sorry. I didn't understand the question.

478
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:51,200
Just sort of like, get involved. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

479
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:56,300
Thank you. I think I got it.

480
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:59,600
You're welcome. Yeah. Yeah.

481
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:05,770
Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry.

482
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:19,350
And what exactly is it that is that gave you some comments about how to change it, but it's just to redo it by tomorrow evening.

483
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:29,170
Oh, yeah. Look, it's also a great lecture, and she did a great job, which gets you to take a.

484
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:42,930
It's great. Oh, do you feel good about it? I felt after the lecture, I was scared.

485
01:13:42,930 --> 01:13:48,239
I went too fast. But clearly the activity was pretty long and they were still talking about consciousness.

486
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:54,200
I didn't want to. And they asked, but only about, like, minutes.

487
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:59,970
Yep. Yep. That's good. So I was going to crack for, like, 2 seconds.

488
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:03,900
So I thought you did a great job.

489
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:14,219
But I think your preparation was really reflected and like putting this together and, you know, I think it all came together very well.

490
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:18,600
And, you know, it's you got to put yourself in these situations in practice.

491
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:23,310
And I think you you pulled it off and you did a great job.

492
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:27,389
Thank you. And that I definitely love I don't know in my notes right now,

493
01:14:27,390 --> 01:14:33,750
but how you just have I was kind of shaken up but I like that I've was tried to use the side

494
01:14:33,790 --> 01:14:42,540
note I think it but I said something to you thank you for being so sure this is so great.

495
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:47,639
It was you. You found it. I was just like, okay, here's a different way of doing it.

496
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:53,790
Yeah, I thought it was a great activity. But the question, yeah, I think we're in the age now like that.

497
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:59,910
They really are. They understand the theory you something like from.

498
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:07,680
Yeah. That was exciting. That's good.

499
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:11,310
I appreciate. Thank you for allowing me to give that.

500
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:14,880
Thank you for contributing to the class. You did a great job.

501
01:15:15,930 --> 01:15:19,730
Yeah, I like it. To me, presenting, it's all about preparation.

502
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:27,660
And you clearly put the preparation in and it paid off pretty good.

503
01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:37,800
Yeah, it was awesome. Yeah, but, uh, I go celebrate, but you have this big thing now that is off your chest.

504
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:41,130
Now that's cause for celebration. Yeah.

505
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:46,620
Yeah. A lot of students ask me about their Christmas, so.

506
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:50,459
But most of them sent it. Sent it in, like last night.

507
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:55,590
I integrate last night and sent their emails last night.

508
01:15:55,650 --> 01:15:59,729
Most of it. I'm still waiting for a few, but it sounds like it.

509
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:03,030
Do they seem to be cool about it when you say can you redo it?

510
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:06,270
Yes. How they. Yeah, yeah.

511
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:09,890
Like Davina, I didn't want to like she was like, I'm so sorry.

512
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:15,700
You got it completely wrong. I'm like, no, I don't like and I do this myself negative self-talk.

513
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:22,650
I'm like, no, you're like she was like, I incorporated the other article and I was like, That's fine, but.

514
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:28,610
Typically you could do that another crack. But we want to see how you apply the actual crunch.

515
01:16:29,330 --> 01:16:32,780
That was eggs. So she was like, okay, that makes total sense.

516
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:41,509
So yeah, it's, it's like they they try to do or they try to go outside of the scope of this.

517
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:44,740
And it is like not just like rein it in, guys.

518
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:48,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

519
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:55,850
That's yeah. Oh, she's doing it over. Yeah, he's engaged.

520
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:59,060
She's, he's getting there. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

521
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:08,389
That's good. It's good to have some, I'm glad to have some rapport with them so they keep them engaged like we don't want to isolate.

522
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:12,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Alienate them. So then they just sort of withdraw.

523
01:17:12,530 --> 01:17:18,159
Yeah. It's hard to communicate. Yeah. Yeah. But no, I don't.

524
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:22,570
I don't. I let them know that, you know, you I don't think anybody else had any.

525
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:27,309
They're like, they do stuff in advance, the group that I wanted to meet.

526
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:35,020
So I think that's why they're trying to get ahead of their control now. But no one else has emailed me, so I think you might be the officer again.

527
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:41,290
Good, good. Thank you so much.

528
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:46,090
I appreciate it. Yeah, I'll see you next week.

529
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:49,720
I rescheduled, I think, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

530
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:54,100
So you have a good father. I don't know if you take it, but, uh.

531
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:57,220
Yeah, yeah, well, not really. A break and so work, but.

532
01:17:58,330 --> 01:18:16,050
Okay. All right. Yeah. See you later. I.

533
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:28,320
But a little bit of. A little bit.

534
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:49,500
A little. La la la la la la la la la la la.

535
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:35,470
How do you think?
