1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:06,750
There were some really good ones. There was one professor that I met for the first time who walked into class.

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:15,840
It was around this time of year with a long way gone, and he just looks around and he says, I'm Judge Mentor.

3
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,580
That was that very first interaction with that person.

4
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,420
It's amazing. There's always good characters around.

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,320
Okay, well, let's make sure I'm recording here.

6
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:43,490
Um, okay. So, first of all, uh, for those of you watching and not attending class, please attend class.

7
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,100
It's mandatory for those of you in class. Thanks for being here.

8
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:55,590
Um, I think there were still a couple of people who needed to submit their resumes, so friendly reminder to do that.

9
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:06,570
Um, if you haven't already and cover letters are due next week, I believe at the same time.

10
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,700
Um, so make sure that's on your docket to do.

11
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,040
Hopefully you are well on your way. Please contact me with any questions.

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:25,410
Concerns, anything else? Um, I think for for real about the poster session.

13
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:33,330
Time date has been finalized. There was a lot of back and forth behind the scenes on email that you guys weren't subjected to.

14
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,360
Um, just because there's a lot of people with conflicts. Um, so just show of hands briefly.

15
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,140
How many people have a conflict with the new time?

16
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,390
Okay. Um, we know we're.

17
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,640
Yeah, I only have to leave, like, 30 minutes. Okay.

18
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,910
That should be fine. I would consider that for.

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,690
So you should still get an hour. Yeah. And that's okay. Yeah. Question which is your time ago?

20
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,389
Oh, I, I don't want to tell you the wrong thing, so I'm going to make sure I put it on canvas.

21
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:13,070
Here it is, the 25th from 3 to 520.

22
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,450
It's going to be.

23
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,060
Hopefully that isn't, you know, like. Yeah.

24
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,550
Who? Yeah. I mean, the 26.

25
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,070
The 26. Did they really change it again?

26
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:39,550
Rachel sent an email yesterday was Wednesday, the 26th over 26.

27
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:47,910
So this very quickly then just to make sure it is on Zoom.

28
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:58,209
Hmm. So, uh, was that true with.

29
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:05,320
Most people are going to attend. I have to work, but I can't.

30
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,330
True. So I'm trying to work on an option, if you like.

31
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:19,720
Absolutely cannot attend. Um, I'm working with the other instructors to maybe record a couple sessions.

32
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,010
Um, but we're still in kind of works with that.

33
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:31,239
So just like, contact me and make sure I'm aware of any conflicts or like if you get really sick or something

34
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:38,290
the day of just let me know and hopefully we can make sure we have an option for you all there.

35
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:48,159
Um, okay. So today we're kind of shifting gears because we've been talking about like all these very relevant

36
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,210
professional things that you all will continue to take with you throughout your entire careers.

37
00:03:52,870 --> 00:04:04,330
And today, we're shifting into things that are actually very specific to your degree and your time here in our department as an MPH student.

38
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,710
Um, so we're going to be talking about two things.

39
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:15,610
One is the learning agreements slash plan, and the other one is Apex.

40
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:24,819
So I just want to get a sense how many people have heard Slash know about this.

41
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,050
I'm I'm hoping you all have at least heard of it. Okay.

42
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:42,370
So how many people feel comfortable with how you interpret and know our department's expectations and the requirements you need to get your degree?

43
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,470
Show of hands. Okay, great.

44
00:04:48,700 --> 00:05:01,510
So we're going to go over some things together today that will hopefully help people out and make it a little bit easier for everyone to actually,

45
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:09,010
um, start to develop their own learning plans and address those requirements.

46
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:14,950
So you are able to complete your degree on time. So this is very dry but important.

47
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:22,629
And I just want to remind everyone too that if you go to this page on campus,

48
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:31,660
I sent out a notification that I changed this because I wanted to let you know that some of

49
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:37,360
the CFA requirements for your degree were like changed slightly from what was on the page.

50
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,820
So make sure you download the latest copy of the Phillip Learning Plan that was uploaded an hour ago.

51
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:51,190
Um, and I also want to point out that there are a lot of really helpful links on here.

52
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,280
This handbook is insane.

53
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,670
Simmons spent a really long time working on it and making sure that's great.

54
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:10,780
Um, you all have a really, really detailed view of almost everything that I'm going to say today.

55
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,360
So if you are all confused, please review the resources on canvas.

56
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:20,920
There are so many, like step by step by step. Like, this is exactly what I need to do.

57
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,990
Here's a checklist for you in here to make sure you're working towards your proper degree

58
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:33,190
requirements and at the right time the different things that you're going to be actually working on.

59
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,540
All of this stuff is on on canvas, so make sure you download a copy for yourself and you're,

60
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,510
you know, keeping up to date on on what you actually need there. Okay.

61
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,000
So what is a learning agreement?

62
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:59,860
It is the structural framework for all of you all to communicate between your advisor and yourself and make sure you all

63
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:07,360
have the same understanding of what you want to actually accomplish in your degree and you're meeting those requirements.

64
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:16,840
It is really nice because it will help you develop conversations when you're actually meeting with your advisor.

65
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:27,910
Hopefully you are all have somewhat regular meetings with your advisor and if you've reached out multiple times with no response, what is the.

66
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,390
Reasonable course of action from from escalate.

67
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:44,420
Um, if you've reached out multiple times with no response, you should either be talking to someone and or Dana.

68
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:52,759
I don't wanna. Oh, okay. Yeah. Um, you can see.

69
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:58,240
See me now. I'll just. Oh, yeah, that's fine. Um.

70
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:08,940
And. Okay, so, uh, this will also help you when you're actually at the end of your degree and you have to be evaluated.

71
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,810
And when you're creating your posters and your presentations about all your internship loveliness that you did over the summer,

72
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:23,130
it'll help guide all of that stuff for you there. So it's electronic.

73
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:34,270
So I think I'm going to be continuing working with you all next semester, and so we're going to start doing a draft of it this semester.

74
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:42,690
Next semester I'll actually need like a finalized, mostly finalized copy between you and your advisor, and it should be signed off on everything.

75
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:52,350
Um, there's also a specific one that is actually on the heights, and I don't have access to that website.

76
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,220
I've requested access to that website, so I can't tell you what it looks like.

77
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:04,470
Um, so you check that out? Um, you know, send me screenshots if you have questions, cause otherwise I can't help you very much.

78
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:16,110
Um, okay. So right now we're going to, going to be focusing on this kind of starting period for this term,

79
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:22,049
where we're going to be discussing potential tasks and projects with your preceptor

80
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,560
and then also continue on as you're working towards your internship goals.

81
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:32,549
You're going to spend a long time this term developing and identifying your learning goals and objectives,

82
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,580
and then you're going to be completing it on the heights.

83
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,620
And that's going to be an iterative process.

84
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:53,880
Your advisor will review, approve or comment this along the way, and then this won't be till later on, but you can finalize and submit it later,

85
00:09:53,910 --> 00:10:01,580
either next term or even the following term, just to make sure that you are having all that documentation along the way.

86
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:10,080
So apparently these are things that you need to do when you're actually on the website.

87
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:19,260
Um, you'll have to enter. This is again going to be mostly completed next semester, but it's good to understand what you have to do.

88
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:27,600
You enter your preceptors, this information, um, and what they told you that they expect you to be doing,

89
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:38,550
you review instructions for your learning and agreement and then complete the learning agreement table marking off each competency, each product.

90
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:47,340
Um, the approach that you're going to use for that and then you'll be submitting that draft for advisor commenting and approval.

91
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:57,330
This will again mostly be working on that in the future through that hyperlink for this this particular course,

92
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:03,450
we're going to be starting the draft using that billable document that is on canvas right here.

93
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:14,370
Okay. So this is apparently what it looks like.

94
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:20,730
I am not an official student or faculty who is approved to look at this.

95
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:30,060
So I'm hoping that this is still accurate. Please talk to me, the register or anyone else.

96
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:42,030
If you have trouble accessing this or difficulties looking at the form and starting to work on it, um, as you work through this next term.

97
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:52,079
So the advisors, when they're looking at the submitted version of the first copy of this, will be looking at.

98
00:11:52,080 --> 00:12:01,860
First of all, did you identify the appropriate competencies to your degree and your concentration?

99
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:08,190
So we'll go through all those competencies in detail in just a few minutes to remind everyone.

100
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:15,360
But I also want to reiterate that this is really great.

101
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:27,030
Hand to hand book from Simon has all the competencies listed out for you and to be reminded.

102
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:37,920
So here are the CFA ones for your MPH. If you continue down, we have each as concentration, then we have industrial hygiene, etc. etc.

103
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:44,350
So this information is available to you in multiple different spaces.

104
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:51,570
Um. Feel free to use whichever one feels most comfortable, but just to let you know that it's there,

105
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,870
the knowledge and skill that you're going to be identifying should be in your own words.

106
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,760
I think a lot of you have some goals for like careers that you want afterwards.

107
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,399
If you're struggling with this particular section, it would be really,

108
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,110
really helpful to think about what career you want to have afterwards and therefore what

109
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:21,329
skills you're looking for in your internship experience and in your career as a student.

110
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:30,360
Here, um, the product is going to be something that is aligned with our APEC's criteria.

111
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:36,390
So that's what applied practical experience. It, it technically doesn't have to.

112
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:47,310
So if you find an internship that you really, really, really like, but you can't find a way to get an apex out of it,

113
00:13:48,870 --> 00:14:01,170
you can do another volunteer position or research position that allows you to get that apex outside of that internship.

114
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:08,129
Now that'll make it more challenging for you later on.

115
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:14,130
So I don't know if I necessarily recommend that unless you find something that you're like, I can not turn this down.

116
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,810
And honestly, a lot of them can be turned into Apex.

117
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:25,170
Um, but the official apex criteria is something that's administered through the

118
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,510
accreditation from the larger institution that guides public health degrees.

119
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:37,800
So that's not something that we can flex, but it is a very broad criteria to begin with.

120
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:49,550
So the apex or product has to be tangible and you have to be able to show competency achievement.

121
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,050
If you have any questions that are kind of like, Oh, what's all this stuff about?

122
00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:00,750
You can look up the ATX criteria on a number of different sites throughout the heights and um,

123
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:09,020
the actual page accreditation folks as well as attending that poster session coming up is going to be really,

124
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:17,240
really helpful for you to start to understand what type of products can qualify for this.

125
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:25,840
So this today is really to just get you familiar with the topic and thinking about it.

126
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:33,250
You will become experts over the next year as you work towards this apex.

127
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,700
Okay. So don't feel overwhelmed today.

128
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:41,430
I know it's like a lot of very specific information, but it'll be helpful.

129
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:54,130
Um, so your approach for this particular product will also be described in this plan, and it needs to be well described using action oriented verbs,

130
00:15:54,730 --> 00:16:00,250
highlighting the different tasks, responsibilities or activities that you'll be doing to actually make that product.

131
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:05,710
Okay. So competencies,

132
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:18,010
you are required to have at least three foundational space content competencies that are planned that apply for everyone who is getting

133
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:28,270
an MPH here at the School of Public Health will go into these competencies and then request for your either department or your sub plan.

134
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:39,220
You need to have an additional two competencies so all of you know what your degree is hopefully in by this point.

135
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,870
So we'll go over the competencies for each of those individually right now.

136
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,870
Okay. The speech competencies are as follows.

137
00:16:50,880 --> 00:17:00,190
Um, this is a little bit incorrect because they were slightly updated with the numbering, but the competency categories are the same.

138
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,030
Um, you have evidence based approaches to public health,

139
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:13,210
public health and health care systems planning and management to promote health policy and public health leadership,

140
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:18,940
communication, interprofessional practice and systems thinking.

141
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:29,020
So more detail. I'm going to read a lot of stuff about you, but, uh, the evidence based approaches to public health.

142
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:38,100
This is doing research. Basically, you're either using epidemiology to look at health problems and public health practice.

143
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:48,040
You're, you're collecting quantitative and qualitative data and designing different methods to actually look at a public health problem.

144
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,020
You're analyzing those data using biostatistics, informatics,

145
00:17:53,320 --> 00:18:00,310
computer based programing and software, and you're interpreting those results for things later on.

146
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:09,940
So in your internship, you might have 1 to 4 of these competencies, but it's still only under the one category.

147
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:19,990
So you'll still need to have a different category through different categories to actually fulfill your speech requirements.

148
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:27,370
Does that make sense? The category is not the.

149
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:35,760
Come on. It's about three and the two. The 3 to 3 from the foundation.

150
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,250
Yes. So it's very category. It's not very comfortable.

151
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,670
I believe so. But let me double check on that. Yes.

152
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:53,820
No, that's the important point. Okay. So the next category is planning and management to promote health.

153
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,700
Here, you're going to be more likely working with an actual ongoing program.

154
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:08,370
You're going to be assessing population needs, asset and community and capacities that affect community health,

155
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:19,830
designing population based policy, program projects or intervention, or selecting methods that actually evaluate ongoing programs.

156
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:28,390
This me also interrelate link closely with policy and public health.

157
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:38,650
For this you will be discussing multilevel dimensions of policymaking process, including the rules of ethics and evidence.

158
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:49,210
You could also be working with stakeholders and different coalitions and neighborhood partnerships for influencing public health outcomes.

159
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,270
You could be also advocating for political,

160
00:19:52,270 --> 00:20:01,420
social or economic policies and programs to improve health or evaluating policies for their impact on public health and equity.

161
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:10,299
And you can also imagine how internships that cover some of these competencies might cover some of the

162
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:17,710
competencies in the communication section where you would be doing different communication strategies,

163
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,290
presenting in both writing and oral formats to a variety of different audiences.

164
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:34,479
Within your internship, you could also be looking at the control cultural competence.

165
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,390
There's a lot of things that I'm saying I'm sorry in communicating public health content.

166
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:48,010
And then the last two ones are also thinking about the structural bias, social inequities,

167
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:57,700
and racism that undermine health and create challenges in health equity or at organizational, community and societal levels.

168
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:08,020
And finally, applying awareness of cultural values and practices to design or implement public health policies or programs.

169
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,819
If you were maybe at a hospital or an insurance company,

170
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:21,760
you might be doing stuff that explain the basic principles of tools and budget and resource management.

171
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,430
Or you might be looking at the different structural organizations within the health care setting,

172
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:33,520
public health setting, or regulatory systems at national and international levels.

173
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:39,040
Finally, you could be doing things regarding leadership,

174
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:48,070
looking across different ways that we actually run an organized public health and public health programs,

175
00:21:48,190 --> 00:22:01,300
organization, structures, etc., or actually using negotiation or mediation skills between different stakeholders and regulatory bodies.

176
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,780
Um, to come to a common ground.

177
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:16,330
The last two, hopefully a lot of you will be performing effectively on interprofessional teams, so that's a nice easy one for you all to get.

178
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:21,549
And then you could also be using system thinking.

179
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:27,670
So thinking about different ways that systems come together to actually affect public health in a multifaceted way.

180
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:33,790
Okay. That was the SB age competencies.

181
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:38,740
There are a lot of them. Um, some of them are more specific.

182
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,420
Other ones are more broad.

183
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:50,410
Hopefully you all found at least a couple that you think could be targeted in the internships that you're imagining or applying to.

184
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:57,850
And, um, if you are having trouble with this,

185
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:04,990
definitely don't hesitate to reach out to people because we want to make sure you fulfill these competencies.

186
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:10,480
Hopefully you should be able to do that pretty easily. Okay.

187
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:18,700
For those of you in AHP, um, here are the five competencies that are sent from our department.

188
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,920
Um, I think I can't remember the exact number.

189
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:38,050
I have to go back to that slide. Um, two competencies within this list of five you need for your actual concentration.

190
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:45,580
So you could be looking again at summarizing qualitative and quantitative exposure assessments,

191
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:50,080
and you can start to see how maybe these skill sets could overlap.

192
00:23:50,740 --> 00:24:01,600
Um, you could be recognizing adverse health effects of common environmental occupational exposures, applying risk assessment to those hazards, um,

193
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,150
looking at policy and analyzing it,

194
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:14,410
or assessing how health promotion strategies could be used to mitigate environmental health hazards for a general e h.

195
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:22,240
S sub plan. You have a number of different longer bullets here that are saying a lot of.

196
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,650
The same stuff looking at qualitative and quantitative,

197
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:33,690
qualitative and quantitative aspects of exposure based on hazard properties, pathways, relative exposure,

198
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:40,080
etc. Looking at how toxicological effects are associated with exposures and stressors,

199
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:47,759
especially using your knowledge of biochemistry or biological mechanisms to understand those talks.

200
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:59,250
Logical effects. You could also be recognizing adverse health consequences to common exposures in the occupational and public health realms.

201
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:09,030
You could also be designing recommendations to prevent and control those exposures and looking at actually

202
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:16,710
publishing research in a peer reviewed journal and contributing to that process within your internship.

203
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:25,050
For industrial hygiene, within this, we get a little bit more specific.

204
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,890
We're actually now looking at the workplace and the workplace exposures and stressors.

205
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:36,420
Being able to describe those both quantitatively and qualitatively,

206
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:47,490
explaining the mechanisms or stressors behind these types of exposures within the human body,

207
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,160
and then assessing how all of those might actually be affecting worker health.

208
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:04,380
And then also designing engineering, administration, PPE or other intervention interventions.

209
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:10,470
Our lovely triangle for workplace hazards to reduce or eliminate those altogether.

210
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:21,150
Or you could be describing the relevance of business and managerial practices and how that applies to industrial hygiene settings.

211
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:32,090
And of course, you will be interpreting and applying occupational and environmental health regulations, either from Nigeria, etc.

212
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:41,880
Those types of levels for environmental quality, sustainability and health.

213
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:52,410
Um, we have five competencies that you will have to achieve to have that actually look at more so exposure assessment.

214
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:58,050
So you should be actually doing a sort of exposure assessment and evaluating the results from these.

215
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:03,720
So that includes looking at different pathways, different cycles,

216
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:09,570
looking at an overall environmental and exposure, modeling on the local and global scale.

217
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:18,360
Um, implementing quality and considering quality checks in the study design,

218
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:24,240
sampling data collection in general laboratory practices or field practices,

219
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:34,380
evaluating environmental health quality, including environmental standards, or on their effects on individual community and global hub.

220
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:45,990
And then designing and evaluating interventions based on sustainability sciences to minimize the consequences on society and the environment.

221
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:58,680
And I think we're almost there. Um, so planning occupational and environmental epidemiology now we're going to be looking at more epidemiology.

222
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:10,140
Surprise, surprise. So you will be looking at how biological and behavioral mechanisms influence human environment, environmental health outcomes.

223
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:22,530
You could be designing an epidemiologist or study looking at environmental or occupational health factors and outcomes using specific hypotheses.

224
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:32,580
You should be applying appropriate methods to do so and interpreting those methods using a number of different bio stats techniques.

225
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:45,930
And finally, similar to the general, just one, you could communicate those results in a peer reviewed journal for toxicology.

226
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:56,130
Now we're flipping it again, similar to you're doing talk stuff in the lab, predicting tox responses and molecular mechanisms,

227
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:06,990
applying either risk assessment or similar to toxicological or occupational hazards, and hopefully publishing those things in a peer reviewed journal.

228
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:19,230
Okay, that was a little bit brutal, but I just wanted to make sure that all of you understand all the competencies that are available to you.

229
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:25,160
I have that one lingering question from over. Hear that I will 100% confirm.

230
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:30,320
I'm pretty sure it's in the handbook. I said competencies, not category.

231
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:38,420
So that's what I was thinking. So I do think, though.

232
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:45,620
However, I think it is specific where you're not allowed to have all your competencies within one category.

233
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:52,490
So they do need to be spread out over, I think, two categories minimum.

234
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:08,490
Does that make sense? Okay. Any other questions or anything else when it comes to starting to fill out these plans?

235
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:16,710
Of course. What's up? Are the competencies a part of Apex or a part of the internship plan in general?

236
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:24,330
Internship. Learning plan? Yeah. And then is Apex just like the deliverables or is there more than that?

237
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:31,680
Apex is the is the entire deliver of the more experience that you have.

238
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:43,140
So Apex is typically considered like your internship, broadly speaking, but if you don't have a deliverable from that,

239
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:48,510
that is where like there's like subtleties and how that's actually interpreted.

240
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,020
Most people, I think, will be able to have deliverables.

241
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:55,230
So I don't think this will apply to most people,

242
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:03,450
but I just wanted to emphasize that there are workarounds as long as we plan for our docket ahead of time.

243
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:07,830
Okay. More questions.

244
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:13,350
So public order and fees are due eventually, but cover letters or something?

245
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,580
Yes. We're not.

246
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:26,300
We don't have an we're applying to our rewriting the cover letter or filling out these forms of that sort of form is a total draft form.

247
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:30,560
Yeah, it is. And again, reminder, this is a credit no credit clause.

248
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:37,970
So just put the work in that you think is appropriate to where you are and you'll be fine.

249
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:42,650
I'm like, I have my name. I'm not supposed to. Oh, okay.

250
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:53,900
But you can start to imagine some learning objectives that might be really relevant for your personal goals of this particular program.

251
00:31:54,470 --> 00:32:00,890
And so that's something that might be of a bigger focus than actually like how it could fulfill the competency.

252
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:09,560
And then we put a cover letter, though, and I'm like unsure how to write a cover letter for something that I don't remember.

253
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:14,300
But so I know, I know we've talked a lot about your particular position.

254
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:21,170
So if you have a position that you're thinking about, you can pull out a couple of things that are more general,

255
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:27,110
like this position requires environmental health sampling.

256
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:31,040
So I'm going to talk about how I have skills on that or I'm excited to learn that.

257
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,620
And so there are ways to make it.

258
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:43,730
Regardless of what you're doing, you should never really have truly unique cover letters for like every single application that you're applying to.

259
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:51,260
You should have like one cover letter that applies to these community public health jobs,

260
00:32:51,740 --> 00:33:00,350
and then another cover letter that applies to the hospital administration jobs and another cover letter that applies to your industrial hygiene job.

261
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:05,490
And then just within those you can tweak, you can just say like an X, Y,

262
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:13,220
Z company or this position and just have really broad things in there and you just fill in kind of the bubbles.

263
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:22,310
You don't want to make your life harder. So hopefully you have something that's like mostly applicable to what you were aiming to apply for later on.

264
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,340
Any other questions? Concerts, comments.

265
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:46,640
It was a really helpful form for the coroner's office about like identifying your career goals, your internship desires and stuff like that.

266
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:50,830
Feel free to post it on the discussion board on our campus page.

267
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:59,060
That would be great. Yeah, please. If you find other resources, I'm trying to, like, stay on top of things and hopefully send you some resources.

268
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:12,440
I just uploaded actually really recently on canvas under our resources page this

269
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:18,980
Rackham list of resources that talks about everything that they can do for you.

270
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:34,820
So check that out, because you can attend these events or actually make like one on one appointments for their services.

271
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:40,640
As a graduate student here at the university. Yeah.

272
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:46,450
My next lesson is on the 19th, we have do what posters we're going to be watching.

273
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:53,810
But if if if I'm not if I don't have ample time for you all to review that, I will, of course, extend our deadline.

274
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,690
I'm hoping that we get that yes. Soon, but, um.

275
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:05,990
Yeah, of course I will be flexible with that if if I can't get it to you on time.

276
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:10,880
So the week of the poster session, do we not have that right?

277
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:16,040
Yep. Yep.

278
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:21,790
So we only actually have a few more sessions in person this semester.

279
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:28,710
Two one is going to be looking at actually using simplicity and the other one will be looking at, um,

280
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:37,130
library support services through services and talking a little bit more about Apex and those criteria.

281
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:48,190
Okay. Any last lingering questions about anything.

282
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,500
So just to reiterate, if you find internships you like,

283
00:35:53,500 --> 00:36:02,880
but they don't meet your like required whatever specialization, concentration and competency are competencies.

284
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:14,290
So the best thing would be to try to fill something out with other work or, or try to like look for different internships.

285
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:30,810
I think. I would start to consider how those might overlap in different ways and contact your advisor to get the benefit of that.

286
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:42,790
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

287
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,580
I'm going to stop this recording now.
