1
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,160
In this module I'm
going to give you

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,275
an introduction to
systems thinking.

3
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:14,640
Now, I've used this phrase,

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,575
systems thinking a few times in

5
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:19,185
other modules and you may
be wondering to yourself,

6
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,585
what the heck is
systems thinking?

7
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:23,220
You're not alone I assure you.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,410
So I'm hoping over the
course of this module,

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,790
I can give you a better sense

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,040
of what we're talking
about for this very

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,725
important potential
approach to public health.

12
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:33,360
First though, I want to highlight

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,015
the challenges that we
face in public health.

14
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:39,000
We always have numerous
interacting variables

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,380
to account for whenever we're

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,200
looking at a public
health problems.

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,720
The problems that we addressed
in this profession are

18
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,400
complex and they often don't have

19
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,670
simple or linear patterns.

20
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,140
We're also almost
always dealing with

21
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,544
multiple agencies or
groups or actors,

22
00:00:54,544 --> 00:00:56,360
all of whom typically have

23
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,660
very different values and
concerns in area of focus.

24
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,850
So one of our challenges
is always how do

25
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,480
we integrate all those
different perspectives?

26
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,655
So systems thinking is one
way for us to do that.

27
00:01:07,655 --> 00:01:09,800
We might think of systems
thinking as basically,

28
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,450
looking at things in terms of

29
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,310
the bigger picture or trying to

30
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,200
understand how are
things connected to

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,340
each other within
some whole entity.

32
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,535
So what is a system?

33
00:01:20,535 --> 00:01:23,150
Well, a system is a perceived
hole that's made up of

34
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,065
parts all of which interact
towards some common purpose.

35
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:30,530
The ability to perceive that
system and the quality of

36
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,480
our perception is actually
also part of that system.

37
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,950
One of the goals of
systems thinking,

38
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,230
is to help us improve our quality

39
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,660
of perception of
the whole system,

40
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,089
and also of its individual
parts or components

41
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:45,329
and of the interaction

42
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:47,500
between those
components and parts.

43
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,450
Let's take a step towards
defining systems thinking.

44
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,730
The first thing we have to
acknowledge is this doesn't

45
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,940
represent a single discipline
and in fact inherently,

46
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,470
it's intended to link a bunch
of disparate disciplines.

47
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,270
Systems thinking emphasizes
the relationships

48
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,950
between different
types of structures.

49
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,094
So for example, from a
public health perspective,

50
00:02:06,094 --> 00:02:08,030
we might have biological systems,

51
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,250
we might have
organizational systems

52
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,730
and we might have
political systems,

53
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,600
we need to understand the
interplay between those.

54
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,520
The paradigm here with systems

55
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,080
thinking is that we
really are trying to

56
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,000
consider these connections among

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,025
different components
in the system,

58
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:24,020
that's going to
allow us to plan for

59
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,660
the implications of
those interactions,

60
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,210
how well they go or
how they're conducted.

61
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,540
As I said earlier,

62
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,000
systems thinking inherently

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,160
requires trans-disciplinary
thinking.

64
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,600
So we want to take
ourselves out of

65
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,075
an individual discipline
and a link disciplines,

66
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,850
and it also like much of
public health requires

67
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,265
active engagement of stakeholders
for any defined system.

68
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,625
So systems thinking which is it?

69
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,100
Is it a powerful language to

70
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,799
communicate and investigate
complex issues,

71
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:53,780
or is it a confusing
amorphous body

72
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,945
of theories, methods and tools.

73
00:02:55,945 --> 00:02:57,485
Actually that's a trick question.

74
00:02:57,485 --> 00:02:58,670
I think it's absolutely both,

75
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,530
but hopefully we're starting to

76
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,365
sort through and make things
a little more clear to you.

77
00:03:03,365 --> 00:03:05,450
So systems thinking involves

78
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,910
lots of different
models and theories.

79
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,110
Some of them can be very

80
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,180
grand and very widely applicable.

81
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,130
Some of them are going to
be incredibly focused and

82
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,365
specific to a
particular phenomenon.

83
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:16,760
There's also going
to be a wide range

84
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,140
of theories we can draw on.

85
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,870
Theory being some
rational set of ideas or

86
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,490
principles that's intended
to explain something.

87
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,020
There's a wide variety of
scientific methods we can use.

88
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,795
Some methods we can use to

89
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:32,450
identify phenomenon we'd
like to investigate

90
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,880
and highlight or layout

91
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,645
at a high level how we
can acquire knowledge.

92
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:39,950
Finally, there's lots of
different instruments

93
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,120
and tools we can use,

94
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,890
these being specific things we

95
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,795
can do to conduct experiments,

96
00:03:44,795 --> 00:03:46,580
make observations or otherwise

97
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,170
go out and collect and analyze

98
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,580
data that is going give us

99
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,460
the information we want
and need about a system.

100
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,620
There's four critical
points I'd like

101
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,360
you to remember about
systems thinking.

102
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,730
One is, understanding systems

103
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,900
that relate to humans which

104
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,325
is what we do in public health,

105
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,595
requires that you
understand people.

106
00:04:03,595 --> 00:04:05,330
Two, efforts to achieve

107
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,610
larger and systemic understanding

108
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,620
don't negate the need
for specialization,

109
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,360
so we don't want
everybody to always be up

110
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,190
in the clouds thinking
about a system,

111
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,930
we still very much
need people with

112
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,760
deep specialized knowledge in

113
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,045
particular areas
of public health.

114
00:04:19,045 --> 00:04:22,535
Three, systems thinking
requires information exchange

115
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:25,630
and synthesis across
organizational boundaries,

116
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,500
so we want these
different components and

117
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,570
parts of the system
to be talking to each

118
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,360
other and exchanging
information and also we want to

119
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,630
be synthesizing that information
across organizations.

120
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,999
Finally four, many
different methodologies

121
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:40,070
are available to approach
system thinking.

122
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,385
So one of the challenges you
may have is trying to match

123
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:45,060
a certain methodology to

124
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,075
a particular public health issue.

125
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:49,775
We'll talk about that
in a subsequent module.

126
00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:51,800
I'd like to give
you an example of

127
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,720
systems thinking
just to highlight

128
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,310
this and maybe cement it

129
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,110
a little more clearly
in your mind.

130
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,850
So let's think about
a very important

131
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,205
public health effort,
tobacco control.

132
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:03,080
We could break
tobacco control down

133
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,820
into four major elements,

134
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,960
those are highlighted on the
bottom of the figure here.

135
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,990
Management, processes, programs

136
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,475
and services and
finally outcomes.

137
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:15,230
So in terms of management,

138
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,030
we're going to have
issues anytime we talk

139
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,160
about tobacco control,
what's our budget?

140
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,900
How well can we mobilize

141
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,450
resources to contribute
to this effort?

142
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,430
What is the existing
infrastructure

143
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,780
that we're going to work within,

144
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,750
and what collaborations and

145
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,775
partnerships and technical
assistance are available?

146
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:36,390
So that's management
in the middle,

147
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,410
in the blue squares,

148
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,240
we're looking at processes.

149
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,830
These processes can contribute
either to systemic change,

150
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,850
so that might be

151
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,240
more global advocacy
for tobacco control,

152
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,225
could be efforts to monitor
the tobacco industry,

153
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,100
but also you'll see
that bottom red arrow

154
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,080
for individual change.

155
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,210
That's absolutely critical
to and that's going to be

156
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,700
more involving for example,

157
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,525
the media and public education.

158
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:03,570
Moving to the right
and the graphic,

159
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,485
now we're looking at
programs and services.

160
00:06:05,485 --> 00:06:07,030
This is going to involve
things that are more

161
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,700
systemic like a policy
intervention or

162
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,260
things that are more
individual level

163
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,210
like youth policies
specifically in

164
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,010
programs or the provision and

165
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,390
availability of
cessation services.

166
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,480
Finally, shifting to
the right again we have

167
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,520
our outcomes and
you'll see highlighted

168
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,945
here the importance of us

169
00:06:22,945 --> 00:06:25,090
surveilling those
outcomes to decide

170
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,115
our tobacco control
efforts making

171
00:06:27,115 --> 00:06:30,040
a difference or making the
difference we want them to.

172
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,329
So I'd like to also identify
some systems thinking needs,

173
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:36,220
where we have employed systems

174
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,095
thinking and applied
it to public health.

175
00:06:38,095 --> 00:06:39,580
It's often focused on just

176
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,620
describing or modeling systems,

177
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,065
so what is the baseline
condition of this system?

178
00:06:45,065 --> 00:06:46,535
What we haven't done,

179
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:50,410
is investigating the impact
of interventions on systems,

180
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,400
which of course is something we

181
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,540
want to do in public health.

182
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,430
We identify a
problem in a system,

183
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,130
we deliver an intervention
and try to fix that problem.

184
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,905
Our research hasn't really
caught up with that need.

185
00:06:59,905 --> 00:07:01,600
So we really need to develop

186
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,910
multi-disciplinary
tools and methods so we

187
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,724
can do intervention research

188
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:08,064
and conduct evidence synthesis,

189
00:07:08,064 --> 00:07:10,510
and that's going to lead to
greater integrative learning

190
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,589
and better understanding

191
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:13,330
across all of these
structures that we

192
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,575
study as part of public health.

193
00:07:15,575 --> 00:07:18,690
Finally, what can systems
thinking do for public health?

194
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,955
Well, as I just mentioned,

195
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:22,555
it can help us
systematically synthesized

196
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:25,420
existing data across all
the different disciplines

197
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,250
that comprise public health.

198
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,695
It can help us identify gaps
in our existing knowledge,

199
00:07:30,695 --> 00:07:32,840
and once we do
identify those gaps

200
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,880
that can help us guide
research priorities.

201
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,980
So if we identify
a gap and what we

202
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,080
know and assess how critical

203
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,420
that gap is that
can help us frame

204
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,220
research questions
to help fill in

205
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,475
that gap with future research.

206
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:48,710
Finally, we can identify
leverage points in the system,

207
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,250
so systems thinking can
help us ask what changes in

208
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,230
this system are most likely to

209
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,270
lead to the desired outcomes?

210
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,380
So we're always trying to

211
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,510
find the change that's
going to give us

212
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,840
the highest probability
of our desired result and

213
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,010
systems thinking gives us

214
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:07,019
some powerful tools
to do just that.
