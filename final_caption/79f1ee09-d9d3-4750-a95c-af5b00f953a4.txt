1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,450
Correct. That's the goal.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:10,410
Okay. So here are your sides. All right, I.

3
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:20,800
All right, I'd like to introduce our first speaker today. Hello.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:30,370
My name is Scarlett, and I'm going to be talking to you about the outbreak investigation of Nipah virus disease in Kerala, India, in 2018.

5
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:37,750
My colleagues and I did, and this was the first Nipah virus outbreak in South India.

6
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:46,360
So just a little bit of background on Nipah virus. It is a do not virus and the natural animal reservoir is in fruit bats.

7
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,990
It's considered an emerging virus causing severe respiratory illness and encephalitis in humans.

8
00:00:53,470 --> 00:01:02,940
It has two genetic lineages an eye view, which is short for a virus, Malaysian and Bangladesh,

9
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,540
and then it's considered a potential threat to global health security.

10
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:14,920
And the W.H.O. designated it as one of their top ten priority diseases in 2018, and it is still on that list today.

11
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:28,650
So about the virology. It is a virus genus in the family pyramid severe day it's a negative sense.

12
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,540
Single stranded non segment and RNA virus with you.

13
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:41,580
You look for symmetry in it. The genome has a consecutive arrangement of six different genes which I have listed here.

14
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:51,030
The fusion glycoprotein and the attachment glycoprotein are what the virion uses for attachment and entry into the hospital.

15
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,240
And then so getting into our case definitions a little bit.

16
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:10,410
So we defined a suspected case as someone who presents with a fever and at least one of the other seven signs or symptoms which include body aches,

17
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:23,550
vomiting, cough, shortness of breath, new onset, altered sensorial, just kind of like changes in cognitive state and then viral encephalitis,

18
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:33,210
a probable case as a suspected case who had reported contact with a Nipah virus case or died before clinical samples could be collected,

19
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,920
and then a confirmed case with a suspected or probable case with Nipah virus

20
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:45,120
with an RNA positive reverse transcriptase PCR analysis of any body fluids,

21
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:53,940
specimen or any serum specimen testing positive for the Nipah virus idea by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.

22
00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:01,110
And then because this was an outbreak, we did not have to get consent from any of the patients for their samples to be tested.

23
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:10,590
So these are the types of specimens that we collected. So or pharyngeal swabs and endotracheal aspirins.

24
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,870
If the patient was intubated, we collected four milliliters of blood.

25
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:21,540
I want the leader of cerebrospinal fluid, five milliliters of sterile urine,

26
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:29,910
and those were transported between two and eight degrees Celsius to the Manipur Mrpl Center for Virus Research.

27
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,560
And all the samples were processed under biosafety level three conditions.

28
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:45,540
So just a little bit of our assay to use real time RTI, PCR to test for the viral RNA.

29
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,930
We use two different protocols that our two colleagues.

30
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:01,990
Uh, excuse me. The two of our colleagues suggested targeting the Nucleocapsid gene.

31
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:12,700
We did serological analysis to look for anti Nipah virus IgG Yemen IgG by linked Immunosorbent assay.

32
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:24,550
And then we used my next generation sequencing analysis to look at the sequences of the RNA and then created phylogenetic trees based on those.

33
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:35,850
So we did interviews for all of the family members of the cases, the friends of the cases, community leaders and health care workers.

34
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,940
We asked about illness, onset of the case, the course of the illness,

35
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,280
movement of the case within the community and contacts preceding and during the illness.

36
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,750
And then for each person who had contact with the case, we asked about their specific contact,

37
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:00,990
about if there was any touching or coughing, anything like that.

38
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,100
All case details were reviewed for hospitals.

39
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:15,629
So admissions records, patient logs. And then when possible, we reviewed surveillance footage within the hospitals to kind of track the index cases,

40
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:20,100
movements and their interactions with the other cases within the hospitals.

41
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,630
And then we also collected samples near the residence of the index case and the workplace of the index case.

42
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,190
We also tested his pets.

43
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:41,130
He had rabbits and ducks. We tested their vehicle specimens and or swabs for any of the virus.

44
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:50,610
So just a little bit about the outbreak description. So this outbreak occurred between May 2nd and May 29th and 2018.

45
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:59,640
We had 23 cases of Nvidia's Nipah virus disease identified, including the index case.

46
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:06,660
The index case was not lab confirmed. So we had 18 confirmed cases and four probable cases.

47
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,399
The transmission occurred in three different hospitals within the postcode district,

48
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,440
which we talk about in like as three different clusters with each hospital being a different cluster.

49
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:24,000
So I apologize for the President and chief and I did attempt to preface this before.

50
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:31,200
So to move headquarters hospitals in parameter grow this hospital one the government,

51
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,579
medical, college and postcode is hospital two and the community health center.

52
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:44,970
And the last three is hospital three. The case fatality rate was 91%, with 21 deaths and two survivors.

53
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:50,190
The median age of cases was 45 years and 65% were male.

54
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,480
The mean incubation period was 9.5 days.

55
00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:02,010
And then the most common symptoms that we saw, just a few were fever, any respiratory symptoms.

56
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,520
And then that altered some sort of we talked about a little bit earlier.

57
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,060
And then this is an AP curve that we created for your viewing pleasure.

58
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:18,750
So here we can see this is where oh, and this is by date of onset of illness.

59
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,140
This is where the index case first has onset of illness.

60
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:31,200
And then if you would like to call it 9.5 days to make sure we can see this is where the next case started having onset of symptoms.

61
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,239
I believe this was either his father's brother, but we'll get into those details later.

62
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:44,750
Don't worry. And then the orange bars are the two cases who survived, and then the rest are mortality use.

63
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:56,580
So just a little bit about our lab results. So 18 out of the 23 cases, we were able to have clinical specimens.

64
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:03,659
Now, all of those 18 clinical specimens were positive for Ebola virus through PCR and negative

65
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:09,900
for all other cases of encephalitis or respiratory infections or serologic analysis.

66
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:20,340
13 out of those 18 had anti Nipah virus AGM antibodies, and then four out of those 13 had IgG as well as AGM.

67
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,420
Five of those cases had neither. And then for a phylogenetic analysis,

68
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:38,790
we were able to identify that our strain from Kerala was similar but not identical to the virus phenotype B that we talked about earlier,

69
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,940
which is Nipah virus, Bangladesh. And then the fusion protein was highly conserved.

70
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,590
This is our phylogenetic tree analysis.

71
00:08:50,640 --> 00:09:07,220
So we can see in A, B, C, E and F where our viral strain is forming the sub plane with all of these things being genotype B and then here in D,

72
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:16,170
we see how the fusion protein was conserved. And so that similarities in all of the other genotype B lineages.

73
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,260
All right. So getting into the index case,

74
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:33,800
the index case is a 27 year old male in the gender of village in Poland up in the coastal district in 2018 who developed a fever and myalgia.

75
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:42,290
May 3rd, he presented hospital one. So I think it be okay here.

76
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,320
So we get to see a little bit. This is where the index case lives.

77
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:54,150
This was the first hospital he attended. This is the second hospital he attended.

78
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,040
And then this is another hospital hospital theory where the third cluster was.

79
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:05,900
And this red line just kind of tracks his route of travel.

80
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:12,410
And from hospital, one hospital to he was driven in a private car, but by his father.

81
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:20,540
So I think what we're going to do here is I'm going to show you this instead of just showing you important slides and talking about you,

82
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:25,500
see, you have a nice visual to look back. Such difficult time.

83
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:39,770
So. So we can see here the index case was admitted to hospital one at 8 p.m. on May 3rd and the fourth he was shifted to the male ward,

84
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:44,810
which we see right here. And he was located near the entrance.

85
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:56,780
So we can see, unfortunately, that provided a big platform for many people to be exposed and come in contact with him.

86
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:06,830
So in this male ward, there were 22 people which included patients and their companions, housekeeping staff and nurses.

87
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,709
So Case two was the brother of Case one, the index case.

88
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:17,090
Case five was the father of the index case. Case seven.

89
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:24,110
Here was his nurse who provided him direct nursing care for about 10 hours.

90
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:35,640
So after close contact, their cases three, four, eight, nine and ten were all either patients on this ward or companions of those cases.

91
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:47,510
And interestingly, a lot of the companions of cases, they were seen to help him get in and out of bed system as needed.

92
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,950
So that also increased their contact and likelihood of being infected.

93
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:57,320
And then Case six here was actually that of the index case who came to visit.

94
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,030
Right. And then moving on on May 4th.

95
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,570
So that night he had complained to fever.

96
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:15,020
His cough was increasing, just having vomiting onset, increased altered sensorium.

97
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:27,440
And then on May 5th, he was transferred to the second hospital at 8 a.m. and at 10 a.m. he reached the hospital after that car drive with his father,

98
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:34,850
where he was reported to vomit on his father, as well as cough, a loss of contact with bodily fluids there.

99
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:43,820
And then at between time to 10 a.m., the patient was admitted to the emergency department, which we can see here.

100
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:56,150
And he was after his entering into the emergency department, the referring doctors wanted to get a c p scan.

101
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,760
There were three different failed attempts to get a CT scan due to persistent coughing.

102
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,180
And so in the course of that, after the first two times,

103
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:15,110
they moved him back to the emergency department from this 18 corridor room and then back to the city corridor to get the city.

104
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,400
And here we can see so many different people walk past him.

105
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,570
There's lots of different contacts, different cases.

106
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:38,930
So we can see cases 1814, 1913, 2012, 15 and 16 were all infected in this corridor.

107
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:53,930
And then May 3rd, we can see other cases presenting that were secondary to those primary cases infected from the index case.

108
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,040
So case ten here. Who was in the hospital?

109
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:09,320
Hospital one on May 4th. We may here we talked about was admitted to hospital three for treatment and then case

110
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:18,410
23 was actually across across the way from his time and was infected in Hospital three.

111
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,090
And then kind of some thought about transmission.

112
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,700
Most transmission from case one occurred about two days before his death, when his coughing was most severe.

113
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,690
No transmission events related to burial,

114
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:46,430
and those who contracted contracted the disease had longer and closer contact with bodily fluids or coughed on.

115
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:52,010
Of the 60 environmental samples collected around the index case in residence.

116
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:58,070
All were negative for Nipah virus as well as his pets were negative.

117
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,670
So only the index case was infected in the community.

118
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,480
And we hypothesized that the initial transmission event was a do not.

119
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:18,470
To me, romantic transmission for fruit bats versus bird breeding season is in April and the index case was very fond of animals,

120
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:28,910
so he hypothesized that he probably came in contact with an infected baby bat and or the main mode of transmission.

121
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:35,690
We used to be droplet transmission and there was extensive nosocomial spread which we talked about earlier.

122
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:45,710
And we believe that those this was because inadequate infection control measures, lack of compliance with infection control measures.

123
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:53,050
Very few of the doctors and providers and health care workers did not wear masks.

124
00:15:53,060 --> 00:16:01,250
Very few wore gloves. There was a lack of hand washing, also altruistic behavior from the patient companions, helping them get in and out of bed.

125
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,180
Poor regulation of visitors in hospitals and extended wait time for procedures,

126
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:14,480
as well as his movement inside the city quarter and in different wards and departments.

127
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,110
And then some limitations. Recall bias.

128
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:29,870
During interviews, patients were asked to recall information about their exposure, sometimes weeks before, so that could lead to some recall bias.

129
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:37,310
The initial transmission event so known how to do is hypothesize about his initial exposure from the community.

130
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:43,219
Then, because this was an active outbreak investigation, we could have missed information on cases,

131
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:49,070
mis different transmission dynamics and introduced some bias into our study.

132
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,430
Thank you for your time and letting me talk about you. Do you have any questions?

133
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:09,510
Thank you. Hi. Yes. So I was in med school like right across the border when this was happening and that was amazing.

134
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:16,020
And we were actually sending alarms that, you know, you could expect cases floating across the state border.

135
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:23,970
Um, I declined. It was. It was nice. Oh, I think you asked me with pronunciations of the complex mean.

136
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:33,809
Thank you. Um, I just wanted to ask, like, oh, is this something we could have done to break the cycle in terms of the explosion,

137
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:39,600
transmission across the quarantine for like when they were going crazy, do you think?

138
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:47,070
Yeah, absolutely. I think they if we would have made sure that the the patient the index case had a mask on,

139
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,770
as well as kept him isolated and not just like hanging out in the corridor with people passing by him.

140
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,729
I think that would have been really important as well as like making sure that people

141
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:01,620
who are coming in contact with him were wearing like kind of like droplet proportion,

142
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:08,970
things like that. Masks mature and they were wearing gloves, handwashing procedures, kind of like those infection control prevention measures.

143
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:15,490
Of course. Thank you. All right.

144
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:22,060
Now, what is there any approved treatments that can help reduce the case fatality rate?

145
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:26,750
Absolutely. So a little bit we have looked into.

146
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:35,080
But we have some way there are some like monoclonal antibodies as well as some antivirals that are used for Hendra virus.

147
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:40,900
I'm not sure how well they work, but that's definitely something we should look into.

148
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:50,040
Thank you for bringing it up. Having surveillance footage is not something you see very often.

149
00:18:51,510 --> 00:19:01,590
To what degree do you think you were able to identify, you know, future opportunities for intervention and like linkages from that footage?

150
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:08,430
Was it a was it a big help in being able to match that compared to what people have been able to do in the past?

151
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,140
Absolutely. I really do think that it was helpful, especially in that corridor.

152
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:18,790
I feel like it's you know, people don't remember who they're walking past or, you know, who is in that group in the hallway or not.

153
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:22,740
So I think it was super beneficial and especially that it's a situation.

154
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,739
The question. All right.

155
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:43,330
Thank you very much. That. Oh, God, I'm right here.

156
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:54,720
I want to take you home. I'm still waiting for the day with a microphone on and then, like, brings three medics in here teaching him.

157
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:58,690
But the sound is coming, like, from my office. I think it's going to happen.

158
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:37,340
Okay. I have slowly been making a switch with you as I go through different virus topics.

159
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:45,680
We've been now spending more time with viruses that cause chronic infections and more long term infections like when we are looking at our businesses.

160
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:53,569
So with that switch. So we start today talking about human papillomavirus.

161
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:57,500
And I'm going to use human papillomavirus is actually an opportunity to talk about herd

162
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:04,430
immunity just because they're it's just a great it's a great example to kind of think about,

163
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:11,570
well, here are herd immunity means where herd immunity does not mean. And so we're going to start there.

164
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:20,060
We're going to move again to HIV, this time talking about HIV in terms of treatment and prevention from an antiviral perspective.

165
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:25,190
So we'll move into that and then we'll be getting into hepatitis later and some of these

166
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:30,809
other chronic infections where the antiviral piece of it starts to become really important.

167
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:36,980
And so this is where we diverge a bit from the vaccinology side of virology,

168
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:42,020
and we'll be talking more about therapies and prophylactics as we go here.

169
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:52,010
So but first, human papillomavirus, this is still largely kind of important from a vaccine landscape perspective,

170
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:56,150
but this is also very common cause cancer.

171
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:05,329
So every time you hear somebody say, well, it's not like vaccines can prevent cancer.

172
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:08,390
Vaccines can prevent cancer. So let's get to that.

173
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:14,810
So human papillomavirus, these are small, non enveloped viruses.

174
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,650
They are double stranded DNA. They have a circular genome.

175
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,360
They have because they with this DNA virus,

176
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:32,430
they have this sort of characteristic schedule of how they produce proteins throughout the cycle of the virus that I'll show you more about.

177
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:40,640
So this is a picture of the genome here on the left here.

178
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:47,900
And then here on the right, you've got this schematic of all of the different functions of these different genes.

179
00:22:48,350 --> 00:23:00,620
Now, there is these are separated into the genes and the genes e genes, our early phase genes, our genes are late phase genes.

180
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:11,270
So the early phase it's tightly regulated in the purpose of the early phase is to allow HPV to establish latency in cells.

181
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:18,890
Now sometimes the virus will integrate with the host's genome during this early phase.

182
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:26,870
It's possible, but this then, if it does integration, it kind of destroys the virus, its ability to replicate further.

183
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:38,140
And so you see this regulation of replication, this integration and replication that happens during the early phase.

184
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,930
It's very kind of tightly controlled and regulated. These these parts of the process.

185
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:53,780
Notice that the L proteins are the capsid proteins, and these are produced until the late stages, the late region of the genome.

186
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:02,450
So it's only later in the in the virus lifecycle that you are starting to produce the the cancer proteins that are needed for final virus.

187
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,300
So in the early stage, it's going to create a circular genome like this right here.

188
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,990
The circular genome is maintained in the nucleus,

189
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:20,269
these copies are made and then these copies are going to be present in daughter cells of the of this cell that it started out in.

190
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:24,140
So I will show you a picture in a second of what that daughter cells look like.

191
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:36,919
Eve five right here. This is ae5 plays a really big part in growth regulation and then late gene expression

192
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:42,650
is only going to happen if this genome is carried forward into a terminal.

193
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:51,049
Differentiate itself. Now, if you get to this late genome replication because you're going to terminally differentiated,

194
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:55,820
so you're going to have the production of these this major capsid protein L one and the

195
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:04,219
production of the minor caps and protein out to L one determines the serotype of HPV.

196
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:09,260
So you've heard about HPV is the type 16. There's all these different types of HPV, and we'll go through these.

197
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:14,750
But those types are referring to the specific type of L1 that's produced.

198
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:20,540
So each HPV is going to be producing just a specific type of of L one and those

199
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:28,550
are those are numbered l to the function of L two basically binds the HPV.

200
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:38,139
And L2 kind of serves as a kind of binds to the cellular trafficking mechanism to get this genome

201
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:43,150
where it needs to go when it's infecting a new cell and gets it brings this genome to the nucleus.

202
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:50,500
So when I'm talking about what happens this early versus this late phase function,

203
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,150
the production before I before I go in there, I don't think I present this later.

204
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:58,060
And I think I've heard and may have already told you the story, but I can tell you again.

205
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:04,480
So L1 forms the the capsid proteins that are recognized by the immune system.

206
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:09,490
Oh one is also the what the vaccines try to replicate.

207
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:18,459
L One can actually self-assemble into virus like particles or VlPs if you just have a whole bunch of L1 in solution,

208
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:24,340
it will form part little particles that look like empty HPV viruses.

209
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:31,960
And this is how the HPV vaccine that was the advance that actually made the HPV vaccine possible.

210
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:40,239
There was a scientist that was producing a whole bunch of these ones and sent them off for electron

211
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,960
microscopy just to make sure that he had produced the protein that he needed for his experiment.

212
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,690
And they sent back a picture that looked like a whole bunch of virus like you've seen this pictures are showing before of these clusters of viruses.

213
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:55,030
And so it showed like a whole bunch of virus using guidance in virus, essentially proteins.

214
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:03,190
And so they tried again and they had self-assembled. And so he said, What the heck, let's inject it into a mouse and see if it's immunogenic.

215
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:10,450
And that's how they made the first VLP virus like particle based vaccine because it was you can take a whole bunch

216
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:19,569
of Self-assembled L1 and use it in a vaccine and it prompts an immune response as if you had injected a full virus.

217
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:22,930
But it's empty. It's just has it just has the potential.

218
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:32,410
So it's kind of a cool idea. You can kind of see how this is a sort of scientifically a progenitor of how we think about the RNA vaccine.

219
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:38,950
Right, the RNA vaccine. You introduce the marinade that just produces that protein, that surface protein.

220
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:44,709
Right. All right.

221
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:50,540
So let's look at how HPV interacts.

222
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:54,430
So, you know, to this point, we've been talking with the exception maybe of RSV.

223
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:07,780
We've been talking quite a bit about a single virus in a single cell and not a lot about kind of this cell's development or about how,

224
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,750
you know, multiple cells kind of work can work together.

225
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:21,610
So you have the initial in this picture, the the different epithelial labels or layers are going to be indicated here.

226
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:27,790
And the other side of the the diagram and the virus is going to be in the small gray circles.

227
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,120
And so what you have is the virus is going to affect through some sort of cut

228
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:39,370
or break in the skin layer that allows the virus to infect in the basal layer.

229
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:50,050
So in the nucleus it's going to form its circular DNA in the basal layer, in a in a nucleus of a cell that is located in the Visalia.

230
00:28:52,540 --> 00:29:00,400
These are so they're it's going to establish initial infection and persistence of this viral layer at this point.

231
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:08,140
So let's see, as it moves through other layers,

232
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:17,830
you're going to have the genome kind of of HPV kind of regulated to have initial kind of establishment of the persistence in that secular DNA.

233
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:23,380
But then you're going to have amplification of the genome happening as it goes up through the layers.

234
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,870
You're going to get to the granular left layer.

235
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:35,469
At that point, it initiates virus assembly, and then as it gets to the dead cells in the very top of the skin layer,

236
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:39,010
that's where it's going to have shedding of the virus that was assembled,

237
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:45,640
kind of slowly replicated and assembled as these cells move up through the skin layer.

238
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:51,600
So you can see on the right how these different proteins play into this.

239
00:29:51,610 --> 00:30:00,879
Right. You have these early proteins start the process. And then as you get through kind of the replication steps,

240
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,840
you have production of these capsid proteins that are needed for final viral assembly

241
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:08,920
and then you have complete virus available once that that you have a terminal cell.

242
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:13,150
That's all is that and that shutting the virus can spread from the very top.

243
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:29,680
So far, as I mentioned, that one protein comes with the number and that's how we label the different, quote unquote, serotypes of HPV.

244
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:37,600
So we tend to group these into mucosal and genital types and not only postal.

245
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,559
Q To the cutaneous types, the now because opportunity sites,

246
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,330
those are types that cause skin works warts in the hands where on the feet there are a ton of types.

247
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:53,620
We don't worry about those types quite so much. It's the mucosal genital types that we worry about, around 40 types,

248
00:30:54,040 --> 00:31:02,950
and those are further split out into high risk, high risk types or low risk types.

249
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:13,330
So you've got 16 and 18 are your highest risk types and then your lower risk types are six and 11.

250
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:22,480
The lower risk types will lead to things like low grade cervical abnormalities, genital warts or laryngeal papilloma us.

251
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:35,320
Now these are all, you know, laryngeal papilloma is low risk types means sort of low risk of event, but they can still be significant events.

252
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:47,830
Their high risk types are a higher risk of producing these low grade cervical abnormalities, precursors to cancer,

253
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:53,950
including cervical cancer in our genital cancer, and then also high grade cervical abnormalities.

254
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:59,380
So serious abnormalities that are sort of high level of concern.

255
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:14,990
So. So HPV by the numbers is the most commonly sexually transmitted infection in the United States is actually HPV.

256
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:21,890
The majority of men and women are infected with some some type or another at least once in their lifetime.

257
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:29,810
It is a we've talked about this before. This idea of necessary but not sufficient is a necessary but not sufficient cause of cervical cancer.

258
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,890
So if you can get rid of HPV, you can certainly get rid of cervical cancer.

259
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,200
But not every HPV infection is going to lead to cervical cancer.

260
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,970
And here you can see the natural history of HPV infection.

261
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:52,400
It is initial infection leading. Now, some people will clear that initial infection, but others will establish a persistent infection.

262
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,120
The same. This is a cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and different.

263
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,560
But the higher the grade, the worse the abnormality is.

264
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:13,100
So you can have a level one C and you can have persistent infection, then leading to a higher level of C and two or three.

265
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:22,760
This then might lead to clearance at this point, theoretically, but we tend to see progression here to cervical cancer.

266
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:26,690
No, the really, really long timescale we're talking about here.

267
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:32,410
So this is from initial infection to establishing persistent infection.

268
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:39,530
We're talking about a year and then to having the initial kind of cervical abnormalities.

269
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:44,690
If here you're seeing 1 to 5 years and then decades later, cervical cancer will develop.

270
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,810
This presents a lot of problems for a for a virus epidemiologist.

271
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,030
Right. If you want to test an intervention,

272
00:33:53,690 --> 00:34:00,710
it's going to take decades before you see if you actually reduce the virus enough to be able to change what's happened with cancer.

273
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:13,409
Also think about here. You know, I think you're all sort of familiar with public opposition to HPV vaccine in that areas.

274
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:15,450
And I've got I believe I have some data in here about there,

275
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:24,149
but some areas where there's been such a linkage with HPV as a sexually transmitted disease,

276
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:34,170
that there's been hesitancy around vaccinating kind of pre sexual onset teenagers against this,

277
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:40,860
that you see kind of the the scale of time we're talking about, you know, that you you need to intervene.

278
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:55,950
And so here, if you kind of look at this again, so this is looking at the risks of HPV persistence and progression on a population level.

279
00:34:55,950 --> 00:35:08,129
So here we've got on this y axis, we've got the percentage of carcinogenic HPV infections and years since infection with a person and genic HPV.

280
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:11,490
So something that is a type that has the potential to be carcinogenic.

281
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:18,960
And we see that over time you have more and more clearance happen.

282
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:26,800
But then you have this, you know, some people continue to continue continue to maintain persistence and then you have cervical abnormalities.

283
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,330
The high grades or abnormalities can grow slightly over time.

284
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:38,610
Now, about ten years later, you take this this small subset here.

285
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,310
So these are the years since diagnosis with the CIA three.

286
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:53,719
And you can see that more and more of these will eventually lead to invasion within decades of diagnosis of the ACA.

287
00:35:53,720 --> 00:36:00,300
And so we see that things that they're diagnosed here like within a few years of infection with the HPV type,

288
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,580
you can see about 50% of them within 30 years will eventually.

289
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:23,569
Develop severe disease. So this presents some challenges from for screening programs to be able to initiate

290
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:29,300
HPV testing for the purpose of preventing down the line preventing cervical cancer.

291
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:34,909
So. Here on the bottom,

292
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:46,790
we've got an example of like an optimize prevention and testing strategy for and then you've got vaccination on here in terms of what type,

293
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:59,000
you know, using pap screening, using other types of of testing and HPV kind of HPV testing to try to supplement it,

294
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,340
to try to identify as many as possible.

295
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:10,910
But you kind of see you've got your biggest opportunity to detect HPV infection right in the beginning here.

296
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:21,350
And then you sort of have to switch to pre-cancer abnormality screening, and then you've got cancer screening, very low prevalence.

297
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:24,650
It's going to be difficult to pick up from a screening program perspective.

298
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:36,170
So something that gets missed is.

299
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:42,200
So I think that most people are familiar with HPV associated cancers as being cervical cancers.

300
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:53,570
And you can see that 90% of cervical cancers are attributable to any HPV in general.

301
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:57,920
So remember I mentioned this is like a necessary but not sufficient cause for the most part.

302
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,800
You can probably eliminate, it's estimated, about 90% of cervical cancer by eliminating HPV.

303
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:10,430
And most of those are going to be attributable to types 16 and 18, the highest risk types.

304
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:16,640
And then there's this long list that gets you up to 80% if you include all of these types of HPV here.

305
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:26,210
This is where you continue to see kind of debates about how many subtypes to include in HPV vaccines, because the more types you prevent,

306
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:34,160
the more types you get rid of, the more types that you would prevent are the the larger percentage of cervical cancer you prevent.

307
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:39,680
There's also been some debate, though, about whether the more types you would like,

308
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:46,610
whether other types would kind of back fill that niche if we were to get rid of certain types like has happened with other vaccines,

309
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:52,040
particularly pertussis. Now, you know, HPV is a virus, not a bacteria,

310
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:59,260
but I think there's concern about whether there would be expansion of other types if we were to kind of remove low light,

311
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:03,020
continue to add more low risk factors to the vaccine.

312
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:14,180
Something that I always like to make sure to point out, though, is so we're used to seeing the cervical cancer data.

313
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:29,120
I think that's where the public message has been focused on. But notice the anal cancer data in men is pretty striking and all rectal cancers that low

314
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:36,710
numbers but a high percentage and then oral pharyngeal cancers in men is very high as well.

315
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:47,450
So as this background, this vaccine, the vaccine against HPV kind of made it through the cost effectiveness conversation and into approval.

316
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,860
This was, you know, the majority.

317
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:55,820
And I'll talk about when we you know, we're going to talk about herd immunity.

318
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,900
A lot of the case was focused around this herd immunity idea that, you know,

319
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:08,989
we can reduce even more cervical cancer for reducing transmission and we're reducing we're kind of protecting the susceptible person.

320
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:14,420
But then we're also reducing transmission events by eliminating the virus in sexual partners.

321
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:27,710
But there is a there is a solid case here as well for protection of cancer in people that do not identify as female as well.

322
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:45,620
So here's kind of a snapshot of cervical cancer global mortality in the the gray bars with incidence in the orange bars,

323
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:53,150
we have mortality and you see both there is disparity across the world in the amount of cancer that's happening,

324
00:40:53,420 --> 00:41:03,350
but also the difference between incidence and mortality and that the difference between incidence and mortality is going to come down to screening.

325
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:10,070
Right. You see you have countries with very similar incidences that have very different

326
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:28,430
mortalities and that's going to come down to their screening protocols. So the disparity is great to the point that there have been estimates that by

327
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:36,469
2030 that mortality becomes concentrated in less developed regions of the world,

328
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:42,379
so that we're going to see a big shift in cervical cancer mortality in in areas where

329
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,370
we're not having the screening programs and not having the vaccination programs.

330
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:57,089
And as I mentioned before, all of these other cancer types as well.

331
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:08,250
You can kind of see how historically over the decades, these different cancer types have changed over time and sort of shifted in different regions.

332
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:25,720
So specifically looking at HPV and how it impacts head and neck cancer if we have that.

333
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:32,000
So here in this figure, we're going to see HPV is going to again be the gray circles.

334
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:38,650
It's going to enter in it's going to reach the tonsils or crypt, which is which is the thing.

335
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:54,640
And once it infects the cancer epithelium, you've got this beginning of the basal stem differentiation happening in this area here,

336
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:00,670
leading then to dysplasia and to carcinoma that will happen in here.

337
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:08,530
So these red genes, these mutations here.

338
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:16,450
So these red genes are all upregulated in this process of the creation of head and neck cancer.

339
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,160
And so you can see again,

340
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:29,770
E6 and E7 that the upregulation of E6 and E7 during this process is going to increase the risk of dysplasia leading to carcinoma.

341
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,060
All rights reserved.

342
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:46,150
Mentioned recombinant vaccines is the technology that was used to create the vaccine like particles that were used in the HPV vaccine.

343
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:52,609
So basically what what is being done is they use genetic engineering to produce the antigens.

344
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:56,380
This happens for HPV. It happens for the hepatitis B vaccine.

345
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:01,210
The number of there are some flu vaccines that are made through recombinant technologies.

346
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:11,710
And basically the way this works is you have gene segments for the surface proteins that these viruses introduce inserted in the yeast,

347
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:17,230
and then that yeast is going to produce mass quantities of the vaccine antigen or the protein.

348
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:25,720
So when you do that with HPV, the way this is approached is subunit vaccine produced by recombinant DNA.

349
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:32,890
It's a HPV one major capsid protein, and that one's going to form these virus like particles.

350
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:39,470
Now, you can include different types of L1, and that's going to give you these different multivalent vaccines.

351
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:46,930
So Gardasil or HPV four, I've got an update and I'll later side on to who the approvals are for.

352
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:58,870
Keeps changing. But Gardasil, HPV four has L1 Type 16 and then L1 from type 18 and then L1 from 26 and then L1 from type 11.

353
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:08,620
And then there's a nine valent vaccine for that's kind of related to that platform as well.

354
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:16,479
And then there's server, server REX, Server X is going to have just 16 and 18.

355
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:24,080
L1 is included. So here's the big list of strains, the two castles in the suburbs.

356
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:35,740
So the initial approvals for HPV vaccines was initially approved for girls,

357
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:44,680
and it took a while for even though it was approved for boys, for the recommendation to start to come forward for vaccinating boys.

358
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:50,979
One one piece, as I mentioned, one piece of the recommendation was because of the number of cancers that affect boys,

359
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:59,980
but then also because of data on herd immunity that was coming out of other countries that were vaccinating more kind of on a wider scale.

360
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:15,160
So at this point, the recommendation is for boys and girls start start vaccination between ages nine and 12.

361
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:20,320
They have to have two doses now 6 to 12 months apart.

362
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:27,190
And so it's going to take about two years to get these kids through fully through this.

363
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:33,790
Well, a year to get them through the series took two years when we needed three doses, but only two to get them fully through the series.

364
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:37,330
If you wait until you start a little bit older,

365
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:45,370
then the recommendation is that you go with the average the three dose strategy that was originally approved for the vaccine.

366
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:51,549
So the vaccine was originally approved and recommended with a three dose strategy and then enough data came out that two doses were sufficient,

367
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:56,800
that they backed it up to two doses for just four people that start on time or slightly late.

368
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:07,660
An earlier vaccine appears to be more. Vaccination does appear to be more effective.

369
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:12,940
So after those approvals happened,

370
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:20,079
there was a debate about what to do with people that had not been vaccinated as children either because they didn't

371
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:25,270
get vaccinated as children or because they were too old for the vaccination schedule when it started to come out.

372
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:32,139
And, you know, the data suggests that almost everybody was probably already infected with some types of HPV,

373
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:36,880
but maybe not could still have the opportunity to be protected against a high risk type of HPV.

374
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:46,450
And so, you know, slowly over time, both FDA and a.S.A.P have expanded their approvals.

375
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:53,410
Now, FDA has now approved Gardasil for 27, all the way up to 45 years of age.

376
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:59,100
The A.P. recommendation remains at 26 years of age.

377
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:04,750
This is one of those weird situations where the FDA has expanded the approval.

378
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:09,550
So you're allowed to use the vaccine in these 27 to 45 years of age.

379
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:13,690
It is not part of the official ACP recommendation, though.

380
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:20,140
Now, this sometimes will lead to like insurance and payments issues.

381
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:26,500
You know, there are insurers. Our peers don't want to pay for a vaccine that does not fall under your recommendation.

382
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:32,560
So they say the official language basically says 27 to 45 year olds can get vaccinated despite

383
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:36,879
the lack of the recommendation using shared decision maker with their decision making,

384
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:43,810
with their provider. So a doctor can get this, but it's not part of the recommended adult vaccine schedule.

385
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:55,239
And that's because the strength of the evidence, the kind of the cost effectiveness balance is is not does not appear to be there

386
00:48:55,240 --> 00:49:00,160
in terms of doing mass vaccination of people that are older than 26 years of age,

387
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,700
because so many people by that point are already infected by HPV.

388
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:13,760
So nationally, this is what next?

389
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:20,490
These are the latest, the most recent numbers National Cancer Institute has released in terms of nationwide data.

390
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:30,200
Six out of ten girls have started this series, and then five out of ten boys have started the series.

391
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:38,250
And you see there's a huge variation state by state in terms of adolescent uptake of HPV vaccine.

392
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:51,880
And if you've got a this is a study that was done pretty shortly after the initial rollout of the HPV vaccine.

393
00:49:52,270 --> 00:50:08,140
And it's interesting if you ask or if you ask parents who do not intend for their 13 to 17 year old daughters to receive HPV vaccine,

394
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:20,470
if you asked for the reasons why it was, it's really highly varied in terms of what people were reporting initially.

395
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,980
So there was that lack of knowledge. So this is not a vaccine I've heard about.

396
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:29,050
I don't know what it is. I don't want it. This is a vaccine that's not necessary.

397
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:31,299
But then this third one,

398
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:41,830
that that's the third most common reason was that daughter not sexually active was there was a commonly reported reason for declining the vaccine,

399
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:48,040
even though the vaccine for it to work has to be used before the teen becomes sexually active.

400
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:55,059
So, you know, there's this very clear gap in understanding about the prevention mechanism.

401
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:59,110
And and you know what this means? It doesn't mean it's really fascinating.

402
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:12,260
So the global vaccine introduction, you know, so when you look at international the international picture compared to,

403
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:21,470
you know, in in the US, it's become largely like a political in a behavioral health challenge to get people vaccinated.

404
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:27,980
But in other countries it's still in in remember there's a lot of other countries

405
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:34,010
outside of North America are countries that have huge both cervical cancer incidence,

406
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:39,320
but also kind of disparately disparate mortality rates when there are cervical cancer happening.

407
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:46,070
And the challenge is more about getting the vaccine introduced to all.

408
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:55,100
And so you kind of look to see where there are, you know, some areas we've got subnational introduction,

409
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:00,379
you have some areas where you've got demonstrations of the vaccines being completed are protected.

410
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:08,180
But there are a lot of big, big areas that have not nationally introduced HPV vaccine vaccine as a as a larger strategy.

411
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:21,969
All right. Any questions about that? Before I sort of talk about I'm going to give a give a few kind of thoughts on herd immunity broadly in general,

412
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:26,440
and then talk about HPV, an example of HPV in the context of herd immunity.

413
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:34,600
So herd immunity. So the definition of herd immunity is the resistance.

414
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:44,380
And I will just there's the resistance of a group of people to an attack by a disease to which a large portion of the members of the group are immune.

415
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:49,770
This is essentially indirect protection against infectious diseases.

416
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:54,910
Can you be protected from an infectious disease because everybody around you is immune?

417
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:06,400
My I have family, so my West Coast family members are well interests are interestingly anti-vaccine.

418
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:11,980
But the the my three cousins, the sons all grow grew up and vaccinated themselves as they got older.

419
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:18,790
But my aunts, when their kids were little and my kids a big Catholic family, all of our kids, I would say.

420
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:27,700
And so when my kid was little and my cousins were little, told me that if I decided I wanted to not vaccinate my kid,

421
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:36,520
and I was like, Do you know what I do that she has a pediatrician she could recommend and who will support not vaccinating?

422
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:44,319
If I wanted to switch to the pediatrician and and was telling me that it was okay to do this because vaccines

423
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:50,050
are so common in Seattle that like your kid not be vaccinated as a matter because everybody else is vaccinated.

424
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:53,010
And they said, tell me more about this pediatrician. How did you find this group?

425
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:57,070
All of my friends and everybody in our preschool goes to that pediatrician.

426
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:02,530
Okay. So herd immunity like it matters who the herd is, right?

427
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:08,290
There's this there's this idea, there's this perception that like 93% of the city's vaccinated against measles,

428
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:12,670
it must be 93% of the people in this room are vaccinated against measles.

429
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:20,139
That's not how things work in real life. It has to be the people that are actually participating in your transmission

430
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:23,770
network have to be the ones that are protecting against infectious disease.

431
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:32,400
So I feel like I've spent the last two years of my life in really random debates about herd immunity.

432
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:37,230
Some people tell her that that she was her own mother.

433
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:47,420
Well, you know how families work. And mostly I told her that I was planning on, in no uncertain terms, vaccinating my child for the following reasons.

434
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,709
And do you know what I do? It's funny,

435
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:56,370
because actually it was a long time ago and we like have had this really kind of dynamic relationship as she's figured out what to do with that COVID.

436
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:59,640
And she's still do the COVID vaccine, but she will not be the vaccine.

437
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:09,840
Yeah, it's it's it's a it's a work in progress. So they asked me about my brother, but I was all right.

438
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:21,120
So if you were to draw it out, it, it actually like feels very drawn out in a way that makes it very clear.

439
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:26,940
Right, that you've got here's four are not equals four.

440
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:29,379
On average, one person is going in,

441
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:35,180
the index person will infect four other people and those people will each go on to infect four other people all at once.

442
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:45,330
But then once you start breaking the transmission cycle by having immune kind of these grayed out dots in the process,

443
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:50,520
then you have less infection happening in a community overall.

444
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:58,190
Okay. And there's this theoretical herd immunity threshold calculation that you've probably all

445
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:02,870
seen in like sleep and the facts and whatever that everybody was trying to calculate.

446
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:05,840
Mid-pandemic that you just take one minus one over Ana.

447
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:14,570
The reality is that these virus, you know, that that actual immunity is way more complicated than this.

448
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:20,209
Right. This is sort of assuming that previously infected people can't get reinfected.

449
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:25,160
It's it's also assuming that your immune status stays constant throughout.

450
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:28,550
But this is a theoretical herd immunity threshold population.

451
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:34,009
Now, with viruses like measles where you are, you can get infected.

452
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:41,930
And you don't expect that that person will get measles again if they've been originally infected, so confers pretty durable immunity.

453
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:52,950
This actually works. You can actually take the vaccine effectiveness of the vaccine and predict when you're going to start to see outbreaks.

454
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:54,590
And actually, if you look at the U.K.,

455
00:56:54,620 --> 00:57:05,029
it's pretty it's pretty clear you can see outbreaks in the U.K. start to happen right about the time you kind of you kind of

456
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:12,230
match the the vaccine percentage in the population with the herd immunity in the calculation using the R not for measles.

457
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:18,050
You can it's pretty clear most viruses are more complex than that.

458
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:27,010
So when you apply the threshold for herd immunity to a threshold for vaccination,

459
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,309
there are a lot of public policy leaders who tried to do this for COVID by

460
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:34,540
figuring out like what percentage of the population they tried to submit to,

461
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:37,960
you know, what percent of the population do we need to vaccinate before we're at herd immunity?

462
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:44,260
That calculation, though, assumes the vaccine is assumed to be 100% effective in everybody.

463
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,750
So if you have imperfect immunity,

464
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:59,080
then you have to back off your herd immunity projections if your vaccine effectiveness is actually less than your threshold.

465
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:06,630
So if your vaccine that is is lower than that herd immunity threshold that you get by calculating the first slide so you are not is high,

466
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:12,310
high, high, high. But your vaccine effectiveness is not high. It is impossible to eliminate infection.

467
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:19,390
The vaccine strategy alone will not completely create herd immunity to the point to reverse that the herd,

468
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:31,479
which is the situation we are in with COVID. So the other thing is that the threshold for herd immunity also is assuming complete protection.

469
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:38,620
So the vaccine is assumed to stop transmission, not just stopping a parent infection or reducing the severity of infection.

470
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:46,090
So where the rubber meets the road, though, and where things start to get challenging, is this idea of nonrandom mixing.

471
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:52,479
So it's when you've got social and geographic factors and this is we know this to be true.

472
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:57,140
The social geographic factors determine the contact patterns for an infectious individual.

473
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:02,380
We do not have even exposure to each other in our entire community.

474
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:10,360
So this is going to change your or not, the number of secondary cases generated by one typical infected person.

475
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:15,190
It's very difficult to average out because your contacts are going to be different from an infected person.

476
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:27,760
And one of my favorite examples of thinking about nonrandom mixing is this this paper from from eight European

477
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:35,710
countries where they followed seven over 7000 people and they recorded every contact they had with another person.

478
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:42,550
And they showed here where they had. So the top is all reported contacts.

479
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:51,969
And then B is limited to where physical contacts happened. And you've got, you know, transport contacts, you've got leisure contacts,

480
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:57,850
school work, home most of and then if you like, restrict just to physical contacts.

481
00:59:57,850 --> 01:00:03,880
You see, home goes way up and some of these other categories like worked their way down.

482
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:12,099
And so the next thing they did is they, they actually brought these different of these different bars.

483
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:16,930
And then here these different squares are all by different countries. They broke this down by age.

484
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:25,060
So on the bottom of each of these grids by country or the age of the participant they are tracking.

485
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:30,880
And on the Y axis is the age of the person that they came into contact with.

486
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:36,490
And again, so they've got all contacts on the top and you've got physical contacts on the bottom.

487
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:41,530
And this is physical virus is basically just adding specificity and kind of cleanliness to this.

488
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:51,970
But you see here, everybody contacting somebody of their own age, plus or minus a couple of years is the strongest aspect in all of these plots.

489
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:56,500
They're more likely to be in some sort of physical contact with somebody who's about your own age.

490
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,630
But then second to that,

491
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:13,750
you've got these kind of both average age of 25 year olds contacting zero year olds and progressively getting old like on a diagonal like this.

492
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,620
Right. So this are parent child dyads, right?

493
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:25,240
You've got parents coming into contact with children and you've got your youngest people right here.

494
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:28,540
The zero participants, zero age.

495
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:36,520
They're having this second level of contacts with, you know, 25, 34 year olds with caregivers here, and they're all getting older together.

496
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:40,479
And then it's interesting to me in that in some countries, but not all,

497
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:47,830
you sort of see this 60 year olds caregiver book come out you which is interesting.

498
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:54,240
The six year olds in the in the infants. So nonrandom social mixing.

499
01:01:54,250 --> 01:02:02,140
Right so it's not just you can't just think about that herd as being one person in these straight lines from these four dots,

500
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:08,860
things like age structure, population structure, all sorts of things are going to affect all of those, how those contacts work.

501
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:13,690
This is an interesting bit if you want to watch this, the modeling.

502
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:20,889
They basically modeled the impact of non random mixing and they applied it to a sexual

503
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:24,910
network model which were like all the rage at this time period in HIV research.

504
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:30,730
So you can kind of see how that thinks out if you want to take a look at it. All right.

505
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:35,920
So what is this? What does it have to do with HPV? Why do I include it in the HPV lecture every year?

506
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:47,830
Because when the vaccine was first launched, the Australian Government, they weren't big on rolling out the HPV vaccine program.

507
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:57,320
And so in 2007, in April, they, they introduced a free vaccine program that was targeted at girls 12 years of age and older in school.

508
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:02,800
So they were doing school based vaccination. And they started targeting girls 12 years of age.

509
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:15,280
And then by July, very shortly after 20, in 2007, all female Australian residents up to age 26 were eligible for the vaccine.

510
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:20,860
But it was not free and it was not part of this school based government program.

511
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:28,210
So about 80% of eligible girls and women received one dose.

512
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:37,690
70% received two doses. Boys and other age groups were that were eligible but were not subsidized by the program,

513
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:47,230
had a vaccine rate, had lower vaccine rates in the the rate school aged boys was less than 5%.

514
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:51,280
So boys were allowed to get vaccinated, but it wasn't free.

515
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:54,720
And so they went to a very low vaccination numbers.

516
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:06,720
Now, one of the big challenges I talked to you about was the fact that HPV has such this long course of events,

517
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:12,180
that it takes really 30 years to understand the total impact that the vaccine has had.

518
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:17,400
Well, the data is starting to come out. We're starting to see reductions in cervical cancer based on vaccination now.

519
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:21,930
But an answer was needed before that.

520
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:32,610
So what they did, because there was a proxy endpoint in the trials, that the vaccine was also preventing enough HPV attributable genital warts,

521
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:42,060
that they could monitor genital work development and get a general sense of where where reductions were happening that were related to the vaccine.

522
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:53,850
So does Donovan at all studies. Did this study, surveillance study for genital warts kind of rolled out at the same time period as the the vaccine?

523
01:04:54,480 --> 01:05:06,090
So this top group here, this is these are women who are eligible for the vaccine, 12 to 26 year olds at the very start of the campaign.

524
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:12,080
And these are women who are not eligible for the vaccine, over 26 year olds at the very start of the campaign.

525
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:20,700
So this is the very first way. And so you've got resident women, 12 to 26 years old.

526
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:29,940
Here you see this huge drop in genital warts that's happening in this red line after the vaccine campaign starts pretty quickly after the start.

527
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:33,990
And blue women, nonresident women, these are likely women.

528
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:38,370
Even though the government was providing free services, they probably had lower access to care.

529
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:44,280
You don't see a big change there happening in the women that were over 26 years of age.

530
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:48,480
So they were not eligible. You're not seeing any change in general.

531
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:52,320
So there's not you know, even though it's a it's an ecological study, essentially,

532
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:57,480
you're not seeing a whole lot of change in groups that you would not expect to be receiving the intervention.

533
01:05:57,690 --> 01:06:02,520
Right. So it's very strong data, given that it's a ecologic study.

534
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:12,240
But the interesting data was what happened to the men so that the men were not eligible for free vaccine.

535
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:19,140
We know that less than 5% of them were vaccinated, actually had a drop.

536
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:26,550
So heterosexual men had a drop in genital warts prevalence following the rollout of the vaccine in the women.

537
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:31,530
And that drop was not seen among men who have sex with men.

538
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:39,930
And then, you know, so this line is, you know, there is a downward trend.

539
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:44,550
This is a interrupted time series model for those of you that want to know.

540
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:50,819
So this is that there is a downward trend in the in the before period.

541
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:59,940
But then after the period, you have an additional a more kind of notable and significant downward trend after the dotted line.

542
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:05,100
But then you go to this bottom panel and they broke the heterosexual men out by age range.

543
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:13,410
And the heterosexual men that were in the comparable age range to the women that were eligible for vaccine were the ones where the decrease was seen.

544
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:17,070
The men that were older did not have a decrease in genital warts.

545
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:23,340
And so by age, we're seeing and this is a very clear example of herd immunity working,

546
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:28,320
but in a very specific you have they had to drill down to the right contact never

547
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:34,260
to be able to see vaccinating the women was reducing HPV infection in the men,

548
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,850
but they had to kind of get the right context to see it.

549
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:50,480
Okay. And I have spent so much time talking with you because I'm too interested in that, that I did not get the HIV slides.

550
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:54,760
I will talk about HIV to Wednesday.

551
01:07:54,800 --> 01:08:02,720
Not tomorrow, but Wednesday. One of the things that I want to point out, as you read the articles that are assigned for Wednesday,

552
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:07,580
we're going to talk about kind of the historical development of different HIV therapies.

553
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:15,620
And we're going to talk about efforts to reduce mother to child transmission and reduce

554
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:20,960
transmission to children through reducing the viral load of the infected parent.

555
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:30,200
But these are all strategies that are focused on taking somebody who's infected and reducing their viral load so that transmission doesn't happen.

556
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:35,780
What you're going to read for Wednesday is Prep, which is pre-exposure prophylaxis,

557
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:43,280
and this is going to be treating people who are at risk prophylactically so that they don't become infected in the first place

558
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:51,770
without regard to the viral status or the treatment status of the person they're being exposed to or who the index person is.

559
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:55,520
So I just wanted to like help your brain wrap your brain around that.

560
01:08:55,940 --> 01:09:07,010
These are people who are not infected that are receiving the antiretroviral therapy in order to protect them from infection in an exposure event.

561
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:11,660
Pre-Exposure prophylaxis. So read the papers with that in mind.

562
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:20,270
Giving the antiretroviral therapy to someone who does not have the HIV virus and that this that's what that strategy is kind of founded around.

563
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:23,180
All right. Thank you very much, everybody.
