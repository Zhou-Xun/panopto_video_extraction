1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,840
All right, Ms. Joshie. So why are you interested in this position?

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:10,470
I'm interested in this position because I think that this would be a great opportunity to apply my skills to a different kind of position.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,830
So I have a lot of experience in my data management working with other people, and I think I can bring those skills to the table.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,010
And I really want to learn more about the consulting side of the applications of their public health knowledge into a real world work,

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,850
whether that be with like health care centers, with big companies, whatever it may be.

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:34,559
I think I have the tools and skills to do this job, and I think I would really enjoy learning more about how this side of the industry works with.

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,430
I was a very big proponent of public health and making sure our health care system is up to date.

8
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,160
All right. Thank you for the answer. If you could expand on some of your strengths and weaknesses.

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,600
Yeah. So my so my strengths are like I have a really great attention to detail,

10
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:55,410
really good interpersonal communication as well as a written communication because in my one of my previous positions, I was a health educator.

11
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,450
And so in that it was very important that I had clear and concise communication.

12
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:07,080
And in addition to that, I really kind of helped lead a group of people. So I had to be a leader, but also provided a welcoming environment.

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,450
I'm a very big people person and I really want to make sure everyone feels valued and included in the process because it's important.

14
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,750
And I think one of my biggest weakness is that sometimes I tend to focus more on the small scale details in the big picture as a whole.

15
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,610
So that's something I've been trying to work on.

16
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:26,939
But I think sometimes just reminders of this is a really important topic, but overall trying to accomplish is a good reminder for me.

17
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,269
So I think that's how I function best and I do try to remind myself of that.

18
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,650
But we're all learning while growing. All right. Thank you for that response.

19
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,520
Last question. Why should we hear you over other evidence?

20
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:46,050
Because anyone can do the job, but you have to be committed and passionate about the topic to truly do it well.

21
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,980
I want to further pursue a job in this company. Is something just getting here?

22
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,470
Do a word for two years and get out. But that's not what I'm looking for.

23
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,690
I'm looking for like a long term commitment, a job I can be in and I can grow and improve.

24
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,180
And that's why I think I'd be a better applicant,

25
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,160
because I have the skills to communicate better with people who have only been improving on my skills.

26
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,849
And like this is proven by my previous bosses, you can call them.

27
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,989
They all have really good things to say, not very good, but they have a lot of really good things to say.

28
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,860
And I think that speaks to my character a lot and how dedicated I am and persistent I am.

29
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,180
Right. So great.
