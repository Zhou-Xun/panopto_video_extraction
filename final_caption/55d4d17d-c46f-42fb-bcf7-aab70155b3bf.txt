00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,310
Hello. Welcome to this
lecture on sampling concepts.

2
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,410
Today, we'll talk about
how to generalize

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,530
from data to an
entire population.

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,200
Now, most sets of data
that you have are

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,190
only a single snapshot of a
small group of individuals,

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,080
and summarizing what we see in

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,985
those individuals is important.

8
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,595
But our ultimate goal
is actually bigger.

9
00:00:29,595 --> 00:00:31,290
We want to know if the data from

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,920
our sample provide
a story that can be

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,390
extended to everyone else in

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,645
the population whose
data we did not collect.

13
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:40,820
We also want to know
how certain we are

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,130
that our single-story is correct,

15
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,810
or should we be concerned that

16
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,380
perhaps it is biased
or incorrect.

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,430
So in this module,
we'll talk about

18
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,620
the fundamental way that
statistics helps us to

19
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,470
understand what and
when we can generalize

20
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,800
from our smaller studies
to the whole population.

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,270
Our learning
objectives are; first,

22
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,130
to understand the relationship of

23
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,385
sample statistics and
population parameters.

24
00:01:04,385 --> 00:01:06,320
Then to understand
how data can be

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,480
generalizable to a population,

26
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,180
and then to understand
why generalizability is

27
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,305
a desirable characteristic
for our data.

28
00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:16,360
In front of you, you
have what I call

29
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,970
the big picture of
biostatistics showing the cycle

30
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,250
from the population to
collecting data from

31
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,895
the population and making
inference to the population.

32
00:01:24,895 --> 00:01:26,770
The large orange circle is

33
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,090
the large population of

34
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,160
individuals you're
interested in studying.

35
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,740
The green circle represents
the small sample

36
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,725
of data that you collect
from this population.

37
00:01:35,725 --> 00:01:39,304
Up to this point, we focus on
exploratory data analysis,

38
00:01:39,304 --> 00:01:41,169
talking about the
collection of data,

39
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:43,735
and computing quantities
such as sample means,

40
00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:46,850
sample standard deviations,
and sample medians.

41
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,180
Today, we return back
to the population

42
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,165
and the sample collected
from that population.

43
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:54,640
Now, the population is summarized

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,485
by quantities we call parameters.

45
00:01:57,485 --> 00:01:59,930
The population is far too

46
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,270
large to study every individual.

47
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,960
Therefore, we design a
study and from that study,

48
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,015
we collect data on a
much smaller sample

49
00:02:08,015 --> 00:02:10,445
of individuals from
the population.

50
00:02:10,445 --> 00:02:13,610
From that sample, we compute
numbers we call statistics.

51
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,795
These are, the sample mean,

52
00:02:14,795 --> 00:02:16,340
the sample standard deviation,

53
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,870
and any other quantity you
might compute from the data.

54
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,850
We believe that perhaps
these statistics are

55
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,520
good representations
of the parameters

56
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,230
back in the population.

57
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,570
We therefore wish to
make inference from

58
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,125
the statistics to the parameters.

59
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,700
Now, in the example I
have in front of you,

60
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,595
the sample is a good
representation of the population.

61
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:39,950
You can see that every
color of person in

62
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,085
the population is
represented in the sample.

63
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:46,630
Because this sample is a good
likeness to the population,

64
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,265
we say that this sample
is generalizable.

65
00:02:49,265 --> 00:02:51,620
Anything we see in the sample is

66
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,680
likely to carry forward
into the population.

67
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,410
In contrast, I show you
a sample now in which

68
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,035
only two types of
individuals are represented;

69
00:03:00,035 --> 00:03:01,745
the orange and the black.

70
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:04,250
Therefore, this sample
is a poor likeness to

71
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,710
the population and
anything we compute from

72
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,480
the sample will not be

73
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,540
a good value for the
value in the population.

74
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,695
We therefore say the information
in the sample is biased.

75
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,230
As an example, consider a study

76
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,650
looking at all US
high school students.

77
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,940
Now, there are
approximately 16 million

78
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,040
high school students in the US,

79
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,900
which is a number far too large

80
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,170
to allow us to study
every individual.

81
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,260
Therefore, we design a study.

82
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,890
Perhaps I design a study
in which I collect data on

83
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,060
10 high school students from

84
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,110
a local high school here in

85
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,970
Ann Arbor Skyline High School.

86
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,370
To those 10 high school
students, I ask them,

87
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,540
on a scale from 1-10,

88
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,770
how anxious are you about

89
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,755
leaving home and
going to college?

90
00:03:44,755 --> 00:03:47,900
The sample mean from these
10 individuals is 4.5.

91
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,240
Again, this is a
statistic that we hope is

92
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,620
a good representation of

93
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,190
the corresponding parameter
in the population.

94
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,700
Now, because this sample is

95
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,830
a good representation
of the population,

96
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,560
we have generalizable
information and therefore,

97
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,050
we make inference back
to the population.

98
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,450
Perhaps we might
conclude from the sample

99
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,670
mean of 4.5 that on average,

100
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,140
US high school students have

101
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,495
some anxiety about
heading to college

102
00:04:11,495 --> 00:04:13,910
because our sample mean of 4.5 is

103
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,510
right near the middle of
the scale from one to 10.

104
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,955
Therefore, our
inferences are unbiased

105
00:04:18,955 --> 00:04:22,925
because the sample is
generalizable to the population.

106
00:04:22,925 --> 00:04:25,460
Consider instead this sample of

107
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,770
10 students which are
orange and black only.

108
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,510
Let us suppose that orange are

109
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,490
freshmen and black
are sophomores.

110
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,875
Those 10 students, when
asked that question,

111
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,935
now, I have a sample
mean of three.

112
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:39,050
This sample mean is not a
good representation of what

113
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,280
the population mean might

114
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,440
be because we have a bias sample.

115
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,390
There are no juniors and seniors

116
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,930
in the sample of data we have.

117
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,670
Therefore, we say we
have biased inference.

118
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,785
The results from
our sample are not

119
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:54,755
generalizable to the
entire population.

120
00:04:54,755 --> 00:04:56,540
Generalizability allows us to

121
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,585
believe that our data
mimic the population.

122
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:02,585
But our story is still dependent

123
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:06,020
upon the specific sample
of data that we have.

124
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,795
What if we had collected
a new sample of data?

125
00:05:08,795 --> 00:05:10,895
Would we have gotten
the same results?

126
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:14,425
If not, how much would
the results have changed?

127
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:16,840
So before our story is complete,

128
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,269
we need to know how
convincing our story is,

129
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:21,950
which is quantified by a concept

130
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,024
known as sampling variability.
