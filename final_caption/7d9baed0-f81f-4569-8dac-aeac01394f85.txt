00:00:03,165 --> 00:00:09,394
Hello, I'm Dr. Carole Chenoweth from the Infectious Diseases Department

2
00:00:09,394 --> 00:00:13,140
at the Michigan Medicine Healthcare System.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,941
Today I want to talk to you about the importance of hand hygiene in healthcare.

4
00:00:18,941 --> 00:00:23,325
Hand hygiene is the simplest, most effective measure for

5
00:00:23,325 --> 00:00:28,605
preventing any type of transmission of organisms between patients or

6
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:31,569
from patients to healthcare workers.

7
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:36,739
It is the primary prevention for infecting a healthcare worker or

8
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:42,572
becoming colonized with some of the microorganisms found in hospitals.

9
00:00:42,572 --> 00:00:47,164
We have known since the days of some advice that

10
00:00:47,164 --> 00:00:52,122
hand hygiene can decrease the risk of infection.

11
00:00:52,122 --> 00:00:57,128
However, over the years our rates of hand hygiene

12
00:00:57,128 --> 00:01:02,977
compliance have been generally between 30 and 50%.

13
00:01:02,977 --> 00:01:07,919
Now, there has been a lot of effort put into hand hygiene

14
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:10,758
over the last 5 to 10 years and

15
00:01:10,758 --> 00:01:16,645
I'm happy to say that the rates are much better, but they do not yet

16
00:01:16,645 --> 00:01:21,509
get to the rates of 95 to 100% that we would like.

17
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,657
So the objective today is to explain the importance of hand hygiene for

18
00:01:26,657 --> 00:01:30,758
prevention of infections in healthcare settings, but

19
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:36,100
also to help you understand the barriers for hand hygiene in hospitals.

20
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,640
So this is an older study but it raises some

21
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,571
very important points about hand hygiene and

22
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:50,643
why it may not be done in the way that we expect.

23
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:51,998
Up until this time,

24
00:01:51,998 --> 00:01:57,352
there hadn't been much emphasis on what are the barriers and how do we improve.

25
00:01:57,352 --> 00:01:58,682
This was done by Dr.

26
00:01:58,682 --> 00:02:03,702
Pittet who's a very well known researcher in hand hygiene in Switzerland.

27
00:02:03,702 --> 00:02:08,136
He observed healthcare workers and

28
00:02:08,136 --> 00:02:14,054
saw 2843 opportunities for handwashing.

29
00:02:14,054 --> 00:02:18,687
And he found an overall compliance of about 48% that fits

30
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:23,146
well within the range that we saw in the previous slides.

31
00:02:23,146 --> 00:02:28,128
The reasons for noncompliance were boiled down to three

32
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:31,947
main types of situations in the hospital.

33
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:34,694
First of all, in an ICU setting,

34
00:02:34,694 --> 00:02:39,800
actually where it's the most important to use hand hygiene,

35
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,121
the risk of not using proper hand hygiene was increased 2 fold.

36
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:51,307
During procedures with risk of contamination the odds ratio was 1.8.

37
00:02:51,307 --> 00:02:56,858
And whenever there was an intensity of patient care that was

38
00:02:56,858 --> 00:03:03,641
above 60 opportunities per hour, that is a lot of hand hygiene [LAUGH].

39
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:07,396
The odds ratio went up to 2.1.

40
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:13,013
And this is just a picture of our ICU, you can see just from

41
00:03:13,013 --> 00:03:18,049
initial glance there are lots of things going on and

42
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:22,752
there may be lots of people in the room at a time.

43
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:27,772
There can be emergent or semi-emergent

44
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:32,058
things happening at any one time.

45
00:03:32,058 --> 00:03:37,222
And in a setting like this where there are many very important

46
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:42,691
decisions to make about the medical, all those medications and

47
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:47,044
it looks like this person is on a dialysis machine,

48
00:03:47,044 --> 00:03:50,715
all of these things tend to take priority.

49
00:03:50,715 --> 00:03:55,659
And it's very difficult for the healthcare worker to remember that

50
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:59,744
hand hygiene has to be up at that same level of priority.

51
00:03:59,744 --> 00:04:04,485
So what are the barriers for hand hygiene compliance?

52
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:07,833
There have been a number of studies,

53
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:13,136
most of them in the form of surveys to healthcare workers.

54
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:19,608
And I can tell you at the University of Michigan we have done surveys and

55
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:24,328
the reasons why people think they cannot wash their

56
00:04:24,328 --> 00:04:29,485
hands as we ask them to boil down to these main five things

57
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:34,228
plus one other important reason that I will get to.

58
00:04:34,228 --> 00:04:37,045
So as we saw in the picture,

59
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:42,322
there are a lot of things happening in healthcare.

60
00:04:42,322 --> 00:04:46,647
There are several emergent situations that can arise at any time.

61
00:04:46,647 --> 00:04:49,261
And so healthcare workers have a perceived,

62
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:52,768
they think they don't have enough time to wash their hands or

63
00:04:52,768 --> 00:04:56,231
they have real time constraints that don't allow them to.

64
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:59,404
And in emergent situation you have to get to the patient and

65
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:01,033
do whatever needs to be done.

66
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,913
That's a real reason, but

67
00:05:02,913 --> 00:05:08,730
healthcare workers also have this feeling that they're always rushed sometimes.

68
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:13,612
And so it can be just a perceived constraint.

69
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:18,586
Also people if they do hand hygiene especially with soap and

70
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:23,566
water, they will end up with skin irritation and dryness.

71
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:30,297
This is particularly true in Michigan where we have a colder climate.

72
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:33,944
We were involved in a study of nurses and

73
00:05:33,944 --> 00:05:39,361
compared to other geographic areas in the United States,

74
00:05:39,361 --> 00:05:43,118
our nurses actually had the worst hand or

75
00:05:43,118 --> 00:05:47,446
skin integrity when compared to other areas.

76
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:51,696
And this is dryness, but it's also the soap that you use.

77
00:05:51,696 --> 00:05:57,265
It also can be the towels when you dry your hands with towels, it's actually

78
00:05:57,265 --> 00:06:02,678
quite a lot of friction and can contribute to the dryness and irritation.

79
00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:04,548
Inconvenient locations of sink.

80
00:06:04,548 --> 00:06:09,072
So this seems intuitive that you would put a sink where it's most convenient for

81
00:06:09,072 --> 00:06:11,030
the healthcare worker, [LAUGH] but

82
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,575
hospitals are designed by people who are not necessarily healthcare workers.

83
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:20,566
And it comes down to the clinicians and our infection prevention staff to look

84
00:06:20,566 --> 00:06:25,582
at all hospital designs and make sure that the sinks are in a proper position.

85
00:06:25,582 --> 00:06:31,772
As you get out onto the wards, check out where some of the sinks are.

86
00:06:31,772 --> 00:06:36,634
And you'll see that some of them are put on the opposite wall away

87
00:06:36,634 --> 00:06:41,228
from the entrance so that a healthcare worker has to actually

88
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:45,118
cross the room to wash their hands before leaving.

89
00:06:45,118 --> 00:06:50,330
You can imagine that the most convenient place to have a sink is right

90
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:55,553
beside the door so people can wash their hands as they're exiting.

91
00:06:55,553 --> 00:06:57,464
Lack of personal responsibility.

92
00:06:57,464 --> 00:07:01,641
So this gets to the fact that some healthcare workers have

93
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:06,339
a sense that they are doing what they're supposed to be doing and

94
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:09,661
it's not them, that's the problem [LAUGH].

95
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:13,953
It's everybody else that's not doing what they're supposed to and

96
00:07:13,953 --> 00:07:17,139
they don't actually look at what they're doing.

97
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:23,851
You may be able to get around something like this by simply pointing out,

98
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:30,465
giving feedback on how well somebody is doing with their hand hygiene.

99
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:34,990
And then the final item that I wanna talk about is the lack of awareness that hand

100
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,132
hygiene affects clinical outcome.

101
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:42,233
Now you probably think everybody should know that and

102
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:48,919
that education will solve this problem, but we have done education,

103
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:54,497
everybody knows that hand hygiene is supposed to be done.

104
00:07:54,497 --> 00:07:59,484
The thing that is missing in the link however, is that healthcare

105
00:07:59,484 --> 00:08:04,209
workers can't see the downstream effects of their actions.

106
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:07,620
So they may not wash their hands properly.

107
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,741
But the infection that comes after a break in

108
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:19,663
hand hygiene maybe several days to weeks after that event,

109
00:08:19,663 --> 00:08:24,106
and they can't see the correlation.

110
00:08:24,106 --> 00:08:28,108
So it's very hard to teach that part of it.

111
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,143
If they saw it,

112
00:08:29,143 --> 00:08:34,424
they would immediately know nobody wants to give anybody [LAUGH] an infection.

113
00:08:34,424 --> 00:08:39,949
But it would be very good feedback in education if they could see the effects,

114
00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:41,224
but they can't.

115
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:47,678
This study again is old but it highlights some very

116
00:08:47,678 --> 00:08:52,468
important things about healthcare workers.

117
00:08:52,468 --> 00:08:57,171
In this study, it was house officers in Australia and

118
00:08:57,171 --> 00:09:02,396
they are not really that much different from physicians and

119
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:06,486
healthcare workers everywhere in the world.

120
00:09:06,486 --> 00:09:09,336
They were administered a survey and asked,

121
00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:13,119
how often do you wash your hands when you're supposed to?

122
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,833
And they said 73%.

123
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:19,717
Now we have given surveys as well.

124
00:09:19,717 --> 00:09:23,631
Again, part of the survey that I mentioned earlier and

125
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:29,091
uniformly healthcare workers say they wash their hands 75% of the time.

126
00:09:29,091 --> 00:09:34,082
They never say they're perfect, [LAUGH], but they still think that they're

127
00:09:34,082 --> 00:09:39,405
doing pretty good, 75% of the time they're doing what they're supposed to.

128
00:09:39,405 --> 00:09:44,570
So these same house officers were watched either covertly,

129
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:49,331
meaning they didn't know somebody was watching them or

130
00:09:49,331 --> 00:09:54,715
overtly, the observers weren't trying to hide themselves.

131
00:09:54,715 --> 00:10:00,389
So when they had observation, the house officers were washing

132
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:05,422
their hands before patient contact only about 8.6%

133
00:10:05,422 --> 00:10:10,346
of the time, after contact, 10.8% of the time,

134
00:10:10,346 --> 00:10:14,970
and before and after, about 3.2% of the time.

135
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:20,598
So the commentary that came with this paper made the point that careful and

136
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:26,883
caring doctors can be extraordinarily self-delusional about their behavior.

137
00:10:26,883 --> 00:10:31,595
So this brings up the final point that I think is one of

138
00:10:31,595 --> 00:10:36,736
the main drivers for why people don't wash their hands is

139
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:41,677
that they don't recognize that they are not doing it.

140
00:10:41,677 --> 00:10:47,048
They think they're actually doing it and they simply forget and

141
00:10:47,048 --> 00:10:52,133
it's not reinforced that they have missed an opportunity.

142
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:58,240
So in this continuation of this same study,

143
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,201
they did staff education and

144
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:08,289
they did covert, Observations.

145
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:15,149
These are the same type of studies that we saw previously,

146
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:20,469
before contact they were able to get 8.6%

147
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:25,378
compliance and after it was 10.8%.

148
00:11:25,378 --> 00:11:32,490
When they went to overt, meaning not hiding the observers,

149
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:38,626
they were able to get higher rates up in the 30% for

150
00:11:38,626 --> 00:11:43,513
both before and after patient contacts.

151
00:11:43,513 --> 00:11:48,666
Nowhere near what we would want, but when they know somebody is watching

152
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:54,166
them they're more likely to do what we have asked them to through education.

153
00:11:54,166 --> 00:12:00,464
Following that, they gave feedback to the house officers of how they were doing.

154
00:12:00,464 --> 00:12:03,225
They were told here's your 30%,

155
00:12:03,225 --> 00:12:07,425
you're not at that 73% that you think you [LAUGH] are.

156
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:12,767
And with the feedback they were

157
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:19,547
able to get rates up to the 72.8% or

158
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:25,312
67.6% with that activity.

159
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:28,899
Then they reverted to the covert observation and

160
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:33,018
while the rates were still good, they started to slip.

161
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:36,189
And this is an important point for

162
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:41,518
any infection prevention initiative that we try to do.

163
00:12:41,518 --> 00:12:47,159
It's very easy to get people to change their behavior for

164
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:53,989
a short amount of time but that effect usually fades by three months.

165
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:58,991
So if you are planning to do an intervention I will

166
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:05,952
say that staff education alone will not get you where you want to be.

167
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:10,850
And if you are going to give some observation and

168
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:15,137
feedback you have to maintain some type of

169
00:13:15,137 --> 00:13:20,047
process over time to keep the effects in place.

170
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:25,731
Doing it once is likely to be effective for a short period of time but

171
00:13:25,731 --> 00:13:29,399
it's going to fade by about three months.

172
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:35,471
So when should healthcare workers wash their hands or [COUGH] clean their hands?

173
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:38,218
First, before and after direct patient contact.

174
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:43,859
And if they did this everything would be mostly capturing

175
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:48,687
all the times that they should be washing hands.

176
00:13:48,687 --> 00:13:52,594
When potentially soiled with moist body fluids.

177
00:13:52,594 --> 00:13:54,809
So they've gotten something on their hands,

178
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:56,583
of course they should wash that off.

179
00:13:56,583 --> 00:14:01,488
After handling used dressings, sputum containers,

180
00:14:01,488 --> 00:14:05,760
urinals, catheters, bedpans, catheters.

181
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,180
Any type of material that might be contaminated with body fluids,

182
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,194
they should be washing their hands.

183
00:14:14,194 --> 00:14:19,101
Following personal hygiene such as use of the toilet,

184
00:14:19,101 --> 00:14:22,629
blowing nose before and after eating.

185
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:28,083
These are things that you probably think, why do you have to tell people to do this?

186
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:32,997
But I can tell you there was an observation [LAUGH],

187
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:38,847
this was at an infectious disease physicians conference,

188
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:45,282
that's where they watched people coming out of the restrooms and

189
00:14:45,282 --> 00:14:52,203
they really found a very dismal use of hand hygiene even in that group.

190
00:14:52,203 --> 00:14:56,960
So it's something that we continue to have to remind people.

191
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,970
Always before preparing or handling sterile products.

192
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:05,346
Of course somebody should have very clean hands coming into that procedure.

193
00:15:05,346 --> 00:15:10,902
Any time you're removing a pair of gloves and we'll talk about this more,

194
00:15:10,902 --> 00:15:16,723
and we have a caveat that whenever our hospital policy requires handwashing,

195
00:15:16,723 --> 00:15:21,661
if people follow the reasons above then they would be capturing all

196
00:15:21,661 --> 00:15:25,217
of the times our policy requires hand hygiene.

197
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:30,670
So these guidelines are pretty much taken from the centers for disease control.

198
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:35,204
You have the hand hygiene guidelines from the CDC in your

199
00:15:35,204 --> 00:15:40,619
supplemental material on canvas if you want to take a look at them.

200
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:45,040
This is what most of us follow but I will point out that

201
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,068
there's also a World Health Organization guideline which

202
00:15:50,068 --> 00:15:54,606
is slightly different from what the CDC recommends.

203
00:15:54,606 --> 00:16:00,830
And many people have adopted this type of policy as well.

204
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:05,267
So you should at least know that there is a five moments of hand

205
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:09,882
hygiene recommendation from the World Health Organization.

206
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:14,742
So what are those five moments when healthcare workers should wash

207
00:16:14,742 --> 00:16:15,789
their hands?

208
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:17,915
Number 1, before touching a patient.

209
00:16:17,915 --> 00:16:22,883
That's basic, that's pretty much what we say before you touch

210
00:16:22,883 --> 00:16:26,846
a patient you should be having your hands cleaned.

211
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:33,285
And number 2 is before a procedure, so that's also covered in our guidelines.

212
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:36,442
3, after a procedure or body fluid exposure risk.

213
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:39,228
So after you've touched the patient or

214
00:16:39,228 --> 00:16:45,147
done something that might contaminate your hands then you should wash your hands.

215
00:16:45,147 --> 00:16:51,774
That's very similar, that also is incorporated into our current guidelines.

216
00:16:51,774 --> 00:16:54,267
Number 4 is after touching a patient.

217
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:58,454
Again, this is the same, before and after patient care,

218
00:16:58,454 --> 00:17:00,766
we should be washing our hands.

219
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:05,557
Now, 5 is the one that's a little bit different from

220
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:09,719
what the CDC has traditionally recommended.

221
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:13,450
And that is that if you are caring for a patient and

222
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:18,455
then you touch something in their room, like that IV pole that's

223
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:23,005
sitting beside the patient or you go over to the computer and

224
00:17:23,005 --> 00:17:28,101
you're typing something in and then you come back to the patient,

225
00:17:28,101 --> 00:17:34,405
the World Health Organization recommends that you wash your hands at that point.

226
00:17:34,405 --> 00:17:38,525
In the past, it has always been assumed or

227
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:43,117
the rule of thumb was that any of the patient's

228
00:17:43,117 --> 00:17:48,556
surroundings was considered the same as the patient.

229
00:17:48,556 --> 00:17:54,847
Because those that will become colonized with the patient's own bacteria.

230
00:17:54,847 --> 00:17:55,904
And so we're not so

231
00:17:55,904 --> 00:18:00,079
much concerned about the patient's own bacteria getting to the patient.

232
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,982
But we have learned over the last 10 to 15 years that certain

233
00:18:04,982 --> 00:18:10,352
organisms such as Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant

234
00:18:10,352 --> 00:18:16,016
Enterococcus can live in the environment for very long periods of time.

235
00:18:16,016 --> 00:18:21,651
And so organisms from the previous patient may end up still in that room.

236
00:18:21,651 --> 00:18:26,068
So what this number 5 is intending to do is prevent

237
00:18:26,068 --> 00:18:30,489
healthcare workers from picking up extraneous or

238
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:35,552
exogenous bacteria and bringing it back to the patient.

239
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,172
So how do you wash your hands?

240
00:18:40,172 --> 00:18:44,505
Now, the joint commission does certification for

241
00:18:44,505 --> 00:18:49,545
hospitals and they send their reviewers into a hospital and

242
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:55,104
they will actually watch people how they wash their hands [LAUGH].

243
00:18:55,104 --> 00:19:00,904
We follow the CDC guidelines which are that you wet your hands first,

244
00:19:00,904 --> 00:19:07,709
you apply your soap, and then you rub under running water at least 15 seconds.

245
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:12,716
The World Health Organization has said 20 seconds, and so

246
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:18,427
there was some confusion as to what we were supposed to be following.

247
00:19:18,427 --> 00:19:21,233
The CDC has come back and

248
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:26,153
said they are saying these 15 seconds.

249
00:19:26,153 --> 00:19:29,127
So 20 seconds is fine [LAUGH] but

250
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:34,533
they want at least 15 seconds and then you rinse and dry.

251
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:36,490
So how long is 15 seconds?

252
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,997
That is much longer than you think.

253
00:19:39,997 --> 00:19:47,119
So it requires standing with your hands under the water.

254
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:52,614
And this can be accomplished by,

255
00:19:52,614 --> 00:20:00,079
some people use the crutch of singing songs.

256
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,248
So if you sing a frame of Yankee Doodle Dandy,

257
00:20:04,248 --> 00:20:08,210
that generally takes about 15 seconds.

258
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:13,485
If you sing the Wolverine Fight song, that takes about 17 seconds.

259
00:20:13,485 --> 00:20:16,337
And there are several others that people have used.

260
00:20:16,337 --> 00:20:17,587
Happy Birthday has been used.

261
00:20:17,587 --> 00:20:22,212
But we have recommended to people to use something like that

262
00:20:22,212 --> 00:20:27,116
to gauge the time because otherwise people will think they've

263
00:20:27,116 --> 00:20:31,107
done 15 seconds but it's really not even close.

264
00:20:33,077 --> 00:20:35,837
Now, the antiseptic hand rinses,

265
00:20:35,837 --> 00:20:40,162
you've heard a lot about this over the last few months.

266
00:20:40,162 --> 00:20:41,044
Are they effective?

267
00:20:41,044 --> 00:20:46,649
First of all, they are very effective against most bacteria viruses and fungi.

268
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:50,747
They kill the bacteria and

269
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:55,035
they are very time saving.

270
00:20:55,035 --> 00:20:59,508
So we encourage alcoholic hand sanitizers to

271
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:03,869
be used as much as possible in our hospital.

272
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:09,522
We've placed them everywhere, when you're out on the floors please take a look.

273
00:21:09,522 --> 00:21:13,425
You should find them inside patient rooms,

274
00:21:13,425 --> 00:21:18,707
outside patient rooms, by elevators, by the cafeteria.

275
00:21:18,707 --> 00:21:23,669
We don't put them in the bathrooms generally because we want people

276
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:28,032
to wash their hands in that situation using soap and water.

277
00:21:28,032 --> 00:21:32,907
We also don't recommend it if the hands have

278
00:21:32,907 --> 00:21:37,402
visibly soiled organic matter on them.

279
00:21:37,402 --> 00:21:41,207
Any body fluids, anything that you can see or

280
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:46,215
that is organic, then people should be washing their hands

281
00:21:46,215 --> 00:21:51,337
because the alcohol can't penetrate into that bio matter.

282
00:21:51,337 --> 00:21:56,831
We also know that clustered in difficile spores are not inactivated by the alcohol

283
00:21:56,831 --> 00:22:01,939
hand sanitizer and they simply have to be washed off with the soap and water.

284
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:03,972
And the same is true for

285
00:22:03,972 --> 00:22:09,754
norovirus which tends to be a little more resistant to alcohol.

286
00:22:09,754 --> 00:22:13,175
So here's my friend and colleague Dr.

287
00:22:13,175 --> 00:22:18,055
Sinti, you will meet him a little later this semester.

288
00:22:18,055 --> 00:22:24,937
He is outside a room at the VA Hospital using the alcohol hand sanitizer.

289
00:22:24,937 --> 00:22:29,497
And this all looks well and good except he is coming out of a room which

290
00:22:29,497 --> 00:22:32,784
has a precautions called enteric precautions.

291
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:37,713
This is what we would call contact precautions for diarrhea and

292
00:22:37,713 --> 00:22:41,806
it is saying do not use the alcohol hand sanitizers.

293
00:22:41,806 --> 00:22:47,726
So we have a number of things that we try to put into place

294
00:22:47,726 --> 00:22:54,059
to keep people from not using the alcohol hand sanitizer.

295
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:56,899
You can use the sanitizer going into the room but

296
00:22:56,899 --> 00:23:00,741
you should be washing your hands with soap and water to come out.

297
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:05,781
So one of the things that we do is put up a sign by the hand

298
00:23:05,781 --> 00:23:11,045
sanitizer saying use soap and water or we remove the hand

299
00:23:11,045 --> 00:23:17,770
sanitizer from the room not from the outside of the room but in the room.

300
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:22,135
The signs are generally on the outside of the doors so it's very easy for

301
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:24,171
someone in the room to forget,

302
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:28,342
this is a situation where I have to wash my hands with soap and water.

303
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:31,011
So we try to help them as much as we can.

304
00:23:31,011 --> 00:23:35,918
But it does require people to simply remember this is a room that

305
00:23:35,918 --> 00:23:38,614
I have to wash with soap and water.

306
00:23:38,614 --> 00:23:44,646
So in summary, handwashing is the most critical infection prevention intervention

307
00:23:44,646 --> 00:23:50,358
for safety of patients and healthcare workers and yet rates remain suboptimal.

308
00:23:50,358 --> 00:23:56,109
Hand sanitizers can be used in most situations except certain infections and

309
00:23:56,109 --> 00:24:01,954
when the hands are visibly soiled with body fluids or other organic material.

310
00:24:01,954 --> 00:24:07,273
