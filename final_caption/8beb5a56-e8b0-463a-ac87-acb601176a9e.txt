1
00:00:08,712 --> 00:00:12,654
In this module, I'm going to introduce you
to some basic concepts of air pollution,

2
00:00:12,654 --> 00:00:16,490
but before we do that,
I'd like you to take a deep breath.

3
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:21,105
Now think about what was in that air you
just breathed, if you have any science

4
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:25,365
background, you might know that
that are was about 78% nitrogen and

5
00:00:25,365 --> 00:00:28,357
about 21% oxygen, but
what else was in there?

6
00:00:28,357 --> 00:00:32,770
Over my shoulder here, you can see I'm
standing next to a power plant smokestack,

7
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,377
what's coming out of there that's
going into my breathing space?

8
00:00:36,377 --> 00:00:40,171
The good news about this particular
plant is the emissions are mostly carbon

9
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:41,030
dioxide.

10
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,137
But for millions of people around
the world plants like this and

11
00:00:44,137 --> 00:00:49,850
other sources emit lots of different
hazards that people breathe in.

12
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,568
So air pollution is not a single chemical,

13
00:00:52,568 --> 00:00:57,706
it's actually a mixture of thousands and
thousands of components collectively

14
00:00:57,706 --> 00:01:02,405
those components are thought to kill
about 7 million people every year.

15
00:01:02,405 --> 00:01:06,134
Now, we're faced with a number of big
air pollution challenges today one is

16
00:01:06,134 --> 00:01:08,170
stratospheric ozone depletion.

17
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,058
Now this is one where we've actually made
some huge progress, you may have heard

18
00:01:12,058 --> 00:01:15,615
about the hole in the ozone layer
that emerged in the 1970s and 80s.

19
00:01:15,615 --> 00:01:20,257
We actually took some steps to prevent and
actually arrest the growth of that ozone

20
00:01:20,257 --> 00:01:23,700
hole and
have made some huge strides there.

21
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,998
Where we haven't made strides
are things like atmospheric deposition.

22
00:01:26,998 --> 00:01:31,445
So power plants like this other sources
put air pollution into the air, it travels

23
00:01:31,445 --> 00:01:35,828
over time and space and unfortunately out
of that are come things like mercury and

24
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:40,420
persistent organic pollutants
that are harmful to human health.

25
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,640
We also have issues in city environments
like an arbor of urban smog,

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,571
particulate matter ozone
that we can breathe.

27
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:48,931
A huge defining issue and

28
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:53,470
environmental health is climate change
resulting from greenhouse gases.

29
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,967
We're fortunate this smokestack puts
out almost entirely carbon dioxide, but

30
00:01:57,967 --> 00:02:02,792
that's not the case with many plants, and
even though carbon dioxide's not directly

31
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:05,857
toxic it's very much driving
global climate change.

32
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:10,518
Finally, there is actually no place to run
even going home indoor air pollution turns

33
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:16,739
out to be a substantial source of exposure
for many, many people around the world.

34
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,115
Air pollution is not a new problem,
if we go all the way back in time to 61 AD

35
00:02:21,115 --> 00:02:25,839
the famous Roman Seneca, was noted as
talking about the pestilential vapors and

36
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:28,500
soot that emitted from
the chimneys in Rome.

37
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,437
Fast forward 1000 years and Moses
Mainmonides was quoted as talking about

38
00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:39,050
the are in cities becoming stagnant and
turbid, thick, misty and foggy.

39
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,403
We've talked previously about the great
London Smog of 1952 that was in

40
00:02:43,403 --> 00:02:46,065
the United Kingdom, but
we had our own event.

41
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:50,516
Actually a series of them starting in
1948 in Donna of Pennsylvania where

42
00:02:50,516 --> 00:02:53,670
20 people were killed by air pollution.

43
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,550
In 1966 in the city of New York
something like 3,000 people were made

44
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,127
substantially ill, and

45
00:03:00,127 --> 00:03:06,401
up to 10% of the City's population
was impacted by a smog event there.

46
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:10,742
Now there was a highly influential study
that was done looking at the effects of

47
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:14,754
air pollution on adults in
the United States in the 1970s and 80s,

48
00:03:14,754 --> 00:03:18,150
this is the so-called
Harvard Six Cities study.

49
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,777
And this was one of the very first
studies that very strongly and

50
00:03:21,777 --> 00:03:26,230
unambiguously showed a positive
correlation, between levels of pollution

51
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,601
in the air of a community and
mortality in that community.

52
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:33,853
And so what they did was study six
different cities including a city called,

53
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:35,720
Steubenville, Ohio.

54
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,705
And looked at the average lifespan and
the estimated loss of life among people

55
00:03:40,705 --> 00:03:45,625
in these different cities, and
I'll sort of jump ahead to the conclusion.

56
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,416
They found that in Steubenville,

57
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:51,556
Ohio people lived an average of four years
less with those highest air pollution

58
00:03:51,556 --> 00:03:56,570
levels compared to Portage Wisconsin the
city in the study with the cleanest air.

59
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:01,055
So this study again kind of definitively
showed that there is a link

60
00:04:01,055 --> 00:04:04,397
between chronic exposure to air pollution,
and

61
00:04:04,397 --> 00:04:07,831
mortality related to
cardiovascular outcomes.

62
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:11,334
So diving into this a little bit more,
these are different graphics

63
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:15,205
showing the relationship between
different measures of air pollution and

64
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:16,940
the six cities that I mentioned.

65
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,542
Steubenville, Ohio Portage, Wisconsin,
Waterton, Massachusetts, Topeka,

66
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:24,666
Kansas Harriman, Tennessee in St.
Louis, Missouri.

67
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:28,580
I don't want to get bogged down on
the details of each of these six specific

68
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,220
graphs, but I do want to note that if you
look for the P, that's Portage, Wisconsin.

69
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,200
You're going to find it in the lower left
corner of all of these graphics, so for

70
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,912
that least polluted city
in terms of air pollution.

71
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,960
They tended to have the lowest
effects observed, and

72
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll also ask you to look for the S.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,661
That's Steubenville, Ohio and

74
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:50,704
you'll see they tend to be in the upper
right hand corner of each of these graphs.

75
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:54,904
They had the highest air pollution and
they suffered the highest impact, and

76
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:58,975
we can also see a generally linear
response between air pollution levels in

77
00:04:58,975 --> 00:05:03,250
these cities and
the health impacts picture.

78
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,223
So a very important point I want to
illustrate here is that air pollution is

79
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:10,426
not static, it varies over time and
it varies over space.

80
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:15,062
So what you're looking at here are two
images of air pollution levels,

81
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:20,720
one at the national level and one zoomed
in on the southwestern United States.

82
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,576
And you can see that as the graph rolls
forward in time over the course of a day,

83
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,982
the air pollutions are fluctuating.

84
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:32,143
We start with a very strong air
pollution emission in the upper left

85
00:05:32,143 --> 00:05:36,330
corner of national map a giant
wildfire occurring in Canada.

86
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,970
And you can see the air pollution there
actually spreads out over the course

87
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,559
of the day.

88
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:44,579
And looking at the right hand side
to the Southwest you can see there's

89
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:48,888
another plume of emissions in
Northern California again from a wildfire.

90
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:53,178
But what you'll also observe over the
course of the day, is that the colors in

91
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:57,750
both images tend to get more vibrant and
the air pollution spreads out.

92
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,052
So again,
pollution is not the same over time and

93
00:06:00,052 --> 00:06:03,196
it's not the same over space, and
that's that's what makes it so

94
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:08,770
very difficult to understand from
an environmental health perspective.

95
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:13,258
If we zoom out to the global level here,
we're looking at a map of air pollution

96
00:06:13,258 --> 00:06:15,918
levels in different
cities around the world.

97
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,460
The green coloration on this map
indicates cities with safe or

98
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,730
acceptable amounts of air pollution,
and the yellow and

99
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,700
the red dots indicate areas with
less safe or harmful air pollution.

100
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,507
And again, you can see the air
pollution is not uniformly distributed,

101
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:32,200
Western Europe United States.

102
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,978
We have relatively low levels of air
pollution compared to specially to

103
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:38,419
South and East Asia.

104
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:43,720
So even at a global level we see massive
variations in the air pollution.

105
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,637
So we can also look at the health impacts
of this air pollution at a global scale.

106
00:06:47,637 --> 00:06:51,894
So here we're looking at two images one of
the rate of deaths from air pollution by

107
00:06:51,894 --> 00:06:53,730
country around the world.

108
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:58,387
One of the rate of disability adjusted
life years, and you see a similar pattern

109
00:06:58,387 --> 00:07:03,199
for both outcomes North America South
America much of Western Europe Australia.

110
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,620
These places we know have low exposure and
they also have lower burdens of disease.

111
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,457
Whereas sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and
East Asia have the highest levels of

112
00:07:12,457 --> 00:07:17,600
air pollution and
also the highest health impacts.

113
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,625
Unfortunately, we know that the burden
of air pollution is much stronger in low

114
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:26,090
income and more developing countries than
it is in high-income developed countries.

115
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,984
There's a couple of different reasons for
this, one is,

116
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:33,080
low income countries tend to have
much higher household exposures.

117
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,474
So, imagine that the only way
you have to heat your food and

118
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:39,955
to heat your home is an open fire
in the middle of your house.

119
00:07:39,955 --> 00:07:44,238
You're going to have substantial exposures
to particulate matter the whole time that

120
00:07:44,238 --> 00:07:47,975
fire is burning, compared to a home
where you have central air and heat and

121
00:07:47,975 --> 00:07:50,790
the exhaust is emitted outside.

122
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:55,248
We also know that low-income countries
tend to have much more rapid development

123
00:07:55,248 --> 00:07:59,324
in terms of industrialization or
urbanization into city environments.

124
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:02,360
And the development of their
transportation infrastructure that can

125
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,960
result in unchecked air pollution.

126
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,825
There's fewer preventive services and

127
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:09,850
less Health surveillance
available in low-income countries.

128
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,191
There also tends to be higher
maternal exposure during pregnancy.

129
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:17,315
Imagine you're a pregnant woman working
directly over a wood stove inside your

130
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:19,860
house, you're having a huge exposure.

131
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,042
And we also tend to see much
higher childhood exposures

132
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:26,445
in low-income nations compared
to high income Nations.

133
00:08:26,445 --> 00:08:30,506
So these factors and more make it
critical for us to look at air pollution,

134
00:08:30,506 --> 00:08:35,861
not just on a low local level,
but also on a global scale.
