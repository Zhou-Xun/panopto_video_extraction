00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,090
Hello. Welcome to this lecture on

2
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,000
hypothesis testing with
continuous outcomes.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,440
In this lecture, we'll focus

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,585
on two-sample hypothesis testing,

5
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:21,990
which is better known
as a two-sample T-test.

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,510
Now, one of the biggest questions

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,850
that we have in public health is,

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,195
why do some people get sick
and other stay healthy?

9
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:32,715
To begin to answer
that big question,

10
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:35,430
we have to know how to
test for associations

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,240
between exposures and
corresponding health outcomes.

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,810
For example, is the
average birth weight

13
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,070
of a baby born to women in

14
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,665
poverty different from
the average birth weight

15
00:00:45,665 --> 00:00:47,765
of a baby born to
women not in poverty?

16
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:50,390
In other words, we're trying
to figure out if poverty

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,765
has any association with
lower birth weights.

18
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:55,565
We might also ask,

19
00:00:55,565 --> 00:00:56,960
is the average birth level of

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,090
children living in
Southeast Michigan

21
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,475
different from the
average blood lead level

22
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:04,105
of children who live in
Southwestern Michigan?

23
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,690
Now we're interested in

24
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,310
knowing whether or
not where a child

25
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,835
lives has any association
with their blood lead level.

26
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:12,770
Making decisions about whether

27
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,110
exposures had any
association with

28
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,255
continuously distributed
health outcomes

29
00:01:17,255 --> 00:01:18,740
such as birth weight or

30
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,970
lead levels is facilitated
through a two-sample T-test.

31
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,190
So our learning
objectives are first to

32
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,305
apply statistical
inference concepts

33
00:01:27,305 --> 00:01:29,300
to one continuous outcome

34
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,760
that is measured on
one group of people,

35
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,190
and therefore requires
a one-sample T-test or

36
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,100
two groups of people using
a two-sample T-test.

37
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,780
We'll then state the null,

38
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,370
and the alternative
hypotheses that are

39
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,460
used in these two T-tests,

40
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,210
and then identify the statistics

41
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,740
that we use in one-sample,

42
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,270
and two-sample T-tests,

43
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,580
and then to comprehend
how a P-value and

44
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,860
confidence interval
both address how

45
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,190
a null hypothesis
can be rejected.

46
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,279
So in one-sample
hypothesis testing,

47
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:00,665
we are interested
in one population,

48
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:02,480
and our example here is

49
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,210
babies born to women
who live in poverty.

50
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,120
In this population, there is

51
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,600
a mean birth weight that we
are interested in describing,

52
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,720
represented by the
Greek letter Mu.

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,070
Perhaps, we have a
null hypothesis that

54
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,469
the mean birth weight of
these babies is 2,800

55
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:20,050
grams versus an alternative
hypothesis that

56
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,155
it is something other
than 2,800 grams.

57
00:02:23,155 --> 00:02:25,315
To compare these two hypotheses,

58
00:02:25,315 --> 00:02:28,045
we gather a sample of
data from the population,

59
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:29,470
and from that sample,

60
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,290
we compute the mean
sample birth weight.

61
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,609
We compare this number to 2,800
as the level of evidence,

62
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:39,700
and then we scale this by
the amount of skepticism,

63
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,780
or the standard error of

64
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,105
the mean that would
occur from these data.

65
00:02:43,105 --> 00:02:45,340
This produces the T-statistic,

66
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,395
which then leads to a P-value,

67
00:02:47,395 --> 00:02:49,900
and allows you to
either reject or not

68
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,790
reject the given null hypothesis.

69
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,295
Now, imagine I collected data,

70
00:02:55,295 --> 00:02:59,165
and it resulted in a
mean of 3,000 grams.

71
00:02:59,165 --> 00:03:00,560
The 3,000 grams is

72
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,465
represented by the
green vertical line,

73
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:03,950
and the null hypothesis of

74
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,340
2,800 is represented by
the vertical orange line.

75
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,730
If I have a sample
standard deviation of 700,

76
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,529
and a sample size of 25,

77
00:03:12,529 --> 00:03:15,050
that leads to a standard
error of the mean,

78
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,030
and leads to a histogram around

79
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,280
my sample mean that
looks like this.

80
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,080
The question now is,

81
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,520
due to sampling variability,

82
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,960
is the distance between

83
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,820
the green line and
the orange line big

84
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,500
enough for me to conclude
that there would be

85
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,155
a difference in
repeated sampling?

86
00:03:30,155 --> 00:03:31,790
The answer is no.

87
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,990
The orange line is still

88
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,170
encompassed by enough
of the histogram.

89
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,740
So it's also quantified
by a T-statistic,

90
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,925
which is 1.43, which
produces a P-value of 0.15.

91
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:45,055
The P-value is not
less than 0.05,

92
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:48,505
and therefore, I will not
reject the null hypothesis.

93
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:51,650
Now, in contrast,
suppose my information

94
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,515
was actually collected
from 100 babies.

95
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:56,450
In this case, the
two vertical lines

96
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,040
remain at the same point,

97
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,840
but the histogram is
more narrow now because

98
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,305
the standard error of the
mean will be smaller.

99
00:04:02,305 --> 00:04:07,950
The T-statistic is 2.86
leading to a P-value of 0.004,

100
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,155
which is less than 0.05,

101
00:04:10,155 --> 00:04:12,140
and I now would reject the null.

102
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,015
I believe that the
population mean

103
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:16,735
must be something
other than 2,800,

104
00:04:16,735 --> 00:04:19,430
because the orange
vertical line is way to

105
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,470
the left of the
corresponding histogram

106
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,270
or on my sample mean.

107
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,510
Now, we also could have
gotten a sample mean from

108
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:30,460
these 100 babies that was
not 3,000, but 3,100.

109
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,330
What this does is
move the histogram

110
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,160
to the right by 100 units,

111
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,930
so that the null
hypothesis value for

112
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,830
the orange line is even further
away from this histogram,

113
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,900
and the distance between
my sample mean and

114
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,830
the null mean is so far relative
to sampling variability,

115
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,270
that the T-statistic becomes

116
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,215
larger and the
P-value even smaller.

117
00:04:50,215 --> 00:04:52,125
I'm not giving you
the exact P-value,

118
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,920
but it's certainly
less than 0.001,

119
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,100
which is very strong
evidence to reject the null.

120
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,010
Now, as I suggested earlier,

121
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,700
we are less often interested in

122
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,300
an hypothesis above the mean of

123
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,150
one population having
a specific value.

124
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,990
Instead, we're more
interested in knowing if

125
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,695
there is a difference in the
means of two populations.

126
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:17,030
So I have just described

127
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,940
a one-sample T-test
as a motivation for

128
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,800
the more interesting
question which is

129
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,485
answered through a
two-sample T-test.

130
00:05:24,485 --> 00:05:27,015
So imagine our first
population, again,

131
00:05:27,015 --> 00:05:28,460
is women living in poverty,

132
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,480
and the birth weights of

133
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,505
those babies born to those women.

134
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:32,900
We have a mean birth weight for

135
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,730
those babies represented by Mu,

136
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,050
now the subscript one to
indicate the first population.

137
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,770
Correspondingly, we now
have a second population,

138
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,230
and these are babies
born to women

139
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,850
who do not live in poverty.

140
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,040
Those babies have a
birth weight represented

141
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,350
by Mu with a subscript two.

142
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,090
What I want to do is compare

143
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,065
the means of these
two populations,

144
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:54,970
and ask the question on average,

145
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,990
does a mother's living
in poverty have

146
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,875
an association with the
birth weight of her newborn?

147
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,780
If there's no association,

148
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,005
then these two populations
should have the same mean,

149
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:07,745
and so the null hypothesis

150
00:06:07,745 --> 00:06:09,110
is that the two means are equal

151
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,310
to each other or

152
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,425
equivalently that their
difference is zero.

153
00:06:12,425 --> 00:06:14,435
If there is an association,

154
00:06:14,435 --> 00:06:18,020
then these two means should
be different from each other,

155
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,260
or their difference should be
something other than zero.

156
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,740
So we begin to collect data
from these two populations.

157
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,240
I go to the first population.

158
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,010
I gather a sample of data with

159
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,780
the sample mean, sample
standard deviation,

160
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,890
and sample size often
noted with subscripts one,

161
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,390
and I'll get corresponding
values in our sample from

162
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,375
the second population
with subscripts of two.

163
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,570
Now the difference in
the two sample means is

164
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,850
our best estimate of
the difference that we

165
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,295
might think exist
in the population,

166
00:06:46,295 --> 00:06:48,950
and the difference
between their two means.

167
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,325
If this difference is big enough,

168
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:52,650
we're going to reject the null

169
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,050
hypothesis and conclude that

170
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,245
the two populations
have different means.

171
00:06:57,245 --> 00:06:59,690
However, we have to look at

172
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,970
the difference in the
sample means relative

173
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,110
to the magnitude of the
difference's standard error,

174
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,290
or the standard deviation of
the sampling distribution.

175
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,480
Again, different
studies will produce

176
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,405
different sample means
for the two populations.

177
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:17,360
We want to know how variable
these differences are.

178
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,040
We know already
that if X bar one,

179
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,660
and X bar two are collected,

180
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,615
they have individual
standard errors

181
00:07:23,615 --> 00:07:26,720
represented by those
two equations there.

182
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,930
Mathematically, it can be
shown that the difference in

183
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,550
these two sample means has

184
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,870
the standard error
that is equal to,

185
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,220
first, the sum of the
squared standard errors,

186
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,145
and then the square
root of that sum.

187
00:07:40,145 --> 00:07:42,515
Now that we have
this standard error,

188
00:07:42,515 --> 00:07:44,345
I again compute a statistic,

189
00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:45,830
which compares the difference in

190
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,610
the sample means relative to
their sampling variability.

191
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,620
This is a ratio of the evidence

192
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,150
measured by the difference and

193
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,335
the amount of skepticism

194
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:56,950
represented by the standard
error of the mean.

195
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,770
I emphasize, again, that

196
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,000
the denominator of
this T-statistic,

197
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,170
the standard error
for a difference of

198
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,015
two-sample means is not

199
00:08:05,015 --> 00:08:07,445
the sum of the individual
standard errors.

200
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,410
It's the sum of the square of

201
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,995
the standard errors
then square root again.

202
00:08:12,995 --> 00:08:15,590
So the statistic is
then converted to

203
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,500
a P-value like it was
in a one-sample t-test.

204
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,540
We use the P-value
to decide whether or

205
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,750
not to reject the
null hypothesis.

206
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,260
Once again, a value of

207
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,750
the statistic that's
bigger than two or less

208
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,430
than negative two will give me

209
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,415
a P-value that is less than 0.05,

210
00:08:31,415 --> 00:08:34,910
and allow me to reject
the null hypothesis.

211
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:39,050
Now a 95 percent confidence
Interval for the difference

212
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,380
in the two population
means is computed by

213
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,500
taking the difference
in the sample means and

214
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,880
simply adding or subtracting

215
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,420
two standard errors
of their difference.

216
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,980
If this 95 percent
confidence interval

217
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,840
does not contain zero,

218
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,515
then the P-value must
be less than 0.05.

219
00:08:57,515 --> 00:09:00,560
It's important to see
how the T-statistic and

220
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,960
the 95 percent
confidence interval all

221
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,870
use the same information in
slightly different ways.

222
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,900
We use the difference
in sample means,

223
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,850
we use the sampling variability
of their difference,

224
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,530
and we use the critical value of

225
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,475
two that we got from a
normal distribution.

226
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:17,535
So as an example,

227
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:19,730
I've pulled information
from my manuscript

228
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,700
published by Pace and
colleagues in 2017,

229
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,230
where they were
interested in seeing if

230
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,445
the consumption of sugary
beverages in adults

231
00:09:26,445 --> 00:09:30,010
had any association with the
level of calorie intake.

232
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,870
So the first population
was all US adults who

233
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,755
reported consuming less than
one sugary beverage per day,

234
00:09:36,755 --> 00:09:40,624
and that population has a mean
calories per day of Mu_1,

235
00:09:40,624 --> 00:09:43,010
and the second population
was all US adults who

236
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,700
reported consuming one to two
sugary beverages per day,

237
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,950
and they had a mean
calories per day of Mu_2.

238
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,020
Again, my hypotheses are first to

239
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,230
null that these two populations
have the same mean,

240
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,390
and the alternative is
that these two populations

241
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,985
have a different
mean caloric intake.

242
00:09:58,985 --> 00:10:00,905
From the first population,

243
00:10:00,905 --> 00:10:02,975
they gathered a set of data from

244
00:10:02,975 --> 00:10:05,285
just under 2,400 individuals.

245
00:10:05,285 --> 00:10:06,470
You see the sample mean and

246
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,705
the sample standard
deviation on the slide.

247
00:10:08,705 --> 00:10:10,475
From the second population,

248
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:12,830
they gather data on a
sample of just over 1,200

249
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,560
individuals with a
corresponding sample mean,

250
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,330
and sample standard deviation.

251
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,880
I take these six
pieces of information,

252
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,870
and I plug them into the
formula for the T statistic.

253
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,260
You can see here that I get

254
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,590
a T-statistic of negative 10.4.

255
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,980
Again, the difference in
the sample means could be

256
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,615
computed either by taking

257
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:34,160
the first mean minus the second,

258
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,080
or the second minus the first.

259
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,590
The ordering is irrelevant,
because in the end,

260
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,885
we're interested in the
magnitude of the statistic,

261
00:10:40,885 --> 00:10:43,280
not the actual sign
on the statistic.

262
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,260
Again, this statistic of negative

263
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,635
10.4 gives me a
very small P-value.

264
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:50,840
Remember that the
critical value is two,

265
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,790
and here we have a
test statistic that is

266
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,250
very far to the left
of negative two,

267
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,445
and therefore, produces
a very small P-value.

268
00:10:58,445 --> 00:11:00,320
From these data, we

269
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,615
conclude that we will
reject the null hypothesis.

270
00:11:02,615 --> 00:11:04,490
These two populations have

271
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,160
different mean calories per day.

272
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,415
We could also compute a 95
percent confidence interval

273
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:13,255
for the two population
means, and their difference.

274
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,065
From that formula, we plug in

275
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:16,790
the information from the data,

276
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,590
and I get a confidence
interval of negative

277
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,800
268 to negative 182.

278
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,680
Again, this is a
plausible range of values

279
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,565
for the difference in the
population and the means.

280
00:11:27,565 --> 00:11:30,260
The null value of zero
for the difference is

281
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,590
not in this interval,
and therefore,

282
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,770
my data tell me that

283
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,260
the actual difference
is different from zero,

284
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,920
and I reject that null value.

285
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,440
So at this point, we
have two pieces of

286
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,970
information to make
a decision here.

287
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,030
We have a T-statistic
of negative 10.4,

288
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,040
and a 95 percent
confidence interval

289
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,730
for the difference in

290
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,675
the means of negative
268 to negative 192.

291
00:11:53,675 --> 00:11:56,300
So based upon these
data, I ask you,

292
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,235
would you support a press release

293
00:11:58,235 --> 00:11:59,750
that states that consumption of

294
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,375
sugary beverages
is a direct cause

295
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,595
of higher caloric intake?

296
00:12:04,595 --> 00:12:06,835
The answer to that
question is no.

297
00:12:06,835 --> 00:12:09,340
A t-test is used only to look at

298
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,730
the association between an
exposure and an outcome.

299
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,640
It cannot be used to
conclude that one might

300
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,805
be a causal impact on the other.

301
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:22,245
So concluding an
association is appropriate,

302
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:24,970
including a causal
relationship between these

303
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,150
two from a T-test
is inappropriate.

304
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,800
So the true elegance of

305
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,410
a two-sample T-test
is often lost in

306
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,930
the computations in the
formulas that I've just shown

307
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,900
you but they are important
for the computer to use.

308
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,655
So when a SQL to this lecture,

309
00:12:39,655 --> 00:12:40,540
I would like to strip away

310
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,310
the mathematics and instead use

311
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,960
a visual heuristic that also

312
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,867
conveys how a two-sample
t-test operates.
