1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,370
All right. Looks like we're down a few people today.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,540
Draw on Halloween. Doesn't seem to be as much as the drive.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,730
I don't know, candy parties, etc.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:21,030
But thank you to you faithful few who showed today and today we are going to talk about sound propagation a little bit more,

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:26,040
but then we're going to focus for most of today's session on how we actually go about controlling sound.

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:32,970
I brought in some equipment, we'll do a few demonstrations and hopefully drive all these concepts home in a very practical way.

7
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:40,620
So as I said, we've touched a bit on propagation, how sound travels through the environment already today.

8
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,729
We're going to talk a little bit more in detail about concepts like Directivity and

9
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,630
how we can use distance to our advantage as well as this concept of reverberation.

10
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,769
And then I think in other classes you've all hopefully been exposed to the concept of the hierarchy of controls,

11
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,540
how we actually approach implementing controls to any kind of exposure problem.

12
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,450
And in this case, I want you to have a better understanding of how that hierarchy applies specifically to noise.

13
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:15,870
So when we're talking about sound, it's really important for us to have a sense of what so-called sound field we're in.

14
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:21,780
And so you can see here we might have a source, let's say a compressor or something making noise in the corner.

15
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:29,650
And we've got a graph here where the X-axis is distance from the source and the Y axis is sort of a

16
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:36,479
conceptual representation of how variable noise levels are expected to be depending on distance.

17
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,930
And so if we get a rate really close to a source, typically within one dimension of the source.

18
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:49,950
So if we imagine the largest dimension of the source, if we're within one dimension of the source, we're going to be in a so-called near field.

19
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:57,479
And you can see the variability here is actually quite large when you get up close and personal to a source, sound is bouncing off you.

20
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,680
It's bouncing off all sorts of things around you and it makes for a sort of highly variable

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,040
noise level once you get ideally more than one dimension away or so from that source,

22
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:15,330
we get into what we call the free field, and here you can see the variability drops down to sort of a minimal level.

23
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,790
And we end up with this theoretical six decibel graph for every doubling of distance.

24
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,770
So the free field again is very useful because we have very kind of predictable behavior of the sound.

25
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:33,150
And again, every time I move twice as far away from that source, I'm going to be dropping my exposure substantially up to six decibels.

26
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:38,790
Then if as is typically the case, we're in a room with lots of reflective surfaces,

27
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,180
eventually we're going to come up against a wall or some other kind of barrier,

28
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:51,000
and we're getting into a so-called reverberant field where now we've got essentially echoes or the noise bouncing back towards us.

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,250
So we're going to get back into a regime where the levels of noise are highly variable.

30
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:02,040
So kind of the takeaway from this graphic is we don't want to make measurements in the

31
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,670
near field because the noise levels are going to be jumping up and down substantially.

32
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,570
We don't want to make measurements in the reverberant field for the same reason.

33
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:16,170
Really what we're looking for is this sweet spot, the free field where the sound is going to behave in a very predictable fashion.

34
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:23,429
Now we can make a few assumptions about propagation and we have two.

35
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,620
So most examples I've talked about so far have assumed free field conditions.

36
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,690
In other words, we're not in a room with a bunch of reflective surfaces. We're out, for instance, in an open field.

37
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:40,620
And so if we think about a free field condition, again, no real reflective surfaces around us and we've got a so-called point source.

38
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,590
So a single point in space that's emitting sound.

39
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:53,370
We have a relationship here that we can formalize between the sound pressure level that we typically measure and the sound power level, which,

40
00:03:53,370 --> 00:04:01,500
as I said previously, we can't measure directly but might in fact be labeled, for instance, on the piece of equipment that we're working with.

41
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,320
And so I'll highlight this equation requires that we be in distance units of meters,

42
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:13,350
but the relationship here is we can estimate the sound pressure level if we know the sound power

43
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:19,709
level and we know the distance from this source distance here representatives are in meters,

44
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:23,280
so ten times the log of four pi r squared.

45
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,120
We subtract that from the sound power level and that'll give us the sound pressure level.

46
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,589
And we'll look through an example in a moment here. Alternatively, sometime we want to know, or sometimes we may want to know the difference.

47
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:40,829
So let's say I know the sound pressure level here and I want to move the piece of equipment a little bit further away.

48
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,750
What's the likely sound pressure level at that second location?

49
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:51,460
So here I could estimate the sound pressure level at the spot I'm considering moving the equipment to.

50
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:59,730
And I'll kind of distill this equation into we've got our starting sound pressure level -20 times the log.

51
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:06,320
Hand over the first distance between the source and typically the worker we're concerned about.

52
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:14,209
Divided by the second distance from the source. So the two relatively straightforward equations that can be really practical in terms of

53
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:19,400
figuring out how loud is my exposure going to be at a particular distance from the source?

54
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:26,680
So let's just run through an example here. Let's say I've got a piece of machinery that was made in the European Union.

55
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:34,070
And as we talked about previously, the EU requires that some types of machinery be labeled with their estimated sound power.

56
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:39,080
So I look at the label, the sticker on the machine, and it says A sound power level of 100 decibels.

57
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,850
Let's say I've got the machine on soft ground in a nice wide open field.

58
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,220
I'm kind of treating this as free field conditions.

59
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,220
I want to know what's the sound pressure level going to be two meters or about six feet from this source?

60
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,860
So I've got my equation that we talked about earlier.

61
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:03,290
So the sound pressure level is going to be the sound power level minus ten times the log of four pi to R squared or 100 decibels.

62
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,709
That's our sound power level minus ten log, four pi squared.

63
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,720
And if I run through the math and again do this on your calculator just to make sure you're doing it correctly,

64
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,790
I can figure out two meters away from this piece of equipment, the level is going to be about 83 decibels.

65
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:24,890
Now, we talked previously about how most regulatory agencies in the world are really concerned about noise levels less than 85.

66
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:33,169
So with this one equation, I can figure out if you're not within closer than two meters or about six feet of this equipment,

67
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,820
we're not really concerned about your hearing.

68
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:42,980
So one thing I could do here would be to draw a big yellow line or a red line around that equipment and say if you stay outside this red line,

69
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:51,469
you don't need hearing protection, for instance. Now, I've talked about the free field and free fields are great.

70
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,590
They're sort of the default assumption for acoustics.

71
00:06:54,590 --> 00:07:01,729
They're also relatively rare. So oftentimes we have to consider the Directivity or directivity the source,

72
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:06,230
and we sort of qualify this using something called the Directivity factor or.

73
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:14,480
Q And this is simply a measure of roughly how spherical is the radiation of sound from the source.

74
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,720
And so we've got really four directivity factors we consider.

75
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,770
So if I truly have a point source in a bunch of open air with no real services around it,

76
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,950
I'm having, you know, as close to spherical emission as we can.

77
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:36,710
And I've got a directivity factor here of one. On the other hand, if I take that same source and I put it down on a surface, a floor, for instance,

78
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:41,750
well, now I've cut that radiation zone from a whole sphere into just a half a sphere.

79
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,530
And I've got a directivity factor here of two.

80
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:51,049
Now, if I take that same source, keep it on the floor, but move it up against a wall like you can see here.

81
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,700
I now cut it down to a quarter of a sphere that that sound coming out.

82
00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:02,989
And so I've got a directivity factor of four. And finally, sort of worst case scenario, if I take that source, leave it on the floor,

83
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,370
leave it against one wall, but push it into a corner and now it's against another wall.

84
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,760
And now restricted this from completely spherical radiation down to just one edge of a sphere.

85
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,430
And I end up with a directivity factor of eight.

86
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:26,960
So remember, I have this equation that we just talked about a moment ago that lets me estimate sound pressure level given sound power and distance.

87
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:31,760
But I'm going to need to modify that equation to account for directivity if I have that going on.

88
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:38,120
And so let's say I've got that same piece of machinery, 100 decibels sound power,

89
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,829
but now instead of being out in an open field, I've got it in a corner in my factory.

90
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,970
So again, I've got a one eighth sphere that it can radiate sound out over.

91
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:54,680
My question is still, what's the sound pressure level likely to be at two meters or about six feet away from the source?

92
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:02,780
And so I modify my equation slightly here. So we've already looked at LP equals LW minus ten times the log of four pi r squared.

93
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,750
When I have any kind of directivity to consider,

94
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:17,360
I put this additional equation on the ends ten times the log of Q and so Q I highlighted on our previous graph here,

95
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,380
so I've got Q of one, two, four and eight.

96
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:27,170
And so if I consider my machine in a corner,

97
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:34,370
I've got one eighth of a sphere that can radiate out over that gives me a Q of eight and I can actually plug that into my equation.

98
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:39,530
So we already ran through this and figured out if I just run this portion of the equation,

99
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,890
I'm at 83 decibels, but now I have this directivity to consider.

100
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:49,819
And when I run through ten times the log of eight and add that, I'm going to end up with a sound pressure level of now 92 decibels.

101
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,180
So same source, I've just put it in a corner.

102
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:59,780
Kind of the worst case scenario and the sound pressure level at six feet has now gone up by almost ten decibels.

103
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,330
So this ought to get us thinking, well,

104
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:11,950
where I position equipment in space can have a huge impact on what my workers or what my community members in ways exposures are going to be.

105
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,600
Now a highlight. We actually have applications of Directivity.

106
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,810
We talked about this a little bit in the first lecture, but I'll just revisit the long range acoustic device here.

107
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,469
So the L Rad, as I mentioned previously,

108
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:35,510
is designed to send very focused messages through essentially beams of sound that can travel upwards of five kilometers.

109
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,780
So this is pretty, pretty cool, unprecedented technology.

110
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:47,929
Again, the idea being, you know, if you're the enemy, you can listen in on electronic signals or probably already stories from the the war in Ukraine,

111
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:54,590
where Ukraine is intercepting electronic messages and using them to essentially figure out where people are located in space.

112
00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:00,379
Well, the idea here is unless you're actually within that beam of sound, there's no way you can sort of hack this message.

113
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,720
It's a very secure form of communication.

114
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:08,629
But as I said in the first lecture, people very quickly figured out, well, I can turn this into a weapon, too,

115
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:17,360
because nobody likes to be exposed to levels of, say, 162 decibels, you know, potentially immediately harmful to your hearing.

116
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:25,550
And so the folks who invented this device have essentially figured out how to circumvent the inverse square law.

117
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,870
So we've talked previously about how sound drops with the square of distance.

118
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:34,040
So a little increase in distance means a dramatic reduction of sound.

119
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:40,639
Well, these folks have figured out how to, you know, not violate physics, but design a device that essentially bypasses that.

120
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,720
So you don't get that six decibel drop per per doubling of distance.

121
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,950
Okay. So Directivity is important. And again, if we're situating equipment, we want to think about, well,

122
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,440
this equipment is probably going to generate less noise overall if it's out in the middle of the room than if it's in a corner,

123
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,770
at least if I have people working relatively close to that equipment.

124
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,790
Another thing we have to think about is reverberation.

125
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,230
And this is simply the the persistence of sound in space.

126
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,570
I'll show you some examples or actually I'll play you some examples in a few minutes.

127
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:17,959
So any time we're in a confined area like the classroom here and there's sound being emitted,

128
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:24,170
that sound is traveling directly from me to your ears, but it's also bouncing off the surfaces around us.

129
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:29,510
So if we didn't have the acoustical panels on the ceiling and we didn't have carpet in this room,

130
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,070
my voice would sound much different to you because you'd be having a lot more reflected sound

131
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:38,990
coming to your ears at a slightly different timing than the sound directly from my voice.

132
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,049
A little bit of reverberation is not a bad thing.

133
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:49,760
In fact, it turns out that humans aren't designed and we don't really like to be in an environment where there's no reverberation at all.

134
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,890
It sounds quite unnatural, but if we've got reverberation, that's too great.

135
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,540
We can start to get again,

136
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:04,280
primarily a loss of speech intelligibility because your brain is really good at decoding speech if it comes into both ears at the same time.

137
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,900
But if the speech on your right side is coming in a little bit faster than the reflection that's coming in your left ear,

138
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,210
your brain really struggles with that. And the more the reverberation, the more that struggle.

139
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,469
Now, I just added this slide this morning. I think this is really funny just to, you know, break things up a little bit.

140
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:29,630
But I will say the pigeons available for acoustic type humor are pretty slim, so I'm not even sure you can read this.

141
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,760
The sound from a musician on stage bounces off the auditorium walls to surround the audience.

142
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,840
The sound from a pigeon on the stage does not do this.

143
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,490
The reason is acoustics. Yeah, okay.

144
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,330
Like I said, there's not much out there on the internet, but I'm trying here.

145
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:52,430
Give me a little bit of credit for that. So reverberation really is quite important.

146
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:59,509
The factors we have to consider here are primarily, well, what is the distance that the sound travels between the reflections?

147
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:03,950
The longer it's traveling, the longer the delay before it hits your ears.

148
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,910
So distance is one thing. And the other thing is the surfaces around us.

149
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:15,350
Again, we've got acoustic tiling in here and carpeting very purposely put it in this classroom to cut down on reverberation.

150
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:21,380
That's why you'll almost never find a classroom that doesn't have carpet or doesn't have some kind of acoustical treatment.

151
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,570
It becomes very difficult to learn. And you might look at these tiles and think, well, what are they actually doing?

152
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:31,220
They actually do quite a bit in terms of cutting down on those reflections of sound.

153
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:38,060
Now we can think about reverberation qualitatively, but we can actually quantify this too.

154
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,020
And we actually have a measure called the reverberation, time or t60.

155
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:48,590
And the way we measure this is essentially we create a very loud but transient sound.

156
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:55,340
So we can do this two ways. We can crank up a speaker like we're going to do in a little while and create a high level sound,

157
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,720
maybe 100 decibels, or with the right kind of instrumentation we could have, for instance.

158
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,880
To cap gun or a starter pistol and create a very brief impulse sound.

159
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:09,190
And what we're looking for is once we activate that sound and the sound stops.

160
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:14,290
How long does it take for the sound level in the room to drop by 60 decibels?

161
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:18,700
The longer it takes to come down 60 decibels, the more reverberation we have.

162
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,200
And I'll show you again an extreme example of this in a couple of minutes.

163
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,040
So reverberation time is something we can control with how we design the room.

164
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:35,020
And there are guidelines out there for what kind of spaces need or sort of what sort of reverberation.

165
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,259
Times are acceptable in different kinds of spaces.

166
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,020
And so if you think kind of qualitatively, again,

167
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:51,339
we probably have different expectations for reverberation in a music hall or a rehearsal room than we do in a classroom or a cafeteria or a gymnasium.

168
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:57,520
So I'm going to play you here a sequence of the same clip of sound, but with different reverberation.

169
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,290
Times applied to it. Many factors influence eligibility.

170
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:06,910
So that's about a 0.6 second reverberation time. Pretty clear.

171
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:10,540
Pretty understandable. You can hear there's maybe a little bit of echo in there, but it's not too bad.

172
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:17,200
What if we go up to about 0.9? Let's see here. Minute impact is able to see what you're doing.

173
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:23,320
So still understandable, but you can start to hear there's a lot more reflection, there's a lot more reverberation going on there.

174
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,959
We can certainly understand what's being said. So that might be appropriate again for, say, a cafeteria,

175
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:37,300
maybe a music rehearsal area if we get up to about 1.4 seconds because you can get a little with again,

176
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,120
still understandable, but starting to lose the clarity.

177
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:46,629
Again, the sound is is traveling different distances and it's not all arriving at the same time at the receiver the recorder.

178
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:55,840
In this case, if we look at about 1.6 seconds, you know, that's starting to get to the boundary where,

179
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,000
you know, I certainly would not use that in a classroom, maybe not even in the cafeteria.

180
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,060
It might be okay in a bus station or something like that.

181
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:12,400
And if we get up to about 1.9 seconds, you know, that's that's basically what a really bad P.A. system sounds like,

182
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:18,010
either because the electronics are bad or because you're just in a space that simply untreated,

183
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,190
there's nothing absorbing those sounds and they're just ricocheting around.

184
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:27,249
So you can start to get a sense that reverberation time certainly has an impact on the quality of sound,

185
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:33,229
but it also has an impact on your ability to understand spoken sound or speech intelligibility.

186
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,550
Well, yeah, I would I wanted to comment that.

187
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:42,879
I think that when when people designed airports they didn't think about and

188
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,050
through that because you don't understand anything that would be exactly right.

189
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:53,290
That's a great example I threw at a bus station. As you know, that's my idea of like a quintessential bad communication environment.

190
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,640
But airports are not much better.

191
00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:02,830
I will say oftentimes when airports were designed and a lot of airports in the United States were built out in the 1960s and 1970s,

192
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:08,830
air travel was exploding. This was not really a concept that was kind of programed into the design.

193
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:16,990
So a lot of airports that have gone back and essentially reconfigure the space just so people have any chance of understanding what's been done.

194
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:22,900
If you go to a newer airport or one that's very recently been renovated, this is much more of a priority now.

195
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:27,639
And it's it's good for all of us, but it's especially good for people with a hearing impairment.

196
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,640
So you can think of that as kind of an accommodation it needs to be made.

197
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,040
So people who, you know, even in the best of circumstances have trouble hearing can still hear messages.

198
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:42,250
Yeah, great example. So this is the world's longest reverberation.

199
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,049
There's a an underground oil tank in Scotland that someone found in there.

200
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:51,370
Like, you know, these acoustic people are insane. They're like, I bet this has the world's longest reverberation time.

201
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:57,790
Let's fire a gun in here and see. So I'm not the only weird noise person in the room, so I'll just play this for you.

202
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:14,590
So just completely insane that that sound is still bouncing around in this this facility.

203
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,719
And I can't remember. It's like a 32nd reverberation time or something.

204
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,750
It's just 75 seconds. I stand corrected.

205
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:28,479
So just crazy that you can still hear a little bit of the reverberation.

206
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,810
So that's kind of the worst case example of what we don't want to do.

207
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,850
Again, for areas especially where speech is important, we want to focus on reverberation.

208
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:45,070
Time to make the one second to make the room more, more comfortable, more easily understood in terms of speech.

209
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,829
The also thing the other thing we want to think about, though,

210
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,780
is if we're trying to control noise in a room not just for speech, but to bring noise levels down,

211
00:19:53,170 --> 00:20:01,420
you know, for many people who are standing right next to a piece of equipment they're working with, most of that noise is coming directly to them.

212
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:09,909
So if I treat the walls that are farther away and maybe cut down a little bit on the reflections, I'm doing nothing about that direct noise exposure.

213
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:14,530
So we can't just think about treating the walls. We always have to think about the source itself too.

214
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:24,340
And so because it's such a long hallway, that's why there was like so I and so on.

215
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,940
So if it's like a lot worse, then you're recording for me, I'll be damned.

216
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,209
Is that correct? So it is true.

217
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:38,140
The more kind of twists and turns the space takes, the more the reflections are going to be absorbed, or at least not come back to you.

218
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:43,000
So they may still be bouncing around far away, but they're not returning to you as as the receiver.

219
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,839
I mean, and a totally analogous comparison here.

220
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:53,050
If you think about stealth aircraft, right, their whole job is to avoid getting detected by radar.

221
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:58,749
So they end up having a bunch of nooks and crannies in the surface that basically trap that radar energy.

222
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:03,969
It bounces around inside and it doesn't return to the the origin of that.

223
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:11,170
So it can't be detected. So we can use twists and turns to our our benefit for any time of energy, including acoustics.

224
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:22,360
Yeah, good point. Yet another thing for that headphones with noise canceling that I think it works with with another department.

225
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,540
I don't know the name that cancels this. Yeah.

226
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,700
From outside in council. So you can hear the outside now.

227
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,739
Yeah. We're actually going to talk a little bit about active noise cancellation towards the end of this lecture.

228
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,850
Ballmer So I'll just ask you to hold that comment. You're just a bit ahead of me, but great point.

229
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,450
So coming back to reverberation here, you know, it's it's one thing to talk about it qualitatively.

230
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:52,060
We can measure it with the t60. We also can sort of evaluate it as what's called a room constant.

231
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:58,929
And so the room constant basically just accounts for how much surface area is there in the room and what kind of materials

232
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:05,890
is it made at it if is it completely reflective material or is it very absorptive material like the acoustical tile?

233
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,450
And if we have that room constant, we can actually plug it into our equation here.

234
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:16,870
So we've already looked again at the the equation estimating sound pressure level from the sound power level.

235
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,730
And here, if we know the room constant, we can break out kind of the direct effects of noise.

236
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:25,650
So that, again, is me standing next to my equipment just getting blasted with noise.

237
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,990
That's not bouncing off anything. It's just going directly into my ears.

238
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:35,019
And then we can start to think about the indirect contribution, too, which is what's the noise that's not coming directly to me,

239
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,669
but bouncing off the surfaces around me and eventually getting it to me again.

240
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:47,380
For most workers who are using a noisy piece of equipment, treating the rooms, treating this, the ceiling, the floor,

241
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:52,570
that's not going to do anything for your worker because the sounds coming directly from the equipment into their ears.

242
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:59,890
But if you don't have workers who are sort of stationed or working directly with equipment but are just in a general room with equipment,

243
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,210
then treating the walls can be an effective way to cut down on noise levels.

244
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:12,490
Also highlight here and you may have been thinking, gosh, you know, carpet, acoustical tile, is this really making that big a difference in a room?

245
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:20,740
So I'll play you a demonstration here. This is a room that for the first recording is just completely concrete in all surfaces.

246
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:29,920
And I'll play you a sound recorded in there. I am saying a very firm rise room, so truly reverb.

247
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:36,130
And again, we've got all these reflective surfaces. The treatment that was put in for the second one is they just put carpet on the floor.

248
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,549
They didn't do anything with the walls or the ceiling, just the floor.

249
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:45,010
And I'm saying in the same room after curtains and then applying to the floor.

250
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:52,690
And so you can see, you know, that didn't cut the reverberation time down to maybe a super comfortable level, but it made a huge difference.

251
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,840
So we don't necessarily have to treat the entire room.

252
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,490
And if there happens to be a part of the room that the noise is bouncing most off of,

253
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:07,180
maybe we've got a source in a corner sort of facing towards the corner that's blasting noise, reflections around the room.

254
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:11,190
You know, maybe we just. Read that corner first and see how that does.

255
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:22,059
So lots and lots of options here. Again, reverberation is more for preservation of speech intelligibility, but it is a piece of noise control as well.

256
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,150
And so we're going to focus for the rest of the lecture on noise control.

257
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:33,070
So the idea here is we've got some kind of harmful noise exposure to a worker or to a member in the community, maybe in their household.

258
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,050
And we want to think about, well, how can I cut down that noise exposure?

259
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:45,040
And it's sort of a two part question. How can I do that and how can I do it most effectively and efficiently is kind of a second part.

260
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:51,159
And as with any kind of environmental hazard, we always have basically at least three options.

261
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,190
But but three is the one we we tend to focus on here.

262
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:59,620
So I can think about treating the source in some way. Can I change where the noise is being made?

263
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:07,030
I can think about the path that the sound is taking between the source and the people that we're worried about.

264
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:13,060
And as I've just mentioned a couple of times, that path may be direct right from the equipment to the person's ear,

265
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:20,560
or it could be indirect through, again, bouncing off of or traversing across a room in different ways.

266
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,630
And then I could also, of course, think about the receiver, the worker or the community member.

267
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:30,820
Now, I mentioned the hierarchy of controls before, which I know you guys have talked about in other classes,

268
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:37,809
but I'll just bring this back to the hierarchy of controls dictates that we always start with eliminating sources if we can,

269
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:44,770
so this noisy equipment doesn't need to be there, let's get rid of it. We just solve the problem or if the source has to be there.

270
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,919
But maybe there's a slightly quieter source I could substitute in.

271
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,520
We've got the second level of the hierarchy of controls substitution.

272
00:25:52,630 --> 00:26:01,630
If I have either been unable to fix the source or my fix wasn't enough, then I can think about dealing with the path that the sound travels through.

273
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:08,140
Maybe by putting in an engineering control to kind of control or contain some of the sound here.

274
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:15,430
And on the receiver side, I can think about administrative controls, maybe limiting the amount of time that person spends in noise,

275
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:26,079
or last and least I could think about personal protective equipment and PPE for noise is often to go to in this country kind of the primary fix.

276
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,709
It shouldn't be,

277
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:32,710
but we rely on a lot and it's so important we're going to spend the entire next lecture talking about just hearing protection devices.

278
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,769
But in this section, we're going to talk about basically all of the non hearing protection controls

279
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:42,550
that we always should try before we ever even think about hearing protection.

280
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:45,399
So let me just have you turn to the person next to you,

281
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:54,370
and I want you all to think about some noise controls that either workers or people in the community or you might experience just in your daily life.

282
00:26:54,370 --> 00:27:02,799
So what kind of technology or equipment out there has been specifically designed to make your life quieter or more intelligible?

283
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,130
So take a moment to talk amongst yourselves, and I'd love to hear what you come up with.

284
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:20,460
Mean. I think that I like your voice.

285
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:24,210
I love my father.

286
00:27:27,110 --> 00:28:01,470
I was like, I just thought got like last night I started saying like three years ago I was like, you know what?

287
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:07,910
I guess that's too strong. I think so, yeah.

288
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:14,610
Yeah. Wherever you go further down.

289
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,800
Can you help us? Yeah. Yeah.

290
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:28,660
I think you just need something other than merely, you know, having an effect, you know, in terms of this drug remdesivir.

291
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:37,420
Yeah. Yeah. I think that on their mind, I just heard, like.

292
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:45,981
Yeah, what do you think you might be able to use on her?

293
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:56,570
All right. All right. Let's go ahead and wrap it up. Yeah.

294
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:03,319
And if you guys want to, you want to stay where you are, we're going to get back together in just a minute.

295
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:08,629
But you're you're free to return to your original seat, too. So I was just catching snippets of conversation.

296
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,040
I heard some great ideas, but I'd love for you to share with the group here.

297
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:18,770
So what sorts of things did you come up with? Oh, Velma, please.

298
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,029
Yes. We talk about first the airplane that we flew.

299
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:27,920
Isn't that TV right? And the noise canceling headphones.

300
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:38,330
That is a good one, too, because if you use that without music, just you just put your your your most canceling the headphones in the airplane.

301
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:42,230
You know, you don't really hear the truth inside the airplane.

302
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,030
Okay. So both are essentially forms of personal protective equipment.

303
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:52,970
We've got sort of the conventional earplugs that we'll talk about next time, as well as active noise canceling headsets that can,

304
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:58,880
you know, essentially cancel noise that's coming in from the outside, which we'll talk about a little bit shortly.

305
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:03,080
Great example. One of the things did you come up with? Yeah, please.

306
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:10,370
We talked about just like walls or windows, like people putting insulation in their walls, even inside walls.

307
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:15,910
Sure. You know. Controlled by going from one room another.

308
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,919
Yeah. So application of insulation is a great form of sound control, as you say.

309
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,540
You might do it inside your house.

310
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:30,700
If you're tired of hearing your upstairs neighbor clumping around all the time, you can do it to the outdoors on an an outdoor facing wall.

311
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,740
You talk about windows too. So some of you may know there are different grades of windows there.

312
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,950
Single glazed or double glazed or even triple glazed windows.

313
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:45,219
The more levels of glazing you have, the better those windows are at blocking sound when they're closed.

314
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,510
Of course, those windows block zero sound when they're open, say, in the summer months.

315
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:55,780
Yeah. And this is more of a question before for whole neighborhood communities, you get to do voice control.

316
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:01,650
Because the first thing I thought about was the eight and 10 seconds I thought about is neighbors arguing with each other over it.

317
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:09,670
But I've had experience of neighbors not being able to resolve it and becoming a little neighborhood bar and shortening that each other.

318
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:17,230
Yeah, noise is a very contentious topic when it's your neighbor making the noise and you don't think that noise needs to be made.

319
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:21,700
You know, it could be your neighbor's barking dog, it could be your air conditioner, lots of different things.

320
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,209
So it is a very touchy issue.

321
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,660
Let's say you mentioned edgeways and I'll get to you in just a second.

322
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:35,290
Jordan, one of the things we can think about is not necessarily retrofitting communities, but when we design them in the first place,

323
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:41,350
trying to apply some urban design principles and making sure we're not creating issues

324
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:46,030
by putting one person's air conditioner right next to the next person's bedroom window,

325
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:51,160
for instance. We can do that in a neighborhood level. We could also do that at the level of an individual structure.

326
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:57,370
So so a little bit of design to go a long way to preventing those things but doesn't help them once they've already had.

327
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:02,920
Jordan You wanted to add what we were talking about require hours of quiet hours.

328
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,610
That would be more like an administrative control where you hire people as often.

329
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:11,499
Yeah, absolutely. So most cities that have a noise ordinance will say, you know,

330
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:17,530
you're allowed this much noise during the day and a lower noise level at night when most people are trying to sleep.

331
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:26,550
You may also have seen, you know, there are some communities that will have a sign when you enter the community that says no air brakes or no brakes.

332
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:34,030
If you've ever heard large diesel trucks, they can make a really loud kind of roaring sound when they use air to help stop the truck.

333
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,050
And some communities have said that's not allowed in our community. It's too loud.

334
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,259
The Federal Highway Administration, for the most part,

335
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:47,830
prohibits work unless it's emergency work on freeways between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. for the same reason,

336
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:53,890
you know, that's when people need to rest. We shouldn't be jackhammering concrete right next to their home during that time.

337
00:32:54,730 --> 00:33:00,580
Good. What other. Yeah, you mentioned, I guess this is not a community policy, but it affects community members.

338
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,549
So in restaurants, the goal is, you know,

339
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:11,620
flip as many tables as possible to be designed for people who are trying to cram people in the restaurants, that tablecloths are quieter.

340
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,380
You can have a conversation because those are observing some society.

341
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,420
Yeah, it's a great point. So restaurant design is kind of a hot topic right now.

342
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:22,479
There is some research, I'd say, of dubious quality.

343
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,180
It comes from a restaurant marketing firm,

344
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:32,139
but they essentially did some math and figured out at a certain decibel level you can guarantee that tables turn over at a particular frequency.

345
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:36,160
And oftentimes the higher the decibel level, the faster people get in and out.

346
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:42,010
And so if you're just trying to maximize money off a single table, you don't want people lingering.

347
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:48,160
You want them in and out, you know, ideally drinking as much as they can during that time, because that's how most restaurants make their money.

348
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:55,389
So we've got that kind of, I'll say faux economics because I don't necessarily believe that concept.

349
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:57,310
But then on the other hand, you have restaurants that are like,

350
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:02,799
I want to have a restaurant where people could actually talk to each other and tablecloths and absorptive materials.

351
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,530
And even in an industrial space that's been refinished,

352
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:11,530
you'll see maybe foam on the ceiling or something to cut down on the reverberation time and bring the noise level down.

353
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,940
So there's kind of competing rules,

354
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:19,600
schools of thought here between let's make it louder and make more money versus let's make it quieter so people can actually enjoy their meal.

355
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,750
And it's kind of a joke. Question What was that? It was a loud decibels being 144 mentioned in profit.

356
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:31,479
I know there does come a point where you're deafening your customers and nobody appreciates that.

357
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,219
So another one in the back. Oh yeah. This was more so related to right.

358
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:40,870
Restaurants and something like I've noticed restaurants have been background music.

359
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:46,270
Like depending on how loud music is, people will have to talk over the music.

360
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:50,230
Sure, people talk over each other and then you end up with like a very, very loud restaurant.

361
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:55,929
But if the music's kind of played like at the right volume where it's like quiet enough for you to hear it,

362
00:34:55,930 --> 00:35:02,440
but like you can also talk like a, you know, in your voice, like the vibe of the restaurant stays really positive.

363
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,660
So that would be, you know, another form of noise control is like just the volume that you play your music.

364
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,340
Absolutely right. And so maybe I'm just old, but the first situation where it's like.

365
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,030
Everyone screaming to talk over each other. That doesn't sound fun to me anymore.

366
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,280
I want a nice, quiet, you know, a little bit of music.

367
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:23,230
So I'm not listening to my neighbors so much, but I can still hear my table mates that that just sounds perfect.

368
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:28,089
Again, I'm not very interesting, but what other kinds of controls did you come up with?

369
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:33,550
Jordan More like a source control. I'm not talking about like engineering, but I used to play violin.

370
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:40,840
I have dark nerves and short on the bourgeois instrument and use it for practice some stuff so that it's not producing a not of a sound.

371
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:45,190
Yeah. So source control, it works for equipment, it works for musical instruments too.

372
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:48,910
I mean, brass instruments have mutes. You can put it in to make them quieter.

373
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:53,560
That's a great example. Brendon, did you have an alarm? Yeah, I'm just thinking, just transportation in general.

374
00:35:53,710 --> 00:36:00,820
So, like, you're on the train, you're on the bus, you're in a car. There's got to be stuff that they're putting in to minimize the sound.

375
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,160
But recently I went on the Gordie Howe tour that last Saturday.

376
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:11,680
Yeah. Yeah. And it was so interesting because they rented one of the busses overtaking like,

377
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,940
you know, the expressway into Detroit and it was so loud you couldn't even yeah.

378
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,820
You could have conversations. And presidents are people that you're next to people who are struggling to.

379
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:25,330
Sure. And I realized like busses are not supposed to be on.

380
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:29,049
It's not that kind of bus ride, not that amount of time. Yeah.

381
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:35,620
You know, so maybe it's just the space, how big the bus is or is not absorbing material and cars.

382
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:42,790
Well, I think it's a combination of both. So if you imagine if any of you have been on a nice sort of inner city bus intercity,

383
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:49,690
not not interested in where they're designed to go long distances at freeway speeds, they tend to have better windows.

384
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:53,169
They tend to have windows that don't open. They tend to be air conditioned.

385
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:57,790
So you can trap some of that sound out. Much more absorbent materials in there.

386
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,520
You know, sort of the worst case example is like a school bus.

387
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,409
If you all remember back to school busses, they're designed to go with low speeds, relatively short distances.

388
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:09,219
And noise control is like the last concert. So everything in there is ricocheting off.

389
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,879
Plus, you've got all the screaming kids in there, just a super horrible work environment.

390
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,100
I have to say, I've never been a bus driver.

391
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:23,980
And you contrast that to like a super high end sports car where there's been a lot of effort designed into the car to make it quiet.

392
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:30,370
They've probably got damping materials, as Jordan mentioned, in the doors and the ceiling in the body really high.

393
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:33,939
And of course, cars will add on to that active noise cancellation.

394
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:39,460
So there's some cars that will have speakers doing noise cancellation around the driver's head.

395
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:46,840
So so when you're sitting in this little bubble of canceled noise, it's like, wow, there's almost no noise in this car at all.

396
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:51,579
But I'll make this point later, but I'll just unveil it now.

397
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,139
Any you're doing active noise control.

398
00:37:53,140 --> 00:38:00,130
You are introducing more sound into the environment and there's going to be spaces to get quieter, but there's going to be spaces to get louder.

399
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:05,020
So if you're in that super nice car, you jerk your head to the left, it's going to be much,

400
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:10,659
much louder because you're no longer in kind of the bubble of active noise cancellation or yeah, I know some cars.

401
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:15,340
They increase your music as you increase your speed, you try to counteract that.

402
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:20,000
But when you abruptly stop the music of take some time to adjust lower.

403
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:25,540
So it's like blasting for a second and then it cools back down to recognize that speed change.

404
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:31,880
Yeah. So I mean, that's a great example of the car making itself louder and louder, just like the restaurant example too.

405
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:38,320
So you can hear over the engine. But you know, if the system doesn't correct quickly, you end up with a lot of unnecessary exposure.

406
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:44,340
Good example though. Yeah. Going to the same way I needed that that car with the noise canceling.

407
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:52,150
Yeah. Really. Especially when I pick up my kids from school, they you started to talk loud and now I know, I know.

408
00:38:53,050 --> 00:39:06,820
Which is just a minute. And then I turn on the radio a high volume, so maybe they will go low and with less volume, movies, voices, that doesn't work.

409
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:10,120
So you're like, keep turning it up, which that mama can't hear you.

410
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:16,870
And finally, I would say, Well, just one minute of silence, please.

411
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:22,480
Everybody was quiet and say, just one minute, and then of started again.

412
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,320
So you were controlling duration to an extent. That's absolutely legitimate.

413
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,400
So these are great examples. Let me ask you,

414
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:37,990
there is one piece of equipment on every motor vehicle that sold for on road use in America that's specifically designed to make it quieter.

415
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,770
And we call that a muffler. Exactly.

416
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:47,649
So if any of you have ever been near like a motorcycle with glass packs or no muffler on it, you can realize,

417
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:53,200
oh, my God, mufflers actually do a huge amount to reduce the noise coming out of a motor vehicle.

418
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:59,409
And then the other thing that didn't get mentioned explicitly, but coming back to Bernoulli's comments about transportation, you know,

419
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:06,459
when you're driving down 94 and there's walls on both sides of the freeway with maybe some art on them, those are not art installations.

420
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:11,770
Those are walls. So people can live in their homes, you know, immediately on the far side of the wall and not have to be scream.

421
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:17,640
And each other inside their home. So we can design communities in a way that reduces the noise.

422
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:23,880
And we didn't really even touch on occupational exposures. But there are lots of things we can do to make jobs quieter.

423
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,300
In fact. Yeah. Yeah. One more thing.

424
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:39,090
Well, is, you know, I think that the spies or the military who designed the gun with a silencer.

425
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,050
Mm hmm. Because they want. They don't. They didn't want to get this color.

426
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,420
But it is a good device. Sure.

427
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:56,640
If they are exercising and shooting and everything, they would need to use the silencer to avoid that noise for dead soldiers.

428
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:01,500
Yeah. So quick technical caveat. There's no such thing as a silencer.

429
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,489
They're called suppressors because they reduce the sound. There's nothing that silences the sound.

430
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:11,700
I mean, what you hear in the movies, whether it's like not not realistic at all, it brings it down maybe ten or 15 decibels.

431
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,370
So from 160 to 145, still really loud, but way better for the soldiers.

432
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:21,599
In fact, there's been an ongoing debate in the U.S. Some of you may know suppressors have

433
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,980
historically been illegal in most states because they were associated with crime.

434
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:33,809
But now there's a movement afoot to make suppressors more easily obtained so that people that go out shooting aren't putting themselves at extra risk.

435
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,700
It's like a way you can control the source.

436
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:44,080
So, you know, in America, we've always got tensions between like, well, are we promoting crime or are we protecting public health?

437
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:48,150
You know, ideally we're protecting public health, but in this case,

438
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:56,070
there's this long standing kind of association some people have between that type of equipment and trying to just be quiet so you can commit crimes.

439
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,590
So an interesting situation, but yeah, thank you for bringing that up, Thelma.

440
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:03,660
So I mentioned I wanted to get you back into groups. Let's go ahead and do that.

441
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,550
Feel free to get with somebody else or the same group. And I want you to take a look at this photo.

442
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:18,089
And I'd like for you to figure out five different ways that any of the people in this particular photo could reduce their own noise exposure.

443
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:26,300
So, you know, we've got a couple of workers here, one of whom is operating a jackhammer, and we've got some pedestrian passers by here.

444
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:31,260
So, again, take a couple of minutes. I'd like each group to come up with at least a couple of examples, again,

445
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:37,350
of what anybody in this scenario could do to lower their personal risk exposure or lower the exposure of people around.

446
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:47,070
So glad you could do that.

447
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:58,455
All right. I think in the interest of time and I hear good, good conversations going on.

448
00:42:58,456 --> 00:43:02,596
But let's let's come back together. Yeah.

449
00:43:03,096 --> 00:43:08,506
Maybe we can approach this a little bit systematically. So let's maybe let's start with the workers.

450
00:43:08,926 --> 00:43:13,365
So as is often the case, these are the folks that are creating the noise in the first place.

451
00:43:13,366 --> 00:43:17,776
So what kind of ideas do you have for how they can reduce their or others exposure?

452
00:43:18,286 --> 00:43:22,756
Well, first, I think they can modify the equipment so that you can be quieter.

453
00:43:22,936 --> 00:43:29,276
Okay. Either through the put itself or through the feed the pressure on.

454
00:43:30,256 --> 00:43:38,896
Second thing I notice about well is that by working for people that they are too close to the source of the noise of a larger zoning area.

455
00:43:39,436 --> 00:43:43,486
They allow for less exposure for the people outside of the construction area.

456
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:52,006
I it doesn't seem like there were any very professionally trained up with some sort of PPE.

457
00:43:52,516 --> 00:43:56,026
Yeah, hard to tell. I think they actually do both have earplugs in.

458
00:43:56,026 --> 00:43:59,476
But I agree with you. This is one of the problems with PPE, especially earplugs.

459
00:43:59,706 --> 00:44:04,906
It can be really hard to see if people are wearing them or not. So let me pause you right there.

460
00:44:04,906 --> 00:44:12,555
So I've heard modify the source. I'll tell you, this is a traditional pneumatic powered jackhammer.

461
00:44:12,556 --> 00:44:18,676
There are quieter electrical versions available. We can run it at a lower speed that's generally going to quieted down.

462
00:44:19,486 --> 00:44:21,916
So for the workers that and the PPE, definitely good.

463
00:44:21,946 --> 00:44:26,536
You also talked about increasing the distance so the pedestrians aren't like six inches from the jackhammer.

464
00:44:26,536 --> 00:44:30,826
That's a great idea to protect the pedestrians. What other ideas to folks have?

465
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:37,476
Yeah, maybe the employee who's not operating the jackhammer doesn't need to stand right there overhead.

466
00:44:37,576 --> 00:44:40,965
Right. He's like taking this break on the jackhammer while it's working. Yeah.

467
00:44:40,966 --> 00:44:43,695
So just getting a bit away from the noise.

468
00:44:43,696 --> 00:44:49,426
I mean, I can tell you this person's job is typically to sweep away the debris that the jackhammer chips up.

469
00:44:49,426 --> 00:44:53,325
But you don't need to stand there 100% of the time. So get a little bit of distance.

470
00:44:53,326 --> 00:44:59,926
Take a little bit of a break from the sound. Good. Yeah. Also, guys like switching out workers, so that links those with first home run time.

471
00:45:00,136 --> 00:45:05,146
Absolutely. So in this case, you know, the two workers here, we could think about swapping them.

472
00:45:05,146 --> 00:45:10,066
So one is running the jackhammer, one sweeping up. They're both going to get a huge amount of sound that way.

473
00:45:10,336 --> 00:45:15,945
But if we have two other workers that are off, you know, sweeping or something, not in a noisy area,

474
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:20,146
who could come in and give these guys a break or trade out for part of the day.

475
00:45:20,146 --> 00:45:24,736
We can rotate them and everybody gets some exposure, but nobody gets too much.

476
00:45:24,736 --> 00:45:28,516
Absolutely. So that's a great administrative control. Yeah.

477
00:45:28,746 --> 00:45:32,205
You just feel like a mechanical engineer. And here's perspective.

478
00:45:32,206 --> 00:45:40,576
Jackhammers are really like fun in the sense of you can't really dampen them because then they overcome as efficient.

479
00:45:40,876 --> 00:45:46,846
So it's a fun tradeoff with like, yeah, you can reduce the speed, but concrete effort needs a certain frequency to work on crack,

480
00:45:47,896 --> 00:45:51,586
so like material cracking and all those kind of things that would play into it.

481
00:45:51,586 --> 00:45:56,466
So it's like, do you want to do a lower speed for longer or do a high speed operator?

482
00:45:57,376 --> 00:46:02,086
Yeah, great point. And I will say for a conventional pneumatic jackhammer like this,

483
00:46:02,086 --> 00:46:08,356
a lot of the sound comes not from the bit striking the concrete, but rather from the pneumatic air that's getting ejected.

484
00:46:08,806 --> 00:46:16,756
And so the thing the electric jackhammer does is it doesn't do anything for the bit hitting the concrete, but it eliminates that discharge of air.

485
00:46:17,056 --> 00:46:20,865
And so we can cut down sound with a different device that way.

486
00:46:20,866 --> 00:46:24,376
But you're absolutely right. I mean, we want to make sure these people can do their job.

487
00:46:24,376 --> 00:46:27,705
At the end of the day, we don't want it to take, you know, 10 hours.

488
00:46:27,706 --> 00:46:31,156
If it could be done in 15 minutes with a different piece of equipment.

489
00:46:31,156 --> 00:46:40,186
There's other trade offs there, too. And I just rust and I feel like barriers like, yeah, you mentioned barriers like, you know,

490
00:46:40,186 --> 00:46:45,446
like something a bit more forward type of barriers instead of the ones that black holes everywhere.

491
00:46:45,946 --> 00:46:52,606
Sure. You know, so a lot of construction sites that are done in dense residential areas will erects noise walls around the whole site.

492
00:46:52,996 --> 00:46:59,416
And so it doesn't do anything for the workers. In fact, it could make their exposure worse because now we're trapping the sound in there with them.

493
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:05,796
But it can cut these people down from a a tremendous exposure to an acceptable exposure on the far side of the wall.

494
00:47:05,806 --> 00:47:08,356
Again, the same concept as the freeway noise wall.

495
00:47:09,586 --> 00:47:20,055
Any other ideas get less of an idea for more questions like in this case, think I'm I do not know how much a high decibels can be,

496
00:47:20,056 --> 00:47:24,676
but I would assume they're are into some sort of noise conservation program.

497
00:47:25,846 --> 00:47:29,565
We could certainly put the workers in a hearing conservation program and track their

498
00:47:29,566 --> 00:47:32,746
hearing and make sure that they're trained on how to use those hearing protectors.

499
00:47:32,746 --> 00:47:34,486
That would be a good idea as well.

500
00:47:35,206 --> 00:47:40,816
You know, we might also just shut this street down altogether so the pedestrians are nowhere close to the construction.

501
00:47:41,026 --> 00:47:45,885
That also cuts down on the risk of a flying piece of concrete hitting a pedestrian in the face or something,

502
00:47:45,886 --> 00:47:50,535
which is, you know, a not a zero risk to and then nobody mentioned.

503
00:47:50,536 --> 00:47:54,586
But you can see the young kid here just plugging their ears.

504
00:47:54,586 --> 00:47:56,836
That can be a very effective solution.

505
00:47:56,836 --> 00:48:01,686
You can actually get a lot of attenuation, but it's hard to really do anything else while your your answer in your ear.

506
00:48:01,706 --> 00:48:06,076
So just a temporary fix. So, I mean, this is not an uncommon situation.

507
00:48:06,076 --> 00:48:08,955
You have all come up with a number of different innovative solutions here,

508
00:48:08,956 --> 00:48:17,266
and this should start to give you some confidence that actually there are things we can do to to fix workplace noise and its impacts on the community,

509
00:48:17,266 --> 00:48:21,166
too. So we'll take just a couple more minutes and then we can jump in to our break.

510
00:48:21,696 --> 00:48:26,316
I want to just highlight, though, what can happen when we have sound propagating through an environment.

511
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:29,356
So let's say we've got a sound source like we've been talking about.

512
00:48:29,956 --> 00:48:34,516
You know, that sound can just continue to propagate through the environment if it never hits a surface.

513
00:48:35,296 --> 00:48:40,875
But when it hits a surface, a wall, a barrier, something, there's a number of different things that can happen.

514
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:44,476
So one is that some of that sound can be absorbed.

515
00:48:44,476 --> 00:48:47,566
And that's what's happening with. Acoustic tiles right above is here.

516
00:48:47,806 --> 00:48:53,416
So when they when the sound hits that that barrier, the acoustic tile, some of the sound is absorbed there.

517
00:48:54,286 --> 00:48:57,046
Some of the sound is inevitably going to be reflected back.

518
00:48:57,046 --> 00:49:03,376
And that's what can lead to reverberation, no matter what the material is that this barrier is made out of.

519
00:49:03,736 --> 00:49:10,395
Some of the sound is going to be transmitted through. There is no material that can completely block the transmission of sounds.

520
00:49:10,396 --> 00:49:20,625
We have to account for that. And then depending on the frequency, low frequency sound especially has this nasty habit of refracting around barriers.

521
00:49:20,626 --> 00:49:26,986
So higher frequencies will tend to either be blocked or just continue traveling straight and they won't kind of bend around the wall.

522
00:49:26,986 --> 00:49:31,545
But lower frequencies with very long wavelengths will tend to distract around.

523
00:49:31,546 --> 00:49:39,136
And what this means is if you live next to the freeway, next to that sound absorbing wall or sound reflecting wall.

524
00:49:39,736 --> 00:49:47,836
So if your home is right here in the shadow zone, you're probably going to have less exposure than someone who's maybe 100 meters away from the road.

525
00:49:47,956 --> 00:49:54,526
They're going to be noisier even though they're farther away from the road because the the sound that was blocked for you by the barrier,

526
00:49:54,526 --> 00:49:59,355
essentially creating this noise shadow is going to distract around and make it to your home.

527
00:49:59,356 --> 00:50:06,945
So so it's a little perverse to think about homes that are farther away from the freeway being noisier, but it's not an uncommon circumstance.

528
00:50:06,946 --> 00:50:12,706
All right. So you mentioned the lower frequencies because it's possible to go through this diffracted

529
00:50:13,096 --> 00:50:19,096
pathway and higher frequencies get transmitted absorptive properties or whatever are reflected.

530
00:50:19,096 --> 00:50:26,715
So what areas? The other parameters that would define whether a sound that's a matter that gets absorbed reflected

531
00:50:26,716 --> 00:50:32,476
like is it able to experience like light at a mirror or like what's one of the factors at play here?

532
00:50:32,776 --> 00:50:33,225
Yeah.

533
00:50:33,226 --> 00:50:41,865
So you're actually you're absolutely right for light we think about specular reflections and we'll actually talk about those in a subsequent lecture.

534
00:50:41,866 --> 00:50:47,476
When we talk about electromagnetic energy for sound, the angle is not so critical.

535
00:50:47,476 --> 00:50:53,086
I would say the frequency of the sound and the material that it's striking are kind of the two big parameters.

536
00:50:53,086 --> 00:50:56,926
So we can mess with the material and make something that's either more absorptive

537
00:50:56,926 --> 00:51:01,996
if we don't want the sound to to reflect back or like in the case of a freeway,

538
00:51:02,326 --> 00:51:07,456
if we really don't care if it reflects back to the cars on the road, then we might make something that's more reflective.

539
00:51:08,686 --> 00:51:13,305
There's a lot of other things that we are often concerned about, like, do I have to clean this material?

540
00:51:13,306 --> 00:51:20,236
Am I worried about it getting dirty? But it's really typically the material used for the barrier and the frequency of sound that's hitting it.

541
00:51:20,776 --> 00:51:30,085
Good question. So when we think about putting in some kind of barrier wall, whatever we are very interested in,

542
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:33,986
well, how can I quantify how well that barrier is actually blocking sound?

543
00:51:34,046 --> 00:51:39,056
So there's two ways we can do this. One is called the insertion loss, and one is called noise reduction.

544
00:51:39,626 --> 00:51:42,986
And so I'm going to use this little prop a little bit later.

545
00:51:42,986 --> 00:51:46,196
But let's let's just pretend that this is a wall that I'm erecting.

546
00:51:46,226 --> 00:51:50,696
Let's see. I've got a freeway over here and some homes here, and I want to put a wall up.

547
00:51:50,996 --> 00:51:57,356
Well, one of the things I could do is say, what is the sound level at this home before I erect a wall?

548
00:51:57,956 --> 00:52:02,636
Then I can put the wallop. Then I could see what's the sound level after the wall has been put into place.

549
00:52:02,636 --> 00:52:05,636
And what I'm describing there is something called an insertion loss.

550
00:52:06,236 --> 00:52:12,446
So we're making a measurement at the same point in space, but in two different points in time one before and one after.

551
00:52:12,986 --> 00:52:15,396
So that's fine if you're developing a new control.

552
00:52:15,416 --> 00:52:21,206
Sometimes, though, we're interested in what's the effectiveness of a control or a wall, a barrier that's already in place.

553
00:52:21,566 --> 00:52:26,126
And in that case, I don't have the option of a before and after, because the control exists already.

554
00:52:26,516 --> 00:52:34,196
In that case, I would make a measurement on one side of the barrier and then make a measurement on the other side, ideally at the same time.

555
00:52:34,736 --> 00:52:38,996
So now I've got two different points in space at the same point in time.

556
00:52:39,206 --> 00:52:42,416
And the difference between those is what's called the noise reduction.

557
00:52:43,046 --> 00:52:51,206
So both of these are concepts or basically the idea is let's figure out how much sound in decibels is being blocked,

558
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:56,096
either with the introduction of this control or by a control that's already in place.

559
00:52:56,426 --> 00:53:01,346
So that noise reduction is under the assumption of a single source on one side of the wall.

560
00:53:01,586 --> 00:53:06,826
It is as if you have a dog barking at the other that's attenuated, you know, that's amplifying.

561
00:53:06,856 --> 00:53:10,316
And if think about it. Yeah. So I mean,

562
00:53:11,276 --> 00:53:15,445
ideally we want this to be sort of controlled experimental conditions where we only have the

563
00:53:15,446 --> 00:53:20,906
source going and there's nothing happening on the leeward side or the protected side of the wall.

564
00:53:21,326 --> 00:53:26,486
You know, there are ways to do that to some extent, especially if it's in a workplace, in a community.

565
00:53:26,516 --> 00:53:29,756
You can't just close the freeway because you want to get a background noise level.

566
00:53:29,786 --> 00:53:35,216
There are ways to to kind of estimate that, though. But you're right, we want the conditions to be as controlled as possible.

567
00:53:35,216 --> 00:53:38,666
And if there's a dog barking on on the side that we think is protected, well,

568
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:42,806
we want to shut that dog up at least long enough to make our measurement and probably longer than that.

569
00:53:44,756 --> 00:53:49,375
All right. Let's think for a minute here about some common ways that noise just gets generated.

570
00:53:49,376 --> 00:53:54,356
I would say these apply both to communities and workplaces, but we think about them more in workplaces.

571
00:53:54,356 --> 00:54:00,776
So, you know, anytime we've got mechanical impacts, any time we've got high velocity air movement,

572
00:54:00,776 --> 00:54:07,946
whether it's pneumatic air being discharged from a jackhammer or like a compressed air hose being used to spray off the surface.

573
00:54:08,426 --> 00:54:14,305
Any time we have high velocity fluid flow, anytime we have any vibrating surfaces,

574
00:54:14,306 --> 00:54:19,556
those vibrating surfaces essentially act as speakers and their own independent noise source.

575
00:54:20,036 --> 00:54:25,406
And in sometimes in workplaces specifically, we have the product that's being manufactured, vibrating.

576
00:54:25,406 --> 00:54:31,526
And the worst example I've ever seen of this is a canning plant where they were putting a product into

577
00:54:31,526 --> 00:54:36,866
glass bottles and the bottles were all rattling against each other and just creating this horrible din.

578
00:54:38,366 --> 00:54:41,666
So we'll just do this one more slide and then I'll give you your break here.

579
00:54:42,206 --> 00:54:48,236
One of the challenges and this kind of builds on Oren's comment when we're trying to identify sources is is figuring out,

580
00:54:48,236 --> 00:54:51,746
well, how do I identify in this really noisy area?

581
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:55,586
What is it that's actually causing the problem? Sometimes it's obvious, sometimes not.

582
00:54:56,426 --> 00:55:02,966
So in an occupational setting where we've got equipment that's kind of running through its cycle, we can take a measurement over time.

583
00:55:03,206 --> 00:55:09,176
So let me kind of if I can shut off other equipment nearby and focus only on this one piece of equipment,

584
00:55:09,176 --> 00:55:14,815
and I'm going to let it do its thing and on a measure sound the whole time and try to figure out if there's one

585
00:55:14,816 --> 00:55:22,376
point in the operation of that equipment where it's exceptionally noisy now with noise in our logarithmic scale.

586
00:55:22,676 --> 00:55:29,036
If I've got one period that's, you know, ten decibels more than the other periods that this equipment is running,

587
00:55:29,366 --> 00:55:33,746
that one period is going to determine the noise level associated with this equipment.

588
00:55:34,496 --> 00:55:40,016
So I can see how sound changes over time. I could also think about noise frequencies.

589
00:55:40,016 --> 00:55:47,485
And so this is an example where they took a measurement at a worker's workstation and they took third octave band measurements.

590
00:55:47,486 --> 00:55:52,975
So this this band here in blue is a bunch of sound pressure levels across frequencies.

591
00:55:52,976 --> 00:55:56,366
So that's the worker station, that's the exposure we're concerned about.

592
00:55:56,906 --> 00:56:02,305
And then they went sniffing around the factory, looking for a piece of equipment that had that same profile.

593
00:56:02,306 --> 00:56:06,806
And lo and behold, they found this piece of equipment that had something called a crossover pipe.

594
00:56:07,466 --> 00:56:11,306
And when they measured the crossover pipe, it was the exact same frequency spectrum.

595
00:56:11,306 --> 00:56:17,996
So they were able to figure out this is what's driving the exposure at that workstation through a little bit of detective work.

596
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:24,586
All right. Let's go ahead and take our 5 minutes to come back. Ten after and keep talking about noise controls.

597
00:56:24,586 --> 00:56:28,896
And I will say thank you all for the great suggestions in your discussion. I hope that was interesting for you.

598
00:56:28,906 --> 00:56:33,166
It's always great for me to hear what you're thinking. So yeah, please, let's take five here.

599
00:56:36,744 --> 00:56:38,604
We'll jump back into it here.

600
00:56:40,194 --> 00:56:47,274
I already alluded to the hierarchy of controls, but just in case any of you haven't seen this before, which I suspect is unlikely,

601
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:51,833
I just want to reiterate that this is the framework we use when we're evaluating our

602
00:56:51,834 --> 00:56:56,244
options to control any type of environmental hazard where we always eliminate the hazard,

603
00:56:56,724 --> 00:57:01,914
if at all possible. That's the only way we can be 100% sure we solve the problem that can't be eliminated.

604
00:57:01,914 --> 00:57:08,993
We want to substitute in something that's less hazardous, and we may also need to put in engineering controls again,

605
00:57:08,994 --> 00:57:13,524
either isolating people from the exposure or isolating the source from people.

606
00:57:14,094 --> 00:57:19,164
Then we can think about administrative controls changing not the work itself, but the way the work gets done.

607
00:57:19,524 --> 00:57:23,814
And then last and least, we think about personal protective equipment, which can be quite effective,

608
00:57:23,814 --> 00:57:29,964
but essentially shifts the responsibility onto the worker, which is the last thing we want to do from an occupational health perspective.

609
00:57:31,734 --> 00:57:35,003
So elimination and substitution, pretty straightforward. Here again,

610
00:57:35,004 --> 00:57:43,404
we can think about ideally eliminating noisy equipment wherever possible or using the smallest equipment that'll still get the job done in EE.

611
00:57:43,404 --> 00:57:46,074
Kim's comment earlier was very appreciated.

612
00:57:46,074 --> 00:57:54,143
So any time we can think about not using that £90 jackhammer, if a much smaller chipping gun would get the job done almost as fast,

613
00:57:54,144 --> 00:57:59,364
we're going to tend to create less noise if we use the smallest equipment possible.

614
00:57:59,844 --> 00:58:03,354
It's not always the case, but at least worth considering.

615
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:06,954
And it applies to a jackhammer just as much as any other type of equipment.

616
00:58:08,814 --> 00:58:11,574
If elimination and substitution aren't options,

617
00:58:11,784 --> 00:58:17,664
we've got other engineering and control approaches so we can think about changing the path that the noise is traveling on.

618
00:58:18,174 --> 00:58:26,274
We can think about modifying or retrofitting the source in some fashion, maybe enclosing the source, or, as I mentioned previously,

619
00:58:26,274 --> 00:58:31,674
we could just think about increasing the distance between the worker and the source or the community member in the source,

620
00:58:32,034 --> 00:58:38,004
with distance resulting in potentially tremendous and sometimes free reductions in exposure.

621
00:58:39,564 --> 00:58:41,363
So diving into that first one a little bit,

622
00:58:41,364 --> 00:58:46,704
if we're modifying the noise path and typically what we're thinking about is what's called a partial barrier.

623
00:58:47,514 --> 00:58:53,274
Partial seems a little bit weird, but unless your barrier is sort of infinity long times infinity tile,

624
00:58:53,274 --> 00:58:57,894
it's going to be a partial barrier by definition and things we're concerned about here.

625
00:58:57,894 --> 00:59:02,904
So one is transmission. So once I put that barrier in place, how much sound is still getting through?

626
00:59:03,834 --> 00:59:09,384
We're also concerned about absorption. So how much sound energy is that barrier physically absorbing?

627
00:59:10,044 --> 00:59:16,044
And then we can also differentiate between a partial barrier, maybe just a single wall versus a full enclosure.

628
00:59:16,044 --> 00:59:22,734
And I'll I'll show you some examples of that as we go along here for partial barriers.

629
00:59:23,004 --> 00:59:28,524
As I mentioned earlier, as Oren was asking about, we're really concerned here about diffraction.

630
00:59:29,124 --> 00:59:32,394
So low frequency sounds have really long wavelengths.

631
00:59:32,394 --> 00:59:37,464
And when they tend to escape from an enclosure through a crack or a hole of some sort,

632
00:59:37,854 --> 00:59:43,884
they will tend to then start radiating back out and eventually heading in different directions than they were originally.

633
00:59:44,604 --> 00:59:49,824
Whereas high frequency sounds with very short wavelengths really don't have that diffraction capability.

634
00:59:49,824 --> 00:59:54,294
If they get through a hole, they're going to tend to travel in a straight line from their source.

635
00:59:55,194 --> 01:00:01,253
So when we think about barriers here, good barriers tend to be very dense and relatively low limb material.

636
01:00:01,254 --> 01:00:07,974
They're going to provide us with a lot of absorptive capacity, and I've already showed you this slide.

637
01:00:07,974 --> 01:00:14,484
But just to reiterate, anytime we're considering how well a barrier or an enclosure works, we could measure the insertion loss.

638
01:00:14,904 --> 01:00:20,723
So if we're putting the barrier in place and we have kind of the baseline condition right now,

639
01:00:20,724 --> 01:00:27,684
we take a measurement of a location now put the barrier in place and then take a measurement at the same location later in time.

640
01:00:28,044 --> 01:00:34,673
Or if the barrier is already in place, we can make a simultaneous measurement on either side of the barrier and figure out the noise reduction.

641
01:00:34,674 --> 01:00:40,974
Both of those are just our way of estimating how much sound in decibels is this barrier blocking.

642
01:00:42,174 --> 01:00:45,954
So let's think here and actually I'd love to get an assistant if one of you will

643
01:00:46,134 --> 01:00:50,784
come up and run the sound level meter for me while we're doing the experiment here.

644
01:00:51,504 --> 01:00:57,504
Volunteers Hayley Dillon and don't all jump up at once.

645
01:00:58,044 --> 01:01:01,374
You both look like you were shifting in your seats. I'll take that as a good sign.

646
01:01:02,964 --> 01:01:07,904
So I'm going to hand Hayley just a basic sound level meter here. What we're reading out is DDA.

647
01:01:08,004 --> 01:01:10,524
That's what we want. And it's a slow time constant.

648
01:01:10,524 --> 01:01:17,874
You'll see the numbers are fluctuating quite a bit, but hopefully you can kind of zoom in there and get a sense of what the sound level is.

649
01:01:18,534 --> 01:01:24,024
And so I'm just going to crank up these speakers. And source.

650
01:01:25,954 --> 01:01:30,693
And we're going to pretend that you are the worker. So I'll just have you stand at the end of the table there.

651
01:01:30,694 --> 01:01:34,114
And what I'm going to play here is some pink noise.

652
01:01:34,804 --> 01:01:38,674
So this is probably a sound you guys have heard at some point in the past.

653
01:01:43,094 --> 01:01:54,094
And we'll just see how bad is it going? Yeah, I'd say right around 74 decibels.

654
01:01:54,094 --> 01:01:59,164
So this is kind of the uncontrolled situation where we're doing an insertion loss measurement.

655
01:01:59,164 --> 01:02:02,313
I haven't put any controls in yet. It's just a source.

656
01:02:02,314 --> 01:02:05,643
Now, if I flip this around, this is no,

657
01:02:05,644 --> 01:02:11,674
I have put in a barrier here and then play the same sound and we'll see what kind of reduction you get in the sample.

658
01:02:18,424 --> 01:02:21,714
Yeah. So let's say 67 decibels versus 74 before.

659
01:02:21,724 --> 01:02:27,453
So just putting in this stupid little barrier here has cut down Hailey's exposure by about seven decibels,

660
01:02:27,454 --> 01:02:32,224
which again is a huge reduction in the actual sound energy she's being exposed to.

661
01:02:32,764 --> 01:02:37,593
So that would be an example of insertion loss. We could also do a noise reduction measurement,

662
01:02:37,594 --> 01:02:44,794
and so we'll take that as kind of the on the far side of the wall measure and let me have you step around to this side.

663
01:02:45,424 --> 01:02:49,444
So it was 67 here with the barrier app and we'll have you take a measurement here.

664
01:02:54,574 --> 01:02:56,304
We're still around 74.

665
01:02:56,314 --> 01:03:03,124
So this is effectively a noise reduction measurement where she's made a measurement on either side of the barrier and we're looking at a difference.

666
01:03:03,184 --> 01:03:06,333
So thank you so much, Hayley, for your assistance there.

667
01:03:06,334 --> 01:03:11,764
And so, you know, those are just kind of direct applications of how we make these measurements in the field.

668
01:03:12,094 --> 01:03:16,654
Typically in noise control is going to be a little bigger than this and the equipment is going to be way, way noisier.

669
01:03:16,654 --> 01:03:20,224
But you kind of get the idea. It's actually a pretty straightforward operation.

670
01:03:23,734 --> 01:03:30,574
You know, one other point I'll make. So if we're playing noise over the speakers, so this was a very directional source, the more.

671
01:03:31,354 --> 01:03:35,254
But now I've got a sound coming out of the speaker. You know, it's a.

672
01:03:35,464 --> 01:03:41,924
More of a omnipresent source or. Speakers are heading into the center through.

673
01:03:42,514 --> 01:03:48,593
So this area here is probably not quite. It would be blocking sand that's coming straight from the front.

674
01:03:48,594 --> 01:03:53,324
But. So we have to think again about the activity.

675
01:03:53,864 --> 01:03:57,324
We were looking at a very directional source before this one.

676
01:03:57,344 --> 01:04:01,364
Not so much to get that to stop. Yes, success.

677
01:04:02,984 --> 01:04:10,874
As I said, no matter how massive and dense our barrier is, we're always going to have at least a little bit of the sound transmitted through it.

678
01:04:11,354 --> 01:04:14,923
And so we can quantify this with something called the transmission coefficient,

679
01:04:14,924 --> 01:04:20,684
which is basically just let's look at how much sound is incident or how much is hitting the windward side,

680
01:04:20,684 --> 01:04:25,154
if you will, of the barrier versus how much is passing through to the leeward side here.

681
01:04:25,874 --> 01:04:28,843
And so the transmission coefficient would be, for instance,

682
01:04:28,844 --> 01:04:37,753
what's the ratio of the transmitted power to the incident power or the the transmitted intensity to the

683
01:04:37,754 --> 01:04:43,454
incident intensity or the square of the transmitted pressure to the square of the incident pressure.

684
01:04:44,414 --> 01:04:51,714
Now we can take that transmission coefficient and convert it into something called the transmission loss, which is much more useful.

685
01:04:51,734 --> 01:05:00,194
So transmission loss is just the inverse of that transmission coefficient and we multiply that by the the ten times the log of that value.

686
01:05:00,764 --> 01:05:09,104
So here this turns out to be something that lots of manufacturers who make noise control materials put out in their information.

687
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:13,724
So what we're looking at in the graph here are different frequencies from low to high.

688
01:05:13,724 --> 01:05:21,523
And here we're looking at transmission loss where zero means we're not we're transmitting basically all of the energy through.

689
01:05:21,524 --> 01:05:27,734
And the higher this transmission loss, the more energy that we are not transmitting or blocking, basically.

690
01:05:28,244 --> 01:05:32,674
And so you can see for different kinds of materials, we're going to get different sorts of profiles.

691
01:05:32,684 --> 01:05:33,614
So, for instance,

692
01:05:33,614 --> 01:05:41,744
regular old plywood turns out to be reasonably good at blocking sounds in the higher frequencies and not so good at the lower frequencies.

693
01:05:42,134 --> 01:05:46,333
Gypsum board or drywall gets a little bit more kind of middle frequency.

694
01:05:46,334 --> 01:05:54,374
Attenuation and concrete has extremely good attenuation at the high frequencies and still much better attenuation at the lower frequencies.

695
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:59,894
So if you were trying to spec out a noise control and you know, well, how much of a transmission loss do I need?

696
01:06:00,404 --> 01:06:08,654
Again, you could start to look at different materials and ask like, well, let's say I know that I need 20 decibels to at 250 hertz frequency.

697
01:06:08,654 --> 01:06:13,933
You know how much led what I need in my barrier to block that match or how much steel, for instance.

698
01:06:13,934 --> 01:06:17,774
So this is maybe not something that you'll do as an environmental health professional,

699
01:06:17,774 --> 01:06:22,364
but if you hire a noise control consultant, this is absolutely the kind of stuff they're going to consider.

700
01:06:23,894 --> 01:06:31,184
The other thing we need to think about transmission, loss or any type of barrier is openings in a barrier are a huge problem.

701
01:06:31,194 --> 01:06:40,334
So what we're looking at on the x axis here is the potential transmission loss from zero all the way up to a high of 60 decibels.

702
01:06:41,024 --> 01:06:45,794
And then on the Y axis, we're looking at the achieved or actual attenuation.

703
01:06:46,244 --> 01:06:51,133
And these different curves represent different percents of the barrier that are openings,

704
01:06:51,134 --> 01:06:56,804
openings meaning cracks or sort of space for hinges, any place where the sound can escape.

705
01:06:57,584 --> 01:07:07,904
So if we have 0% of our barrier as openings, then for a nominal 60 decibels transmission loss, we should be getting 60 decibels of transmission loss.

706
01:07:07,904 --> 01:07:14,893
There's no sound escaping, but you can see just at the lowest point 1% of that barrier being not solid,

707
01:07:14,894 --> 01:07:24,463
but rather an opening that sound can get through. Now we go from a 60 decibels nominal value to maybe more like 30 decibels of actual attenuation

708
01:07:24,464 --> 01:07:28,694
because we can't make up for the sound that's escaping through the cracks in this barrier.

709
01:07:29,294 --> 01:07:36,104
And you can see by the time we get up to maybe five or 10% of this barrier being cracks or otherwise openings,

710
01:07:36,644 --> 01:07:41,744
we go from a nominal 60 maybe down to an actual of ten decibels of attenuation.

711
01:07:42,104 --> 01:07:48,614
And if we were to go to and this is just ridiculous to a barrier that was 50% openings, that's basically a screen door.

712
01:07:49,094 --> 01:07:51,704
You know, the amount of attenuation you get is trivial.

713
01:07:52,454 --> 01:07:58,454
So any barrier we have, again, we want to minimize any cracks or other openings that the sound can escape through.

714
01:08:00,214 --> 01:08:03,853
Now, absorption is another option that we have available to us here.

715
01:08:03,854 --> 01:08:08,474
So absorptive materials, we typically want to be soft and thick and porous.

716
01:08:08,474 --> 01:08:10,934
Fiberglass is kind of a great example here.

717
01:08:11,834 --> 01:08:17,924
A lot of times absorptive materials are either good at absorbing low frequencies or high frequencies, but not usually both.

718
01:08:18,284 --> 01:08:21,944
So again, we need to figure out, well, what are the frequencies that are creating my problem?

719
01:08:22,244 --> 01:08:30,763
Those are the frequencies I want to match my controls. And we can compute here something called an absorption coefficient which ranges from 0 to 1.

720
01:08:30,764 --> 01:08:37,094
And again, this is just the ratio of how much energy is being imparted into this versus how much is being absorbed.

721
01:08:38,714 --> 01:08:42,464
And so fiberglass, as I mentioned, is a great example of the absorption material,

722
01:08:42,464 --> 01:08:46,994
something you can put in your walls to ideally cut down on you, hearing your neighbors through them.

723
01:08:47,564 --> 01:08:52,274
So, as I said earlier, materials. Tend to be good either in high frequencies or low frequencies.

724
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:57,394
If we were to blow in, for instance, a half an inch of fiberglass into a wall,

725
01:08:57,934 --> 01:09:03,544
we would start to get pretty darn good absorption at high frequencies, but we get almost none at the low frequencies.

726
01:09:03,994 --> 01:09:09,453
But like most materials, the more of this fiberglass we add, the better attenuation we get.

727
01:09:09,454 --> 01:09:14,524
So a half an inch of fiberglass is really not doing anything for me at the low frequencies.

728
01:09:15,034 --> 01:09:20,164
But if I increase that to five inches of fiberglass now killing it at these middle and

729
01:09:20,164 --> 01:09:24,304
high frequencies and I'm still doing a much better job down at the low frequencies.

730
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:30,423
So, Orrin, maybe I'll amend my comment earlier to it's the material, it's the frequencies instead.

731
01:09:30,424 --> 01:09:34,954
And it's also how much of that material is present with more generally being better.

732
01:09:36,794 --> 01:09:43,574
Now I mentioned enclosures and we'll will simulate an enclosure here in a moment with our little faux setup.

733
01:09:43,994 --> 01:09:46,924
You know, we can think about enclosing the equipment or enclosing the worker.

734
01:09:46,944 --> 01:09:52,784
So if I've got 100 workers all gathered around one piece of equipment, I'd probably want to close the equipment.

735
01:09:52,784 --> 01:09:58,843
Right. But if I've got 100 pieces of equipment in one worker, which is also not an uncommon situation in that case,

736
01:09:58,844 --> 01:10:02,774
it's probably make sense just to enclose the worker and let the machinery run.

737
01:10:03,164 --> 01:10:07,794
Either way, enclosures can be extremely effective, but there's a few things we have to keep in mind.

738
01:10:07,814 --> 01:10:14,443
So, number one, any time I put an enclosure around something, I'm making it harder to get in and deal with that equipment.

739
01:10:14,444 --> 01:10:18,674
I may not be able to see it any more. I'm going to have to open the enclosure if I have to get in there.

740
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:22,394
And as an industrial hygienist who's worked with lots of companies,

741
01:10:22,394 --> 01:10:28,034
I can tell you companies that put in enclosures without talking to the workers to design those enclosures

742
01:10:28,304 --> 01:10:32,564
often find that their enclosure gets destroyed within the first couple of days because the workers are like,

743
01:10:32,564 --> 01:10:36,824
I can't do my job. You designed this enclosure and I literally can't access my equipment anymore.

744
01:10:36,824 --> 01:10:40,454
So I broke it accidentally so I can do my job.

745
01:10:40,964 --> 01:10:46,064
So we always have to keep in mind that we're cutting off access to the equipment at least a little bit.

746
01:10:46,754 --> 01:10:52,333
Any time we have an enclosure around hot moving equipment, we have now generated a fire risk.

747
01:10:52,334 --> 01:10:59,324
And this does happen that these create fires, especially if you've got equipment that might be spraying off an oil mist or some other

748
01:10:59,324 --> 01:11:04,723
flammable or combustible material that's now building up on the inside of that barrier.

749
01:11:04,724 --> 01:11:07,754
So we have to think very much about fire safety here.

750
01:11:08,444 --> 01:11:12,614
You know, any type of enclosure is going to be damaged over time, just through wear and tear.

751
01:11:12,614 --> 01:11:16,694
People running into it with a forklift opening and closing it to get in and fix it.

752
01:11:17,024 --> 01:11:21,254
And the more openings and cracks we have, the less effective that enclosure is going to be.

753
01:11:22,724 --> 01:11:28,484
So let's do another experiment and maybe I'll get someone else to come up here and run the sound a little better this time.

754
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:32,434
If I've got a volunteer. Anybody ever?

755
01:11:32,624 --> 01:11:45,224
Please. Thank you. So what we're going to do this time is we can see this is just an equipment case that's got a little bit of fun you had in it.

756
01:11:45,224 --> 01:11:55,664
So I'm going to take the front pad in and we are going to see what the insertion loss is from just closing the door on that saw.

757
01:11:55,664 --> 01:11:59,684
I'll have you check kind of our baseline measurement here where the source going is.

758
01:12:10,304 --> 01:12:17,504
Okay. So we'll say right around 71 decibels. And all I'm going to do here is just close the door or the lid of this container.

759
01:12:17,514 --> 01:12:26,734
I'm not even going to seal it. I'm just going to close. So it's around like 63 or 62.8.

760
01:12:26,824 --> 01:12:32,793
Okay. So we're getting it about an eight decibels reduction. That, again, is without any padding in there.

761
01:12:32,794 --> 01:12:36,874
So this would be just transmission loss. There's not very much absorption going on.

762
01:12:37,654 --> 01:12:45,454
Now, if I take this equipment out and bear with me for a second and we'll put this back in as it was.

763
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:54,664
It was two speakers. Two speakers? Yes. They're small, but relatively minor, but two is even mightier.

764
01:12:54,904 --> 01:13:02,064
And so we'll just take another kind of default measurement here with the stuff now that.

765
01:13:05,644 --> 01:13:14,494
There are 59. Okay, so now I've got absorptive material and I've got some transmission lines occurring, so I'm just going to sort of hold the.

766
01:13:18,614 --> 01:13:22,284
Surprisingly close, 65, 65. They're now going to see a.

767
01:13:27,584 --> 01:13:31,594
54.5. So we had almost 20 decibels reduction with the ceiling.

768
01:13:31,604 --> 01:13:35,384
All I did was take care of those little cracks that exist inevitably.

769
01:13:36,814 --> 01:13:43,574
And so you can start to see even a little bit of a hole for the sound to travel through compromises your controls.

770
01:13:43,664 --> 01:13:50,683
Thank you so much for your help. Again, kind of a ridiculous little example here, but hopefully you can get the idea that, wow, you know,

771
01:13:50,684 --> 01:13:58,964
if I if I put some absorptive material plus something that's going to reflect the sound that's coming in, I can make a big, big difference.

772
01:13:58,964 --> 01:14:02,804
And if I can actually seal it airtight, it's going to make a tremendous difference.

773
01:14:04,244 --> 01:14:07,873
So other things we can do here, we can think about retrofitting our source.

774
01:14:07,874 --> 01:14:12,104
So anytime we have mechanical impacts, which is very common in industry,

775
01:14:12,494 --> 01:14:19,783
if I can slow those impacts down so they happen over a longer period of time, I'm not going to get the sort of very high level peaks.

776
01:14:19,784 --> 01:14:26,324
It's going to bring that sound level down, lengthening the impact event, reducing the speed the machine operates.

777
01:14:26,324 --> 01:14:29,804
And all of these things are things we can try. They're not all going to be successful.

778
01:14:30,434 --> 01:14:38,624
You know, if I've got a bunch of very turbulent fluid or airflow, that's going to create a lot of unnecessary noise and wasted energy, frankly.

779
01:14:39,344 --> 01:14:44,324
And if I've got vibrating surface areas on my machine that I can modify, that's also going to make things quieter.

780
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:51,254
So here's an example again from that bottling plant or canning plant that I mentioned earlier.

781
01:14:51,764 --> 01:14:59,804
So these folks initially were using compressed air to blow bottles around in cans around to where they need to be.

782
01:15:00,254 --> 01:15:05,174
And so they were getting across all these frequencies, an average of about 104 DBA,

783
01:15:05,774 --> 01:15:11,263
and they switched it to a mechanical device that actually reached out and grabbed the bottle without blowing it around.

784
01:15:11,264 --> 01:15:18,524
And in doing so, they dropped their noise levels by ten decibels just by eliminating this uncontrolled compressed air that they were using originally.

785
01:15:19,424 --> 01:15:26,294
You know, here's another example of noise levels for a piece of machinery that they were running sort of as fast as it would go,

786
01:15:26,294 --> 01:15:35,613
88 rpm, generating 91 decibels of sound when they cut it down to 70 R.P.M., that reduced their sound level by seven decibels.

787
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:40,964
And when they cut it down in half or a little more than half to 40 rpm, that cut off another decibels.

788
01:15:40,964 --> 01:15:46,664
So you can see there may be some kind of sweet spot between machines got to run and it has some basic speed,

789
01:15:46,994 --> 01:15:52,994
but it doesn't have to run at a bajillion RPM, necessarily reducing air pressure, too.

790
01:15:52,994 --> 01:15:59,923
So any of you who have taken, you know, engineering classes, you know, if you've got a closed system, for instance,

791
01:15:59,924 --> 01:16:06,584
a system that's compressing air, the more you compress that air, the more energy it takes to do that compression.

792
01:16:07,454 --> 01:16:15,644
And so this is an example of an air cylinder that was blowing at 100 pieces or PSI gauge compared to seven DPS.

793
01:16:16,124 --> 01:16:24,854
And so just lowering the compression, the amount of compression on this air by 36, cut the sound level down by 12 decibels.

794
01:16:25,724 --> 01:16:32,504
The other thing that's great about this is if you're not burning as much energy to keep the air compressed to a higher level, you're saving money too.

795
01:16:32,534 --> 01:16:38,593
You're not wasting electricity. In addition to creating noise, we can also think about damping.

796
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:45,974
So Jordan gave a great example of damping on musical instruments works for machinery to silencers or suppressors,

797
01:16:45,974 --> 01:16:49,994
as we talked about earlier, active noise, cancellation and relocation.

798
01:16:49,994 --> 01:16:59,143
So let's talk about these. You know, damping is basically just putting something that generally is is dense and limp against a piece

799
01:16:59,144 --> 01:17:04,154
of machinery that otherwise would be vibrating around to essentially control those vibrations.

800
01:17:04,874 --> 01:17:11,714
So this is an example of a device that sharpens these enormous like six foot diameter saw blades.

801
01:17:12,254 --> 01:17:15,974
And so you can imagine if the saw blade is just connected on there with a bolt.

802
01:17:15,974 --> 01:17:20,173
Basically, the blade is vibrating as it's getting sharpened and it's creating a bunch of

803
01:17:20,174 --> 01:17:26,414
unnecessary sound versus if you slap an enormous piece of damping material on there,

804
01:17:26,414 --> 01:17:34,454
maybe a rubber coated steel plate, it stops the solid from vibrating and reduces the noise level quite substantially.

805
01:17:35,774 --> 01:17:40,003
We can also think about equipment that sits on the floor, as most equipment does.

806
01:17:40,004 --> 01:17:45,104
If that equipment is vibrating, that vibration gets transmitted to the floor and now the floor is acting as a speaker.

807
01:17:45,104 --> 01:17:52,514
It's vibrating, too. So if we can isolate the equipment from the floor, there's tons of types of materials we can use for that.

808
01:17:52,874 --> 01:17:57,824
It could be absorptive material like foam rubber or plastic.

809
01:17:57,824 --> 01:18:01,214
It could also be mechanical, like a spring, for instance.

810
01:18:01,754 --> 01:18:05,894
All of those things are going to reduce especially low frequency sound.

811
01:18:07,454 --> 01:18:11,083
We could think about silencers or suppressors. And again,

812
01:18:11,084 --> 01:18:16,154
the idea behind both of these is we're passing a really noisy stream of of air

813
01:18:16,544 --> 01:18:21,254
through a device that's going to dissipate that sound energy as it passes through.

814
01:18:22,394 --> 01:18:25,873
You know, the sort of details of how these things operate are not critical.

815
01:18:25,874 --> 01:18:35,744
But again, understand. And things like mufflers are specifically designed to contain and reduce the sound from especially combustion engines,

816
01:18:35,954 --> 01:18:43,724
and they do a remarkably good job at it. An issue in the workplace is workers will often incorrectly believe, Oh,

817
01:18:43,724 --> 01:18:48,704
the muffler is really like suppressing the power that I could otherwise achieve with this motor.

818
01:18:49,064 --> 01:18:53,144
Like it's cutting down the horsepower so I can't race my forklift around quite as fast,

819
01:18:53,534 --> 01:18:56,664
so they'll take mufflers off thinking that they're getting better performance.

820
01:18:56,684 --> 01:19:00,254
Typically they're not, but they are getting a lot more noise when that happens.

821
01:19:01,874 --> 01:19:05,384
And then we come to Active Noise Control, which we've touched on already a couple of times.

822
01:19:05,384 --> 01:19:13,034
So the basic idea behind an active noise control system is we've got a computer and a couple of microphones and a speaker,

823
01:19:13,544 --> 01:19:19,754
and essentially the computer uses the microphones to figure out what are the sound frequencies in the environment around me.

824
01:19:20,234 --> 01:19:26,293
And then the computer tells the speaker, I want you to create sound that's exactly out of phase with the incoming sound.

825
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:29,384
So if we have and I'll show you here with an animation,

826
01:19:30,164 --> 01:19:35,954
if we have a sound wave that's coming in and we've kind of described sound as a wave since our very first lecture,

827
01:19:36,404 --> 01:19:42,193
and I can figure out how to make a sound wave that I generate essentially cancel out.

828
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:44,444
So when one is at a peak, the other's at a trough.

829
01:19:44,444 --> 01:19:53,684
You can see the overall sound level here drops from a high level down to a much, much lower level as those waves cancel each other out.

830
01:19:54,314 --> 01:19:59,713
Now, it's very easy to imagine doing this for a single frequency in a community, in a workplace.

831
01:19:59,714 --> 01:20:03,404
We're not dealing with a single frequency. We're dealing with broadband noise.

832
01:20:03,404 --> 01:20:07,784
So, you know, the comparison here would be it's a lot easier.

833
01:20:09,914 --> 01:20:16,624
Sorry. It is a lot easier to talk about generating a tone than to actually do it.

834
01:20:16,634 --> 01:20:21,134
So like this is a tonal sound. That's a thousand hertz that we're listening to.

835
01:20:21,964 --> 01:20:28,364
Single frequency. Very easy to cancel as opposed to something like this, which is many.

836
01:20:29,484 --> 01:20:34,284
Computationally it's orders of magnitude more difficult to control broadband sound.

837
01:20:34,974 --> 01:20:39,053
But the idea is we defined some space that we're trying to control the noise in.

838
01:20:39,054 --> 01:20:43,583
That could be the little bubble around the driver's head in the car. It could be a room like this.

839
01:20:43,584 --> 01:20:47,634
It could be the Earcup inside your Bose noise canceling headphones.

840
01:20:48,414 --> 01:20:51,684
We're defining this area, their sound coming in.

841
01:20:51,954 --> 01:20:54,474
We measure that sound with this input microphone.

842
01:20:54,684 --> 01:20:59,784
We've got some fancy electronics in here that tell the loudspeaker, here's the frequencies coming in.

843
01:20:59,784 --> 01:21:06,924
I want you to cancel those. And then there's an error microphone that basically tells the system, Did I did I succeed or did I fail?

844
01:21:06,954 --> 01:21:12,054
In which case I need to give it another try. Maybe there were maybe I didn't quite get the frequencies right.

845
01:21:12,654 --> 01:21:18,083
So active noise control can be truly magical, especially for low frequencies.

846
01:21:18,084 --> 01:21:25,644
So for sounds less than 500 hertz and Velma mentioned sitting on an airplane very low frequency rumble from the engine active noise control can

847
01:21:25,644 --> 01:21:34,103
make it as though that sound doesn't exist inside the tiny little space of your your noise canceling headset or even inside your ear canal.

848
01:21:34,104 --> 01:21:41,424
If you have noise canceling earbuds, it becomes much more problematic for large spaces, like a room like this.

849
01:21:41,964 --> 01:21:47,154
Now, just to mix things up a little bit, I'm going to let I assume this guy is like a physics teacher in Canada.

850
01:21:47,154 --> 01:21:50,723
I don't know. He looks like a physics teacher to me, but at any rate.

851
01:21:50,724 --> 01:21:53,214
Well, we'll listen to what he has to say in this cool demonstration.

852
01:21:53,364 --> 01:22:03,474
What I've done is I've said I'd like to identify the speakers same same distance from the camera and both of them to fire away from them.

853
01:22:03,484 --> 01:22:11,174
But I'm not my primary speaker. They sound a sound coming from just one speaker.

854
01:22:12,224 --> 01:22:17,074
The second speaker in these days, the lower.

855
01:22:22,724 --> 01:22:26,424
NASA says sea ice twice the amount of video.

856
01:22:27,564 --> 01:22:33,594
If I did take. Back on board, half a wavelength apart.

857
01:22:33,834 --> 01:22:38,874
You'll hear the Pearson sound aggressively quieter, quieter and quieter.

858
01:22:38,874 --> 01:22:43,074
Its manual noise control using the frequencies to its base.

859
01:22:43,074 --> 01:22:46,104
And this is because they're out of phase and it's spacing.

860
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:51,354
If I if I take the two microphones, two speakers, and put them at the same distance again.

861
01:22:54,914 --> 01:23:03,883
Things, phasing them in positionally a phase that I simply reversed their ability to lead the

862
01:23:03,884 --> 01:23:09,374
embassy speaker so that one speaker's moving forward with the other speaker is back.

863
01:23:12,784 --> 01:23:18,624
You can hear it here that it becomes much quieter simply because I have been chronicling it.

864
01:23:18,664 --> 01:23:28,834
So what we can do is in order to try to access the sound of sound amplitude, if we can accomplish it spatially or we can accomplish it electronically.

865
01:23:29,434 --> 01:23:33,064
So I actually tried this demonstration a couple of years ago in the classroom,

866
01:23:33,064 --> 01:23:36,513
and it doesn't work nearly as well as it does on YouTube, which is why I play the video.

867
01:23:36,514 --> 01:23:43,054
But you can get the idea here that even just by altering the placement and the distance of the speakers from one another,

868
01:23:43,054 --> 01:23:51,514
you can not quite cancel out completely, but substantially reduce the amount of sound that's being perceived by you as a receiver.

869
01:23:52,294 --> 01:23:57,244
So I'll just reiterate by saying active noise control is super cool, but keep in mind,

870
01:23:57,604 --> 01:24:02,464
anytime you're doing active noise control, you are introducing more noise into the environment.

871
01:24:02,464 --> 01:24:10,623
And so I am colleagues with a gentleman at the University of British Columbia who's been doing active noise control research because the idea is,

872
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:16,804
well, gosh, wouldn't it be cool if you could just let active noise control your factory and all the noise goes away?

873
01:24:17,284 --> 01:24:21,574
And so he's tried this not at a factory level, but at the level of an individual room in a factory.

874
01:24:21,574 --> 01:24:26,943
And inevitably, some spots get quieter and other spots always get louder.

875
01:24:26,944 --> 01:24:30,423
So you're not sort of overall lowering the noise level.

876
01:24:30,424 --> 01:24:33,484
You are lowering it at very specific locations.

877
01:24:33,484 --> 01:24:40,774
And so if you can lower it at the locations where your workers are spending their time or again in the bubble around the driver's head in your car,

878
01:24:41,224 --> 01:24:48,004
that's a success. But if you move around in that space, you're inevitably going to end up in some of these noisier areas, too.

879
01:24:48,574 --> 01:24:53,824
So we're just not quite at the level technologically that we can fix things at a big scale.

880
01:24:53,824 --> 01:24:59,254
But again, for those of you who have tried active noise control headsets or earbuds, they are pretty magical.

881
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:05,974
I'll be the first to admit I mentioned as well that we always have the option to relocate.

882
01:25:05,984 --> 01:25:12,003
So if I can move the source away from my workers or move the workers away from the source again,

883
01:25:12,004 --> 01:25:15,544
at least in a free field, I might get a six decibel reduction every time.

884
01:25:15,544 --> 01:25:23,074
I just double the distance between them and the source so that that can be a very effective and sometimes free solution.

885
01:25:23,074 --> 01:25:27,513
And when you get out to work, you'll realize free is something that managers really appreciate.

886
01:25:27,514 --> 01:25:33,244
So when you're selling them on a fixed so we'll just run through a couple of examples here.

887
01:25:33,244 --> 01:25:37,473
These graphics look pretty dated because they are incredibly dated.

888
01:25:37,474 --> 01:25:42,394
These come from a 1979 book on noise control that was put out by Nash,

889
01:25:43,234 --> 01:25:49,144
still one of the best guides out there in terms of sort of translation to the practical.

890
01:25:49,714 --> 01:25:53,644
So I'll walk you through what we're looking at here, and we're just going to look at a sequence of these things.

891
01:25:53,644 --> 01:25:59,674
On the left here, we're looking at some generic image of a piece of belt driven machinery.

892
01:26:00,364 --> 01:26:05,224
So here's the belt here. Although honestly, this looks like a bighorn sheep to me, so you can tell I'm not an engineer.

893
01:26:06,004 --> 01:26:13,774
But we've got something here that's going to be making noise. And for whatever reason, M is the symbol that Nash chose to represent to work on.

894
01:26:14,074 --> 01:26:16,233
So we've got the machinery and the worker,

895
01:26:16,234 --> 01:26:22,713
and then on the right we've got different octave band measurements that they made at this particular piece of machinery.

896
01:26:22,714 --> 01:26:28,234
So from low frequency to high frequency. And then we're looking at the decibel level on the Y axis here.

897
01:26:29,074 --> 01:26:38,914
So the default here that we're looking at and I'm sorry, the image isn't scaling right here, it's kind of leaking off underneath the text.

898
01:26:39,274 --> 01:26:44,644
But we have almost a flat spectrum here between about 80 and 85 decibels.

899
01:26:44,644 --> 01:26:50,704
So we'll say this is effectively an 85 decibels broadband source that this worker is being exposed to.

900
01:26:51,454 --> 01:26:57,423
So we can start to think about, well, what are the types of controls that we could put into place to help this worker?

901
01:26:57,424 --> 01:27:02,314
And one of the things, as I mentioned, is maybe we put on vibration, isolating feet.

902
01:27:02,314 --> 01:27:09,934
So now the equipment is not vibrating the floor and the floor is not acting as a speaker creating extra noise.

903
01:27:10,594 --> 01:27:17,194
So here's our original, the dash line. Here is the original active band spectrum, again, right around 85 decibels.

904
01:27:17,584 --> 01:27:22,294
And then the dark, solid line here is the post control noise level.

905
01:27:22,294 --> 01:27:29,464
So this is after the anti vibration feet were put on made no difference at all at the higher to the mid frequencies,

906
01:27:29,854 --> 01:27:33,634
but we got about a ten decibel reduction at the low frequency, so that's a start.

907
01:27:33,634 --> 01:27:37,084
We didn't fix the problem, but it's like a step in the right direction.

908
01:27:37,864 --> 01:27:44,194
Well, what else could we do here? So let's say we take off the anti vibration feet and instead thank you.

909
01:27:45,184 --> 01:27:48,814
We put in just an acoustic blanket here. It's not solid.

910
01:27:48,814 --> 01:27:52,814
It's just absorptive material between the source and the worker.

911
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:58,084
What did we do now? Well, again, we've got our original dashed line around 85 decibels.

912
01:27:58,084 --> 01:28:04,284
We really didn't do anything at the super low frequencies, but we got maybe a five decibel reduction at the mid to high frequencies.

913
01:28:04,294 --> 01:28:09,783
Again, that's progress. Okay. What if we didn't just put the baffle on one side?

914
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:16,344
What if we made an enclosure of just. A soft, dense material around the entire piece of machinery.

915
01:28:16,374 --> 01:28:20,634
What happens now? Well, again, really no change in the low frequencies.

916
01:28:20,634 --> 01:28:25,084
But now we're up to maybe a seven to an eight decibel reduction at the mid to high frequency.

917
01:28:25,104 --> 01:28:28,494
So still, that's progress. We're moving in the right direction here.

918
01:28:29,274 --> 01:28:34,734
Okay, let's ditch the acoustic blanket and instead we'll put in a rigid enclosure here,

919
01:28:34,734 --> 01:28:37,794
something that's going to reflect the noise back towards the source.

920
01:28:38,454 --> 01:28:41,454
So again, we've got our original around 85 here.

921
01:28:41,454 --> 01:28:44,003
You can see now we're really starting to make some good progress.

922
01:28:44,004 --> 01:28:47,844
So we've made a little bit of a difference, maybe one or two decibels at the low frequencies,

923
01:28:48,264 --> 01:28:52,284
but we're getting up to like a 20 to 25 decibel reduction at the high frequency.

924
01:28:52,284 --> 01:28:59,544
So this rigid enclosure has made a large leap forward in terms of reducing that worker's exposure.

925
01:29:00,864 --> 01:29:05,724
What if we now start to think about combining these things? So what if we take that rigid enclosure and keep it?

926
01:29:05,724 --> 01:29:09,694
And now we add in the vibration footings which we already saw?

927
01:29:09,774 --> 01:29:11,454
Reduce the low frequency sound.

928
01:29:11,454 --> 01:29:19,404
And lo and behold, now we're getting that ten decibel reduction from the the low frequencies from the anti vibration feet and still getting,

929
01:29:19,404 --> 01:29:22,763
say, 25 to 30 decibels of attenuation at the high frequencies.

930
01:29:22,764 --> 01:29:32,934
That's fantastic. Okay. What if we keep the vibration feet in the rigid enclosure and now we add on an absorptive enclosure inside the region?

931
01:29:32,934 --> 01:29:40,164
Enclosure? Well, now we're getting like a 40 decibel reduction at the high frequencies and still 10 to 15 at the low frequency.

932
01:29:40,174 --> 01:29:45,584
So that's that's huge progress. And then sort of the unrealistic idea.

933
01:29:45,594 --> 01:29:52,104
Well, let's do that. Let's do it twice. Well, I can close the equipment and then we'll build an enclosure around the enclosure.

934
01:29:52,104 --> 01:29:55,914
So now, literally, you couldn't do the job anymore. This thing is totally controlled.

935
01:29:56,424 --> 01:30:03,804
But as you can see, if you can look at the slides directly and again, I'm sorry about the scaling issue here,

936
01:30:04,194 --> 01:30:08,214
but you'll see we have effectively eliminated the noise at the mid to the high

937
01:30:08,214 --> 01:30:11,543
frequencies and we've made like a 20 decibel reduction at the low frequency.

938
01:30:11,544 --> 01:30:19,134
So you might argue that noise would drop to zero because you literally can't do the job with two enclosures here preventing the work from being done.

939
01:30:19,524 --> 01:30:25,524
But we have made it physically sort of achievable here to reduce the noise levels to where this

940
01:30:25,524 --> 01:30:30,384
worker would no longer have a noise problem wouldn't need to be in a hearing conservation program.

941
01:30:30,384 --> 01:30:38,933
We have largely fixed the problem. So this is often the case with noise control is there's not any one kind of silver bullet to fix the problem.

942
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:43,614
And oftentimes we need small combinations of different approaches to get where we need to be.

943
01:30:45,234 --> 01:30:49,734
All right. In our last couple of minutes here, I'll just mention we've been focusing on engineering controls.

944
01:30:50,034 --> 01:30:55,734
We talked about elimination and substitution. Let's move down the hierarchy of controls here to administrative controls.

945
01:30:56,574 --> 01:30:59,003
One thing we could do is establish a high noise zone.

946
01:30:59,004 --> 01:31:07,044
So this is a corrugated packaging facility that students for a class that I taught at the University of Washington did a survey of,

947
01:31:07,044 --> 01:31:12,534
and they essentially mapped out the green zones. Here are areas where no hearing protection is needed.

948
01:31:13,074 --> 01:31:18,053
The orange zones are areas where you need some hearing protection in the red zones or the very noisiest areas

949
01:31:18,054 --> 01:31:22,974
where they are saying you have to have better forms of hearing protection if you're going into the red area.

950
01:31:23,394 --> 01:31:28,884
Now, I love this, especially because they did it in crayon. I'm like, Duke, this is you're in graduate school, you can do better.

951
01:31:29,904 --> 01:31:32,934
But I kid, of course it was it was a good idea.

952
01:31:33,144 --> 01:31:37,343
The company actually took this and they painted the floors and the facility and they're like,

953
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:41,724
if you're on a yellow floor or an orange floor, here's the type of hearing protectors you need.

954
01:31:41,724 --> 01:31:47,394
If you're in green, you don't have to worry about it. And we don't want you going in random unless you absolutely have to.

955
01:31:47,394 --> 01:31:51,264
So they really translated it into something that workers could actually act on.

956
01:31:52,614 --> 01:31:56,753
Another administrative control that's always an option is signs.

957
01:31:56,754 --> 01:32:02,064
So putting up a sign, warning people of a problem, I will say some signs are better than others.

958
01:32:02,064 --> 01:32:06,533
So when I worked at Yudof, we were on the fifth floor of our building.

959
01:32:06,534 --> 01:32:10,583
We had a lovely balcony and I don't know if you can read this sign.

960
01:32:10,584 --> 01:32:16,674
It says, Do not lean on railing lose. So presumably you lean on the railing, you plummet five storeys to your death.

961
01:32:17,184 --> 01:32:20,964
I will point out there were two doors to this balcony and only one of them had a sign.

962
01:32:20,964 --> 01:32:28,734
This is a terrible, terrible signage program from the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, so that's how you don't do it.

963
01:32:29,244 --> 01:32:33,323
On the flip side, I have never actually seen a lightning rod up close in person,

964
01:32:33,324 --> 01:32:36,864
but just based on this sign, I have regular nightmares about lightning rods.

965
01:32:36,924 --> 01:32:43,134
It's like this is a compelling sign that tells me I need to worry about this particular hazard in the environment.

966
01:32:43,134 --> 01:32:50,333
It's not just words, there's an image. And so when you think about picking signs and inevitably many of you will pick signage

967
01:32:50,334 --> 01:32:54,654
for your facilities and think about something that's a little more graphical,

968
01:32:55,104 --> 01:33:01,584
a little more easily understood, especially by people who may not speak English as a primary or maybe not even as a secondary language.

969
01:33:01,944 --> 01:33:09,414
We want to make this as intuitive as possible. Less text is generally better for other administrative controls.

970
01:33:09,414 --> 01:33:15,084
We can think about scheduling the noise, you know, if most of. My people are in the building between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.

971
01:33:15,504 --> 01:33:19,254
Is there some way I could do my noisiest activities before or after that?

972
01:33:19,254 --> 01:33:23,544
So the fewest people are around? Can I limit my exposure duration?

973
01:33:23,544 --> 01:33:33,564
So, you know, if you're the U.S. Navy and you've got people standing on the deck of an aircraft carrier like 15 feet from 150 decibels jet engine.

974
01:33:34,164 --> 01:33:36,794
There's just so much you can do for noise control and then you're done.

975
01:33:36,804 --> 01:33:41,364
So what they say is you can do this job for X hours of time per day, and then you're done for the day.

976
01:33:41,374 --> 01:33:46,524
You have to go below decks and get out of sound. There's just this is our best controllers to limit your time.

977
01:33:47,544 --> 01:33:52,674
We can also think about job rotation. So again, if I've got one noisy job and a couple of quiet jobs,

978
01:33:53,004 --> 01:33:59,414
instead of having the noisy job be done by one worker all day who gets a huge dose of noise and needs to get nothing.

979
01:33:59,914 --> 01:34:04,064
Now I rotate them through so everybody gets some, but nobody gets too much.

980
01:34:04,074 --> 01:34:07,523
That is fine if you have relatively unskilled jobs.

981
01:34:07,524 --> 01:34:11,064
You know, this is not like, okay, all the carpenters are doing plumbing for the day.

982
01:34:11,364 --> 01:34:15,864
You know, we have to account for the fact that not all jobs can rotate, but some of them can.

983
01:34:17,004 --> 01:34:23,064
We want to think about potentially a buy client program where every time we're replacing equipment in our facility,

984
01:34:23,064 --> 01:34:26,334
we actively look and find the quietest replacement available.

985
01:34:26,994 --> 01:34:29,753
So this doesn't fix things right away, but over time,

986
01:34:29,754 --> 01:34:37,344
the levels in the facility will absolutely come down as you get rid of loud old stuff and replace it with new quiet stuff and then just equipment,

987
01:34:37,344 --> 01:34:44,394
maintenance, keeping, keeping our stuff in good repair tends to make it last longer and it's quieter as well.

988
01:34:45,804 --> 01:34:49,283
So unfortunately, we've run out of time for this demonstration.

989
01:34:49,284 --> 01:34:54,164
I was just going to have you all take a quick peek here and go back into your groups and figure out like,

990
01:34:54,174 --> 01:34:57,144
what are some controls that might work for these?

991
01:34:58,164 --> 01:35:05,154
It's a mix of women and men working in a textile factory, some of them with sewing machines, some with other types of equipment.

992
01:35:05,964 --> 01:35:09,474
I can tell you from experience, these textile halls can be quite loud.

993
01:35:09,474 --> 01:35:14,814
So I was going to try to get you thinking about possible controls for noise here.

994
01:35:15,384 --> 01:35:20,994
Maybe I'll take just 30 seconds. Does anybody have any ideas for how we might control noise in this environment?

995
01:35:25,294 --> 01:35:28,714
Entered this famous painting.

996
01:35:29,734 --> 01:35:31,503
So these are textile workers.

997
01:35:31,504 --> 01:35:39,664
It's a giant hall of people, some of whom are working on sewing machines, some of whom are folding in other ways, processing textile materials.

998
01:35:39,664 --> 01:35:43,653
Yet it seems like they have little to no faith.

999
01:35:43,654 --> 01:35:47,583
So probably not because you're going there first.

1000
01:35:47,584 --> 01:35:52,444
But let me advise you, that's not where you should go first. So. So PPE, of course, is always an option.

1001
01:35:52,444 --> 01:35:56,374
But, you know, what could we do here that you're right, they don't have much physical space,

1002
01:35:56,674 --> 01:35:59,914
but could we think about putting in partitions in some fashion?

1003
01:35:59,914 --> 01:36:07,593
So, for instance, if the sewing machines are where much of the sound is coming from, can we isolate the other positions from the sewing machines?

1004
01:36:07,594 --> 01:36:11,224
That doesn't help the sewing machine operator, but it might help everybody else.

1005
01:36:11,704 --> 01:36:14,464
So again, thinking about what engineering controls, you know,

1006
01:36:14,494 --> 01:36:19,294
are these ancient sewing machines that are super loud, maybe we could replace them with quieter ones.

1007
01:36:19,624 --> 01:36:22,863
People can. And in some cases, we'll need to be part of the solution.

1008
01:36:22,864 --> 01:36:26,554
But I guess my key message here is it shouldn't be the first thing we go to with effort.

1009
01:36:26,704 --> 01:36:29,914
There are always other solutions. All right.

1010
01:36:29,914 --> 01:36:34,203
And with that, we're out of time. We're out of slides. That's good news. So the next session, as I said,

1011
01:36:34,204 --> 01:36:37,414
we're going to spend the whole time talking about hearing protection devices and

1012
01:36:37,414 --> 01:36:42,093
you're going to try some on and figure out what you think of the newer cells. So thank you so much, everybody.

1013
01:36:42,094 --> 01:36:46,924
Have a great Halloween. I hope everyone has a fun evening and I'll see you next week.

1014
01:36:47,974 --> 01:36:53,134
Also, as a quick reminder, the noise exposure assessments, as you probably saw in my announcement, are due next Monday.

1015
01:36:53,494 --> 01:36:54,304
So thanks, everybody.
