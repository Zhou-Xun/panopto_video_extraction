1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:09,750
So once the 1991 event was done in Washington, D.C.,

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:17,040
where they added the organizers of that event intended to host about 300 folks from across the country.

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:24,390
But word of mouth desperation cost nearly a thousand people to show up to this four day event.

4
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:37,740
And it was there that we defined a number of things to roll out a movement that would change communities significantly.

5
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,260
I've mentioned Warren County, North Carolina here

6
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:52,200
again, this was the event that really moved the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice to address the issue.

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:01:02,400
Many folks from that organization showed up at Warren County just to show their support,

8
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:12,540
and it would be so important to acknowledge that this key event really did take the

9
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:20,430
issue of environmental justice and put it on a national and international world stage.

10
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,280
I like to tell people that of the five hundred demonstrators that were arrested,

11
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:37,620
many of them were grandfathers, children, moms and dads, folks who really were just done with doing,

12
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,540
just going along with the status quo

13
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:54,000
and people were taken to jail because they were fed up with this idea of being the dumping ground for,

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,460
for all of the most dangerous, nasty issues

15
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:08,970
that were contained in those trucks going to the landfill.

16
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,550
So I mentioned the United Church of Christ,

17
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:19,800
a Commission for Racial Justice study that began to link race and the location of hazardous waste sites.

18
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:30,120
Remember, I mentioned earlier that it was because of Warren County, North Carolina's desperate plea to get support,

19
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:39,780
that the United Church of Christ responded with a study, not just showing up to show their support,

20
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,780
but also to say, let's see if this is happening in other places around the country.

21
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:53,350
Well, it was.  Soon after the release of this particular study, the big thing that came out

22
00:02:53,350 --> 00:03:06,270
of this was the realization that there was a stark difference between communities of color,

23
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:16,770
Black communities and Caucasian communities when it came to deciding where undesirable land uses would take place.

24
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:27,590
In fact, this study revealed that Black communities were more likely to receive the disproportionate number of these facilities,

25
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,270
five hundred times more likely.

26
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:43,620
They were unlikely to receive help from the Environmental Protection Agency when they called in to make complaints about an environmental issue.

27
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:57,100
I remember having a conversation early on in my walk with this work that I had with a former EPA employee who said

28
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:05,150
that the conversations by folks who were supposed to be deployed to communities like Detroit to check out an environment issue,

29
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,330
the comments would be that that was a workplace hazard.

30
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:17,130
Why go to Detroit? Your putting your lives at risk if you respond to an environmental issue in places like Detroit.

31
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:24,900
It was a huge revelation that came from this particular study,

32
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:36,600
and this study when it was released in 1987, was released during a very conservative administration at the federal level.

33
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:51,210
They could not deny at that time the truth of the matter that communities were inundated with these issues, particularly communities of color.

34
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:51,810
And in fact,

35
00:04:51,810 --> 00:05:01,290
one of the responses to that particular report from the federal government at that moment was to create an office of Environmental Equity.

36
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:05,940
Now, you remember I said there's a difference between equity and justice. We needed justice,

37
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:12,210
we needed remedies, communities to receive priority for cleanup and redress.

38
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:25,260
And so this really helped to put that issue in front of policymakers and decision makers. Ultimately, during the Clinton administration in 1994,

39
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:38,730
there was a response by them to create the executive order 12894, which really required that every federal agency,

40
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:46,470
and it continues today, every federal agency must have an environmental justice policy and strategy for redress.

41
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,310
You may recall, I mentioned that I met some people out of Chicago,

42
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:59,220
particularly out of Argyle Gardens, where that was a public housing community when Hazel Johnson,

43
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:09,990
who ran People for Community Recovery at the time, learned that her husband was dying from a very unusual cancer.

44
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,180
She,

45
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:25,110
she did research and learned that, that housing project was built deliberately, and intentionally on top of industrial waste, on top of a landfill.

46
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,860
What this report really revealed was that there was very little interaction

47
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:38,970
between HUD and the Environmental Protection Agency. So as HUD is deciding where to place

48
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:43,290
public housing around the country,

49
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,300
they never had conversations,

50
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:54,450
they rarely had conversations with the Environment Protection Agency about whether or not it was safe to place housing on a particular area.

51
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:59,130
The work of the environmental justice movement helped to push that dynamic.

52
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:07,350
Now there are interagency's offices that are required to have conversations among themselves.

53
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,220
So Department of Transportation, HUD, EPA,

54
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,260
Department of Energy,

55
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:22,470
Department of Agriculture and other departments within the federal government begin to talk to each other in a way that they had never done before,

56
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:30,710
and that is a direct result of the outcome of the environmental justice movement.

57
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:39,860
There were some other things that were determined back then as well that needed some addressing,

58
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:46,430
and one had to do with the availability of research and information that would help folks

59
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:53,810
better understand what it meant to be disproportionately exposed to environmental problems.

60
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,010
So folks like Dr. Robert Bullard, Dr. Beverly Wright,

61
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:07,400
Dr. Paul Mohai and other academicians that really came from that core group out of Michigan I spoke about in the early 80s,

62
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:23,840
they really took it upon themselves to ensure that research around environmental justice was embraced throughout the academic community

63
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:34,970
in a way that would provide the kind of evidence that one would need to make their case around these kinds of exposures and issues.

64
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:47,120
Because oftentimes, as I've experienced over the years, when you're trying to make a case for improving air quality or whatever,

65
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,590
decision makers are often telling, asking for evidence, well where'd you get this information from?

66
00:08:53,590 --> 00:09:01,340
And the more that we are able to support and invest in research and stuff that help us make the case, the better.

67
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:13,700
Dr. Bullard has written a number of books on the various topics, and he's well-known for this one called Dumping in Dixie.

68
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,440
Policy, it took a long time. Policy takes a long time.

69
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:24,850
This was the actual eventual cleanup of the site that people laid down and

70
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:30,800
we're willing to go to jail for, in the early 1980s.

71
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,690
And now it took a couple of decades for that site to be cleaned up,

72
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:50,400
2003 when it actually got cleaned up. North Carolina spent 18 million dollars to detoxify this contaminated property,

73
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,150
and unfortunately Warren County still does not have a hospital.

74
00:09:55,150 --> 00:10:02,740
This is the kind of issues that communities like Warren County experience across this country,

75
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:13,630
and it's just not okay. It's no longer okay for this to be the way that people have to experience their lives.

76
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:21,700
You may even be thinking, well, why don't people move? Well, we have to understand discriminatory housing policies,

77
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:33,760
we have to understand employment opportunities, we have to understand all those things that kind of comes together as a perfect storm when it

78
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:42,460
comes to racism and how that has a negative impact on the outcome of people's lives,

79
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:56,800
right to the very decision of can they move? You have communities that are primarily Caucasian that have a long sort of process to ensure that Black

80
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:04,520
folks and some other people of color don't get to to live in their communities, out of harm's way.

81
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:14,620
This is a huge issue that has to be challenged. So the environmental justice really is about speaking for ourselves.

82
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:23,860
What came out of the environmental justice movement or that particular event was the 17 principles of environmental justice,

83
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:31,870
and it is the piece of information that continues to guide many of our work.

84
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:38,120
This is important because a number of people that have jumped on the bandwagon of environmental justice,

85
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:45,080
that don't even understand what the foundation of this movement is about.

86
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,140
And the one way that you get to understand what the foundation of this movement is about

87
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:56,140
is to take advantage of the 17, and read the 17 principles of environmental justice.

88
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:01,180
And one of the major key elements to this is that we speak for ourselves,

89
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:07,720
we being those people were inundated with these issues who were disproportionately impacted,

90
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,760
the disparate impact I spoke about, we speak for ourselves,

91
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,440
we don't need someone else to speak for us.

92
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:24,040
We just need access to decision makers, and others that will help us make the difference,

93
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:33,880
but we don't need people to go in without us and decide for us what those priorities are.

94
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,820
And that crosses all kinds of issues, including climate,

95
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:47,770
there's a climate justice movement, including housing, health and other things.

96
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:57,520
When environmental justice and environmental health is factored into policy decisions, what have you,

97
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:06,460
this will result in a better quality of life for all of us, not just the people disproportionately impacted.

98
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:13,210
But that's where we start, that's where the justice start. That's where we need to begin this process,

99
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:24,790
ensuring that communities that have long held the burden and responsibility for addressing environmental legacies,

100
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:33,220
improper use of land, air quality and all that kind of stuff, that has to be more than

101
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:44,290
just an acknowledgment, there has to be a dedicated commitment to acknowledging that these kinds of consequences

102
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:54,070
occur on a daily basis and a commitment to changing this, so that everyone has the right to breathe clean air,

103
00:13:54,070 --> 00:14:07,900
drink safe and healthy water. No more Flint, Michigan's. For children to be able to go into school buildings and not have asthma triggers occur.

104
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:15,140
This is really key. And this is a good place to stop, so I could bring up the other...

105
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,990
So this was very key in many of the folks I talked about,

106
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:35,990
Dr. Robert Bullard, Dr. Beverly Wright and others got to observe President Bill Clinton signing the executive order, 12898.

107
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:42,230
This was after 50 years and more than half dozen studies by several federal agencies.

108
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:47,420
This executive order actually was created and it was the federal action to address

109
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:53,500
environmental justice and minority populations and low income populations.

110
00:14:53,500 --> 00:15:03,470
There's still a lot to be done. We're very happy that there's a new administration in the Biden-Harris administration.

111
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:12,230
We have a lot of hope that they will pick up the charge and continue to fulfill what this executive

112
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:19,490
order, and all the work that the environmental justice efforts have undertaken, is accomplished.

113
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:29,510
It is so inspiring to know that this administration is serious about that,

114
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:37,340
and one example that they just appointed someone to the White House Council for Environmental

115
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:44,210
Quality who has been doing environmental justice work at the grassroots level for a long time,

116
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:54,920
Cecilia Martinez, we're very proud of her. She's inside where she's able to help navigate the various agencies to ensure that there

117
00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:00,940
is equal protection under the law for everyone when it comes to environmental protection.

118
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:12,500
And thank you for your attention. I would invite you to ask any questions, or comments, or responses

119
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:23,120
to help you better understand what was discussed. And I look forward to you joining us in ensuring that justice is achieved.

120
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,160
Thank you.
