1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,120
Okay. I think that we're ready to go here.

2
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,450
So first couple days of class students come and go and it's settled.

3
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:24,880
The dust settles. We have students who are interested and committed, so that's kind of what we're going for.

4
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:34,030
I get anywhere from 7 to 15 and depending on what year it is, so it varies.

5
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:42,910
So some of you have had a lot more coursework or knowledge about the immune system or innate immunity,

6
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,660
which we're going to be talking about today and today. I'm just going to walk you through it.

7
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,340
Some of you will remember this stuff and some of you will. It'll all be new to you.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,600
So the purpose of this is to just kind of establish a foundation in terms of your.

9
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,820
In terms of, you know, what you really need to know in the quizzes, you know,

10
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:13,350
I'll just give you a heads up two weeks ahead of time about a quiz is what I put into the learning objectives.

11
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,730
So you want to be able to, after you've viewed this lecture, to describe acute,

12
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:27,770
chronic and systemic inflammation, then I'll have some examples for for each of these.

13
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:34,580
And then just to understand the basic functions of the innate immune system or innate immune response,

14
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:40,129
we'll talk I'll talk a little bit about barrier function and you'll see why that's

15
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,690
important and how vitamin aid plays a critical role in that particular function.

16
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:56,780
We discussed the paper on Thursday. Then we're going to talk about what happens when you have an inflammatory response, what players are involved,

17
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:06,110
cellular recruitment, cytokines, lipid mediators, that sort of thing, and what is the innate immune response to that?

18
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:16,850
And then you will recruit cells in the cells, perform various functions, and they elaborate pro and anti inflammatory cytokines and lipid mediators.

19
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,350
And we're going to sort through all of that, this basic information today.

20
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:27,930
Okay. So first of all, what's the purpose of the immune system?

21
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:32,930
Well, number one, it's to perfect to protect you against infection.

22
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:41,090
You are in an environment where there's constant exposure to bacteria, fungi, viruses,

23
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:49,700
and you need to defend yourself against these from establishing colonization of your tissues.

24
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:56,840
So that would be in your skin, in your gut, in your respiratory tract, anything that is exposed to the environment.

25
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,089
Then there is tissue remodeling and repair.

26
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:07,129
You're always growing, you're responding to different immune challenges.

27
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:20,780
And this kind of shapes that the tissue structure itself within the surface of your skin and other other areas, the GI tract, the respiratory tract.

28
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,370
You're responding to different stimuli and this can change the structure.

29
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:38,870
And the immune system also plays a role in restructuring and remodeling damaged tissue, and it can restructure adipose tissue.

30
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:46,700
So if you gain or lose lipids, it changes to the volume of the individual adipocytes.

31
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,750
And this can change the population of immune cells in that environment, too.

32
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:55,130
So it has very diverse roles in different tissues. And then finally,

33
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:05,899
you haven't had a lot of discussion about cancer and nutrition and immunology and hopefully will get some papers this year to talk about this.

34
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,370
But the immune system plays a critical role in tumor surveillance.

35
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:25,370
So your immune system identifies aberrant cell types that can grow in different parts of your body and the immune cells that you have,

36
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:33,470
the different classes of lymphocytes and the innate immune system plays a role in eliminating tumor cells.

37
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:40,130
But you have natural killer cells that can act immediately and then cytotoxic T cells.

38
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:46,879
And what these do is they recognize foreign or antigens on the surface of cells.

39
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:54,110
An antigen is anything that can elicit an immune response, and your immune system tries to eliminate those cells.

40
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,790
So that's a brief description of these different functions.

41
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:08,170
So you have acute and chronic inflammation.

42
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:23,770
So if you have tissue injury, if you have if you have closed your hand and a door or you're stung by a bee or you get a mosquito bite,

43
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:35,440
you get an inflammatory response that occurs immediately and this can arise and resolve within a few hours or maybe a day or two at the most.

44
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:44,050
And the responses here are mediated by cytokines and lipid mediators that we'll talk about a little bit more.

45
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:58,510
And this can lead to the development of chronic inflammation, which can be maintained for several days or several weeks and maybe in two months.

46
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:05,410
And a chronic inflammatory response can be something like an autoimmune response,

47
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:16,330
where your immune system is recognizing your own tissues and causing this a long, protracted, inflammatory response.

48
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:27,580
So in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system is attacking your own tissues, and that is an example of a chronic inflammatory response.

49
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:39,220
If you have an allergy and you're constantly exposed to allergens, that can cause a chronic inflammatory response.

50
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:48,640
So one is short lived acute. One can be cause a protracted inflammatory response in illness.

51
00:06:49,240 --> 00:07:01,809
And throughout the semester, we'll talk about different types of micro nutrients that have been used to kind of control these types of responses.

52
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:13,350
And we'll see how successful they are. They aren't. So there's systemic inflammation and local inflammation.

53
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:21,840
So an example of a local inflammatory response would be in regard to infection of an epithelial surface.

54
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:27,570
And what's shown here is bacteria infecting epithelial surface.

55
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:36,659
This could be in the lungs. You have bacteria now that are trying to establish a foothold in the host and they

56
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,970
gain that foothold through a figure in this case within the epithelial layer.

57
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,990
So you have we live in a we live in an environment that's not sterile.

58
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:53,670
So you're always exposed to these bugs. And this particular in this instance, the bacteria is trying to get into the host.

59
00:07:54,570 --> 00:08:08,190
And you have a number of protective mechanisms now to eliminate that bacteria and prevent it from colonizing your cells and tissues.

60
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:21,000
So you have leukocytes that are attracted to the side of of the injury, and here are some tissue macrophages that might be present.

61
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:28,559
You have responses that occur from this type of inflammation.

62
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:37,470
And all of these are local inflammatory responses. And then shown here are some cytokines that can be released in response to this infection.

63
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:49,440
So this is how a local inflammatory response is initiated, and it can lead to a systemic inflammatory response.

64
00:08:49,950 --> 00:09:02,100
And in that case, the cells or the inflammatory mediators spill over into the blood, and they can attract more leukocytes or white blood cells.

65
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,110
They can activate cells and cause them to release a lot of pro-inflammatory mediators,

66
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:17,970
and that can spill over to the blood and cause a systemic, inflammatory response that spreads throughout the host.

67
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:24,060
And that can be helpful in that you get a stronger immune response.

68
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:35,610
Or it can be problematic in that that systemic inflammatory response can cause significant illness and septic septic shock,

69
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,800
for example, something that can cause a life threatening response.

70
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,900
So here are some pro-inflammatory cytokines that are listed here.

71
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,560
Tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin one beta.

72
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:57,240
Those are strong cytokines that are activated initially in a tissue and in this case in response to an infection.

73
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:05,880
And then you have this cytokines. Interleukin eight and interleukin eight itself is a key more attractive.

74
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:13,140
It's a chemokine. It attracts, in this case, neutrophils to the side of that local inflammation.

75
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,550
And then so you have also a balance.

76
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:31,339
So you have activation, pro pro-inflammatory mediators and anti-inflammatory mediators in the example in response to something

77
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:37,400
that is anti-inflammatory that could be activated and would play a role in systemic inflammation.

78
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,540
Is these anti-inflammatory mediators cortisol you have epinephrine lift it listed here and

79
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:50,440
they have interleukin ten interleukin ten with the an important anti-inflammatory cytokines.

80
00:10:52,150 --> 00:11:02,080
Okay. So this is this is just a generalization how you have a local inflammatory response leading to a systemic and type limited response.

81
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,940
And we'll see what role intuition plays in these types of responses.

82
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,970
All right. Any questions so far?

83
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,130
Just basic stuff. Has everybody had all of this stuff in the general biology class?

84
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,940
Yes, you have. So I'm walking you through what stuff you already know.

85
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:32,620
Good. So the the when you talk about inflammation, now you're talking about the four cardinal signs of inflammation.

86
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:40,780
Removal are two more Keller and DA. And they also see loss of function associated with this, these four pillars of inflammation.

87
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,200
So you have redness, swelling, heat and pain.

88
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:57,190
And the redness occurs in response to an increase in blood flow to an area that's affected by and usually an inflammatory response or immune response.

89
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:06,160
And what's happening here is the vessels that perfused that tissue become like here, and they dilate.

90
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:12,430
And the dilation causes that tissue to become warm and to become red.

91
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,280
You've got greater amount of blood flowing in that particular tissue.

92
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:22,810
So that occurs fairly rapidly, can occur from a trauma, it can occur from infection,

93
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:30,280
it can occur in response to some antigen like analogy that you're exposed to and you've been sensitized to.

94
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,760
So here's the normal blood vessel and here's tissue inflammation.

95
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:46,150
You've got a lot of white cells here. You have like your endothelial cells so fluid can spill out into the interstitial space.

96
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,440
And you've got a lot of all blood cell types in here.

97
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,069
And then some of these white blood cells are leukocytes can leak out of the

98
00:12:54,070 --> 00:13:00,760
interstitial tissue and produce inflammatory mediators to prolong this response.

99
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:12,730
And then you have swelling and pain. So the swelling is the edema formation where the vasculature becomes more permeable.

100
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,180
The fluid within the vessels that profuse that tissue leaks out to the interstitial space,

101
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:26,110
and that causes the swelling for that particular issue tissue.

102
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:36,670
And then within that fluid, there are, like I mentioned, cytokines and lipid mediators that can activate no cell receptors or pain receptors.

103
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:45,820
You also have a change in the pressure within that tissue so that you have

104
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:51,670
the can receptors that can respond to the change in the volume of the tissue,

105
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,750
the swelling of the tissue. And this can contribute to the sensation of pain.

106
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:05,100
Okay. So that's just the basic stuff. Now we're going to get into some more details.

107
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:12,810
Um, the all new cells arise from the bone marrow.

108
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:18,030
You can have local cells arising from other tissues.

109
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:26,980
So you have, you can have a liver macrophage or a cooper cell, you could have a lung macrophage or now these are macrophage.

110
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:33,719
Those are examples of of resident macrophages that can arise from tissues and they are

111
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,840
derived from the animal during its development and they can be derived from the yolk sac.

112
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:46,080
But but for the general purposes of this class, think of all immune cells arising from the bone marrow.

113
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:57,150
So you have cells that are either thinking in the will eventually become lymphocytes and cells that will eventually become leukocytes.

114
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:04,200
And their common progenitors are listed here. You have a common lymphoid progenitor and a common myeloid progenitor.

115
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:12,480
And the thing I want you to remember here, when I talk about lymphocytes, I'm talking about all white blood cells.

116
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:21,660
When I'm talking about lymphocytes, I'm going to be referring to the cells of lymphoid origin, B cells, T cells and natural killer cells.

117
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:31,410
And then cells that are important in the innate immune response are circled in these red boxes.

118
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:39,150
So you have the granular sites and you have within tissue.

119
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:47,430
These are actually circulating in the blood. So those are neutrophils, mRNA fills base of fills monocytes.

120
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:57,600
And then you have cells within the tissues, the mast cells in the macrophage and then antigen presenting cells of dendritic cells.

121
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:06,230
And then finally, even though this particular lymphocyte, then a natural killer cells,

122
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:14,880
it's a lymphocyte plays a role in innate immune responses against viruses and tumors as well.

123
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:21,940
Cancer cells. So those are the players in the innate immune response and there's some overlap.

124
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,480
But this is a generalization and foundational information.

125
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:37,100
So what do tissue macrophages do? They engulf bacteria through the process of phagocytosis.

126
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,920
They kill them through bactericidal mechanisms.

127
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:47,750
They can present antigens to the dendritic cells, which you'll hear, see here in a minute, and then not listed here.

128
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,970
The macrophage can repair tissues. They can remodel and repair tissues.

129
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,360
This is another really important function that they perform.

130
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:12,270
The next cell I'm going to talk about here is the dendritic cell, and it has this interesting shape.

131
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:17,850
So you have an illustration, which is the case of the macrophage.

132
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:26,160
In the case of the dendritic cell, you have these long projections of the dendritic cell type where you have these long processes

133
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:33,450
and you'll see these cells everywhere where they will be surface exposed to the environment.

134
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:41,910
So you'll have dendritic cells within your respiratory tract, you'll have dendritic types, type cells,

135
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:51,150
or they're called Langerhans cells that live in your skin and you have dendritic cells, lots of them within your gastrointestinal tract.

136
00:17:53,070 --> 00:18:04,890
What they do is they're always sampling the external environment and they're taking up antigens and they're presenting them to other cells,

137
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:14,350
the cells of the adaptive immune system. And they are really important in initiating an adaptive immune response.

138
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:36,280
Now let's talk a little bit about the granular sites and the most common granular site or most common,

139
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,600
I should say, white blood cells circulating in your body right now are these neutrophils.

140
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:47,650
They make up the majority of the circulating cells, leukocytes within your blood.

141
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,790
They perform host defense mechanisms like they can phagocytosis and kill bacteria.

142
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,560
They're actually better killing than the macrophages are. So that's an important function that they perform.

143
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:11,800
You think about them in terms of their ability to kill bacteria, but it turns out that they have a role in killing viruses as well.

144
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:21,630
So if you have a recruitment of a neutrophils to a site of infection or inflammation, they play an important role.

145
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,980
Do you have too few or too many? That can be problematic.

146
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:35,940
Neutrophils can cause collateral damage. That means that you recruit a neutrophil in response to an infection or some kind of insult.

147
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:46,800
And if you get too many of them and there's a really profound inflammatory response that can be detrimental, it can cause excessive inflammation.

148
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:52,290
Can anybody think of an example that we've been hearing about for the last two

149
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:57,030
years in which neutrophils have played a deleterious role in an infection?

150
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:09,690
You're shaking your head a little bit, yeah. So with COVID patients, some people get a really profound recruitment of neutrophils.

151
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:18,450
And like I said, neutrophils can provide some defense against viral infections, but they can cause a lot of collateral damage, too.

152
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,650
So they can take up viruses.

153
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:32,550
But one of the things that they're thought to play a role in terms of antiviral defense is that when the viruses are circulating or exposed,

154
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:40,560
the neutrophils can produce antimicrobial peptides, which we'll talk about a bit on Thursday.

155
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:47,790
And these are molecules that can destroy not only bacteria, but viruses as well.

156
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,270
Okay.

157
00:20:54,540 --> 00:21:05,130
Another Granulocyte that's important in host events and that can be problematic in other kinds of inflammation like an allergy is the eosinophilia.

158
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:12,990
So for host events and the synovial is, it's important against parasitic infections.

159
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:19,470
If somebody is infected with a parasite, you might see a higher number of eosinophilia.

160
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:23,010
So if somebody has some kind of a parasitic worm,

161
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:34,230
the Senate bill count might be high and they can find and kill parasites that might live in your body.

162
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,760
And there's all kinds of interesting things about that.

163
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:50,850
So we know that the Senate bills are important for not only parasites, but in terms of allergic responses.

164
00:21:51,990 --> 00:22:05,220
So how many of you've heard a discussion of this idea where if you live in clean environments, you might be more prone to allergies?

165
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:15,060
Right. I've heard about this. So part of the theory is based on this, well, if you're exposed to feces,

166
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:21,900
you're going to be exposed to these parasites and your immune response is shaped by that exposure.

167
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:33,120
And one of the ways that it's shaped is that you have more of a cytokine profile in response to that, that recruits and eliminates parasites.

168
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:41,070
And the NFL has been trained to recognize and kill these parasites.

169
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:46,080
Well, if you live in a clean environment, you're not exposed to that.

170
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,900
In the Senate, bills become trained or adapted to a cleaner environment.

171
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:58,440
And they they respond inappropriately and they can contribute to inflammation associated with allergies.

172
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:07,860
So you can have eosinophilic asthma, which can be profound, you can be chronic, and it can be really difficult to treat.

173
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:14,580
So that's the that the hygiene hypothesis that I've just talked about.

174
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:25,060
So these officials are another kind of granular site that circulates in your blood.

175
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:31,090
And for a long time, it wasn't understood what these cells actually did or why we needed them.

176
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,610
Well, recently, I guess in the last ten, 15 years, there's been a lot of study, invasive pills.

177
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,480
And they they do participate in inflammation associated with allergy.

178
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:51,220
So in that in that sense, they can be problematic in terms of a role in host defense, I'm not quite familiar with that literature,

179
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:58,000
but it's possible that they would play an important role against certain types of pathogens, but I'm not certain.

180
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:04,360
So you would find these cells circulating in your blood if you had an allergic response,

181
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:10,960
you'd probably find a higher number of of of or higher percentage of base of those circulating in your body.

182
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,140
And then there's that. So I want to make a point.

183
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:28,040
So tissue cells, macrophages, dendritic cells live in the tissues.

184
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,019
These granule sites of neutrophils that you send, it fills in the base of fills are going to be circulating in your blood there.

185
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:42,950
They're short lived, though, the liver about 8 hours, maybe a little bit longer than that, where the tissue cells can live for several weeks, months.

186
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:51,709
Mass cell is a tissue cell. It lives in epithelial surfaces.

187
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:59,480
It's in the surface of your skin and your respiratory tract, in your nasal pharynx and your gastrointestinal tract.

188
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:12,410
And they respond to infectious agents or they respond to allergens.

189
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:23,990
So you noticed the dense purple stain here in this micrograph and that stain staining these granules and the

190
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:33,080
granules contain pro-inflammatory mediators like histamine histamines pro-inflammatory because it can cause edema.

191
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:38,629
So within your tissues you have an activation of the mass.

192
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:43,510
So it will happen almost immediately in your skin.

193
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,280
It can cause hives. So you have a little rash in your skin and your respiratory tract.

194
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:57,290
It can cause occlusion of your airways and be so profound that it can cause an asthmatic attack.

195
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:03,889
It can cause prophylaxis where you have not only local information but systemic

196
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:09,200
inflammation that can compromise your ability to profuse your tissues with blood.

197
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:19,150
So and then histamine the histamine release and you have other diesel active agents,

198
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:29,770
pro-inflammatory agents within the mast cells just, you know, look at trains that can elicit airway, hyper responsiveness in asthma.

199
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:42,490
Other other mediators can be released by masses like serotonin, which can cause in the gut, can cause, you know,

200
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:53,410
like a diarrhea or you're essentially speeding up the peristalsis that would occur in the gut in response to an allergen.

201
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:06,280
And then finally, there's these unusual cells called the NASH, the natural killer cells.

202
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,140
So they're lymphoid cells. They're lymphocytes.

203
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:24,930
But they have these granules in them. They play a major role in innate immunity and they can be activated right away.

204
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,480
So here's a micrograph of a natural killer cell.

205
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:36,990
They can kill some viral infected cells and they can kill tumor cells as well.

206
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:47,579
And there's quite a bit in the literature there had been about impaired natural killer

207
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:56,160
cells function and using a mouse model of diet induced obesity and influenza infection.

208
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:08,130
So this was it was an interesting and a hot topic about, I want to say, 15 years ago now.

209
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:23,759
Thousandseven 2008, an investigator at USC Chapel Hill was looking at natural killer cell function in response to influenza infection.

210
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:31,739
And she found that in mice that were at a high fat diet, when she took out the natural killer cells and presented them with targets,

211
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,670
they had an impairment in their ability to destroy those or kill those targets.

212
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:42,670
So that's kind of a nutrition related story in regard to these natural killer cells.

213
00:28:47,520 --> 00:29:00,270
Okay. The next thing I'm going to walk you through here has to do with things within your blood and within the plasma of your

214
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:09,540
blood that are critical for host events and then can cause a problem in terms of an inappropriate inflammatory response.

215
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,680
So you have complement proteins.

216
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:25,830
Now, complement proteins are really complicated. They're essentially nine, nine or maybe a few more complement proteins that when they're activated,

217
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:33,509
they can attach themselves to cells and they can participate in host events.

218
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:43,470
Response. So you have the classical pathway, vimentin binding, lectin pathway in the alternative pathway.

219
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:47,310
And all of these involve these complement proteins that become activated.

220
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:58,050
And the classical pathway, let's say you've been exposed to a particular bug in the past and you gained some immunologic memory.

221
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:01,770
Is the adaptive immune response that we'll be talking about a little bit later.

222
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:09,780
So you make antibodies and you have an activation of the complement system.

223
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:18,330
The antibody and the complement proteins can work together to better eliminate infectious agents such as bacteria.

224
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,920
So if complement can recruit inflammatory cells and neutrophils.

225
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:26,020
It can optimize pathogens.

226
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:35,210
So that's a process of attaching themselves to pathogens and making them more easily taken up by a macrophage or neutrophils.

227
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:42,270
And then they can actually boreholes within bacteria, causing them to bust open or phragmites.

228
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:49,050
And that's a different ways which this complement activation cascade can be activated.

229
00:30:50,610 --> 00:31:00,389
Man in binding lectin pathway occurs when you have an infection and you have an inflammatory

230
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:07,710
mediators that lead to activation of the immune response and deliver the acute phase response.

231
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:12,000
And the liver produces these man and binding lectins.

232
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,240
And that can also participate in pathogen elimination.

233
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:26,600
And then finally you have the alternative pathway where it's just a complement.

234
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:31,730
Let's say you haven't seen an organism before. The complement cascade is activated.

235
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:43,880
It attaches to the pathogen surface and it can recruit cells, oxidize the pathogen, cover it with complement proteins,

236
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:51,050
and then in the case of just complement they can boreholes within bacteria and kill it eliminated.

237
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:02,340
Okay. Although this is review so far for everybody right now.

238
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:09,980
I don't have a question. Yeah. So you were talking about like our system being adapted to, like,

239
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:19,880
bacteria or viruses or is it exactly the same for for parasites in terms of your having immunity against parasites?

240
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:23,299
Yeah. Like, yeah, yeah. Your, your body can remember parasites.

241
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:33,320
In other words, your immune response can recognize a antigen and a parasite and eliminate it through this type of pathway.

242
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:38,540
Parasites and viruses are really clever in that they can hide from the immune system.

243
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:44,840
So a parasite like just hits the plasma.

244
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,960
We're talking about malaria, the malaria pathogen.

245
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,750
It can hide within red blood cells.

246
00:32:51,740 --> 00:33:01,790
And your red blood cells now, well, are decorated with, um, antigens on their surface that prevent your immune system from attacking them.

247
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:09,980
Right? So the parasite can grow in red blood cells and continue to divide and reproduce.

248
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,360
And your immune system hasn't caught up yet, right?

249
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:22,550
Um, it's not until the red cell dies that the parasite comes out and your immune system says, I ha, you know, that's this is a foreign invader.

250
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:33,230
Let's kill it. So and there are other mechanisms or other strategies that parasitic organisms can can use to kind of disease.

251
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,700
This type of surveillance,

252
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:45,980
tuberculosis is another example where the bacterium can hide within the cytoplasm of macrophages and avoid being detected for years.

253
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,480
So this is putting all of this together.

254
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:08,630
Activation of the innate immune response where you have tissue, macrophages here on the left is exposed to bacteria.

255
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:17,240
Let's say that tissue, macrophages in the lung or in the surface of your skin and that macrophage releases a cytokine.

256
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:32,540
This is a messenger that the macrophage uses to communicate with other tissues, and in this case, the macrophage activates the epithelial cells.

257
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:40,190
Here, the end of the endothelial cells, I'm sorry, right here within the vasculature.

258
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:47,060
And these endothelial cells have receptors for all kinds of different cytokines.

259
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:54,680
They can even produce cytokines themselves. And we have different blood cells that are circulating here.

260
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:58,879
Red blood cell neutrophil, this blue cells, a lymphocyte.

261
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,990
And this is a mononuclear cell. And in response to this cytokine, you get a bunch of different things happening.

262
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,670
So you have the fluid leaking here and here.

263
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:20,210
And so the plasma fluid is leaking out, initiating that acute inflammatory response.

264
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:26,720
And then you have the plasma proteins that are leaking in the complement proteins that I just mentioned,

265
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:31,460
the main and binding, lectin, lectin proteins that are produced by the liver.

266
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:40,680
If you have a profound inflammatory response and what that does is that it can help activate the macrophage.

267
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:47,330
Now to be a better scavenger for or phagocytes to take up this bacteria.

268
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:58,580
And then this this cytokine now that's produced, you can have chemokines that are produced by the cell,

269
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:03,770
too, and the chemokines attract white blood cells to the site of infection.

270
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,820
And there are lots of different classes of chemokines.

271
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:11,390
And then I don't want to overwhelm you right now. But then what?

272
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:20,870
Because there's literally hundreds of them. But they're going to attract other white cells to the site of infection and inflammation.

273
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:26,990
So here is inflammatory cells that are.

274
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,520
Okay. So we have cytokine release and I would say chemokine release as well.

275
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,950
Vasodilation, increased permeability, redness, heat, swelling, inflammation.

276
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,380
And then you have this inflammatory cells migrating into the tissue.

277
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:51,770
They're going to release inflammatory mediators, both pro and adaptive, as the infection resolves anti inflammatory mediators.

278
00:36:52,430 --> 00:37:03,170
And that also results in redness and swelling and pain associated with this inflammatory response.

279
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:16,750
Okay. So that's just a brief synopsis of this acute inflammatory response.

280
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:24,809
I kind of breezed through the epithelial barrier to infection, and we'll talk about this in a bit more detail.

281
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:25,840
We'll talk about vitamin A.

282
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:38,770
So like I mentioned, any anywhere you're exposed to the environment, you have these epithelial barriers that are really important against infection.

283
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:45,460
And you know this because if you cut yourself, you can become easily infected.

284
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,360
In fact, that particular one, unless you cover it and treat it right.

285
00:37:51,160 --> 00:38:00,550
So you have barriers within your skin. You have this barrier function within your gut and your lungs and your eyes and your nose.

286
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:05,610
So the first barriers, these mechanical barriers,

287
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:13,029
and this would be the type junctions between the epithelial cell layers and this prevents a

288
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:19,120
pathogen from or something that's that's just inhabiting your skin and getting into your body.

289
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:26,800
So it's just a tight connection between the epithelial cells within the skin.

290
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:38,440
You have the longitudinal flow of air or fluid in the air and your skin air and your lungs fluid in your lungs.

291
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:48,550
That's the alveolar fluid that's in your respiratory tract, the fluid that's in the epithelial layer of your gastrointestinal tract.

292
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:58,749
You have the movement of mucus that is in this layer with ciliated cells that

293
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:05,440
push that mucus later out of your body and then within your eyes and your nose,

294
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:13,900
you have you have tear ducts, you have cilia within your nails or pharynx, too, that helps move things out.

295
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,080
So these are examples of mechanical barriers.

296
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:22,459
Okay. Then you have chemical barriers,

297
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:32,250
you've got fatty acids that's in the fatty acids themselves that are produced in the surface of your skin, have antimicrobial properties.

298
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:37,640
If you if you wash your skin too frequently, you can lose this.

299
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:50,810
If you have a deficiency in certain essential fatty acids, you can lose that function within your gut.

300
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:54,409
You have other types of chemical barriers.

301
00:39:54,410 --> 00:40:05,120
You have a low, particularly here in your stomach. In your stomach, you produce proteolytic enzymes, pepsin.

302
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:13,550
And this can degrade certain kinds of bacteria, but not all you have within your lungs,

303
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:20,780
other types of of of chemical barriers that are agents that are listed here.

304
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,720
And then within your eyes, in your nose, you have an lysozyme that's secreted.

305
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:36,200
And this prevents infection or kills organisms that might get into these areas.

306
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,060
And then all of these cells within these tissues are antibacterial.

307
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:51,350
The antibacterial peptides realm of realm is the one we're going to talk about on Thursday.

308
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:58,790
These can directly kill organisms like bacteria, like like fungi.

309
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:07,040
They can kill viruses and you're constantly producing them and you'll produce more of them in response to an infection.

310
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:16,700
And then you have these micro biological defenses, barrier defenses.

311
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:25,130
This is the the microbiome, I would say not you don't know which we used to refer to as the normal flora,

312
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:31,490
the microbiome that lives in the surface of your skin, in your gut, in your nasal pharynx.

313
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:47,060
This these organisms have kind of a beneficial existence in that they are out competing something that can make you sick or a pathogen.

314
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:53,840
They can secrete things that can be toxic to a pathogenic organism.

315
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,370
So this is another example of an important epithelial barrier.

316
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:07,580
So later in the semester, we'll talk about the microbiome and how it's shaped by nutrition macronutrients that you might consume.

317
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:24,050
So this is an illustration that briefly summarizes the release of cytokines from macrophages.

318
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:31,700
So all cells, not all cells, but most cells have the capacity to produce cytokines.

319
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:42,230
The macrophage has the greatest capacity to produce cytokines because they can produce a whole lot more than the epithelial cell could.

320
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:51,590
So you have these cytokines that are kind of initiate the inflammatory response.

321
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:58,310
And they would be produced and within a few hours after an infection in this case.

322
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:09,410
So here you have in the very top portion a macrophage that has these receptors on the surface that recognize in this case it's gram negative bacteria.

323
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:17,810
They have on their surface Lipopolysaccharide or LPs, and they secrete these pro-inflammatory cytokines in response.

324
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,840
And you have the liberation of interleukin one.

325
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:30,980
And look, invader would be it would be an example of a pro-inflammatory cytokines and it has all of these properties.

326
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,780
It activates that vascular endothelial, making it more leaky.

327
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:40,550
It can activate local immune cells and their lymphocytes, for example.

328
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:51,620
It can contribute to local tissue destruction through the process of the ptosis or programed cell death.

329
00:43:53,120 --> 00:44:01,610
And it can increase the access to a particular infected area to two effector cells.

330
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:12,170
Later on in this semester we'll talk about effector T cells and how they play a role and what kinds of different inflammatory responses.

331
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:22,790
Once this cytokine spills out into your circulation and it reaches a certain concentration, can reach your your hypothalamus,

332
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:31,010
and it can have a pyrotechnic response in that it increases your body temperature, it produces a fever.

333
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:36,380
IL six can do the same type of a thing, has the same effect.

334
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:47,510
So that would be over here. And it can produce this. Fever response.

335
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:54,950
Interleukin eight is a chemokine, and in particular it attracts neutrophils to the site of infection.

336
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:05,990
It can activate these cells to bind more with a greater tendency to endothelial cells.

337
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,270
TNF Alpha tumor necrosis factor alpha is.

338
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:19,730
It does a number of different things. It makes it activates the endothelial cells in the vasculature.

339
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:29,390
It increases that. Which increases its permeability, which leads to entry of these proteins circulating in your blood.

340
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:40,550
It's produced in enough error over a long period of time, but in cells that can cause systemic inflammation leading to fever.

341
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:45,350
And if enough is produced, septic shock.

342
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:53,900
And then aisle six is part of this acute phase reaction where the liver now becomes

343
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:59,750
activated in response to a systemic inflammatory response and it pumps out interleukin six.

344
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:06,290
And that can cause a fever or an acute phase response.

345
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:09,950
And then finally, you have interleukin 12.

346
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:16,850
It activates a bunch of different cells, including natural killer cells and T cells.

347
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,420
And so you have, in response to an infection,

348
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:28,670
this cascade of events that's initiated by recognizing these pathogens and activating these inflammatory responses.

349
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:34,630
And they seem redundant. They seem redundant because they do similar things.

350
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:44,950
But if you have a deficiency in one of the cytokines, you have a problem with a greater susceptibility to a particular pathogen.

351
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:52,240
So they appear to have redundant roles, but each one of these is very important in its own right.

352
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:03,750
Okay. So putting a lot of this together in terms of what's going on in the surface of the skin,

353
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:09,720
because that's what we're going to be talking about on Thursday. So you have a primary infection.

354
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:15,390
You have your epithelial cells lining the surface of the skin.

355
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:17,520
And here's the infective agent.

356
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:29,009
Here's this cell that looks like a dendritic cell, the Langerhans cell, that's that will take up antigen and present it to cells,

357
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:34,380
the adaptive immune system, a t cell here and here you have an infection.

358
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:42,089
So these cells become activated. They produce inflammatory chemokines in this case that recruit a lot of cells to the

359
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:50,880
site of infection that the inflammatory response resolves and the tissue recovers.

360
00:47:51,960 --> 00:48:01,500
And you have here, in response to this cascade of chemokines, a recruitment of these other types of T cells.

361
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:11,250
Now that form membrane. So you can remember that particular organism in the future and you can respond more quickly to infection,

362
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:14,650
and then you can have these cells being effector cells.

363
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:23,070
If this is a cell that's infected with a virus, that effector t cell, a lymphocyte can kill that epithelial cell,

364
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,990
preventing it from releasing more viruses and infecting other cells.

365
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:42,810
And then you have within these tissues, t cells now that are capable of finding virus infected cells throughout the epithelial barrier.

366
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:53,760
And if this function now is working properly, it can prevent a severe inflammatory response.

367
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,399
And then there are some other things sprinkled throughout this diagram.

368
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:08,220
You have prostaglandin E2, which is a lipid mediator that plays a role in the resolution of the inflammation.

369
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:22,200
You have vitamin D, which plays a role in the all aspects of the inflammatory response, and you have effector memory, memory,

370
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:31,200
t cell, central memory and regulatory T cells that play more of an anti-inflammatory role and infection of the barrier cells here.

371
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,340
So there's that there's a balance of pro and anti-inflammatory mediators.

372
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,680
What are lipid mediators we're talking about in terms of lipid mean?

373
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:47,889
So cytokines are protein hormones.

374
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:55,300
They're kind of like our bones between blood white blood cells.

375
00:49:56,350 --> 00:50:03,040
They circulate in the blood, activate the cells and have their some of which I just summarize.

376
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:11,590
Lipid mediators are derived from fatty acids that are actually positioned in the cell membrane.

377
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:16,960
So. Here's a cell here and now.

378
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:24,040
And this is a close up of the cell membrane. And in the cell membrane, you have this phospholipid bilayer.

379
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:29,800
And this cause is this is where surface proteins are embedded.

380
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:37,030
This is where you might have other types of substances or receptors within the cell.

381
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:48,910
And the lipid mediator, the lipids play an important role in as a there's a plasma membrane as an impermeable layer.

382
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:57,100
But they can also play a role in signaling within the cell and within adjacent cells.

383
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:08,110
So when you have an inflammatory response caused by a release of hormones or cytokines or bacteria,

384
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:16,180
these lipid mediators are released and they're released through the action of phosphor like paste enzymes.

385
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:27,430
So the phospholipase enzymes which are located in the cytosol, closely associated with the plasma membrane.

386
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:36,070
And even in the nuclear membrane, when they're released, they cleave the fatty acid to a certain position.

387
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:46,540
And depending on what type of lipids you have in the plasma membrane, you can get a weak or really strong inflammatory response.

388
00:51:49,110 --> 00:52:02,070
So within the limits now you have here and omega six fatty acid and it has four double bonds

389
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:10,050
and it's arachidonic acid and that is the parent molecule for a lot of these lipid mediators.

390
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:20,279
Lipid mediators would be things like prostaglandin E2 or the liquid trains and the pro-inflammatory prostaglandin

391
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:28,390
E2 is initially pro-inflammatory because it can cause the endothelial cells and blood cells to become like here.

392
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:39,809
So you get edema. Okay. But in response to cytokines like CnF, that PG e2 can inhibit formation.

393
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:50,219
So it plays a kind of a dual role. So in the presence of rapid tonic acid within your tissues, that's what happens.

394
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:53,640
You form these occurs anoints all of these lipid mediators.

395
00:52:55,350 --> 00:53:02,700
So there's a way to manipulate this response and then you're going to manipulate this response through your diet.

396
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:09,280
How many of you consume? Seafood.

397
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:14,360
Couple of times a week. That's the dietary recommendation.

398
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:21,310
Two times a week. A serving of fish or other types of seafood in your diet.

399
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:25,840
How many of you do that? Because of one person? Two people. Okay, I try to do this.

400
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:29,590
I get this sounds gross, but it's actually pretty good.

401
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:35,020
Twice a week, we get a three ounce serving of canned salmon. It's expensive, but it's pretty good.

402
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,220
And and I'm doing this to manipulate this pathway.

403
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:46,960
So when you do that, when you consume seafood, especially fatty fish,

404
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:52,889
the fatty fish contains these omega three fatty acids and you make it three fatty acids

405
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:58,390
and you get salmon and other types of fish that live in the cold layer of the oceans.

406
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:05,650
They contain a lot of these 20 carbon fatty acids.

407
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:16,750
EPA and DHA is another example, and they replace arachidonic acid and tissue phospholipids throughout your body,

408
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:22,630
throughout the immune cells within you, red blood cells within your tissues, within your cells.

409
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:35,430
And when you have an activation of the lipid mediate response, instead of getting those pro-inflammatory media, you get things that yeah,

410
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:41,920
they think that they have some properties to induce a little inflammation, but they're a thousandfold less potent.

411
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:48,820
So you're suppressing the ability of the lipid mediators now to cause an inflammatory response.

412
00:54:53,160 --> 00:55:00,850
Detail or die homo gamma linolenic acid is a fatty acid that you would get in some types of seed oils.

413
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:12,690
Rapeseed oil is an example, and instead of having arachidonic acid in your tissue phospholipids, you can displace that with consuming vegetable oil.

414
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:26,790
Certain mess with rapeseed oil. Canola oil are some examples and that can shape the lipid mediator response to inflammatory stimuli.

415
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:39,600
Okay. Now let's talk about that kind of put all this together in the setting of the

416
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,860
barrier function and the cellular function in response to an infectious agent.

417
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:50,130
So up here in the left panel, you have baseline conditions.

418
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:55,680
You have all of these different immune cells that live underneath layer the surface of the skin.

419
00:55:56,610 --> 00:56:01,079
You have Langerhans cells that dendritic cell.

420
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:07,170
You have tissue, macrophages. You have other types of cells or some lymphocytes in here as well.

421
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:14,760
And you have the epithelial cells producing these antimicrobial peptides.

422
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:22,800
And then you have the normal skin flora, and then you have the lower temperature in the surface of your skin, which inhibits growth.

423
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:30,120
And you have this patch, this lower page. And then you're exposed to pathogen.

424
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:45,320
In this case, Staphylococcus aureus. About 30% of the population in U.S. is colonized, with Staphylococcus aureus mostly in your news offerings.

425
00:56:46,730 --> 00:57:00,500
Especially little kids. Okay, so these organisms now can breach this barrier and they can stimulate an inflammatory response.

426
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:09,590
So you have production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides.

427
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:15,350
And if the barrier is breached here, you can recruit lots of neutrophils.

428
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:20,840
And the neutrophils are these cells that respond immediately.

429
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:27,320
You have some tissue, macrophages, but if you have a cut, you're going to need the neutrophils to eliminate staph aureus.

430
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:34,640
So the neutrophils fangs ties in this bacteria and it's killing it through these different mechanisms.

431
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:47,510
So it has these FC receptors that recognize antibodies, complement that coat the surface and oxidize the surface of bacteria.

432
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:56,780
And that makes it easier, easier for the cell to ingest those things and kills them within these compartments, this phagosome.

433
00:57:57,890 --> 00:58:02,060
And you have different things that can kill the bacteria.

434
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:09,740
You have sequestration of things that the bacteria needs to grow and survive.

435
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:18,410
You have acidic hydrolysis, proteases, antimicrobial peptides, reactive oxygen species.

436
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:26,810
All of these things play a role in killing this bacteria now that's been ingested.

437
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:34,370
And then here's an example of calprotectin. This is a protein that binds things that the bacteria needs to grow.

438
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:40,550
So that would be kind of a growth requirement for the bacteria.

439
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:44,690
All right. So this is how everything is supposed to work.

440
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:52,160
We get infected, it clears the infection. And within a few days, you can't even tell that you've been infected anymore.

441
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:58,610
But it depends on the state that you're in.

442
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:05,900
And if you have a condition in which you're vitamin deficient, this could compromise those functions.

443
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:10,190
And this is the subject of the paper we're going to discuss on Thursday.

444
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:19,130
So it turns out that you need this fat soluble vitamin,

445
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:32,090
vitamin name that within the epithelial layer of the skin produces this antimicrobial peptide real name, which is a product of this bartonella gene.

446
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:39,830
And the antimicrobial peptide can kill bacteria that try to colonize the host.

447
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:46,159
And in this case, you have the infectious agent that they're talking about.

448
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:50,240
This in this graphical abstract is streptococcus pyogenes.

449
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:55,550
And if that works, if you are vitamin A sufficient, you can eliminate that pathogen.

450
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:02,000
And there are some types of dermatologic preparations that you put in your skin

451
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:08,689
that contain vitamin A that can activate this response and clear your skin,

452
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:13,630
actually. And this is how this is thought to work. All right.

453
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:23,550
Now I'm going to show you some gross pictures. All right. So this is methicillin resistant staph aureus.

454
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:28,640
It can be very problematic for some people. So this is false colored.

455
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:34,320
So here's tissue. And in purple, here is this staphylococcus aureus.

456
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:42,450
And here is an infection in which the person's immune system is unable to control the infection.

457
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:46,470
So you have this huge patch of redness and swelling.

458
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:54,090
You have this tissue now that this is a poor that has been enlarged because of the infection.

459
01:00:54,510 --> 01:01:03,250
There are millions of neutrophils now that have been recruited to that side of infection, but they're not successful in clearing the pathogen.

460
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:06,750
In fact, they're probably causing a lot of collateral damage there.

461
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:19,320
So this individual is seeking treatment for that particular infection and they're trying to find the right antibiotic that can clear the infection.

462
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:26,340
And there's this methicillin resistant staph aureus that is really problematic.

463
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:30,420
People are given antibiotics and they don't work anymore,

464
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:42,810
that the bug has developed resistance because it's been overuse and this limits the types of antibiotics that you can use to treat infections.

465
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:49,740
This is a huge problem clinically. Do you have a vitamin A deficiency?

466
01:01:50,640 --> 01:02:07,280
This can happen to you. And the paper that we're going to talk about on Thursday is about this romaine skin and staphylococcus pyogenes.

467
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:13,520
And it grows in chains. So here is a smear of tissue or fluid.

468
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:19,010
Now, that was taken from someone who had the infection. Here are some immune cells here and here.

469
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:23,930
Stain in red. These chains of streptococcus pyogenes.

470
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:29,990
This is a group, a streptococcus. And it causes lots of different problems.

471
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:35,000
Can cause strep throat. It can cause pneumonia.

472
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:38,960
And it can cause necrotizing fasciitis.

473
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:50,210
And that's a condition where it can cause a very profound inflammatory response destroying your skin, causing a life threatening infection.

474
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:55,820
This is another huge problem from antimicrobial antibacterial resistance.

475
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:00,470
All right, get ready. Here's another gross picture. Ready? Okay.

476
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:05,120
This is pre orbital, orbital, necrotizing fasciitis.

477
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:09,580
This poor woman had the infection around her eye.

478
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:17,060
Here she is. She's been hospitalized. She's being treated for this infection around her eyes.

479
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:21,230
And this infection was so profound,

480
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:32,930
they had to find the right dose of treatment for this particular infection to stop it from becoming profoundly inflammatory, systemic and killing her.

481
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:35,480
And they were able to successfully save her life.

482
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:44,210
But the tissue, the collateral damage caused by this immune response caused all of this tissue damage.

483
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:50,059
Yeah. So in those cases, are you saying that this is more likely to happen in people who are vitamin D deficient?

484
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:55,780
Or it could happen. It can happen to anybody, but particularly those who are vitamin D deficient are more susceptible.

485
01:03:57,290 --> 01:04:04,640
Okay. So here I don't know if this one was vitamin deficient, but if you were, it would make you more susceptible.

486
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:13,129
So this particular individual had to have tissue debridement done and I believe

487
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:17,600
they took a skin graft from another part of her body to to repair this tissue.

488
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:21,499
The good news is she completely recovered. Here's her.

489
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:25,370
After several months after treatment, you know where her eyes appear.

490
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:31,070
Normal. You wouldn't know until you looked really closely that there was ever an infection like this.

491
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:34,940
So a very successful case in this regard.

492
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:40,910
Yeah. Only on the scanner. Did it affect the actual eyeball?

493
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:46,220
I don't remember. I don't remember that detail, but it can. You certainly could.

494
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:53,500
Yeah. Yeah, go ahead.

495
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:59,970
I know, like, a lot of us have probably gotten strep throat. Like, how do they, like, progress?

496
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:04,690
So. Like, for some people, I'm like, I mean, you mentioned vitamin D deficiency,

497
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:10,390
but is there any of like if it's not caught early enough or not treated correctly, like how does that work?

498
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:16,600
So with streptococcus pyogenes a group strep,

499
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:27,010
you can get you get colonization and activation of an inflammatory response in your throat that causes the sore throat.

500
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:35,710
And if your immune system is able to keep it there or prevent it from spreading anywhere else, it can resolve.

501
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:40,360
Most of the time, you're you're going to need an antibiotic to help you clear the infection.

502
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:46,630
It can go two ways. It can go into your lungs, um, and then into your bloodstream.

503
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:51,170
And then I guess it can cause believe it can cause meningitis as well.

504
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:56,079
It can get into your, into your arms, into your brain actually cause inflammation there.

505
01:05:56,080 --> 01:06:02,020
And that can be deadly as well. So so could a systemic infection with a broad based strep.

506
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:12,870
Okay. So the innate immune system.

507
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:16,860
You know, this is review redundancy for many of you.

508
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:27,330
But as you know, as I mentioned throughout this morning's discussion is that there are certain limitations of the innate immune system.

509
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:36,830
It's limited to pathogens that bear on its surface common molecules helps with the example that I mentioned.

510
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:43,669
Lipitor particular gas is another example of something that your innate immune system would recognize.

511
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:46,670
It's a highly lipopolysaccharide in the surface.

512
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:58,100
In that case, gram positive bacteria and other types of pathogens have these common patterns that your innate immune system can recognize.

513
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:07,530
So certain bacteria now have developed resistance to urinate immune system.

514
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:13,080
And the way they do that is they produce a really thick layer of these little

515
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:18,960
lipopolysaccharide and this can help them evade your host defense mechanisms.

516
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:35,820
With viral infections, the virus gets into a cell that bears the receptor that the virus can use to get inside the cell and reproduce itself.

517
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:40,230
So it's hiding from the innate immune system.

518
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:44,820
And the way to eliminate that cell. Yeah, your, um.

519
01:07:45,810 --> 01:07:50,160
Your natural killer cells will eliminate some of those cells, but it needs help.

520
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:55,740
And that's the adaptive immune system, which we'll talk about later in performing that role.

521
01:07:57,270 --> 01:08:06,720
And lastly, another limitation of the innate immune system is that it's not specific, especially with something like a neutrophil.

522
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:14,400
When they become activated, they release antimicrobial peptides, pro-inflammatory mediators,

523
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:18,900
cytokines, lipid mediators, and that can cause collateral damage.

524
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:25,230
And as you saw with the woman who woman who had her eye infected, it causes a lot it caused a lot of tissue destruction.

525
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:30,420
So those are limitations. This is why you need the adaptive immune system.

526
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:40,300
So this is kind of a segue way to the very end and getting into the adaptive immune response, which we'll talk about later.

527
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:46,450
So you have here microbes that adhere themselves to the epithelial surface.

528
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:53,260
You have disruption of the epithelial barrier and here are your protections against infection.

529
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:59,620
You have local cells taking up the pathogen.

530
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:06,820
You recruit cells. And then you have this segway into adaptive immunity,

531
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:15,460
which we'll talk about in great detail later on in the production to another type of nutrient that's required for that type of a response.

532
01:09:17,170 --> 01:09:21,970
Okay. So here's some, some terminology that I use and there'll be a whole lot more.

533
01:09:22,330 --> 01:09:29,590
I didn't put a book chapter for this review, meaning you've had.

534
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:46,900
So in terms of the depth of the knowledge that I want you to learn, I will have some review information for you in the future.

535
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:50,800
But this can get really, really detailed.

536
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:54,580
And I would just wanted to give you an overview here for this foundational information,

537
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:01,180
which I do have a textbook, but it's really detailed and not necessary that you learn all of the details.

538
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:14,920
All right. So when we meet again on Thursday, read the read the paper and answer questions and be prepared to talk about the questions in class.

539
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:24,010
Okay. It's a really interesting paper about this ability of vitamin D data to regulate this antimicrobial peptide.

540
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:29,610
Okay. It's. Anybody have any questions? All right.

541
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:37,080
I will see you all on Thursday. You're welcome.

542
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:41,880
And I'll post that schedule where you can fill in when you want to give your presentation.

543
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:51,710
Okay. Yeah.
