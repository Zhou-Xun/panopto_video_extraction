1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,790
All right. Can we get our news article, folks, to come up? Tell us about.

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:30,780
I go in. There we go. Hi.

3
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,260
Good morning. So today we picked an article about a woman who was pregnant with her second pregnancy.

4
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:46,530
And during her third trimester, she developed symptoms of, well, just in general, lower back pain and pain near her pelvis and rectum.

5
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,639
So while she was pregnant, um, her O.B. kind of attributed that to, you know,

6
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,010
that it was her third trimester and that the pain should have stopped, you know, after she gave birth.

7
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,080
So initially they told her it was hemorrhoids.

8
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,460
Um, and she kind of didn't believe that because she had no history of hemorrhoids, especially during her first pregnancy.

9
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:18,330
And then after her delivery, her pain only worsened. So she kind of went back and forth with her doctors.

10
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:26,399
And it got to the point where they told her she needed therapy because her symptoms were psychosomatic and that it was caused

11
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,750
from stress and stress after having the baby and then also having the baby during the first couple of months of the pandemic.

12
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:46,320
So she went to her O.B. and after about nine weeks postpartum, they told her that it kind of wasn't due to her postpartum anymore.

13
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:55,170
Um, and eventually she had a colonoscopy, which revealed a large tumor that they determined was almost 100% cancer.

14
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:01,649
Um, so while she was kind of going back and forth, she was on a lot of pain meds and antibiotics.

15
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,890
So her pain didn't really register.

16
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:12,610
And she was also losing her baby weight very rapidly, which she thought might have been the breast cancer or not breast cancer.

17
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,080
The breastfeeding. Um. Sorry. Um.

18
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,580
So, yeah. Eventually it also got to the point where they told her that she needed probiotics before she had her colonoscopy.

19
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,480
Um. Yes. After all, Jews want to take probiotics.

20
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,390
It just got worse from there, actually.

21
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:40,520
So then she started to build your stool and her pain started getting to the point where she was losing function so she wasn't able to sleep.

22
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:48,260
She was just having overall daily struggles with it to the point where she was messaging her primary physician at four in the morning,

23
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:55,490
talking about her pain to which she was referred to as a beast and was prescribed antibiotics.

24
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:02,360
And this was also during the pandemic. So she was kind of thinking, okay, maybe this could be what's wrong?

25
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:09,169
Maybe it's because of the isolation of the pandemic and just all these stressors that are happening to her and having a kid as well.

26
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,200
And maybe she was thinking, maybe we're doctors, right?

27
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:19,370
She didn't want to think about intentions either. But obviously the therapy didn't help because her pain was visible.

28
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:24,530
And it wasn't until her friend actually referred her to a GI doctor to which she

29
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:30,530
decided to go that route after her primary physician and countless other doctors.

30
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:36,440
And so it did take her a couple of months just because of just because of her weight loss.

31
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:43,339
And so when she finally went to the doctor, he finally wasn't, okay, let's just you've done enough tests, you've done everything.

32
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:50,030
Let's just do a colonoscopy. And that's when she discovered she was stage four for colon cancer.

33
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:56,329
And it was like a huge shock to her just because she had done pelvic exams, rectal exams, ultrasounds,

34
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:02,890
X-rays, countless doctors tried everything, like just tried listening to her doctors and.

35
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,500
It wasn't until she went to a doctor because of a friend that finally care for that diagnosis.

36
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,950
So yeah. And then once they knew it was colorectal cancer, they found it and metastasized to the liver.

37
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,740
And then there was chemo and radiation and 18 hour surgery in April 2021.

38
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,390
This left her with a permanent colostomy bag. And after that, there was additional chemo.

39
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,860
There was different therapies and physical therapy to try to get back to a normal kind of lifestyle.

40
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,630
Thankfully, now that she's stable scans, there are still small tumors on her liver and they're too small to operate.

41
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:44,360
So it's going to be a battle going forward, but it's a relatively good end of the story for how bad it started.

42
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,070
Natalie's message and the reason she shared this with the news agency was try to

43
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,060
encourage people to advocate for their own health and to encourage early screening.

44
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,880
The article also talks about the increase in colorectal cancer in young people since the early nineties.

45
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:06,410
So since the early nineties, there's been a 45% increase in the number of colorectal cancer cases in people under 50 years old.

46
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,750
And the article talked about how maybe it's environmental factors such as a change in diet over time.

47
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:20,870
And the USPS task force now recommends screening at 45 years old instead of 50 years old because of this increase in earlier cases.

48
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,510
And so we chose this article to talk about because of what it highlights about the patient doctor

49
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:32,060
relationship and how the lack of trust in what a patient says could lead to an improper diagnosis,

50
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:36,620
poor treatment and an increase in physical and emotional pain for a long time.

51
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,750
And so the article also says How encourages patient advocacy for their health?

52
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:58,889
If questions or comments. So I will say that this kind of people not being taken seriously by doctors, it is a problem.

53
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:04,590
And I would say it's generally more of a problem for women and obese people.

54
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:09,350
Minorities. Right. So this is an important kind of disparities problem.

55
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,040
When we talk about cancer disparities, this is potentially one of the ways that some of that can occur.

56
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:24,050
Right. I think at first like when she first started, like the beginning of the story makes sense to me as a person who's been pregnant before.

57
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:29,850
Right. Like, okay, you know, she pelvic pain like the third trimester is just uncomfortable.

58
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:36,610
There's no two ways about it. Like having a whole person inside of you is not right and sure.

59
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,870
Right. And she's young. There's not. That is not the first thing you say.

60
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,530
Right. And but after the delivery, like, oh, now you need a therapist.

61
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:47,720
Because I just I was so mad when I read that for this poor woman.

62
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:52,139
Right. So, yeah, that's a great a great it's a great article, but good choice.

63
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,810
Good example. I think that brings up some interesting discussion. Think about.

64
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:20,150
All right. Thank you for being our pioneers. Great job. I mean, the other thing, too, is like she had a friend who could tell her about this doctor.

65
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,150
Right. There are people who don't have the health literacy or the, you know,

66
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:30,220
time to spend looking for a doctor to go to another one or the ability to advocate for themselves.

67
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,290
Like if you're not as well-educated, high as you have good insurance,

68
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,470
it's difficult to advocate to be able to go to these specialists and go to yet another doctor.

69
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:44,170
Right there is what the doctor said. You know, there is particularly among people who have lower health literacy,

70
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:51,550
there's definitely kind of this like not as much ability or willingness to advocate and to push back.

71
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:57,400
Right. And so it is a problem. What am I trying to do?

72
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:02,410
I am looking for. This.

73
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:14,549
All right. So we had done we're here, we acted, we finished group work, too.

74
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,640
And then we were going to talk about things that influence mortality.

75
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,259
We were going to go over question two. Okay.

76
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,800
So we were going to talk about did we talk about question two? Okay.

77
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:34,309
Thank you. La, la, la. This is incidents are we incidents as question to I'm sorry, mortality is question one.

78
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:40,500
That's why I'm confused. Woo All right. Assuming time.

79
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,960
Pull up the exercise. Okay.

80
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,690
All right. So the first thing you were asked to do is go to find this new cancer cases in the U.S. So again, like, what are we looking at here?

81
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:12,710
What statistic are we looking at? Just like mortality. Yeah.

82
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:22,090
It's insidious. Is this an incidence rate? No.

83
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,560
All right. First time, this is the number of people, right?

84
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:33,290
And then the proportion of those cases that are at each site. So then the question is, is this adjusted for anything?

85
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:38,210
And because it's not a rate of any kind, it's just numbers. It's not adjusted.

86
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:47,760
Right. And so then you were asked to look at this figure for males and you were asked to look kind of over the differences.

87
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,120
Anybody remember what the date range was for mortality statistics?

88
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,190
What year did we go back to? Approximately.

89
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:08,249
Yeah. In the thirties. Yeah. It was 1930. That's exactly right. And so incidence we only have 1975 and onwards.

90
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,329
So that was when we established the Seer Cancer Registry in the United States.

91
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:21,030
So the cancer registry is where we get incidence statistics. And so we will talk about how we collect the registration data in a couple of lectures.

92
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,099
But basically that's why.

93
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:29,100
Right, we've been collecting mortality statistics in this country for a long time, but the first cancer registries were established in the seventies.

94
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,860
Okay, so this is where we got incidence. So what do you guys notice here?

95
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,420
I think I specifically asked you what was going on. Let's see what I asked you.

96
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,719
Did I ask you specifically what's going on with PSA in men or with prostate cancer in men?

97
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:54,220
I gave it away. What occurred in the 1990s that drastically increase the incidence of prostate cancer.

98
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:02,400
The Senate. I mean, that looks amazing, right?

99
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:09,460
That's a huge increase. It's almost as impressive as the bone cancer PSA.

100
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:14,410
Yep. They started using PSA to screen for prostate cancer. And we'll talk about this in a little more detail later.

101
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,740
But essentially, PSA is a blood test.

102
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:24,370
It's testing for a protein, prostate specific antigen that is normally present in the prostate.

103
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:28,480
So it's not actually a cancer marker. It's a normal protein in the prostate.

104
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,709
Right. It's not supposed to be in circulation. I was supposed to be in a prostate.

105
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:36,580
So if it leaks out into circulation, that means disruption of the prostate tissue.

106
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,670
For some reason that can happen because you have cancer.

107
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,740
It can happen because you've got a proper infection. It can happen because you recently have intercourse.

108
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,909
It can happen because you rode a bike yesterday. Right. So like there's all of these.

109
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:54,310
It can happen because a man is older and has benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH.

110
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,370
Has anybody ever watched TV and seen those commercials that are like, Do you have a going problem or do you have a growing problem?

111
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:06,520
And they're like, it's like a little man made of pipes, and it's this medication that helps with urinary symptoms in older men.

112
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,470
Anybody seen those advertisements? Nobody watches TV like that anymore.

113
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:18,000
Real Netflix. So we never see commercials. Okay. So we all pay for the Hulu premium where we don't have any commercials.

114
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:24,700
Yes, I do. See. So but yeah. So there's all these it's a very common like prostate grow.

115
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,689
When men get older, it can cause your PSA to go up. It can cause urinary symptoms.

116
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,410
It's not it's really common. Like half of older men have this right.

117
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:37,120
It's not a precursor to cancer, but it can kind of cause an elevated PSA.

118
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:44,260
So the problem with PSA is it helps you catch prostate cancer for sure.

119
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:51,969
But then note how it didn't come down. What you would expect is that it would go up and then come back down to the same

120
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:57,190
levels if you were just suddenly catching some of them early and then back to normal.

121
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,839
But it stayed high. And what that means is that we're over diagnosing prostate cancer with PSA.

122
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,850
We know that we are catching cases that would never become clinically relevant in a man's lifetime.

123
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,340
So that's the the PSA issue. And we're going to talk more about that when we get to the screening lecture.

124
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:31,340
Anything else you guys noticed here that you wanted to talk about? I'll point out again, you know, we're starting in the seventies.

125
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:38,809
We've got kind of this we're past the big the big peak of the lung cancer epidemic.

126
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,320
And so it's coming down from here. Yes. With the overdiagnosis.

127
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,550
Yeah. Is that impacting their diagnosis of cancer?

128
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:55,850
Be relevant in the same. Probably not, because everybody recognizes that men live a really long time after a prostate cancer diagnosis.

129
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:02,969
And so they are still treated for a lot of the other kinds of chronic conditions that might be important.

130
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:08,130
Right. They're still getting their cholesterol checked, especially if they've been diagnosed with early prostate cancer.

131
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:13,140
These are still healthy people. Right. So they may have some sort of treatment for their prostate cancer.

132
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,020
But right now, if you are diagnosed with early prostate cancer, this like low stage, low grade,

133
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:23,360
and we'll talk about what that means a little bit more in the biology lecture, but it's markers that suggest it's not terribly aggressive.

134
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:32,180
So if you have a prostate cancer that's small and doesn't seem to be aggressive, they may not do definitive treatment.

135
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,470
The first line treatment for those cancers is now active surveillance,

136
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:43,730
meaning you just have your PSA checked like every three months or something to see if it seems like it's going up.

137
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,780
And you might get biopsies kind of frequently to kind of see what's going on,

138
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,380
but they're not going to immediately Russian and do prostatectomy like they used to.

139
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,000
Because I guess if the treatment for prostate cancer wasn't a big deal,

140
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,930
like if you took a pill and it didn't have any side effects and then you didn't have prostate cancer, we just treat everybody right.

141
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:05,829
We don't care if there's some possibility you have it, we'll go ahead and treat it.

142
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:10,180
No biggie. But it's not nothing, right? I think we talked about this.

143
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:17,049
Right. What do they say is the first line treatment for prostate cancer? It's the first thing you would do after surgery.

144
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:23,350
And there's a very important nerves that run along the prostate based on where it is anatomically.

145
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:29,490
And so if you damage those nerves, men can be incontinent and have impotence for the rest of their lives.

146
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,870
Right. So you want to take a 55, 60 year old guy who might live 31 years and tell him he has to wear a diaper and can't have sex.

147
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:39,110
That's no good. So we don't do that.

148
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,160
If we can avoid it. Okay.

149
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,950
I will say also colon cancer has been coming down. That is an example of a cancer where we have.

150
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:59,130
So prostate cancer, the incidence went up when we introduced a new screening test because we were screening for early cancer.

151
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:09,300
Right. And so you're catching more cases if you screen when we're screening for colon cancer, what are we hopefully screening for?

152
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:20,940
Hopefully we're screening for polyps, which are pre-cancerous lesions, and if you remove them, the person never gets cancer.

153
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:27,160
So for colon cancer, a successful screening program will decrease both mortality and incidence rate

154
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,560
because you'll take out polyps before they ever have a chance to become cancer.

155
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,530
Breast cancer is another one, worker screening for early cancer. So mammography kind of bumps up incidence.

156
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,469
But pap smears for cervical cancer, we're catching precancerous lesions, hopefully.

157
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:52,120
Right. So a successful pap smear cervical cancer screening program will decrease both incidence and mortality rate.

158
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,899
So it kind of depends. And we'll talk a little bit about this in the biology lecture,

159
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:02,560
but it kind of depends on where we're hoping to catch the disease in the natural history of its progression, what it does to our statistics.

160
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:08,390
Does that make sense? Okay.

161
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:16,709
And this is in females. What do we see here? Exciting.

162
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:30,680
Interesting. Different. No one's really in in weekday mode yet.

163
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,990
We're all still on Labor Day weekend. So you. Yes.

164
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:41,590
Like Logan broke out, broke his cancer pizza off later because Cigarets weren't advertised for women at all.

165
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:49,059
Yeah. The uptake and drop off of cigaret consumption is it's a little bit later women in time.

166
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:54,310
So yes, that's exactly right. But again, it never gets as high as a dozen men.

167
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:58,320
Right? We've got the same the same scale here.

168
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:04,000
Right. And it never gets as high as men. It's like a quarter of what the men have.

169
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,710
Right. Breast cancer, I think is interesting.

170
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:14,770
We get this little bump up here based on what I just told you. What do you suppose happened in, like the late, early eighties?

171
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:20,020
Late seventies, we started doing mammography.

172
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,740
That's exactly right. And I can't remember exactly what your if anybody feels like Googling at who's got their computer open.

173
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:31,360
I always forget exactly what year we started doing mammography screening for breast cancer, but I think it was the late seventies, early eighties.

174
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:36,820
Um, and then anybody know what happened here when we go down kind of in the early 2000s.

175
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:52,870
Big trial came out suggesting that hormone replacement therapy actually increased cardiovascular disease rather than preventing it in

176
00:18:52,870 --> 00:19:02,410
postmenopausal women and everyone threw their HRT in the trash and that actually HRT did increase breast cancer risk a little bit.

177
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,950
And so it comes down to stop using HRT.

178
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,640
And you can I mean, it's really cool that you can see it so clearly.

179
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,920
And the statistics. Yeah. How much longer?

180
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,590
But it actually did pretty quickly.

181
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,970
So the HRT is a is a pretty. I.

182
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,080
And again, I'm not a breast cancer expert. I think you have to think about kind of like where, again,

183
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,120
in the natural history of breast cancer, this is affecting post-menopausal women or taking HRT.

184
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:45,780
So probably what's happening is they've already got like a tiny cancerous lesion and the HRT is pushing it,

185
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:51,270
it's driving it and making it progress and grow. It's not initiating a tumor.

186
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:56,930
Right, because those steps are probably ten, 20 years before you have before you're diagnosed.

187
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,080
Right.

188
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:06,090
So this kind of initiating events that actually cause the transformation of normal cells to cancer cells is probably much earlier in a person's life.

189
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:12,600
But if you've already got kind of this tiny little chrono cancer, if you will,

190
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:21,420
if you have these kind of progressive exposures that can push it to grow and metastasize, then that's that's a problem, right?

191
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:37,920
That is the salary increases. I've been reading the wires, so I will say, what what is our what is the statistic we're looking at here?

192
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:52,280
And since rates and what are they adjusted for? The age adjusted?

193
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:58,860
That's correct. So the population living longer, people living longer is taken into account in these statistics.

194
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,990
So that's not it's a good thing to be thinking about, but that doesn't explain what you're seeing here.

195
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:10,230
Because these are age adjusted. Okay.

196
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:22,480
Great. All right. So when we think about what factors influence cancer incidence, we think about all kinds of different things, right?

197
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:27,700
We think about prevalence of the risk factors in the population. So how is the prevalence of a risk factor changed over time?

198
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:36,020
That could change the incidence over time. And that's kind of what we're talking about with, for example, smoking changing, right?

199
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:42,009
The prevalence of smoking changed over time. So lung cancer rates changed over time, the use of HRT changed over time.

200
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:51,490
And so breast cancer changed a change in population susceptibility or a changing environment which a protective factor, right.

201
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:58,149
You can also have the way we screen or better diagnostic techniques over time finding more cancers.

202
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,170
Right. You can have also a change in classification or registration.

203
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,950
This is not something that we see a lot in cancer.

204
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:13,029
I can't think of a really good example for cancer, but there have been other diseases for sure where this is a big, important thing.

205
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:17,620
So can anybody think of a disease where we were a condition where we've changed,

206
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:22,450
how we define it over time and it seems like it has changed, but the incidence of it has changed a lot.

207
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,430
I hesitate to call because I'm thinking of a disease. But.

208
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:43,440
So the example I'm thinking of is autism spectrum disorder, for example.

209
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:49,250
It used to seem very, very rare. Now it's very, very common.

210
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:54,320
And you'll hear people go, Oh, my God, we have this huge epidemic of autism. I'm like, Well, right.

211
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:01,399
Except, you know, in the seventies, people, only kids who have like very severe symptoms,

212
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,680
like kids were non-verbal or who had very obvious stimming kinds of things.

213
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:11,419
Right. Were called autistic. And then we recognize that it's a spectrum, right?

214
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:19,520
And so people who are much more have much more mild kind of symptoms versus people who have very, you know, more severe symptoms.

215
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:25,640
All of them are now kind of under this umbrella. Right. And so it looks like so many more people have it.

216
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,620
But that's because we're recognizing the spectrum of of the condition.

217
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:36,890
And we're calling people Einstein, who were not defined as such when I was a kid.

218
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,880
Probably. Right. Does that make sense? That's an example.

219
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:51,450
All right. So let's think about major causes, right? We talked about how the prevalence of risk factors changing can change incidence.

220
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:55,330
So what are some of the major causes of cancer? What would you say?

221
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,499
We've already talked about some of them. Smoking number, woman to woman.

222
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,290
Easy one. Exposure to the sun.

223
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,510
Yes, absolutely. Certain infectious agents.

224
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,670
Absolutely. Yes. And I will add to your son, I will add tanning beds.

225
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:21,000
So U.V. exposure more broadly. Right. Actually, one of the biggest risk factors for melanoma is tanning bed use at a young age.

226
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:25,860
So I was super, super happy when that tanning place went away and became a coffee place.

227
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,100
It was like, yes, we need more coffee last year.

228
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:33,080
And then. Obesity, maybe.

229
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,629
Is that what you're going to say? And of course, we're going to talk about this, an obvious obesity lecture.

230
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:46,459
But it's really difficult to disentangle body size from physical activity, from diet quality,

231
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:51,740
from all of the different kinds of social experiences that people in larger bodies have.

232
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:55,730
Right. And so it's a it's a big tangled web.

233
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:01,610
So it's very easy to say, oh, obesity. But, you know, we'll talk about that.

234
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:05,530
I think it's more complicated than that. So.

235
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:13,900
Yes, absolutely. All right. So annual number of cancer deaths attributable to smoking by sex insights from 2000 to 2004.

236
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:19,450
So these are a little bit old now, but I think it is still fairly representative, right?

237
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:27,550
A good proportion. So the black is the proportion that are attributable to cigaret smoking of that cancer and the blue are those that are not so lung.

238
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,520
You've got males and females separately. Here's a lung. Of course, the vast majority of them are due to smoking.

239
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:37,719
But, you know, oropharynx and larynx, esophagus, a big chunk are smoking.

240
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:43,500
Related bladder, a big chunk. Pancreas and stomach.

241
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:48,840
Right. So smoking actually causes a lot of different cancers, not just the kind of big ones we think about.

242
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:57,479
Here's another risk factor that's changed over time. This is the proportion of adults who are obese, according to breakfast.

243
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:03,799
Who knows what purposes? This is a behavioral risk factor surveillance system.

244
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:08,030
It's a big nationwide survey of risk factors that's done every year by CDC.

245
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:17,360
It's a phone survey. And so essentially, if you compare, what, 1995 to 2010, you can see that BMI has increased over time in the U.S.

246
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:29,050
Okay. So this is from the ACR.

247
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,930
So ACR is the American Institute for Cancer Research. They're very diet focused.

248
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:39,680
I've been to their meeting before. It's very interesting. They have a lot of nutritionists who go and people like who work with cancer patients.

249
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:45,590
So it's a very interesting meeting. Lots of diet and cancer related research, physical activity and cancer related research.

250
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:52,220
I will tell you that they do. They're sponsored by like the Walnut Foundation or something.

251
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:58,460
And so they'll give you lunch, but it's like there's walnuts and everything.

252
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:03,980
So my friend and I left and like went and got a burger because we just couldn't take the walnuts anymore.

253
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:09,770
So it's like extremely healthy. But if you want, like, something really yummy, you're going to have to, like, sneak out and go get a different lunch.

254
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:16,730
But yeah, I couldn't take the walnuts and everything anymore, but it's a fun meeting.

255
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,850
It's actually a cool meeting. It's usually in D.C. every year anyway.

256
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:28,220
So this is a little graphic from them suggesting what proportion of cancers can be prevented by staying lean, eating smart and moving more?

257
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,040
These are HPV associated cancers. This is data from 2009.

258
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,840
So HPV related oropharynx cancer has actually increased in men since then.

259
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,530
But you can see that overall in men, it's almost not informative to look at it.

260
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:56,879
Overall, it's really important to look at it by sex. But you can see in men, the vast majority of HPV related cancers are oropharynx cancers.

261
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,070
So that's one of the head and neck cancers that we're going to hear about from the surgeon who's going to come talk to us.

262
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:09,510
And then there's anus and penis cancers as well that make up a small proportion of HPV related cancers in men and women.

263
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:19,140
Of course, the biggest chunk is cervical cancer, but there's still some anal and oropharynx cancers as well as vulvar, both over cancers in women.

264
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:25,260
And a tiny, tiny fraction of vaginal cancers, which is really, really kind of a weird, rare cancer.

265
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,860
So I think this is interesting. This is what we always see.

266
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,880
Right. We see this leading causes of death in the U.S. in whatever year.

267
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:41,480
This is all at this point. It's from 2000. But the point is from this article, and I think the point is really well made.

268
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:45,770
So this is what we're showing, right? Heart disease, cancer, stroke and all these other causes.

269
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:49,460
But these are really the actual causes of death. Right.

270
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:55,760
If you wanted to intervene and change these, those are the things you would have to change.

271
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,010
And I thought that was an interesting way of displaying.

272
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:11,130
Compared to what we usually see. Any thoughts on that?

273
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:24,640
All right. So now we're going to work on question three. I know some of the groups started on that last week.

274
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:29,560
This time you're going to be looking at racial, ethnic differences and you're going to be using SEER data.

275
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:39,120
So you're going to be going to a different website. And that will take at least ten, 15 minutes, probably all come around.

276
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:42,659
I don't know. Sometimes you guys are speedy. Sometimes you're taking your time.

277
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:47,020
So I'll let you know when I've got about 5 minutes left based on how I was doing.

278
00:29:52,330 --> 00:30:08,170
Anybody need help planning their group? It's for no reason.

279
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:24,130
Because you must be thinking. So there's a take when we're with.

280
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,780
And I'm sorry to eavesdrop, but I'm really glad to hear about that.

281
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:38,750
Actually, I thought about you over the weekend, and I think the thing is, it's like your it connects to your phone.

282
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:43,550
Yeah. So I was like walking around and I'm like, it happens with me right now.

283
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:50,780
But it wasn't. But it was. But it was like, is it here?

284
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:55,880
Oh, is it? Yes. I really like that with my dad at that time.

285
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:04,640
It's like what is left behind. That's like yelling at me.

286
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:20,960
This item left behind. And I get. I makes sense to take the.

287
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,590
And the timeline back to 1989. So. Yeah, that's right.

288
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:47,200
Yeah. There you go. Yeah, that's right.

289
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,530
That's right. I it's like, all right for everybody, you know?

290
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:57,140
I think it's something. I think that's right. Yeah.

291
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:04,730
So the timeline that there's like a tab in like the dark area where the topics of long term trends,

292
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:08,880
you'll have to click that and then it'll go back to 1975 as opposed.

293
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:27,280
I'm sure it won't. I probably need to ask you a favor.

294
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:33,140
Guys, come over here.

295
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:49,889
Yeah. We'll look at that in 1/2. Okay. Let's let's see.

296
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:53,930
We're going to Italy, Ali. You're going to go in group six.

297
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,749
So, hey, guys, where's group six? Oh, Joshua.

298
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:01,770
John, is that you guys? You're six. That's your group Italy.

299
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:09,030
And then Amber, we're going to stick you in group and way three lets you guys back for three.

300
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,130
Alexander, Amber, Mariam, that's gone.

301
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:21,570
That's out. There you go. All right.

302
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:25,800
And then so you guys for the. Yeah, for the news article.

303
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:35,460
Yeah. If you go to the first class, the introduction class, there's a link here to the sign up and you can go ahead and sign up for a date.

304
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:43,830
We want 2 to 3 people for each date, so maybe you guys can both sign up for the third or something like that and then does that make sense?

305
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:47,070
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

306
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,990
Yeah. So you're offering. Oh, okay. Oh, yeah.

307
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:08,000
I realize you're not doing this. I'm. Yeah, I know.

308
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:24,090
It's. You'll have to write down your description of speak.

309
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:30,760
Yeah, I agree with that. And you can even get a translator talking on language, right?

310
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:37,200
Isn't that a weighted average? No, I'm.

311
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:42,520
I sit down and time.

312
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:57,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I wait for that?

313
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:12,530
Before you go, he has to go for $9.

314
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:20,650
I feel like you like playing Ivan on that.

315
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:31,640
Yes. I actually think wrong.

316
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:43,220
20. So in the.

317
00:35:47,670 --> 00:36:02,240
I got my notes. This is the best one right now.

318
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:09,130
And I'm yelling in the back to.

319
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:25,230
Yeah. I just don't want to see it right now.

320
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:36,870
I've gotten to that point. This one is going to track almost every day.

321
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:57,210
So it ends up being like, yeah, like I'm like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

322
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:04,290
I was who I was your temperament. Well, yeah.

323
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:15,140
So I think I'll probably gonna go through.

324
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:21,930
So I know I know what's going on, but it's not it's really not that bad.

325
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:34,710
You know, he's like, yeah. So it's like, kind of like, like looking for something.

326
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:39,530
Okay. I was excited. Yeah.

327
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,499
I'm the civil discourse and the fighting is.

328
00:37:43,500 --> 00:38:04,130
Is like. I just with words that reminds me.

329
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:10,330
How many groups are still working? Are you on a B?

330
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,250
Who's on A? Who's on B?

331
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:20,470
Okay, five more minutes, guys. We're going to come back with, like ten, 14 or something.

332
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:25,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

333
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:39,020
But how? I mean, definitely your work.

334
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:49,130
He's not going to show up.

335
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:10,710
Yeah. Yeah. Know, I write about it because I was.

336
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:16,180
But. That's right.

337
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:25,750
Yeah. So I'm trying to squeeze in this type of activity that will satisfy members.

338
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:36,620
First person I know. What? Yeah.

339
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:41,250
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

340
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:46,390
That's not really like that. Sometimes it was like.

341
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:54,350
Right, exactly. I mean, I think if you're like.

342
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:17,560
I was. Only because we know it's a super, super, super duper elusive set of twins.

343
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:25,290
That is the number one comment. Just like that, it's not just like zero.

344
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:37,170
This is going to last.

345
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:46,290
You know. That's.

346
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:54,520
Yeah. I was.

347
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:05,470
There really was. You know, it's like.

348
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:35,340
All right. I hear a lot of like, who knows? We're ready.

349
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,520
All right. We'll go ahead and talk about it.

350
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:45,570
So I asked you to go ahead and look here at incidence and mortality for breast cancer in black and white women separately.

351
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:51,120
So up here, you could change it to incidence mortality. We're going to see higher incidence.

352
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:55,110
Now, it defaults to recent trends, which only goes back to the year 2000.

353
00:41:55,650 --> 00:42:02,910
And interestingly, if you do that, you can see that there is a lot more racial ethnic categories available to you if you use those more recent trends.

354
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:10,470
That's because, as we'll see in our registration lecture series, started off with only certain sites and they really focused on black and white,

355
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:15,990
and then they added sites in such a way that they were able to capture different racial ethnic groups.

356
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:21,629
So they added sites, for example, in Native American reservation areas,

357
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:26,880
right where they added California and Hawaii, which included quite a lot of Asians.

358
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:34,050
Right? So and Hispanics. So they tried to pick geographic areas of the country that would allow them to

359
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:38,670
capture different racial ethnic groups better than what they had started with,

360
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:43,640
essentially. But they did start one of the earliest ones was the Detroit Seer,

361
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:52,860
and it until recently was kind of the the seer site that included the vast majority of African-Americans in the database.

362
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:58,110
So we get a lot of our information on African-American cancer from the Detroit registry.

363
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:07,680
Okay. So if we go to long term trends now, we can see if we go back to 1975 and you've got black and white without Hispanic separately.

364
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:16,380
This allows you to see two separate lines for men and women. But what we want to do is compare by race, ethnicity.

365
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,700
I'm going to get rid of the red line, which is all races,

366
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:26,160
because it tends to kind of track along with the white and just kind of muddy things up when we want to compare black and white.

367
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,180
Okay. And then. I always lose it.

368
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:36,010
Where is it? Where do I pick?

369
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,860
Up here. I see. I think this is so dumb. It's like in the wrong place.

370
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:45,330
I expect it to be over here and I always spend at least 10 seconds looking for it.

371
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,820
So here's where you pick your cancer that you're interested in.

372
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:53,510
And we can do breast and it defaults to female.

373
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:59,959
You can see it doesn't actually include men in the breast cancer statistics because

374
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,590
male breast cancer is much more rare and it's really kind of a different disease.

375
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:07,129
Like you really don't want to include it with female breast cancer. It's really almost a separate cancer.

376
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:11,420
It has totally different causes and everything else. Okay, so here we go.

377
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,959
We've got long term trends comparing white and black women.

378
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,140
The white women are in green here and the black women are in blue.

379
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:32,560
So how would you guys describe what you see here? Historically who have higher incidence black or white women.

380
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,070
White women until more recently in the 2000. They kind of converged.

381
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:42,379
Right. And it looks like white women are a little bit higher.

382
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:46,400
But I bet if you put confidence intervals around that they would overlap and it's pretty much the same.

383
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:50,479
Okay. So historically, white women have higher incidence of breast cancer,

384
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:58,280
but more recently the lines have converged on black and white incidence rates are very similar is how I would describe this.

385
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:04,460
Does anybody disagree or do you have a different thought if you interpret it differently or do you feel good about that?

386
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:14,320
Okay. Now we're going to go to mortality and we have a different picture.

387
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:19,930
Right since. So, again, black women here are in blue.

388
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:32,200
White women are in green since the early 1990s, late 1980s, while both black and white women have had decreasing mortality from breast cancer,

389
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:41,020
white women have pretty consistently had better survival or black women have worse mortality from breast cancer.

390
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,780
Would you guys agree with that assessment, despite having had it be flipped?

391
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:52,000
Right. For a long time, white men have higher incidence, but much lower mortality.

392
00:45:53,320 --> 00:46:02,440
Right. And now, even though the incidence is similar, mortality still remains much higher in black women.

393
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:10,420
So this is an example of a very important racial disparity that we're still trying to address in cancer research.

394
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:18,550
So what are some reasons that you think this disparity could exist?

395
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:24,480
The hospital's access to hospitals. Access to care?

396
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:29,730
Sure. Because if the incidence is the same, but mortality has worse than treatment could be worse.

397
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:34,830
What else? Yeah, like, who cares?

398
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:46,120
Serious? Yeah, sure. So, like overt discrimination or stigma or racism in the in the health care setting, for sure.

399
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:56,510
Yeah. So if you are if you have what we don't see in the incidents picture is stage a diagnosis.

400
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:02,610
Right. And so if you don't get screened, if you have less access to screening and you get diagnosed at a later stage,

401
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,140
your outcome would be worse even if you got the same care. Right.

402
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:19,530
For me, general health literacy and being able to like without being able to advocate.

403
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:26,129
So there is intersection between socioeconomic status, education level and race right now.

404
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:29,910
So there could be some something going on there maybe.

405
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,610
Yes, 100%. Absolutely right.

406
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:43,050
Medical mistrust and therefore, very valid medical mistrust.

407
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:48,600
Right. I mean, you guys have probably heard about a lot of sort of the terrible injustices that have happened.

408
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:52,440
Right. But number one, that always comes to my mind, of course, is the Tuskegee study.

409
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:58,260
I was actually I have colleagues from Finland that I saw had a cancer meeting.

410
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:03,899
And I think I was presenting a paper that had some sort of racial disparity angle to it at the at the meeting.

411
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:09,160
And they were like, why, you know, why would black people not go to the doctor?

412
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,679
Because that was part of the discussion of why would black people in your country not not seek medical care?

413
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:20,129
Why would they distrust? And I was like, Oh, Sweets, our children don't because they didn't know, right,

414
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:24,270
that they're not from the U.S. They don't kind of understand the cultural background that I told them about the Tuskegee story.

415
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:28,139
They were they were right. They were there like when was this? In the 1970s.

416
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:37,220
And they were absolutely horrified. But, you know, it's interesting to talk to people who are kind of outside of our culture around race.

417
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:42,480
Right. And have that discussion with them. I thought that was that was an interesting point of view for me.

418
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,500
Right. And it's a bit of an aside, but yeah.

419
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:52,560
So all of those things you came up with are plausible. I will tell you, I'll go back to my presentation for you.

420
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:58,950
I will tell you here, if you look at the proportion, this is from 2010, so a little bit older.

421
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:04,830
But if you look at the proportion of women 40 and older, so people who are in the age range who should be getting screened,

422
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:07,800
who've had their mammogram within the past year or within the past two years.

423
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:13,620
If you look and compare African-American to white women, tell me what you're seeing.

424
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:26,930
Very, very similar. Yeah. Black women are getting their mammograms. So that's not, you know, the issue now.

425
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:29,060
Is it the same quality of care?

426
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:35,300
Is there that, you know, are they going to the same quality of hospital where they're getting the same kind of person reading?

427
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:40,279
Reading they're really reading the mammogram, I don't know. But they're getting them right.

428
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:46,430
So there that's not a huge driver of this disparity, probably.

429
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:55,970
Stage distribution. Now, if we just look at female breast cancer, despite the fact that black women are getting their mammograms,

430
00:49:56,570 --> 00:50:04,850
they are less likely to be diagnosed at a localized stage and more likely to be diagnosed at regional or distant than white women.

431
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,020
That could be because of the quality of the mammogram they're getting.

432
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:14,300
There are also things about breast density that make mammograms potentially more difficult to read,

433
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:21,260
and breast density can be different in different racial groups. So, you know, there's kind of a lot going on here.

434
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:31,669
But despite the fact that black women are getting mammograms, they are more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage, but not like hugely.

435
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:34,670
Right. So this is probably not the entire answer, but it's a piece.

436
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:47,540
Generally I will say that cancer incidence rates superior of men and red and women in blue.

437
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:54,440
And you got non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic, black, Asian, Pacific Islander, American, Indian, Alaskan, native and Hispanic.

438
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,250
What you see here generally is, of course, that in all racial groups, men are a little bit more likely to get cancer than women.

439
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:15,860
And although incidence is I would say incidence is a bit higher among males in blacks, the incidence of females is a bit lower.

440
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:18,530
Right. A lot of this is smoking related in men.

441
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:23,030
Black men did have higher rates of smoking than white men, kind of at the height of the smoking epidemic.

442
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:29,990
Generally, Asian Pacific Islanders and Hispanics have lower rates of cancer.

443
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:34,129
And I will say that there are certain cancers where American-Indian,

444
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:37,760
Alaska natives do have higher rates, even though on this graph it looks like it's lower.

445
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:42,480
But we're starting to look at this group a bit more carefully. Hi.

446
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:51,390
But death rates, on the other hand, kind of consistently higher in both men and women in black people in this country.

447
00:51:55,610 --> 00:52:00,520
So this is if you want to generalize. If you look at individual cancer sites, you'll see slightly different things.

448
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:06,019
There are certain cancers where white people have much higher rates and worse outcomes than black people.

449
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:10,790
It's like a handful of them. For example, testicular cancer, which is.

450
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:15,309
Probably more genetic than anything else. It happens in younger men.

451
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:18,310
It's much more common in white people. Melanoma.

452
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:23,150
Well, that would make sense, right? Melanoma is very related to skin color.

453
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:26,500
Right. And if you have darker skin, you have more protection from the UV rays.

454
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:30,460
White is more likely to get one, I'm not sure. But for the most part,

455
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:37,660
racial disparities in cancer in this country are such that black people may have higher incidence or a lower incidence or are about the same,

456
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:42,520
but they definitely have worse mortality for most cancers compared to white people.

457
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:49,550
This has been changing over time, particularly for the males.

458
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:53,570
The death rate has been coming down and that's a lot. A lot of that is smoking.

459
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:58,280
A lot of this disparity was due to really high smoking rates and black men.

460
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:04,600
But. You can see that it's generally I mean, among females,

461
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,680
the death rate is higher in black women and among men, the death rate is higher in the black men.

462
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:17,440
Um, I will say this is looking at other racial groups.

463
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:23,559
I'm not going to go into this in a lot of detail. But again, Asian Pacific Islanders tend to have lower rates.

464
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:29,320
Hispanics tend to have lower rates. People call this kind the Hispanic paradox because kind of a lot of the social

465
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:34,840
things that you would imagine would be related to cancer risk are a bit you know,

466
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:39,610
you would imagine that they would go in the direction of increase in risk of Hispanic people.

467
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:47,560
Right. Some of the same socioeconomic kinds of things, some of the same kind of, you know, social exposures.

468
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:51,430
But for whatever reason, that's not really the case.

469
00:53:51,760 --> 00:54:03,370
Um, so there you go. But so that is why and for obvious like history of racism kinds of reasons, we tend to focus on white black disparities,

470
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:10,270
but people are definitely interested in Hispanic health and that kind of thing and people who are interested in that, it's very important.

471
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,950
We tend to lump Hispanics together into one group. Right.

472
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:17,319
And it's not right.

473
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:25,150
There's there's Puerto Rican, there's Cuban, there's Mexican, there's Central American and all these different kinds of Hispanic or Latino Latina.

474
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:33,639
But, you know, for the purposes of our statistics and our census, we kind of tend to lump them all together in one group.

475
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:37,900
And really, people who are interested in this topic tend to split them apart and look at them separately,

476
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:40,509
because there are genetic differences, there are cultural differences.

477
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:44,049
And so if you really want to drill down into that, and that's an area you're interested in,

478
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:46,780
that is something that people tend to to look at in more detail.

479
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:52,000
Another thing that we're really interested in is Middle Eastern North African health, right?

480
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:59,350
So we have one of the largest Arab-American populations in the country here in Michigan, you know, concentrated around Dearborn.

481
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:03,520
And so this is an area that a lot of people in the School of Public Health are very interested in.

482
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:08,320
But like, what line would MENA people be in on this graph?

483
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:16,280
What box would you take? White right.

484
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,910
Facial expression? Yes. We're all very annoyed by the fact that the box is white.

485
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:26,990
So we're actually starting a big study in Michigan trying to recruit 100,000 people between the ages of 25 and 44.

486
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:34,730
And we have a very detailed racial question that asks specifically about Middle East, North African race, ethnicity questions.

487
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,020
Try to look at that because it's a very it's a growing group in this country.

488
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:46,440
It's an important group in Michigan. And, you know, it's a it's an increasing group.

489
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:51,090
And we can't study that because we don't have data on none of the census,

490
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:55,380
none of the serious statistics, none of that separates them out from white people.

491
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:57,390
So you can't really study it very well.

492
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:05,050
Some people come up with like last name algorithms to try to pull out Middle Eastern North African people from the white group.

493
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:09,630
It's not ideal, right? It's better than nothing, but it's not great.

494
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:15,120
So. Relative survival rates by race.

495
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:24,680
So we talked about how overall things have gotten better over time, particularly for some sites like breast and some other ones are less great.

496
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:29,090
Like we've made some progress with liver, but it's still pretty dismal.

497
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,970
Pancreas is still kind of dismal, right.

498
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:40,069
But if you look at the differences, you know, improvements have been made overall in both white and black people,

499
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:43,820
but still remains better in white people kind of across the board,

500
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:52,070
even though survival has improved and both it remains better in white people than white people.

501
00:56:53,980 --> 00:57:00,730
And that's true for lots of these cancers. So if you actually look at it, this is in men.

502
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:06,700
If you look at the African-American rate and the white rate for various cancers, if you compare them and get a ratio,

503
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:11,170
it's, you know, black men are like two and a half times more likely to get prostate cancer than white men.

504
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:18,430
So that's one of the biggest ones. And then you can kind of go down here, stomach, larynx for most of them, higher in black people than white people.

505
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:23,550
Then you've got this kind of these kind of like melanoma, for example, that I told you about.

506
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:39,490
And this is the same same idea in women. So this is a theme that we're going to be talking about throughout the class.

507
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:50,250
And as I said, some of this difference between the men has been because cigaret smoking has come down quite a bit and black men in this country.

508
00:57:50,260 --> 00:58:01,120
Right. Another risk factor difference is that overweight and obesity, this is especially in adolescents, is more common in black people.

509
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:11,530
But again, we're going to talk more about that. As I keep alluding to, I think a lot of public health has basically been like, well,

510
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:16,150
having high BMI is associated with all these different things and therefore being fat is bad.

511
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:27,970
Like, okay, but as we're going to talk about in the obesity lecture, like why there is some biologic rationale behind more fat tissue being bad.

512
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:35,490
But even if that's true, we've just seen it go up and up and up.

513
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:36,719
And I guarantee you,

514
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:45,300
there's not a single person who's overweight or obese in this country who hasn't internalized the message that it would be better if they were thin.

515
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:48,810
Right. Everyone gets it. They've all heard it, right?

516
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:54,570
No one is like not getting the message. No one is not being shamed about it and it's not working.

517
00:58:55,320 --> 00:59:00,990
We don't have an intervention to offer people. That leads to a long term, sustainable weight loss.

518
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:07,300
So what does harping on it do?

519
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:15,430
It causes stigma. It causes depression. It causes all of these different things that causes, you know, health care systems not to take them seriously.

520
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:21,490
Right. So, you know, what we're doing isn't working, is my point.

521
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,870
Right. What we're doing is not working.

522
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:28,270
We don't have something that works to offer people to help them lose lose large amounts of weight and keep it off.

523
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:37,420
That actually works. So maybe we should start thinking about what you can offer them and maybe treating them with some

524
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:41,500
more dignity and respect and having the health care system take them more seriously in the meantime.

525
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:49,900
Right. And stop shaming everybody about it. That's kind of my thought process and where we're going to go with that obesity lecture.

526
00:59:53,220 --> 01:00:00,490
All right. There's also a lot of intersection between race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, insurance status.

527
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:03,630
Right. And so, you know, this is old.

528
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:08,850
This is pre Affordable Care Act. We had quite a few uninsured people.

529
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,880
But, you know, this is the problem.

530
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:18,870
The Affordable Care Act was trying to at least partially deal with is that this is like workers earnings tracking with inflation over time,

531
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:26,750
but this is health insurance premiums over time. You know, those of you who are really interested in like what a.

532
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:34,069
Upper management kind of stuff, right? This is this is your jam and it really matters.

533
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:37,940
Right? So this is colorectal cancer survival among patients by insurance status.

534
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:43,700
So you can see here. So this is the proportion who survive over time.

535
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:48,200
So you start with everybody alive and then people die over time and more people are

536
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,230
dying and the uninsured in Medicaid groups than in the private insurance group.

537
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:56,960
So it really does matter. Yes. Oh, I was wondering, you know, why like Medicaid.

538
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:03,500
Yeah. So the uninsured. Does anybody know before I answer, does anybody have an idea?

539
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:12,710
Yeah this is just honestly a gas of maybe some people are uninsured and and insurance but.

540
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:16,310
And who are those people? If you. There you go.

541
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:20,170
I'm just thinking about you. That's exactly right. Like super wealthy people.

542
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:28,300
So most of the uninsured are kind of people who fall in that gap, who don't quite make it to Medicaid, but who are not wealthy.

543
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:32,480
Right. And maybe don't have private insurance because they don't have that kind of job.

544
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:39,230
But there's a subset of uninsured people who are like super wealthy and they can just pay.

545
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,040
Hey, I guess. What's that like? Whoa.

546
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:46,980
But they're like, I don't need you for insurance. If I get sick, I'll just pay. Okay.

547
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:51,470
Lucky you. So that's. That's so that's what some of that is.

548
01:01:54,530 --> 01:02:01,920
All right. So that is our racial despair. The one thing I will say that I didn't touch on is part of the racial disparity issue with breast cancer.

549
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:06,590
Did anybody see when you were picking breast that you could pick some of these other subtypes of breast cancer?

550
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:12,440
So you know what those are? Okay.

551
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:15,200
So when they when they look at the breath, you've got breast cancer,

552
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:20,840
they take the tissue out and they look at it and they can test whether it has these hormone receptors in the tumor tissue.

553
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,219
So they're they're not together the are the hormone receptor.

554
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:30,470
So they're lumping together estrogen and progesterone receptors there. But they test e r PR and HER2.

555
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:34,040
HER2 positive tumors used to have a very poor prognosis.

556
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:41,000
But we now have a drug called Herceptin that particularly binds to her two receptor that's actually really effective.

557
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:44,300
So we have a good target of therapy for HER2 positive tumors.

558
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:50,720
They're really inherently more aggressive. But because we have this treatment, people now do quite well who have HER2 positive tumors.

559
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:55,850
If you are PR and you are a PR positive or in this case what they're calling

560
01:02:56,330 --> 01:03:01,549
hormone receptor positive tumors also tend to generally have a better prognosis.

561
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:08,540
And we have some targeted treatments that work for them. The each are negative or two negative.

562
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:12,920
Those are what we call triple negative. They're negative for er PR and HER2.

563
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:15,470
That means we have no targeted therapies for them.

564
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:24,049
Most of the traditional risk factors that we're going to learn about for breast cancer are not risk factors for the risk factors that we know about,

565
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:29,030
like the smoking, all the reproductive risk factors.

566
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:33,080
Those are for the the hormone receptor positive tumors.

567
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:41,010
And these triple negative are much more aggressive and they're much more common in black women.

568
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:50,730
So here, this is triple negative. You can see the black women are in green and the white women are in yellow are okay.

569
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:57,239
And so HER2 positive HER2 excuse me, triple negative tumors are much more common in black.

570
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,960
On black women are much more likely to be diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer.

571
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:07,889
We don't know why people have done do. You are trying to find a genetic reason, all kinds of stuff.

572
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:18,230
We don't have a reason yet why that happens. And that's a big part of breast cancer research is trying to understand triple negative breast cancer,

573
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:22,940
find treatments for it, but also figure out why it happens and why it's more common with black women.

574
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:25,670
So part of this that the black women are getting their mammograms,

575
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:31,160
but they're being diagnosed with higher stage tumors is in part because they tend to have this more aggressive subtype.

576
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:39,330
And it remains one of those mysteries that we're still working on.

577
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:51,750
Any questions about that? All right.

578
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:55,080
So in our last few minutes, I'm going to talk a little bit about geographic variations.

579
01:04:56,610 --> 01:05:02,700
So there are some geographic patterns in even within the U.S. in some of these things.

580
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:07,080
So these are death rates. In colorectal cancer, you can see it's kind of higher in the middle here.

581
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:16,530
Males and females separately. And again, keep in mind that these risk factors are different across the across the country, too.

582
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:22,600
So there's the proportion of. You can see it sort of mirrors that colorectal cancer death rate.

583
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:27,090
Right. The other thing that might sort of mirror here is lung cancer.

584
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:33,780
You can see again, you've got that sort of this hotspot sort of in the same area with lung cancer death rates.

585
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:47,550
And this is smoking. So, you know, keep in mind, we're talking about often when we talk about smoking success, people say, oh, about 20% of us smokes.

586
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:51,389
But that's we're going to be in the smoking lecture. We're going to talk in more detail about that.

587
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:57,420
That's not a monolith, right? There are places in the U.S. where more people are smoking, more and more young people are smoking.

588
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:03,360
There are places where more people are obese and perhaps, you know,

589
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:10,100
state health departments can target interventions to their own populations where these kinds of things remain a problem more than other places.

590
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:12,929
Right. Some of this is because of policies. Right.

591
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:22,470
So why do you suppose smoking you know, this is back in 2003, but I think it probably remains color wise, similar in terms of the heat map.

592
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:28,140
Why do you think smoking is more common in those areas?

593
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:36,070
Laws that are less restrictive, laws less restrictive. Why red states?

594
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:39,880
Usually red states, but also what are they used to do? They're tobacco.

595
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:45,040
Yeah, they're farmed tobacco there. Have you ever driven through North Carolina where I'm 85.

596
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:53,440
You pass Winston-Salem, North Carolina. It's a city name, but it's also the name of Cigarets.

597
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:58,780
You pass the Philip morris plant. Right. I mean, so this is where they used to grow and manufacture cigarets.

598
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:05,079
And so, of course, the tobacco companies had more of a pull with the local government, the state governments there.

599
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:12,930
And so tobacco control policies have been less strict compared to something like New York, California, where they have these incredibly high taxes.

600
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:17,610
Right. This is like the.

601
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:24,330
Many, many diseases and also. It does.

602
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:31,620
100%, yes. Yeah. And it's not as simple as they're making it sound, but part of it is the policies have been lagging in those areas.

603
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:38,609
Part of it is that you have socioeconomic status, you have education, you have all kinds of things that that overlap.

604
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:45,930
Right. And those things are all different. There's intersections between all of these things, and it's different across the U.S. in a lot of ways.

605
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:52,400
Absolutely true. Okay.

606
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:59,210
So yeah, so there's geographic stuff is different. We're going to talk about it as we talk about different risk factors in more detail.

607
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:07,459
But um, the interventions for some of these things might be different not only on a national level,

608
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:11,090
but maybe on a state by state or even a locality by locality kind of level.

609
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:20,970
All right. Now, one thing we're not going to talk about in great detail in this class is cancer in children and adolescents.

610
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:27,420
It's kind of a different ballgame than it is for adult cancers, much less common.

611
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:32,490
And we tend to do pretty well at treating these cancers compared to adult cancers.

612
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:38,100
But I do think it's important to kind of just understand what's been going on.

613
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:42,510
So although incidence has gone up a tiny bit over time. I mean, look at the scale here.

614
01:08:42,510 --> 01:08:48,900
It looks it looks like it's going up. But this is very this is small small differences.

615
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:52,560
Right. Mortality has been going down.

616
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:58,770
Right. So we've done a pretty quite a good job at coming up with treatments for many of these cancers.

617
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:05,640
I will say that the most common cancers in children are very different than the most common cancers in adults.

618
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:12,719
So you're going to get leukemia, brain cancers, Hodgkin's lymphoma, rhabdomyosarcoma.

619
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:16,190
You're going to get a lot of these sarcomas like muscle and bone tumors.

620
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:22,260
Right? So these are pretty uncommon in adults, but these are the most common cancers in kids.

621
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:28,920
So it's just a totally different list in children and adolescents than it is in adults.

622
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:34,740
Also, the rates are really tiny compared to adults, so these are actually difficult to study.

623
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:38,400
Because they're so uncommon. Right.

624
01:09:38,410 --> 01:09:45,670
So studying childhood cancer is is a really difficult proposition because there are so few thankfully, there are so few cases.

625
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:49,299
Right. But it's really difficult to study to get enough cases together to study it.

626
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:54,470
Yeah. Yes.

627
01:09:54,530 --> 01:10:02,629
A lot of these are probably generic, but of course, there are kind of profound exposures that can increase certain cancer risk,

628
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:09,320
like radiation exposure, for example, and like personal survivors and things like that has been shown to increase childhood cancers.

629
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:14,960
So there are definitely environmental exposures that are important,

630
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:20,450
but I agree with you that generally genetics plays a strong role in these cancers as well.

631
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:29,260
So children and adolescents are usually defined thusly.

632
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:39,790
Children are 0 to 14 adolescents or 15 to 19. So that's kind of the NCI definition of childhood cancer versus adolescent cancer.

633
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,810
And sometimes they even break down the kids into like young kids and older kids.

634
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:49,330
But generally, the children's cancers are brain leukemia and soft tissue.

635
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:55,170
Adolescence is leukemia, brain and bone. So just.

636
01:10:55,290 --> 01:11:01,620
Just just to know that, like, have some idea of what the most common cancers get are in kids in adolescence,

637
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:07,590
and that they are very different than the most common cancers in adults. That's kind of what I would want you to take away from this.

638
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:14,050
Relative survival rates are really pretty good, right?

639
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:22,250
We're looking at 87, 75%. Now, obviously, the people whose kids fall in this 25% are not agreeing with me.

640
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:29,530
Right. But for you know, for cancer, this is not bad.

641
01:11:31,710 --> 01:11:42,470
For all sites, right? The trouble is, the thing we worry about and where a lot of research is for childhood cancer is survivorship.

642
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:46,730
So these kids survive this, but then they've got their whole life ahead of them.

643
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:53,720
And what we found out is that a lot of the chemotherapies and stuff that you give people when they're children can be kind of toxic.

644
01:11:54,680 --> 01:12:00,830
Like later on, heart problems after receiving these kinds of treatments for cancer is that is a big issue.

645
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,690
Also, second cancers, right?

646
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:07,670
So if they did have some sort of genetic predisposition, we're going to learn that having another cancer later could be a real risk.

647
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:13,010
Also, like radiation therapy, radiation gives cancer, right?

648
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:21,020
So if you had a more kind of broad spectrum sort of radiation therapy, you could actually be at risk of second cancers from the radiation.

649
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:25,680
So like with like, you know, they know that.

650
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:31,490
You're so. It's just like.

651
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:35,840
Cost benefit. Risk evaluation.

652
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:42,889
Yeah. I mean, I think now that they know that. So you had to have some group of I'm not a child care expert,

653
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:50,150
but in order to know that you had to have some group of kids survive long enough that they got to middle age, and then you realized, oh, crud.

654
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:53,990
The ones that got this dose of this medicine are the ones that are more like, you know what I mean?

655
01:12:54,290 --> 01:12:59,660
And so then if you if you come up with other drugs that don't have that effect, you could use those instead.

656
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:05,150
I am sure there are cases where they try those and they don't work and then they have to bring out the real big guns.

657
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:13,250
And at some point you don't get to worry about whether you have heart disease in middle age if you don't think it's middle age.

658
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:17,650
Right. So is there a lot of research? There is some.

659
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:24,080
Yeah, it is. That is one of I wouldn't say it's a big chunk of the research that goes on in cancer generally.

660
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:26,420
But I will say that for childhood cancer,

661
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:36,860
like longer term survivorship and finding treatments that are less cardio toxic and that are not causing those kinds of problems is is a major focus.

662
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:48,420
Any other questions? So this is over time.

663
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:56,610
We've really done a good job, right? We actually have made some made some improvements in in in treating childhood cancer, leukemia in particular.

664
01:13:56,610 --> 01:14:01,410
We've gotten some really nice drugs. Right. So we're up to 91% compared to 58% in the seventies.

665
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:06,270
Acute myeloid leukemia, 19%, up to 64%.

666
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:11,570
So we really have made some pretty good strides with a lot of these.

667
01:14:14,190 --> 01:14:18,710
Hodgkin's disease is one that is fairly treatable, right? Even in the seventies, it was 81%.

668
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:24,690
Now we're up to 97%. So Hodgkin's lymphoma is, you know, I guess if you have to pick a lymphoma.

669
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:36,720
But it should be said that, you know, we we say, oh, survival is really good, but to get to that is no cancer treatment is fun.

670
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,399
No cancer treatment is benign. And I think we'll see some of that.

671
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:48,299
I mean, the surgeon who's going to come talk to us pretending that cancer and that's a particularly nasty one with respect to the the treatment,

672
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:53,300
because it's a lot of surgery on the face and the mouth and, you know, so it can be pretty, pretty difficult.

673
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:59,070
But even radiation therapy for that, there are some people he's going to show you like to have radiation, the head and neck.

674
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:05,250
You have to be incredibly still. So they make like this mesh mask and they actually bolt your head to the table.

675
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:09,120
And there are people who can't do that.

676
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:13,890
They can't sit there for an hour with their face bolted to the table because they're just so claustrophobic they can't do it.

677
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:17,459
I mean, it's a real I'm not making fun of that. I mean, I don't know if I could do it.

678
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:24,720
That sounds horrible. Right. So, I mean, even radiation, which we think of as being not as invasive as the surgery, for example, is not nothing.

679
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:32,309
So we kind of gloss over a lot of that in this class and we're like, Oh, they got treatment and their survival was better.

680
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:36,420
We've gotten better treatments, but the treatments are better, but they all suck, right?

681
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:39,840
They're all kind of horrible. Treatment for cancer is never a good time.

682
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:46,570
Yeah. Not the chemical makeup so much.

683
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:51,910
I think I've gotten really, really good at focusing on exactly where it needs to be.

684
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:55,090
Like they've imaged the tumor, you know, exactly where the tumor is.

685
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:59,540
They know exactly how to. I mean, these people are like physicists, right?

686
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:07,930
Like they know exactly how to kind of triangulate, to keep going through the tissues so that they're focusing all the radiation on the tumor.

687
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:15,430
And the intervening tissues aren't getting as much because they keep moving that right up, focusing, which is why you have to be incredibly stuck.

688
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:20,680
And like, for example, when they're doing breast cancer radiation, there's like a tattoo of the spot, right?

689
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:30,729
So there's all this like very, very engineering physics kind of stuff that has happened and the improvement in the technology and the equipment,

690
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:36,820
it used to be much more like, you know, the kind of arrays, the whole area there were burns and a lot more side effects.

691
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:43,090
They're still far and other tissue damage doesn't hurt. But they they really have worked to minimize that.

692
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:50,349
So it's not the chemical makeup so much as like the the precision, I guess, that has improved,

693
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:57,070
I would say, and probably optimizing the dose so you get away with the least amount possible.

694
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:03,570
That makes sense. All right.

695
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:09,900
So this is a list of kind of the resources that we use today. These are really important.

696
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:13,330
You know, I think that fear really did one thing, but that's your website.

697
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:17,479
But if you're a big nerd like me about cancer, it's actually kind of fun to go play around with like graphs,

698
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:22,000
and that can be really, really useful for presentations and stuff like that.

699
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:25,340
And if you make pictures and put them into your PowerPoint things,

700
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:33,560
if you were ever going to do a PowerPoint about a cancer, you know, someday, any questions?

701
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:38,490
Do we know who are where folks are for our news article on Thursday?

702
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:45,900
Okay. Don't forget to upload your article to internet or yes, one person per group.

703
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:53,310
Please do upload your answers to the questions and we'll put this guy up here.

704
01:17:54,090 --> 01:17:58,650
If you didn't get it and it didn't come to you, you can come to it.

705
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:03,770
Okay. Here we go. All right. See you guys Thursday. Oh.
