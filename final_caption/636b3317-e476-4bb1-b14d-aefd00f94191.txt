1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,080
Involved in a sensory experience because it's tomorrow's.

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:16,340
That's why after you look at the 1968 court ruling, there's a difference between some as you say, it's a terrible time.

3
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:21,970
It's like the evening before the last date from 5 to 6:30 p.m. That's just awful.

4
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,450
So I don't know if you've be there, but anyway.

5
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:32,530
Yeah, yes, we're talking about new. The winter conditions article will be kept for the payoff of all these natural risk factors.

6
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,310
We added dimensions that model and we looked at the cross-cultural comparison kind

7
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:40,780
of would have the prevalence of experiences that were higher from countries.

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,330
Um, I mean really tracts of prevalence, which makes sense because it's, you know, it's like the key, right?

9
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,760
But it, the prevalence is highly variable, you know, especially in Yorkshire countries.

10
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,590
And so especially across Eastern Europe, there's less access and awareness.

11
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,549
So there are some countries like think was incredibly high.

12
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:09,420
Pierre for Pierre. Pierre for the vision impairment for dementia.

13
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,790
Right. Yeah. So yeah, yeah.

14
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:22,690
So actually you would assume that due to the vision and neighborhood that we did.

15
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:30,820
Yes, yes, yes, yes. I'm part of us who live and with. Which is very much what I would have made researchers to do.

16
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,190
So this is like the first time I get promoted as one. Yeah, great.

17
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,380
Right. Right. Okay, cool.

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,720
Cool. Yeah, I'll try to stick to my schedule. There we go.

19
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:53,170
French. Return to front.

20
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:59,830
Yeah. Yeah, it sounds good. Yeah, it seems to work in a way.

21
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,210
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. As if that might be a higher contrast.

22
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:13,310
What it also. All right.

23
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,180
Good morning, everybody. Welcome to see you all here.

24
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,629
I'm really excited to discuss sensory disabilities.

25
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:29,600
Essentially today we talked a lot about disability last week and focused, I think quite bit on physical disabilities.

26
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,930
And now we're going to move into sensory disabilities. We're not just going to be presenting after the group on hearing impairment.

27
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:40,069
We have a guest speaker today, Josh Erlich, who's joined us to talk about vision impairment.

28
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:44,180
So Josh and I have worked together on a number of projects and papers and grants,

29
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,030
and so I'm really excited that you were able to be here with us today.

30
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,900
Josh is an assistant professor in the Department of Ophthalmology, Michigan Medicine.

31
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,530
He's also a research assistant professor in the Institute Social Research.

32
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:03,620
And he also is does a lot of overseas work with the international ophthalmology unit.

33
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:11,510
And he can tell you a lot more about that. He just got back from Kenya, where he's been really trying to push awareness of vision improve as well.

34
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,139
So I will let you take over.

35
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,890
Joshua, thanks so much. The I appreciate it. Well, really pleased to be here.

36
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:24,080
And, you know, excited, too excited to meet all of you and be here today.

37
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,120
Feel free. I mean, I'll sit down so I can advance the slides.

38
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:36,110
Feel free to interrupt in the middle, you know, ask any questions, discuss anything that's of interest to small groups.

39
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:42,290
There's no reason we can't be interactive as we as we go. And thanks so much for the kind introduction and invitation to be here.

40
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:50,600
So the basic outline of today's talk, I'll talk about what vision impairment actually is,

41
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,500
what we mean when we use this term, just so we're all on the same page.

42
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:03,950
I'll talk a bit about Global in US patterns of epidemiology, of vision impairment, focusing mostly on that first.

43
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,920
So bullet point kind of patterns of eye disease and vision impairment.

44
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,510
And then we'll talk about the implications of vision impairment for the lives of older adults.

45
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:22,140
Before I delve too deep into that, I just want to make the point that vision impairment is a really prevalent problem or prevalent issue.

46
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,800
So this larger circle illustrating 2.2 billion people that would include me and many of you guys who are wearing glasses.

47
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,890
Right. We have a vision impairment. It's easily correctable. That's great.

48
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,780
But there's a billion people that had vision impairment that could have been prevented.

49
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:42,030
They got treatment for it early on for a disease state or that is yet to be addressed.

50
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:48,510
As in the case of glasses, if you don't have the glasses that you need, you'd be I would be visually impaired.

51
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:55,260
So there's a billion people really in need that are affected by a vision impairment in their day to day lives.

52
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,990
This problem is it will be of no surprise to anyone in this room, I'm sure not evenly distributed around the world.

53
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:11,040
The map shown here, countries are drawn proportional to their share of the global burden of blindness.

54
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,229
And it probably does not surprise anyone that low and middle income countries tend to bear

55
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:21,930
an outsized share of the world's prevalence cases of blindness and vision impairment.

56
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,520
In particular, actually, India has more blind people and visually impaired people than any other country.

57
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:36,149
Perhaps not surprising since it has over a billion people, but it has something like 21% of the world's population,

58
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,389
like 26% of the world's blind and visually impaired people.

59
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,890
So it's actually rather outsized, more so than any other country use today.

60
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:50,729
Yeah, please. For this map, what is that color represented of the colors?

61
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:57,750
Just to provide, I guess it's regional, right? So you have like the Middle East and North Africa is green and in sub-Saharan Africa is yellow.

62
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:06,180
It's just yeah. Differentiate the countries, the countries you can like if I look at Africa, I can see a faint line differentiating countries.

63
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:13,229
It's more region though. Okay. It is something very similar because of lack of data.

64
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:18,000
Or is it really just that not as prevalent as other high income areas?

65
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,800
It's really just not as prevalent as is other low income areas, at least according to the data that we have.

66
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:33,900
Yeah, yeah, that's a good question. We can look at the United States and we see similar things, right?

67
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:39,310
We see that that the prevalence of blindness in this case is not evenly distributed.

68
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:46,930
In particular, the Deep South, we see a lot of dark blue indicating a higher prevalence relative to other counties in this case in the United States.

69
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:53,890
Of course, we can look at other disease states, other other disabilities, other conditions and find similar patterns, I'm sure.

70
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:03,680
And so with that kind of setting, the stage will now move into talking about squarely kind of what is vision impairment,

71
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:13,159
what do we mean when we use these terms? So when we look at vision sort of overall, we have biology, right?

72
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,210
The structure of the eyeball in the brain, which are the seeing organs of the body.

73
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,229
Right. And that's over here. When we talk about structure, we have the person, right?

74
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:26,690
We have the effects that vision has on the individual, on both the individual and on society, I should say.

75
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:33,530
And then kind of leading joining the organ to the impact we have the function, right.

76
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:39,320
So the ideas in function, well, we may have vision impairment which then has downstream consequences and that's

77
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,760
illustrated here in this in this diagram somewhere to talk for a moment about function.

78
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:55,219
So visual function is not a single thing. I think many of us, most people probably when they think about visual function, they think about, say,

79
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,390
going to the eye doctor for a pair of eyeglasses or for an eye exam and looking at

80
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,710
an eye chart on the wall and being asked to read successively smaller letters.

81
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:09,139
And that is a great indicator of visual function in particular, which imagery is visual acuity.

82
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,600
It's called How Small of Characters Can One See when displayed on the wall?

83
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,210
It's not the only indicator of visual function, though.

84
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:25,490
We can look up in the upper right here where we have a VR studio, we can see that the letters get lighter and lighter as we march on.

85
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:31,370
That's contrast sensitivity. How light of the character can you see on a similarly colored background?

86
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:37,109
Another important indicator of visual function that has really, really big implications in our day to day lives.

87
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:45,709
And we don't often think about that. There's also peripheral vision, some disease states may affect vision on the sides out here,

88
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:55,610
which has really important implications as well for safety, for example, mobility for for, you know, not bumping one's head on a cabinet.

89
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,570
I mean, these practical sort of things that affect people that have these kinds of vision loss.

90
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:10,760
This next this next slide illustrates some of the some of what different types of vision loss may look like to different individuals.

91
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,520
So, for example, here in the upper left, we have these stairs that are real wavy.

92
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,540
Right? And one could imagine how that would have implications for safe mobility.

93
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,970
That's a phenomenon called metamorphosis that could happen in conditions like macular degeneration.

94
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:32,240
We have these sort of black splotches in the middle of the vision that can happen.

95
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,069
Also in other disease states, we have loss of peripheral vision, so we can see that vision.

96
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:40,640
Impairment is not this monolithic thing that we oftentimes think of.

97
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,030
We oftentimes think of it as such when we think about the eye chart on the wall.

98
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,540
Any questions about this? This can be kind of new. I for some.

99
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:56,300
Okay. There is evidence that all of these visual functions do decline with age.

100
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:05,260
And this is from a population based sample. So this is not showing decline necessarily in normal people without any disease state.

101
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:09,430
This is just kind of the overall average decline with age.

102
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,640
So some of this is preventable, avoidable or even reversible.

103
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,630
But when we look in the population, we see a steady decline of all metrics with age.

104
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,360
So getting into some hard definitions now, because we of course,

105
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,910
need hard definitions when we're going to do quantitative research, even if they are somewhat reductive.

106
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,750
We'll talk about a more qualitative definition in in a second.

107
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:39,230
The W.H.O. and the International Classification of Diseases defines vision impairment based on visual acuity.

108
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:44,360
So that is using the eye chart like we just talked about, where the letters get smaller as you read them.

109
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:50,420
And so we have definitions for mild and moderate and severe vision impairment in blindness.

110
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,470
And these definitions are based on how well you can see in the better eye.

111
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,630
So you could have one eye that was totally blind, in one eye that sees really well,

112
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:05,570
and you wouldn't be considered visually impaired by these definitions by this definition.

113
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:13,940
Just to take a step back for a second, when we look at a number like this, say 2060, is anybody know what that means?

114
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:22,680
Yeah. It's like what someone with what someone else can see at 20 feet.

115
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,920
You could hurt what someone else could see at 60 feet you could see from.

116
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,460
Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. They're going to get that.

117
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:38,730
So. So, right. So rarely do the do quantitative definitions of visual impairment.

118
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:45,840
Incorporate these other metrics we talked about like peripheral vision or contrast sensitivity or stereo vision, which means depth perception.

119
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,230
But we know that they're important, that there's good evidence,

120
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:54,510
that they're important for day to day functioning, including in in particular to older adults.

121
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:06,340
A lot of that is practical. They're tougher to test. So there's also more qualitative and more person based definitions of vision loss.

122
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:13,840
And typically this is referred to as low vision. Low vision often refers to the functional implications of vision loss,

123
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,240
and it often refers to vision loss that's chronic and that impacts one's daily life.

124
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:29,379
And so this can be based on individual experience. One person with, say, you know, quantitatively measured, 2040 vision may feel very impaired,

125
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,550
may have difficulty if their job requires that they had very high acuity vision.

126
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,600
And another person may be totally fine with that vision and not feel impacted.

127
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,230
They're able to do their ADLs and their ideals and get by just fine.

128
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:50,230
So this is a more qualitative person based definition that is that is important in the clinical setting as well,

129
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:55,720
because there are rehabilitative interventions that can and we can get into that later if people have interest in talking about it.

130
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:02,380
But there are some rehabilitative interventions that kind of take this is the framework in trying to improve people's day to day function.

131
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:13,990
So what about glasses? So oftentimes when we think about when we think about vision,

132
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:21,010
we think about how one comes to the examination or the study right there presenting vision.

133
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:28,600
And in many ways, in my mind, it's somebody who's interested in the implications of vision loss in the lives of older adults.

134
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:34,630
Presenting vision is what really matters. Presenting vision is how one is walking around, seeing the world.

135
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:42,610
It's sort of a free living measure. I often like to say best corrected vision is a somewhat idealized measure.

136
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,370
So that is the individual is seen by a study personnel or seen by a clinician.

137
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:55,390
And we assess how well we can get their vision with the best possible pair of glasses in front of their eyes.

138
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:56,740
And that's great.

139
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:05,049
And that's actually very, very important because what's left over after correcting someone's vision with glasses is due to other disease states.

140
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:11,320
And so lets us know what fraction of vision loss is attributable to the need for glasses versus other conditions.

141
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:18,940
But if we're thinking from a more functional or disability perspective, presenting vision may actually be more germane.

142
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:28,250
So as as we've been talking about, some vision loss is completely correctable.

143
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,560
With my vision loss, I have myopia, nearsighted. I wear glasses and I can see all the way to the back of the room.

144
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:41,830
I presbyopia the last bullet here is the need for glasses as we get older to see up close.

145
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,640
And I'm sure all of you have seen people sort of holding menu way out here to see what it says.

146
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:55,130
I'm beginning to do that. And that's just the need for reading glasses, which is a nearly universal human condition.

147
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:05,530
Some types of vision loss are reversible. So, for example, cataracts, that's a no pacification of the lens that we're all born with inside of the eye,

148
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:10,210
which can be removed surgically, and that is fully reversible.

149
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,240
And then there are conditions that are irreversible.

150
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:23,250
So, for example, vision loss from glaucoma unfortunately can't be brought back, although it is preventable if caught early.

151
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:31,850
The question. Yeah, when we think about like burden of disease worldwide, is it mostly correctable and reversible?

152
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,989
Good question. The the answer is yes.

153
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:40,430
And we'll get to some actual I'll show like a pie chart in just a few slides. So we'll put some numbers to that.

154
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:49,130
But the answer is yes, which is actually why I often make the argument that it's really low hanging fruit when we think about alleviating disability,

155
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:55,700
alleviating some of the downstream effects, and in improving quality of life, and even attending to things like the Sustainable Development Goals.

156
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,710
How common is it to do surgery, to correct vision problems of people?

157
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,219
Really common. So we think like cataract surgery.

158
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:11,060
I do cataract surgery. I did cataract surgery yesterday afternoon. And actually, I'll be going to see those post-op patients immediately after this.

159
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:19,490
And they were all over 65. And many of the patients that I do cataract surgery on are over age 80, 85, even in the nineties.

160
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,719
And it's like an immediate clearing of the. Pretty much, yeah.

161
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,620
You get a little swelling, maybe a day or two of the way, but yet within the week for sure.

162
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,550
And what about like problems with like being will see closely.

163
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,659
Yeah. I mean usually it's usually reading glasses are you know are are simply the cure for that you know or bifocals.

164
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,920
We need to build in both the distance correction into the reading correction and.

165
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,239
At the time of cataract surgery.

166
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,510
We choose what lens we're going to implant into the eye to replace the native lens that will pacified and form the cataract.

167
00:16:52,870 --> 00:17:01,840
And that lens has a certain power to it. And so we can actually essentially dial in a power to optimize for faraway vision in or up close vision.

168
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:10,030
And so that's a conversation that I would have to fix. But here, this may be helpful as well.

169
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:15,280
This diagram of the eye shows where different how prevalent conditions occur.

170
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:20,470
And we see that there are visually impaired conditions occurring kind of at all levels of the eye.

171
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:30,130
I should say trickiest is not super common here, but very common as a result of of an infectious disease in sub-Saharan Africa,

172
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:36,730
particularly in kind of the Sahel, the area where the Sahara meets sub-Saharan Africa, Ethiopia, that region, that area.

173
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:42,010
But the others we see with some frequency here in this country as well,

174
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,010
moving from the cornea of corneal scar all the way back to the retina where we have diabetic retinopathy,

175
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:53,290
glaucoma, macular degeneration, and then refractive error up at the top.

176
00:17:53,290 --> 00:18:00,820
The need for glasses is simply the need to refocus light as it enters the eye so that it hits the retina that hits the back of the eye.

177
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,889
When you need glasses, the light just as simply as being focused as is it often we should be.

178
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:11,410
As enters the eye, nearly all of these conditions become more common with age,

179
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:19,630
though the big four that we tend to focus on when we talk about vision impairment in older adults are cataracts,

180
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,580
glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.

181
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,790
The incidence and prevalence of each one of these increases considerably with age more.

182
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,400
Look at some grafts and things like that in just a moment that illustrate that.

183
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,350
What causes glaucoma? That's a really good question.

184
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,759
You might win a Nobel Prize if you really figure that out. There's certainly a heritable component, right?

185
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,970
Runs in families, for sure. There's a number of other risk factors besides genes.

186
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,380
The only one of those risk factors that we can treat is a high pressure.

187
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:59,710
So some people come in with glaucoma, they have high pressure. Okay, we've got to get the eye pressure down to a normal ish range.

188
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:05,820
But many people have normal eye pressure and have glaucoma and they still need lower pressure.

189
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,120
Right. So the only treatment we have, whether it's surgical treatment, medical treatment, laser treatment,

190
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,130
they all aim to lower pressure because the only modifiable risk factor we know of for glaucoma,

191
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:26,169
there's probably some there's certainly is some susceptibility of the optic nerve to damage that varies from person to person.

192
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,730
Right. So everybody's going to have like a certain threshold beyond which they would develop glaucoma.

193
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,740
And in a normal eye, that threshold may be actually a rather high pressure.

194
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,040
But in susceptible eye, that threshold is a bit lower. That's that.

195
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:49,390
We don't even know what causes it. So now here's the here's the answer to the to that question about the distribution of causes.

196
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:54,580
This is a global this is a illustration of causes globally, not here in the United States.

197
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,120
And there are some differences when we look at the U.S. data.

198
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,030
But the point here is to show that greater than 75% of this pie is taken up by the blue and the green.

199
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,160
That is glasses and cataract. Two things that are really curable,

200
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,910
really treatable and have actually been shown to be two of the most cost effective interventions in all of medicine,

201
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,390
75% of vision impairment in blindness in many cases with the others.

202
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:31,090
But other. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. So trauma would fall into that same tumors would fall into that.

203
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,120
Congenital conditions would fall into that.

204
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:44,000
You have to look at what the other things are right to, to come up with, you know, there's certain there's other disease.

205
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So we talked about glaucoma is a disease of the optic nerve. There's other diseases of the optic nerve.

206
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,320
There's other retinal conditions.

207
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:58,660
There's corneal scars which are oftentimes results in trauma, particularly in agricultural settings, but can also result from infection.

208
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:07,080
So it's a it's a hodgepodge of things. So the pattern is fairly similar in the US,

209
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,819
but what we see is that there's actually a little bit there's a bit less refractive

210
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:16,080
error unmet need for glasses resulting in moderate to severe vision impairment.

211
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:23,910
But it's still there's still considerable vision impairment due to uncorrected or under corrected refractive error even here in the United States.

212
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:36,270
So there's a lot of treatable disease. So I'm going to well, I think that system will continue on.

213
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:46,019
So the the the number of people that have vision impairment today we showed earlier and one of the very first slides is huge, right.

214
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:50,370
Over a billion people have vision impairment that could have been prevented or is correctable.

215
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:58,020
The number of people with vision impairment is projected still to grow considerably over the coming three decades.

216
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,799
In fact, the projections are for a 55% increase.

217
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,550
That is 600 million people over the next 30 years globally.

218
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,090
And similar patterns obviously have the same numbers,

219
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:15,870
but similar patterns are projected for the United States in approximate doubling over 30 years of the number of people affected.

220
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:21,060
Now, largely, this is driven by aging of the world's populations.

221
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:28,980
Many of you've probably seen population pyramids like this that show how the distribution of the population by age in this case,

222
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:38,610
men on the left, women on the right is changing over time, starting from 1950 and projecting out to out to 2 to 2100.

223
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:46,590
Many middle income countries are experiencing over this time a really transformative demographic shifts.

224
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:53,400
For example, in Eastern Europe, parts of Asia, Latin America, and even in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, this is beginning already.

225
00:22:54,210 --> 00:23:01,500
We we're seeing just an incredible rise in the number of individuals over age 60, 60 or 65, whatever the metric is.

226
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,950
For example, PHILIPPa mentioned that I was in in in Kenya last week where I do some work.

227
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:13,740
Kenya is expected to see a four fold increase in its over 60 population between now and 2050,

228
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:20,069
which has incredible implications, not just obviously for the for the number of people with vision impairment,

229
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:28,500
but also the number of people with all diseases of aging, dementia, loss of independence and disability we know increases with age.

230
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,190
So huge implications here, including for vision.

231
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:42,150
What we see is that there's really this and the reason for this is it's driven by this stepwise increase in prevalence with age.

232
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:51,450
So we get to 90 plus in the prevalence of vision, impairment is over 50%, much of it correctable or avoidable.

233
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,150
But the prevalence goes up with each decade of life. And so we can see how that would been translate to more people affected.

234
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:03,800
We see the same thing in the United States here. The cut point in this graph is age 50.

235
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:09,690
We can just see that the prevalence is considerably higher in adults age 50 and older as compared to those under age 50.

236
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:14,340
Even here in the United States, this is data from 2020, those 50 and older,

237
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:21,420
about 10%, a little under 10%, are estimated to be visually impaired in the future.

238
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,780
This means that an even greater fraction of vision loss is going to be concentrated

239
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,410
in that population as the population shifts towards those older demographics.

240
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:37,190
So one of the problems we face, though, when we talk about vision impairment and blindness here in the United States,

241
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:42,650
is that the data is actually much scarcer than in other parts of the world.

242
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:50,870
And we could talk about why that might be the case. But many parts of the world, including low and middle income countries, have much better,

243
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:56,480
much more up to date epidemiological data on vision impairment and blindness than we do here in the United States.

244
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,979
Most of our data on it has come from self-report.

245
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,910
You know, in national surveys, as you may be familiar with some of these,

246
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:11,930
the health retirement study in Haynes, Eddy, Jasper, FSS, those three or CDC studies.

247
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:20,090
They all contain self-report measures, asking participants about how well they can see at distance near.

248
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,819
In general, the questions tend to vary from study to study, and that's great.

249
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:30,620
In that big map, a little bit closer to what we were talking about when we talked about low vision,

250
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,090
one's perception of their vision and how it impacts their daily life.

251
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:40,280
But it does make it challenging for us to make comparisons across settings, for us to do surveillance,

252
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:49,190
to understand actually how many people have a a a sensory loss rate, a functional loss.

253
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:55,970
And unfortunately, objective measurement has been very rare in us in national surveys in the United States.

254
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:01,250
We do have some locally representative data of some studies that have been done, for example,

255
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:05,540
in Los Angeles or in a community in Wisconsin or Maryland that have given us some

256
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:10,220
population representative data but not necessarily widely generalizable data.

257
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,469
In fact, the last national data was collected in 2008 when an Heins had a vision chart and they were collecting vision

258
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:25,400
data sets 14 years ago without any nationally representative measure data on vision in the United States,

259
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:31,190
which is, in my mind, sort of unbelievable that we went 14 years, that any surveillance data,

260
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:38,660
I say, went because we've we've recently remedied that problem, at least for older adults.

261
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,200
So some of you may be familiar with the National Health and Aging Trends Study or and Hats,

262
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,750
which is run out of the University of Michigan and Johns Hopkins.

263
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:56,810
It's a study focused on late life, disability and the sampling frame of and hat is Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older.

264
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:08,510
And so actually Philip and I both work very closely within hats and we were fortunate to be able to add to and hats in 2021.

265
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:13,639
So last year and going forward, objective measures of visual function.

266
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,410
So this is the first time in a national sample that this has been collected in 14 years.

267
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:26,150
And so what we did in 2021 and what we're in the field doing right now, again, is collecting data on presenting vision.

268
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:31,490
So if they come with glasses, they wear them. If they don't have them, they don't both eyes open.

269
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:36,830
So this is the way people are living, rather than some idealized version of how well they might be able to see.

270
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:43,100
And we measure their distance visual acuity. That is how well they can see an eye chart far away.

271
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:50,899
They're near visual acuity, really relevant because all of these people, 65 and older, will have experienced that condition.

272
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:57,080
We call Presbyopia or the need for reading glasses, of course, and contrast sensitivity,

273
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,460
which I don't know of a national study in the United States ever that measured contrast sensitivity.

274
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:06,050
And that's the ability, as we talked about before, to see things on a similarly colored background,

275
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:09,860
really strong associations with disability with lately functioning.

276
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,990
Tell us a bit more about how these data are collected in the future. Yeah, yeah.

277
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:19,820
So there so this iPad is actually displaying the contrast sensitivity test.

278
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:25,460
So they're all iPad based measures. We worked with an optometrist who is a psycho physicist.

279
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,820
He specializes in developing measures of visual function.

280
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:36,050
And so he took the gold standard clinical tests like you would use if you were running a vision clinical trial, for example.

281
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:43,280
And he developed a set of tests that mirrored those gold standard tests on the iPad.

282
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:49,129
And so they're in it's basically a PDF, it's an e-book. It's sold as on the iPad.

283
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:53,570
And the examiner is able to scroll through as the participant gets letters, right.

284
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:58,430
They simply swipe to the next screen and they record the participants correcting incorrect answers.

285
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:05,030
And then that's converted into a a score on a logarithmic scale.

286
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:09,860
So it's it's essentially continuous and can be used in parametric statistics as a result.

287
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:17,989
And it's we did a a reasonably sized clinical study.

288
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:23,000
We recruited participants and randomized them to get the iPad test first or the clinical test first.

289
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,930
And we showed that there was good agreement between the tests without any obvious bias on the iPad.

290
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:35,240
These tests. And so we feel pretty good about using these tests, making inferences with these tests,

291
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,660
and even comparing them to data collected with other comparable measures.

292
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:47,329
Even though these tests have not been widely used prior to our implementation and hence it simply wasn't you know, it was a practical consideration.

293
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:54,110
It wasn't practical to ask the examiners to paste a chart on participants walls in their homes, in hats as administered.

294
00:29:54,710 --> 00:30:00,560
So this was the solution we came up with, and it's probably something we'll start to see more and more in epidemiological studies.

295
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:06,830
As you know, things like iPads are now part and parcel of going out into the field and so data is collected anyway.

296
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:15,350
So kind of complicated questions. I apologize. Not a problem might be different from 165, but.

297
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:25,320
How do you distinguish between functional contrast, sensitivity and like training or cognitive?

298
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:37,260
Like you said, I guess my background is in graphic design and there is like the Pantone test order, all of the shades.

299
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:41,120
Yeah. And I. It's not like a functional thing.

300
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:44,750
Or is that like a kind of, you know, if you do it with people from your own age,

301
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:50,220
when you're used to seeing shades that are, you know, like a value or a hero.

302
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,720
Yeah. So how do you see?

303
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,910
Is that a part or is it something like is it like the same?

304
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,469
Yeah. So, I mean, the Pantone test, there's definitely a cognitive component, right?

305
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:05,670
You're asking people to make decisions as to some executive function there.

306
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:10,860
There's vision. There's some executive function. There's definitely, definitely a cognitive component.

307
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,969
I don't I wouldn't say that there's no cognitive component here.

308
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:20,860
Right. I think that would be unfair for me to say that. And there are people that can't participate in the test.

309
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,320
Not a huge number, but a small number that can't do the test because of severe cognitive impairment.

310
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:33,840
Right. That said, if they are I was going to say literate, not necessarily literate, but know the alphabet.

311
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:38,090
Right. And are able to recall the alphabet.

312
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:43,560
Right. So there's some level of cognitive function here. Then what we should be testing is visual function.

313
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:49,080
Right. So there is a cognitive component, but much less so than I think the pendulum which requires true executive function to order.

314
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:56,459
Um, I will say, and this is sort of almost like the inverse of one thing that's really interesting

315
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:00,930
when we think about cognitive epidemiology and the impact of vision on cognition,

316
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:07,830
which I'll get to shortly, is that we do worry about since many cognitive tests have a visual component,

317
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,670
whether or not we're testing someone's cognition or their ability to see,

318
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:17,220
particularly if we're thinking about vision as a predictor of incident, cognitive impairment or dementia.

319
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:22,650
So we want to make sure that we're measuring the right thing. And so measurement is is certainly something we think a lot about.

320
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:31,500
Perhaps even more so when we're using vision as an indicator of cognitive function, which does is, is do you see contrast sensitivity.

321
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:35,530
Yeah. So it's really prevalent in all coma for sure.

322
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:41,849
Definitely. We also see it with cataract. Cataract is, you know, pacification of the lens acts like a filter,

323
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:46,800
almost a yellowing of everything that comes into the eye, definitely a loss of contrast.

324
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:50,969
And then to some degree, you can also see it in macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy,

325
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:54,540
but it's perhaps a little less prominent to those two as compared to cataract and more common.

326
00:32:55,530 --> 00:33:07,380
Yeah. And then this is some unpublished data manuscripts is under review where we just were reporting on the epidemiology of vision impairment.

327
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:16,709
It's actually over 70 or 71 in older population since and has has not been replenished since 2015 with be reports this year.

328
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:21,210
But in 2021 it hadn't been replenished since 2015 to the population age to 71.

329
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:26,400
And essentially what we see here and that's mirrors the data that I displayed earlier,

330
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:34,140
which is that with each in this case, a five year bin of life, we see an increase in the prevalence of vision impairment.

331
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:40,139
And this is 80 vision impairment, mild, moderate, severe and by age 19,

332
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:44,380
much like in that other data, we're seeing that the vision impairment is highly prevalent.

333
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:55,379
The 2022 data will provide the first ever opportunity for us to study incident vision impairment in the US population,

334
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:03,000
something that we've just never had. The data for NHANES, which previously collected National Vision Data, is a cross-sectional survey.

335
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,570
So it's different people being survey year after year.

336
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:11,760
There was no opportunity then to to to ascertain who developed new vision impairment since the prior year.

337
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,870
So it will be we'll be studying that as well going forward.

338
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:22,319
This will also enable data for tons of other research that we're excited to work on in the in the coming years.

339
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,210
As the day is more and more data become available.

340
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:31,680
It's important, though, to know kind of returning to to a global context is is relevant in the United States.

341
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:37,260
But but certainly speaking globally, the vision impairment, like many diseases, is not distributed equally.

342
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:45,330
There are enormous disparities both in the United States and globally in some of the high risk groups are labeled here on the right hand side.

343
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:52,830
And there certainly these groups are certainly high risk for other conditions, as I recognize not unique to vision impairment and blindness.

344
00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:00,720
But it is important to keep in mind that adults 50 and older comprise 70 plus percent vision impairment in blindness,

345
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:11,460
that women and girls represent 55% of those with vision impairment globally, and that these other groups also represent a disproportionate burden.

346
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:21,920
Now, that said, I think it is important for us. You know, we talk about say, you know, say here lower middle income countries.

347
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:28,610
Right. Representing a disproportionate burden is important for us to think about data disaggregation.

348
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:37,549
There's a high degree of variation that can be masked when we look at regional averages in this graph of just depicts trends in the

349
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:45,050
unadjusted prevalence of or excuse me yeah understood prevalence of blindness since 1990 across 12 low and middle income countries.

350
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:51,260
And what we can see is that in some countries it's going up, in some countries it's going down, in many countries steady.

351
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:56,600
And so these averages don't always tell the whole story is really the point of of including this.

352
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,379
It is also important to understand that as the raw number of individuals with

353
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,980
vision impairment and blindness is increasing due to these demographic changes,

354
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,150
we talked about the age standardized prevalence of vision,

355
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:14,540
impairment of blindness is actually decreasing in all regions of the world,

356
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:22,460
and that's largely due to an increase in the standard of living, particularly in low middle income countries.

357
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,940
Increases in access to eye care and available treatments for vision impairment.

358
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:32,210
Blindness we have. In other words, we have the tools we need to address this.

359
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:39,230
The age standardized prevalence is going down. We're just fighting against a demographic trend where the population is aging.

360
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:44,000
And so there are so many more who are going to be affected because of this major risk factor that is age.

361
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:55,910
Along with this, we do see changes in causes, which may not be surprising, since causes tend to map to the demographics of the population.

362
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:00,680
And what we're seeing is, as well as the other risk factors, I should say.

363
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:09,440
And what we're seeing is that that certain causes are actually increasing in prevalence, while most causes are decreasing in prevalence.

364
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:17,959
The decreases would be due to the factors that we just talked about. The increases, though, are due to changes in the structure of the population,

365
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:24,590
or perhaps even more so changes in other risk factors like lifestyle and even advances in medicines.

366
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:31,070
This has nothing to do with aging, but some of them other is going up because of, for example,

367
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:38,900
neonates surviving longer in the ICU and being susceptible to certain neonatal causes of vision impairment.

368
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,610
We're seeing that in low middle income countries where survival of babies is improving.

369
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:47,810
And so a condition called retinopathy or prematurity be much more common.

370
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,170
We also see, though, that nearsightedness is becoming much more common in populations around the world.

371
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,960
And this is like we also due to lifestyle factors.

372
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:04,790
For example, not spending as much time outside and spending more time in front of books is known to increase the risk of nearsightedness.

373
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:10,370
And so we're seeing that in populations the world over. And that's largely that's that's also embodied here.

374
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:21,410
When it comes to diabetic retinopathy, we know that diabetes is increasing the world over and that diabetic retinopathy is much more common with age,

375
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,190
as it tends to be strongly associated with years lived with the disease.

376
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:33,020
And so we that's that's sort of what's behind this projected increase in diabetic

377
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:37,430
retinopathy as as a prevalent cause of vision impairment and blindness worldwide.

378
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:45,259
So a lot of the data that I've showed you up to this point come from this really great resource called the Vision Atlas.

379
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:49,400
And if you happy to share the URL, but it's really a very easy to use website.

380
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:54,620
A lot of point and click dropdown menus, that kind of thing, and very easy to get up to date data.

381
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,549
This is also the data that feeds into the Global Burden of disease study,

382
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:02,030
if any of you are familiar with that epidemiological studies at the University of Washington.

383
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,540
So that will transition with the remaining time to talking about the implications of vision impairment for older adults.

384
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:14,159
And I know we're at about we're at about 40 minutes,

385
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:21,760
so I may move fast through some of the slides so that I can focus on those that are that are that are most sort of high yield, high impact.

386
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:29,049
This is just to note that there is a growing recognition that vision represents a

387
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:33,640
key component of overall health and well-being and even sustainable development.

388
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:42,010
So much so that the United Nations last year passed a resolution emphasizing this end rolling vision and

389
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:49,100
pyramid into the Sustainable Development Goals and explicitly talking about how correcting vision impairment.

390
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:55,000
Addressing vision impairment is an important lever for promoting sustainable development worldwide.

391
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:02,950
And we can see some of the some of the the issues here that poor vision is associated with and a good vision is associated with.

392
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:11,740
Certainly when we think about sustainable development Goals three and eight, I think that the relevance to aging is immediately obvious.

393
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:15,940
We think about dementia and falls and disability, even mortality.

394
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,000
We also think about late life economic well-being with sustainable development goals.

395
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:28,509
Eight. But number four is important also in a lot of regions of the world where there's an older adult who's visually impaired,

396
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,630
it means that children are staying home from school to take care of that family member.

397
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,580
And this is really a big issue in particularly in low income countries.

398
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:48,250
And so even even when we think about the impact of the intergenerational impact of good vision, and so vision influences many aspects of life.

399
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:55,930
And there's good there's good evidence for visual impairment being an important influence of each of these aspects of late life.

400
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:02,110
We're going to focus in the remaining slides on cognitive health, an area that I study a lot,

401
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,610
but we also we can also look at caregiving falls, physical inactivity.

402
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:13,240
I would add social isolation to that financial well-being, depression, anxiety and even mortality.

403
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:17,770
There's an increased risk of mortality in people who are visually impaired.

404
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:25,470
So but a highlight one of these areas, as I said, and that is cognitive health and vision.

405
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:30,840
And so there's been quite a bit of work to date trying to understand,

406
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:37,980
trying to illustrate largely that there is an association or longitudinal association between vision impairment and cognitive function.

407
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:43,410
And I knew that we would talk about hearing impairment in the next hour,

408
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:49,649
but the pathways that are mentioned that are hypothesized to account for this association are

409
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:54,660
largely the same pathways hypothesized to account for the hearing cognitive function association.

410
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,110
So when we look at effect sizes, these are drawn actually at the hearing effect size up here as well.

411
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,300
These are drawn from meta analysis that have been all conducted in the past year or two,

412
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:14,310
looking at the association between vision impairment and dementia in the published literature.

413
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:17,430
And we can see that there's a pretty consistent association.

414
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:28,970
And so you can see here illustrated in the in the figure that there are a number of hypothesized pathways, the most of them.

415
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:33,920
Quite honestly, there's very little data and research that has that has been used to test these pathways.

416
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,670
And so we'll talk about what's hypothesized and what we can do going forward.

417
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:43,910
The most likely scenario I would state, though, is that multiple pathways exist and affect different individuals or populations differently.

418
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:50,450
There's probably no one answer. And so one possibility, though, is a common cause.

419
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,350
The AI is essentially an extension of the brain. It is neural tissue.

420
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:03,110
And so we can imagine a cause of dementia, vascular and or neurodegenerative that also would impact the high rates of common vascular

421
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:07,670
apathy or neurodegeneration might result in vision impairment as well as cognitive impairment.

422
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:16,250
There's also this big hypothesis referred to kind of globally as the sensory loss consequence pathway.

423
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,820
And I'm going to break that down, though, because there's a lot kind of baked into this.

424
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:29,750
So one mechanism kind of baked into the sensory loss consequence pathway is this functioning or mediator hypothesis.

425
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:37,220
And that is we know that these factors, for example, so social isolation, psychological well-being, reduced activity.

426
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:43,550
We know that those are risk factors for dementia and cognitive impairment.

427
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:51,470
We also know that vision impairment is a risk factor for social isolation, decreased psychological well-being and reduced physical activity.

428
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:58,670
And so one hypothesis is that really the way vision impairment is having its effect on cognitive health is by affecting these mediators.

429
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:08,880
Another possibility, though, is that as we have less signaling coming into the brain from the eyes,

430
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:17,250
decreased afferent input that there's actual changes in brain structure areas of the brain that aren't being utilized as they should be.

431
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:28,440
And finally, there's some evidence to support limited evidence to support the notion that cognitive load may play a role.

432
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:32,940
So this idea that if you're visually impaired yet you're trying to get about the world

433
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,090
to do your shopping and balance your checkbook and all of these kinds of things,

434
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:43,870
that it takes more work. And this dual tasking is more difficult as cognitive load is greater.

435
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,570
And that that has a cumulative effect over time that maybe to cognitive decline.

436
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:58,020
Despite the fact that these pathways have largely not been rigorously tested due largely to a lack of good data.

437
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:03,600
What we do know is that vision appears to drive cognition more so than the reverse.

438
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:12,450
So there is a reverse association, but the Division two declining cognition seems to be a much stronger association just in evidence for that.

439
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:17,459
There's also evidence when we look at the whole continuum,

440
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:23,250
from normal cognition to dementia with cognitive impairment kind of being in between those two extremes,

441
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,810
that vision impairment appears to affect those early transitions.

442
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:35,460
If you're visually impaired, it appears to increase your risk considerably of going on to develop mild cognitive impairment.

443
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:41,729
But once you have cognitive impairment, vision doesn't seem to matter as much anymore.

444
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:45,900
And that makes some sense because your risk of going on to develop dementia is really high at that point.

445
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:52,560
So vision plays less of a role, even though it might have gotten to that point or been a factor in getting you to that point.

446
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,809
All of this said vision impairment and blindness have really not receive adequate

447
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:05,560
attention in my mind and as a potentially modifiable dementia risk factor.

448
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:10,179
We've talked about how such a large fraction of vision impairment of blindness is easily

449
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:14,980
modifiable with things like glasses and cataract surgery really cost effective interventions.

450
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:20,919
Yet this really influential commission called the Lancet Commission that kind of sets a lot of

451
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:27,040
policy and thinking around dementia globally has not discussed vision at all in their model,

452
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:32,020
although they've held up hearing as one of the most important factors.

453
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,590
And it is. But vision has been absent.

454
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:41,800
So we ask the question intentionally in a rather provocative, basic kind of way where is vision to this model?

455
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:48,520
And so we basically replicated the Lancet commissions model and we showed that vision impairment,

456
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:51,610
and we used the national sample here in the United States to do this.

457
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:59,230
And we showed that vision impairment accounts for appears to account for a similar fraction of dementia

458
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:05,320
cases to other to what we find with other risk factors that are in the Lancet commission model,

459
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:09,250
for example, increased alcohol consumption and social isolation.

460
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:15,220
So about 2% of cases appear to be strongly associated with the presence of vision impairment in the United States.

461
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:18,790
That would be about 100,000 existing prevalent cases.

462
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:24,549
And of course, we know if we start to look at other countries, that is the prevalence of vision impairment goes up.

463
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,060
For example,

464
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:32,350
in India where there's six times more vision impairment than in the US that we're going to see a greater proportion of cases attributable to that.

465
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:41,230
We, as I said, intended to be kind of provocative with this article and let the Lancet commission know that they ought to be thinking about this.

466
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:46,450
And our our provocation reached heights that we actually didn't think would be

467
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:49,840
possible when The New York Times reached out and took an interest in this article.

468
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,510
And so we were very excited.

469
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:58,389
They actually interviewed also the lead author of the Lancet Commission on Dementia in the article, but focused on our work.

470
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:01,690
And I think I think vision is now starting to get a little more traction.

471
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:07,480
I hope and hopefully this will play a role in kind of getting getting vision into those those really influential models.

472
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,810
But one thing that we really do need is interventional research, right?

473
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:20,110
The be all and end all I think in this would be to show that if we make vision better, we're preventing what we want to prevent.

474
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:25,540
That is cognitive decline or dementia. There is no evidence yet to show that that is possible.

475
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:29,320
People just haven't done the work so we could think about it.

476
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:36,459
On correctable causes of vision loss, glaucoma. The intervention in that case would be some sort of vision rehabilitation that is,

477
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:41,290
training to help individuals use their remaining vision to the fullest extent possible,

478
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:47,890
giving them the best lighting possible, printing, high contrast materials, providing magnification, these kinds of things.

479
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:52,390
It's tough. Different people have different functional needs.

480
00:48:52,810 --> 00:49:00,670
Different people have different different amounts of contrast, loss versus acuity loss versus field loss.

481
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:07,780
This would be a really challenging study design. I think it's going the wrong way.

482
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:15,550
Yeah, but we think of a correctable vision loss, refractive error presbyopia the need for reading glasses in cataract.

483
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,680
The interventions are pretty well defined.

484
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,640
They're pretty much the same for everyone, even if the glasses prescription is different from person to person.

485
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:27,040
And so this is really the area where, where,

486
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:34,960
where I think focus ought to be and is in fact the area where where I am focusing with the number of of collaborative collaborators.

487
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:43,240
This is a trial that I'm a co-investigator on. It's being run jointly out of an institution in India and Queen's University, Belfast,

488
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:48,430
and we call it clever cognitive level enhancement provision exams and refraction.

489
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:50,530
I'm not clever enough to come up with that acronym,

490
00:49:51,820 --> 00:50:00,370
but what we are doing is providing older adults in need of glasses that have uncorrected or under corrected refractive error with glasses,

491
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:03,910
or they go on a waiting list and they get their glasses after the fact.

492
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:09,280
And we're tracking the cognitive trajectories of these two arms in South India.

493
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:16,750
And what we hope to be able to demonstrate is that by providing glasses, we're able to slow cognitive decline.

494
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:18,590
Now, there are a lot of issues there. Right.

495
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:24,280
And how are you going to test cognition to know that you're not just testing someone's vision, their ability to see the cognitive test?

496
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:30,490
And so we're thinking about how to use tests that have no visual stimulus while

497
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:34,510
also measuring hearing to know that people can hear us as we administer the test,

498
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:37,990
because if they're not visual stimuli, they're likely auditory stimuli.

499
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:43,030
And so we're trying to account for all of those things. There is actually some interesting research, though,

500
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:54,100
out of out of Johns Hopkins that showed that perhaps there is less of an effect attributable to vision in cognitive, in visual.

501
00:50:54,210 --> 00:51:01,800
Stimuli cognitive tests than one might expect. But that said, we're still kind of accounting for this this potential confounding issue.

502
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:06,890
How do you deal with people? System to classes.

503
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:14,030
Why then? Well, I mean, if they tell us they're not going to wear glasses, then they're they're not eligible for the trial.

504
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:17,300
Right. If they have no interest in the intervention, they're eligible for the trial.

505
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,030
But we're also we're building in a periodic monitoring.

506
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:29,390
So we'll show up for unannounced visits, basically knock on the door, see if they're wearing their glasses, record that kind of data.

507
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:34,219
And, you know, hopefully our hope, of course, is that people see, hey,

508
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:39,140
when I wear my glasses that I can I can see the world better and therefore I'm going to wear them.

509
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:43,430
Obviously, there are cultural issues there and glasses are not quite as acceptable in all places.

510
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:52,940
We're doing this in an urban and semi-urban setting around Hyderabad in South India, and certainly in urban and peri urban areas.

511
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:57,710
In India, you see more glasses where you do if you go to rural areas where you essentially see none.

512
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:04,850
So there should be. We anticipate there'll be more sort of cultural acceptance, but we going to do these spot checks to see if people are wearing.

513
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:13,410
So I think this is the last, last slide here for second to last slide.

514
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:20,840
There are still quite a number of unresolved issues envisioned in aging, and some of these are that we just simply don't have the data.

515
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:23,370
In some places we need better epidemiological data.

516
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:31,290
We need to use some of this better epidemiological data, particularly when it's nested in studies of aging like it has to test mechanistic pathways.

517
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:35,549
We also need to better understand the influence of social determinants of health,

518
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:41,610
since we know that there are big inequities in terms of who was affected and how that affected plays out in daily life.

519
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:48,240
And then there are these interesting scientific questions. Does the cause of vision impairment matter for some of these downstream consequences?

520
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:53,010
Does age of onset matter? Maybe if you become impaired younger, you adapt.

521
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:58,530
We don't have great data to work to guide us there. Does intervening improve systemic health?

522
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:01,880
But we were just talking about and does preventative eye care matter?

523
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:05,160
And this is really important both in the US and globally.

524
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:11,490
The preventative task force here in the United States does not recommend universal eye exams because we just haven't shown them good

525
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:18,840
enough evidence that preventative eye care may be helpful for averting vision loss or even non visual consequences of vision loss.

526
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:28,799
And so we need to really be mindful of generating that data. So in summary, vision impairment is is largely consequent,

527
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:34,650
concentrated in older populations and the number impacted is growing due to changing demographics.

528
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:41,680
The most common causes are really readily addressable and have really far reaching consequences.

529
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:46,440
It's important that we care about how people see the World Vision is and is important for vision sake,

530
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:50,670
but it's also important for so many other reasons. Thank you, guys.

531
00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:09,760
You may have questions. In your own practice in the you do you see or expect to see a higher rate of younger older adults with

532
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:16,870
cognitive impairment or the need for intervention because of our changing how pervasive screens are.

533
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:20,630
And you simply can't walk outside as much as I can.

534
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:26,499
Yes. I mean, the whole screen thing is largely as soon as you see your work,

535
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:30,790
it doesn't matter if you made a book or a screen, write something up close increases.

536
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:34,450
And there's really good evidence out of East Asia about this. And I'll tell you why in a sec.

537
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:39,310
But there's it increases the rate of nearsightedness.

538
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:44,469
You're wearing glasses. My guess is you're nearsighted. If you're wearing glasses, to look at you from the back of the room.

539
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:49,000
I'm nearsighted. Also pretty nearsighted. Like I'll walk into the wall on the way out of the room for not wearing my glasses.

540
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:55,420
But I am totally functional. I can drive, I can do surgery, I can, you know, I can do everything right sports.

541
00:54:57,490 --> 00:55:05,860
So, you know, that doesn't really as long as we're addressing refractive error and getting glasses to the people that need them,

542
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:12,339
then I think we're okay from that point of view with the caveat that really high nearsightedness,

543
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:17,409
like really, really extreme magnitudes of nearsightedness, can have other consequences.

544
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:20,050
But we're now talking about kind of like the very far end of the tale.

545
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:24,100
A lot of that evidence comes out of East Asia because if you go back two generations ago,

546
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:30,100
farsightedness was really common in East Asian populations, probably because of some genetic predisposition.

547
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:37,210
And so there are some other consequences having to do with being very far sighted, but it was highly prevalent there.

548
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:48,009
And what we saw in just the course of a generation is that the epidemiology totally changed, particularly in more highly developed areas of East Asia,

549
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:56,020
like Taiwan and Singapore, Hong Kong, where the prevalence of nearsightedness now is astronomically high.

550
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:00,280
There was a study of Taiwanese military recruits that we're talking about.

551
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:06,310
These were young men aged like 18 to 20 and like 95% were nearsighted.

552
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:11,230
Two generations ago it would have been extremely low and you would have had a lot of farsightedness.

553
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:15,549
And this is really I see some chuckles from around the room.

554
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:22,420
This is really, really attributed to your work. And there have been some even been some interventional trials kind of prescribing outdoor

555
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:29,809
activity in Singapore for for for slowing the rate of your side of of of development,

556
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:34,290
of nearsightedness. I am.

557
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,420
So I'm just mute and I'm getting into having to wear glasses more and more.

558
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:42,450
I know for me they are not a solution. They are a pain in the neck.

559
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:48,029
Yeah. I can't do things I usually do because they fall off or I can't even do activities,

560
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:51,269
physical activity as well because I you know, they're not there's clunky.

561
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:55,530
They're really not well-designed. I don't think, as an apparatus on your face.

562
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:01,110
And I think you can't see like out on the edge. So I think they're very problematic.

563
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:06,040
And I would wonder if that's why people don't want them or don't the uptake in using glasses.

564
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,320
Yeah. You know, I think it's a there's been some qualitative work to really delve into, you know,

565
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:14,729
why people in settings particularly where people just a lot of it's been in schoolchildren

566
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:18,209
right you do a school based intervention you give out a bunch of pairs of glasses,

567
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:23,520
think you're doing a great thing and then you come back and nobody's wearing them. Yeah, some of them broke them or lost them.

568
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,480
Right. But a lot of it is. Some of it I think is that is comfort.

569
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,870
Definitely is that some of it's also social acceptability, right?

570
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:34,080
There are a lot of places around the world where glasses just aren't worn.

571
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:38,999
I was in Kenya last week and I can be with my colleagues in the university in Nairobi and

572
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,470
you see people wearing glasses probably in similar proportions to this room right here.

573
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:49,200
But then you go out into a village in rural Kenya and literally not a single person is wearing glasses.

574
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:52,229
Now, there's going to be less nearsightedness for the reasons we just talked about.

575
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:59,580
Everybody's outside, they're farmers, etc. But the older people saw the glasses to see how close nobody's wearing glasses.

576
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:05,579
So a lot of it is social acceptability. I think some of it is like you become used to it.

577
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:13,620
I mean, I like I'm like an avid athlete and like you, I do a lot of that, like heavy physical activity and like glasses don't bother me at all.

578
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:22,140
Certainly some of it's getting used to as well. You can also work like contact lenses for near a bifocal contact lenses work.

579
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:28,950
So there are other options. But yeah, it's probably not a perfect you're probably not a perfect solution.

580
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:41,340
Mm hmm. I guess like so I'm surprised that the US Prevention Services Taskforce, like, I'm also a medical school.

581
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:47,729
Okay. I don't. I mean, I remember those that, like, eye exams aren't part of it, but yeah, I guess like,

582
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:52,290
why is it that like that seems like a really low hanging fruit to like, go after.

583
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:57,650
It's just like totally the task force, just like especially with like the diabetes epidemic, right?

584
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:01,709
The fact that we do like monofilament exams on a regular basis, but we're like not measuring people's eyes.

585
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:06,010
So like, why don't we just I mean, that seems like an obvious place. So in diabetics.

586
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:12,419
So, I mean, there are carve outs. So when people who are diabetic, definitely it's recommended to have an invasive no question,

587
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:15,959
because they have a priori like a major risk factor for vision impairment.

588
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:26,400
Right. So that is recommended by the by the task force. The update recommendations, which came out earlier this year, basically say it, I wrote it,

589
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:34,170
it was published in in one of the JAMA network journals, and I would invite a commentary on it actually pertaining specifically to older adults.

590
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:41,489
And the updated non recommendation basically just says there's not evidence, right?

591
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:47,969
So there's evidence if you have an eye disease, right, you have glaucoma, you should see an eye doctor to slow down that disease process.

592
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:55,410
Like that's that's fine. Like everybody accepts that. But if you are just older, which is a risk factor, we know from any eye diseases,

593
00:59:56,010 --> 01:00:02,010
the evidence is not there that having a regular eye exam is going to prevent you from losing vision in the future.

594
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:08,129
And you're not like that cognitive like look, somehow like, you know, like phrasing it around like, oh,

595
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:14,620
this might like increase your risk of like dementia or like put you on this path toward like developing dementia.

596
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:21,060
That would be like that's not something very, very well from a preventative task force point of view of might be viable,

597
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:28,400
but we have to provide the interventional evidence that that that level one evidence to show that if we intervene if we

598
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:34,350
see older adults in the in the office provide them with the eyeglasses they need or the cataract surgery that they need,

599
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:38,549
and we slow cognitive decline subsequently. That might be enough.

600
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:42,900
Yes. But you know, those trials are ongoing, right? That trial is ongoing.

601
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:48,780
So, yeah, I mean, work just has to be done to show them that. I think intuitively we know that vision matters.

602
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:52,200
We know that there's a lot of older adults with vision impairment even in this country,

603
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:58,979
that as older adults become even older, the oldest old is the fastest growing segment of the population.

604
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:04,320
Right. The 85 plus years where almost 50% have vision impairment.

605
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:10,410
We know much of this is correctable. Intuitively, we know that it matters that we should be seeing them and correcting what can be corrected.

606
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:12,930
But we just have to provide the evidence.

607
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:18,840
And I think the vision research community is just been has not done enough to do so even if it seems intuitive to us.

608
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:25,410
Yeah. Any other questions?

609
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:34,570
Wonderful. If anybody has questions or thoughts that come up afterwards, please feel free to reach out my emails right here.

610
01:01:35,470 --> 01:01:40,180
And if there are any resources that be helpful, I'm happy to share, you know, links, papers, that kind of a topic.

611
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:44,770
Thank you so much. My pleasure. My pleasure.

612
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:50,390
All right. Well, think about it. You know, our tend to remember hearing loss.

613
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:56,120
That's true. I think it has to.

614
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:02,830
Why is it so expensive?

615
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:08,050
Sometimes. Some of the gold. So it's a caveat.

616
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:14,870
Much of the genetic population is.

617
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:25,380
Come on. Accounted the difference compared to other similar we can come temperatures just a minute.

618
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:38,420
Yeah but when we get to do that worth of work in their fingers crossed.

619
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:40,590
Yeah what does I get really.

620
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:55,050
You know the data said I mean you got a say this is exactly management to me and just hearing those things as much as we can and helping.

621
01:02:55,420 --> 01:03:02,850
I think that patient said to me, like, if we're making this like.

622
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:08,520
The City Council meets in a.

623
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:14,470
Be really supportive. They just had like a half weakness.

624
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:23,420
And so I don't think they need like, you know, bundles or something halfway decent because I would be so great to be terrific.

625
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:33,410
Fruit also serves as sort of a center, for example, sort of to catalyze that kind of growth and.

626
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:40,480
I appreciate and thank you so much for your help with all the calculations.

627
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:50,270
And I do wish you the very best to get around Gary, because I just want to make sure that isn't happening because.

628
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:53,480
Yes. So this is a pandemic puzzle. Yeah, yeah.

629
01:03:53,940 --> 01:04:00,360
Yeah. I guess it's just the problem with driving. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

630
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:08,920
Oh, for sure. For sure. I guess for you. Anyway, I have you know, I have to speak to you and I'm sure that.

631
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:14,000
I'm sure that. Right. Well, thank you very much.

632
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,050
Who else you know that you know was supported by everyone?

633
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:49,410
I think you. And the children must remain in.

634
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:15,690
So why was it important?

635
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:34,310
I was trying to figure out if we could use the Internet, if we could display it from.

636
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,580
But I know that I've never done it before.

637
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:41,760
So, yeah, there's it's just a different name.

638
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:56,420
But if you want to do it from all kinds of switches, from a laptop to a laptop to the kitchen table with laptop computers,

639
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:08,640
it's I think it's only they can do it where you can say, like, Oh, that's my friend or students is doing it for us.

640
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:15,040
That's all it takes. Yeah. Looks like it's. Yeah, I know.

641
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:18,590
Like, I've seen people do it before, but I just don't know how they do it.

642
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:26,170
Oh, you know about in here, but at the end of last year, it's okay.

643
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:31,060
That's okay. I'll just like, pull it up because it's can't.

644
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:38,880
Yeah. What you're talking about.

645
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,830
Oh, thank you so much for this.

646
01:06:43,850 --> 01:06:46,860
Time for each other. It's just we have sex. I see. Yeah.

647
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:54,740
So it was great for me, but I think they don't have the same segregation or contrasting the different.

648
01:06:54,890 --> 01:07:00,130
I could just say it's just showing up after just a morning.

649
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:16,290
But I guess, you know, I try to keep in mind interaction.

650
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:21,870
I don't get the association.

651
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:27,700
Hello? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, it's.

652
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:39,230
Yeah. Just cause I want to. That's so interesting.

653
01:07:39,410 --> 01:07:47,120
Yeah, I hope I didn't realize that this was going to be the only hearing loss.

654
01:07:47,570 --> 01:07:54,530
All presentations and hopefully it's good enough. Expert witness we will.

655
01:07:55,250 --> 01:08:06,220
Yeah. You. Not much you can.

656
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:19,760
Yeah. Yeah, that's true. During a visit to students, the majors said, I want to give thanks to.

657
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:29,320
Right. So there is a couple of announcements I just want to make.

658
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:40,690
Okay. All right. And this is 5% of the genetic component to the present directed side effects.

659
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:46,300
Because I just I had it was like that for Josh. So I just have to use the same.

660
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:53,130
You might almost be talking anything you want to talk with you.

661
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:57,840
Oh, I have to do that.

662
01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:08,320
So ten years? Yeah. I'm like, okay, I don't need this table.

663
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:13,080
I need someone to. So you know John Doe.

664
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:29,310
For you Lindsay reading last semester yet again this is what you and.

665
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:35,940
The poll results and now.

666
01:09:38,870 --> 01:09:48,390
Yeah. You know, I thought we weren't even sure because I thought that was.

667
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:54,990
Oh, yeah, I thought it wasn't available. Oh, right, right, right.

668
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:58,430
Yeah. Did you that.

669
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:21,410
You can't do reality TV or something that's going to blow your brains.

670
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:37,460
Think. The only thing I found. You're the only person.

671
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:55,640
Now in the model. If you read my first run through civil society, charter school formation is not very broad.

672
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:59,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

673
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:11,630
I don't know. I think I have a lot of similar people and I will say that that's why I was laughing when I was like.

674
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:26,820
Bad news wasn't bad. So we automatically agreed that suggestions expressed over something as opposed to

675
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:36,450
say You find my way through was really interesting because it's all a letters time.

676
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:58,379
I wanted you to have some fun. Yeah, we had all the things I had to learn as I would because, you know, when I was saying, Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah.

677
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:01,600
You know, we're into the past relationships.

678
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:08,520
And then we realized that this was very much a central setting.

679
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:17,620
Yeah, I was. Well, I didn't really like it.

680
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:25,970
It has gotten to the point that I was like, I don't want to have.

681
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,830
Isn't that amazing?

682
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:40,090
Like, yes, I do. You know, because I was I was like, you know, personalize.

683
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:43,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, now that I got that.

684
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:48,780
Oh, yeah, yeah.

685
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:51,790
I just. I really like that.

686
01:12:52,110 --> 01:13:01,020
I really like what I say. I don't want to labor here because the trees are there to take responsibility for, right?

687
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:06,450
Yeah. So what about that? I'm going to let you write all this later.

688
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:19,590
I'm trying to find a little bit longer areas of your life insurance, that compound interest.

689
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:33,030
But I was in junior high, and it wasn't something that, you know, that was just there, but those of us.

690
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:48,740
So, yeah, we are. So, you know, but I think this is a simple change that has.

691
01:13:54,320 --> 01:14:03,870
But then it happened. All right.

692
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:08,410
So we're going to shift gears a little bit and shift now into thinking about hearing impairment.

693
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:14,169
Not just going to be presenting one of the papers, but it's really tied up, I think,

694
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:17,200
with some really interesting policy things and changes that are going on right now.

695
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:24,850
Just a quick announcement. We are we have three more classes.

696
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:28,570
I have two more participation assignments.

697
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:34,130
And what I'm going to do is say don't do anymore participation assignments for the rest of the class.

698
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:43,000
I'll just give everybody four points for them. The reason why I'm doing this is because I've never, in all my years of teaching,

699
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,709
had such a class that's been disengaged and authentically engaged with materials.

700
01:14:47,710 --> 01:14:49,300
And it's an amazing job.

701
01:14:50,650 --> 01:14:59,920
And I just I think, in a way, if you met, your participation in the criminal justice world will cancel all those duties and focus on that.

702
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
You can focus on the paper and your other capacities. Thank you.

703
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:10,360
Thank you for the reflections.

704
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:13,660
I think that's one of my favorite assignments in all my classes,

705
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:21,940
really engaging and thinking more about what we're reading and our other being able to put in our other classes.

706
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:31,240
So that stuff that you guys put in there is just a joy and I just look forward to reading it and I really, really enjoy that amazing stuff in there.

707
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:39,900
So I just, you know, it's like I really like the last to to on the little I know.

708
01:15:42,530 --> 01:15:47,950
Yeah, it was funny. All right.

709
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:50,080
I'll read to you that. Okay.

710
01:15:50,890 --> 01:16:01,030
So the paper I'll be reviewing is called Can Hearing AIDS DeLay DeLay Time to Diagnosis of Dementia, Depression, or Falls in Older Adults.

711
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:20,840
Um, so some background, I think in one of the other papers that we read, I learned that hearing loss really occurs from the moment you're born.

712
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:26,530
It's just like a very slow trajectory that speeds up in middle age.

713
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:35,560
So it typically occurs in the forties and the prevalence tends to increase with age from there.

714
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:46,600
About one in three people age 65 and older are affected by significant hearing loss.

715
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:55,990
And however, less than 30% of those with hearing loss have ever used to hearing aids even

716
01:16:55,990 --> 01:17:01,960
just once and even fewer than that are able to use hearing aids consistently.

717
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:16,690
And so while there is evidence that hearing loss negatively affects health outcomes, like I think we saw in Dr. Erlich's slides,

718
01:17:16,930 --> 01:17:28,960
evidence of increased risk of dementia and other, there are other health outcomes also like mental health, cognitive function, things like that.

719
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:40,930
There's conflicting research on whether the use of hearing aids can impact health outcomes positively.

720
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:49,629
Some studies show improved cognitive function and slower cognitive decline with the use of hearing aids,

721
01:17:49,630 --> 01:17:57,190
while others have found no significant differences in cognitive outcomes or mental health outcomes.

722
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:08,830
So the purpose of this study was to examine the association between hearing aid use and time to diagnosis for the following three outcomes,

723
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:14,440
which were Alzheimer's and dementia, anxiety and depression, and falls resulting in injury.

724
01:18:15,010 --> 01:18:22,749
And there are a second study aim that they didn't really explicitly state was to

725
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:30,070
examine the risk associated with hearing aid use with the same three outcomes.

726
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:41,290
So the authors used claims data from 2008 to 2016 from a national private insurance claims database.

727
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:51,640
Their sample consisted of patients age 66 and older with incident hearing loss diagnoses from 2008 to 2013,

728
01:18:52,810 --> 01:19:01,120
and then for their exclusion criteria, they excluded patients with previous.

729
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:07,620
This in diagnoses of the outcomes within 12 months per of the index hearing loss diagnosis.

730
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:18,599
They also excluded anyone with less than 12 months or less than 12 months of continuous enrollment

731
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:24,240
prior to the index date and less than three years of continuous enrollment after the index date.

732
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:30,210
So they had to have at least four years of continuous enrollment.

733
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:42,209
So for their model specifications, their main exposure was hearing adverse outcomes for Alzheimer's disease,

734
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:46,620
dementia, anxiety, depression and fall resulting in injury.

735
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:57,239
And these were ascertained using ICD 910 codes covariates that they adjusted for included age, sex, race, ethnicity,

736
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:07,770
US Census Division and co-morbidities that patients had within 12 months prior to their hearing loss diagnosis.

737
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:15,540
These included hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular conditions and high cholesterol.

738
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:26,659
For their analysis, they use Kaplan-meier product limit survival curves to estimate times a diagnosis with log rank

739
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:32,070
tests for the proportional hazards assumption and to test for differences in survival curves.

740
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:41,810
And they also used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios for the effective hearing aid use on the outcomes.

741
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:48,230
So the average age of the sample was about 76 years old.

742
01:20:49,130 --> 01:21:04,130
12.3% of the sample had hearing aids, 11% females in the sample had hearing aids compared to 13% of males.

743
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:12,350
And that was significantly different from each other, males versus females.

744
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:23,719
13.6% of white patients had hearing aids, compared to 9.8% black and 6.5% Hispanic patients.

745
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:27,680
And those were all. Again, significant differences.

746
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:35,650
And for co-morbidities, those with hearing aids had significantly higher prevalence of hypertension,

747
01:21:35,660 --> 01:21:40,240
high cholesterol and diabetes compared to those without hearing aids.

748
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:48,660
And so for the results here, I'm going to start with the survival curves.

749
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:53,490
This first one is the curve for Alzheimer's and dementia.

750
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:57,000
So you can see that survival is out here.

751
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:07,650
Can't see it. Survival is on the Y axis and the number of days to diagnosis is on the x axis.

752
01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:17,490
The red line on the top represents those who are considered hearing aid users, and the blue dashed line below represents those without hearing aids.

753
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:27,810
So for this outcome, Alzheimer's and dementia, you can see that hearing aid users have slightly higher survival than non hearing aid users.

754
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:41,520
And the long logarithmic test above shows that the differences marginally significant people's 8.05 pretty much for anxiety and depression.

755
01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:50,010
Hearing aid users again have higher survival, and this difference is highly significant.

756
01:22:50,910 --> 01:23:02,850
And for falls resulting in injury hearing aid users again have significantly higher survival compared to those who are not using hearing aids.

757
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:12,060
Results from the Cox regression model show that hearing aid users had significantly lower risks for

758
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:23,190
each outcome ranges from about 11% for anxiety and depression to 18% for Alzheimer's and dementia,

759
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:27,660
lower risk compared to non hearing aid users.

760
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:37,200
And you can see that that relationship is still evident in the non adjusted models, unadjusted models.

761
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:49,889
So strengths for the study included the large sample size and longitudinal data due to using the large national private

762
01:23:49,890 --> 01:24:00,270
insurance claims data and also using this data allowed them to examine people who actually had access to and use hearing aids.

763
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:11,280
And they also, um, well, I'll get to the sensitivity analysis in a minute, but in terms of limitations,

764
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:17,970
the claims data had a lack of socioeconomic information like education and income,

765
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:25,920
as well as lifestyle factors that may affect that relationship between hearing aid use and health outcomes,

766
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:36,090
such as like social isolation, things like that. There were also some issues of measurement error or information bias,

767
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:44,550
so the data they used did not have any measures of frequency or duration of hearing loss,

768
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:56,820
which means that the authors had to assume that those who obtained hearing aids also use them consistently, which we know is often not the case.

769
01:24:58,350 --> 01:25:02,130
And there were also no measures of hearing loss severity.

770
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:08,280
So the authors assume that the majority of their sample had moderate to severe hearing loss,

771
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:16,200
which may or may not be true, considering that only 12% of the sample actually used hearing aids.

772
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:30,329
So one of the other limitations, I think, was that they went to one of their exclusion criteria.

773
01:25:30,330 --> 01:25:40,650
They excluded people who did not have three years of continuous enrollment after their index hearing loss diagnosis,

774
01:25:41,790 --> 01:25:52,410
which I think may be excluding people who may have died prematurely or may have changed providers or something like that.

775
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:57,840
So I think that could result in some selection bias.

776
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:11,790
But the authors did do a sensitivity analysis and found that no, there were no significant changes with the propensity score matching.

777
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:17,520
In terms of significance of this paper,

778
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:28,200
it contributes to the conflicting research out there that hearing aids are are associated with improved health outcomes, specifically that,

779
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:35,850
you know, the use of hearing aids reduces the risk and delays onset of diseases such as Alzheimer's,

780
01:26:35,850 --> 01:26:40,920
dementia, anxiety, depression and and falls among older adults.

781
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:54,510
It also those results provides evidence that can be used to advocate to patients who may be considering getting a hearing aid for their hearing loss.

782
01:26:55,470 --> 01:27:01,150
It also the paper also. Evidence of gender and racial ethnic disparities,

783
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:10,800
which I think can be used to advocate for programs and interventions that are tailored for these groups with lower prevalence of hearing aids use.

784
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:21,850
And this paper was also cited in support of the recent landmark ruling by the FDA that allowed for hearing aids to be sold over the counter.

785
01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:27,520
And for our discussion questions.

786
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:42,180
The first one is how do you think hearing aid hearing aid use differs globally and how would that then affect health outcomes?

787
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:50,490
What further research would you like to see done to further examine the associations between hearing aid use and health outcomes?

788
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:56,970
And how do you think over-the-counter hearing aids will affect health outcomes over the next few decades?

789
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:04,240
That's it. Can you take us back just one slide?

790
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:07,690
Yes. Going to have any questions?

791
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:11,919
I can't remember if it was in this paper or another one where they talked about

792
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:17,110
like like PDA to use like personal devices that aren't regulated by the FDA.

793
01:28:17,710 --> 01:28:22,750
Like they're like where you can. I mean, I assume that they're like little like kind of like headphones that you're like,

794
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:26,590
like a little microphone, like someone can I kind of yell into. Yeah. Just like,

795
01:28:26,590 --> 01:28:39,670
was there any do we have any research around like whether those are like as effective as hearing aids and decreasing rates of dementia diseases?

796
01:28:39,790 --> 01:28:43,540
I'm not sure I haven't looked into that.

797
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:50,550
But it I, I'm not sure how common the use of those devices are.

798
01:28:50,590 --> 01:28:53,870
I have seen them around, but a lot.

799
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:58,720
Yeah. Yeah. Because they're so cheap and like, hearing aids are so cost prohibitive.

800
01:28:58,990 --> 01:29:04,840
Yeah. But I feel like it's like, kind of like you're asking the question about like what's usable, like are people actually going to use it?

801
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:08,980
And like, I think, like, because hearing aids are just absurd.

802
01:29:09,130 --> 01:29:12,880
They're not covered by insurance. Like, like people use these other things instead.

803
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:17,410
So like, maybe we should be studying the things that are actually affordable, like using.

804
01:29:18,130 --> 01:29:22,780
Yeah. I mean, it's going to be very interesting to see what happens with this new regulation that they're

805
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:27,819
now going to be supporting in hearing aids over the counter that as the cost the like?

806
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:32,320
Or is that just like giving you permission to buy expensive hearing aids without a prescription,

807
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:36,250
which like why don't you like why you believe that anyway? It's like insurance is going to cover it.

808
01:29:36,730 --> 01:29:46,930
I think it should the cost should come down because with before the FDA ruling,

809
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:58,750
I think part of the process was that you had to go to an audiologist and get like an official hearing test and provide like need for a hearing aid.

810
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:01,810
And that was not covered by insurance either.

811
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:06,910
So it will at least reduce those costs.

812
01:30:07,330 --> 01:30:12,280
And I think like the market for hearing aids is going to be much more competitive.

813
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:17,110
I think that's going to drive the price down also. Yeah. Because because they are prohibitively expensive.

814
01:30:17,710 --> 01:30:27,010
They are. Yeah. I think it might be interesting how much I mean, it was like, hey, do you think that's what I would think too?

815
01:30:27,010 --> 01:30:32,890
It's like that the market would become a more interesting.

816
01:30:33,070 --> 01:30:38,050
Yeah, I know that, like, some hearing aids have to be fitted for people.

817
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:42,730
Is that not the case for all the hearing aids? Then can they be generalized?

818
01:30:43,090 --> 01:30:49,330
I think that's going to be one of the issues with over-the-counter hearing aids is how do you

819
01:30:50,290 --> 01:30:58,119
like there may need to like develop a sort of hearing aid that is can be easily customized,

820
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:04,210
you know, by the person themselves or, um, you know, figure out a way to customize it.

821
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:09,430
Yeah. Hmm. Which is why they have those readers, the glasses at the pharmacy to like, you know,

822
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:14,110
there's different colors and your do this different test of right there and see which one you need.

823
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:22,600
Yeah. They can do something cool with them. I mean, you pointed out that I guess I'm covered by insurance and it hasn't been.

824
01:31:22,670 --> 01:31:31,930
It's it's just crazy. It's a criminal. I mean, I really think that it's especially because there's like such a good I mean, like, you know,

825
01:31:31,930 --> 01:31:38,889
we were just hearing about how, like, the evidence between cognition and vision is like still kind of like being passed out.

826
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:44,980
And yet, like eyeglasses are I don't wear glasses, so I don't know if they're conventions, but I think they are separate.

827
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:54,670
Yeah, you have to get vision. And but these like hearing has like so much more evidence around, like, the detrimental effects of people's hearing.

828
01:31:54,670 --> 01:32:01,810
Like how that's like. So just I just like so, so much anger towards insurance companies want to hear stuff like that.

829
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:12,040
I think I don't know if he's here, but like in the in China, it's actually covered by the insurance.

830
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:17,019
But the insurance only covers the domestically produced one.

831
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:21,460
And that one has like a life span, I believe, which was like around like it two.

832
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:29,440
It is and it's covered if you have like hearing loss or hearing impairment when you're blind.

833
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:32,380
So if you're really important and you have like those kind of issue,

834
01:32:32,770 --> 01:32:39,339
they give the parents like options to choose whether it's the one that you actually need to open as well.

835
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:44,250
And they put the cochlear implant and this is like not such a good, you know, method.

836
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:52,560
That's a reason like how parents choose to not to. But if you choose to use the important one, which is like, I believe, produced.

837
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:02,790
Some place that can cost you. There was a calculation they did and there was a round like so before,

838
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:10,410
like the kids teenager here, like the total was all the way up to like 30 k U.S. dollars.

839
01:33:11,370 --> 01:33:15,140
It's not like some of that everybody had bought. Yeah.

840
01:33:15,150 --> 01:33:20,850
And what the one that I see like domestically produced and has a lot of like side of things.

841
01:33:21,390 --> 01:33:28,890
So like a lot of people are saying that when they can plan like the hearing aid actually into their hearing, they hear those like you.

842
01:33:29,050 --> 01:33:36,740
Noise that they just can't get rid of. And that's a lot of reasons why it really has to be a.

843
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:43,700
Just feels like institutionalized ageism. Really?

844
01:33:49,550 --> 01:33:54,950
Yeah, it is. I mean, I think these these are the structural things that we've been talking about in the closet throughout is, you know,

845
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:57,920
one of the policies in place where the programs in place to support,

846
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:05,000
even here in health and with the social determinants of whether people actually use hearing aids or have access to them.

847
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:12,370
You know, why is it that there is these gender and race differences in in the use?

848
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:21,180
Mm hmm. What do you what's what do you think is behind some of all that those differences.

849
01:34:25,370 --> 01:34:30,350
In terms of racial and ethnic differences.

850
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:37,570
I mean, the differences in this study were there were small but significant.

851
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:49,580
But I would think like, uh, outside of the study, it would definitely be affected by socioeconomic factors like health insurance coverage,

852
01:34:49,580 --> 01:35:01,970
like in getting insurance from an employer's income, access to health care, things like that.

853
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:08,090
Um. Yeah.

854
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:11,750
The gender differences. I'm not sure. Yeah.

855
01:35:11,990 --> 01:35:15,049
Was it women wearing them more than men or they were?

856
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:20,300
Yeah. Women. Women less than men. Women less than men. Yeah, I think it's a vanity maybe.

857
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:44,420
Yeah. Oh, I can see that one woman wearing black is less likely to wear two these because there's still some consistent like household structures.

858
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:47,660
That means taking the dominant role in terms of financing.

859
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:52,790
And if this is like something you can get out of your pocket and you get into a debate,

860
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:59,930
and then if the woman is not economically independent like everybody else that are raising the money, talk about it the next day.

861
01:36:00,170 --> 01:36:04,460
I don't think you can. Mm hmm. Especially with the expense.

862
01:36:04,890 --> 01:36:10,100
Yeah. Okay.

863
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:18,679
So let's pull up your great discussion, Crystal, and let's break up into small groups of a mental unit four or five like we did before.

864
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:22,460
And you can, you know, pick one or try and get through them all.

865
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:28,220
There's some really good some good questions here, some great fodder for discussion.

866
01:36:28,670 --> 01:36:45,290
So do that for about 10 minutes. Your parents are staying up here to do a great job.

867
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:50,540
If you want to join the group. Oh, I think.

868
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:57,170
Just go through it. Okay. Well, one of the things I was trying to figure out what's going on here.

869
01:36:57,290 --> 01:37:05,780
I just love how they know in these claims data and just really using, you know, how to be identified.

870
01:37:07,910 --> 01:37:15,380
I think because because of this insurance that partially covered the cost of a hearing aid.

871
01:37:15,390 --> 01:37:24,340
So they likely. Oh, I know. Yeah. So if they like, covered it at all, then that was their assumption that they got it here.

872
01:37:24,350 --> 01:37:29,810
Okay. Okay. So that's really why this is such a database for us like that.

873
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:34,440
Yeah, it was really there was like, I think called for that. They were able to do something.

874
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:38,149
Yeah. Obviously so yeah.

875
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:41,900
Yeah. For the if they want to explain about the exchange.

876
01:37:43,750 --> 01:37:52,580
So yeah, I mean I think I wrote that it was, I said, you know, it was just like if you like.

877
01:37:54,830 --> 01:37:59,660
Yeah. I mean your idea that it's kind of dating right now, you can relate to this paper.

878
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:02,959
Yeah. Yeah. In this country.

879
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:15,200
But it was interesting and the sort of people I was going to call this, a lot of people wanted to read interesting little.

880
01:38:16,370 --> 01:38:19,639
Yeah. The little old chronicle. Yeah. In the beginning.

881
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:23,670
But it was like, oh, no, no, no, no. Yeah. Okay.

882
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:33,740
Yeah. I still have a lot of reading to be is going to see more more spending more.

883
01:38:34,070 --> 01:38:37,550
Do you have any thoughts on the answers? I don't know.

884
01:38:39,630 --> 01:38:45,280
So I think the how much I have the power to receive more,

885
01:38:45,290 --> 01:38:51,800
it's hard to know because I guess maybe I should avoid the policies that global in terms of the first question.

886
01:38:52,400 --> 01:39:05,840
But I think she mentioned that here a few other things have been there, covers, you know, for certain plants or maybe other human needs.

887
01:39:07,730 --> 01:39:22,070
So I think that using hearing aids from birth, you know, with so many of these and I know like France is like a higher death population is more.

888
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:30,059
Yeah, I know, I know. And I think I think it also they have like so many like institutions like deaf institutions.

889
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:33,350
There is so much. Yeah.

890
01:39:33,950 --> 01:39:41,120
So I'm not sure but I, I mean like I said he hasn't done is,

891
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:46,490
he gave us a little notice that pressure that if there is an extra generations of findings that

892
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:52,200
this is like a variable or just because it's like he was probably excited grandfather treatment.

893
01:39:52,540 --> 01:40:03,800
Yeah to get like and I mean the treatment hearing loss are not even I think the here is not that there's only hearing aids or

894
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:12,709
there's like that audio amplification like talking or microphone cochlear implants or like like for this particular type of,

895
01:40:12,710 --> 01:40:15,970
for example, cochlear implant. Me Right.

896
01:40:16,490 --> 01:40:23,270
And that's where it is on the horizon because I'm willing to do that.

897
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:34,110
So, so I don't think I, I don't think it was you know we're not hearing or treatments are that we're definitely not as easily accessible as is.

898
01:40:34,610 --> 01:40:35,910
Yeah. Yeah that's true.

899
01:40:36,410 --> 01:40:45,850
Unless this hearing this discovery some more like class and I know I was thinking I was like you know how they have like the blood pressure machines.

900
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:51,080
I was thinking they have a little booth with headphones and check your hearing.

901
01:40:51,230 --> 01:40:55,760
Yeah. Right. Which hearing I do need to buy. Yeah. Yeah, right.

902
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:59,240
Right. I don't do this kind of thing. I them. That's a great idea.

903
01:41:00,830 --> 01:41:07,360
It is cool, I wonder. But I have, I guess I don't have this over the counter and like so what,

904
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:15,730
you know what stage they are with this process of bringing it know I think the like just of things that maybe

905
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:23,960
this a few months ago and I think I read that like are this should be in effect by the end of this year.

906
01:41:24,860 --> 01:41:35,330
But I think in effect being that you can go to your like like like companies will be able to like I'll put their products sales.

907
01:41:35,570 --> 01:41:37,870
I don't know, you know, like I think.

908
01:41:38,010 --> 01:41:45,780
Going to be able to do that for us, you know, because of it, there's a lot of like figuring out how you get people.

909
01:41:46,530 --> 01:41:50,819
Like how many tailor it to people and help people find the right one?

910
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:54,750
Or do they just make one that's, like, broad for everybody? Yeah.

911
01:41:55,830 --> 01:42:00,860
The first question I ask is going to be around like I wanted it to look like.

912
01:42:01,140 --> 01:42:10,740
It's not like my grandfather just decided by insisting that he hasn't seen a hearing aid.

913
01:42:10,740 --> 01:42:16,850
And I know my dad used to have one, but yeah, so this is like really big.

914
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:21,420
But the ones I've seen recently are pretty small, like this whole thing.

915
01:42:21,450 --> 01:42:26,300
So people like this guy, I think, yeah, this is.

916
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:32,720
I don't know. It's also like everyone is wearing like headphones now or, you know, whatever, you know,

917
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:38,450
you know and I know like AirPods, I also believe that that's like a kind of a qualification thing.

918
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:44,570
Yeah. Somehow I'm not sure how, but I've seen, I've seen like videos and some.

919
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:48,110
But, um, yeah, it's.

920
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:53,610
Do you think there's a stigma around here? Oh, yeah, yeah.

921
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:59,159
Oh, he is discreet, but it's like sober and it's noticeable.

922
01:42:59,160 --> 01:43:05,860
And a lot of people like a lot of people that will change that overnight as opposed to wearing glasses.

923
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:11,460
Mhm. Eyeglasses. So it sounds like you think hearing aids are definitely noise for change.

924
01:43:12,810 --> 01:43:17,970
Yeah. Maybe this OTC hearing aid will change that that moment, it will happen.

925
01:43:18,450 --> 01:43:22,830
Yeah. No, it's not. Sorry. Yeah.

926
01:43:23,580 --> 01:43:31,020
I wish that I see my husband because I usually disappear and do this over the country.

927
01:43:31,020 --> 01:43:34,560
You know, you don't get a lot of it for what his day to day life is.

928
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:40,060
He's talking about actually going forward is so different.

929
01:43:40,410 --> 01:43:44,170
I think there's such a in what I don't know.

930
01:43:44,190 --> 01:43:49,590
And it's like I heard, you know, as people get older, the statistics that they'll lose their hearing, they lose their patience.

931
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:53,820
Normally don't do anything about it. Yeah. Don't do anything to sleep.

932
01:43:53,820 --> 01:43:57,500
Yeah. Correct. Yeah. Or like help, you know, help here.

933
01:43:57,930 --> 01:44:03,470
Or it's just assumed that under normal and that's why there has been a pandemic.

934
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:09,480
I think people do that with vision loss to like cataracts or I want to do surgery and just live with.

935
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:17,850
I think for a friend of mine, I think that's so much about eating is just interest, you know,

936
01:44:18,930 --> 01:44:25,379
it's something you're like, I think what Josh was saying about it just takes a lot of time as well.

937
01:44:25,380 --> 01:44:33,360
Like it's a high. It's exhausting to manage aging and hearing loss, vision, loss abilities, limitations.

938
01:44:34,050 --> 01:44:37,360
I think you just gave a fashion vocabulary. Yeah.

939
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:45,660
You fix it. Yeah. So like with Medicare, I can't imagine it's easy to get coverage for everything.

940
01:44:46,230 --> 01:44:51,480
Just getting like being able to get treatments in a timely fashion is a little.

941
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:58,100
I'm only some assistance you have so they don't have like there's like they have this new thing is,

942
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:01,500
you know, something that they might achieve after this hearing.

943
01:45:01,740 --> 01:45:12,479
QUESTION Obviously you asked about five years ago. In other news, do you have any idea everyone gets it that obviously yeah.

944
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:20,010
So I get it when I go to my family doctor him I don't know why I just go to UHC but I've never really developed.

945
01:45:20,010 --> 01:45:26,540
Yeah, really. Yeah. I'm getting it in if it's going to be you know it's always I would.

946
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Oh no. But I know I have very well I know it saddening but I don't say it and everything I try to is I don't know, I don't want to.

947
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:47,100
Yeah. I think there's also like even if you do say it, you know, I'm sure doctors or you know, they're like walnuts and you know.

948
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:54,090
Yeah, right. Yeah. It's easy to brush them, but I mean, that's an assumption that I'm making.

949
01:45:54,240 --> 01:46:01,500
Yeah, I think it's true when I go get my eyes checked, then I just like feeling all these.

950
01:46:01,510 --> 01:46:04,350
Yeah, I really want you to do something. You've got to go in there surgically.

951
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:10,830
I said, Well, I was asking you about that, like how many days or surgery that can be done.

952
01:46:10,900 --> 01:46:14,590
And like I said, I got a huge grant to start doing surgeries.

953
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:19,000
I thought I thought that I was looking for.

954
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:30,070
Yeah, I am like they have every time I go to my prescription gets themselves like slightly and I was like, is this normal?

955
01:46:30,210 --> 01:46:35,130
I thought it was supposed to be stable enough, you know, or just like, you know.

956
01:46:35,190 --> 01:46:40,330
Yeah, but I was like, this is like. I'm like a little bit worried about that.

957
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:46,790
I just get to be calm and like, okay, that's why if everyone.

958
01:46:47,060 --> 01:46:50,420
Yeah, right. Like this kind of normalizing it. Yeah.

959
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:56,420
I think that helps us illustrate the whole.

960
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:03,810
Just don't look. All right, let's just about reading.

961
01:47:03,830 --> 01:47:07,100
Share something that we have just a few minutes.

962
01:47:10,190 --> 01:47:11,809
I know they were just discussing.

963
01:47:11,810 --> 01:47:17,060
We had more of this kind of normalizing of aging where you expect to lose your hearing effectively, lose your vision.

964
01:47:17,150 --> 01:47:19,880
You when you think about it, when we're talking about treated, you know,

965
01:47:20,570 --> 01:47:26,630
asking for help and added to a lot of stigma around wearing hearing aids and things like that.

966
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:36,390
What about the kind of things that you just have? Huh?

967
01:47:38,190 --> 01:47:45,740
Oh, you're just saying that you I like having, like, more available devices running for them and vice versa.

968
01:47:47,050 --> 01:47:53,990
I was thinking maybe like more research done in like developing countries because I

969
01:47:54,220 --> 01:48:00,160
mentioned there are like a lot of fighters bias towards like hearing device and cultural,

970
01:48:00,260 --> 01:48:06,450
you know. But I mean, after all, everybody wanted to benefit from something.

971
01:48:06,460 --> 01:48:14,050
So if they can get benefit from the hearing device and they realized the device actually help with their life,

972
01:48:14,710 --> 01:48:23,200
then we can really see like they improve like quality among like those elderly people, even like within like, you know, younger population as well.

973
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:29,350
And to see how it really changed the health outcome and the overall like population health.

974
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:34,500
Yeah. So. I would have preferred to.

975
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:47,740
Well of we talks about a few different things, but I'm trying to think of which one.

976
01:48:48,170 --> 01:48:54,880
Well, okay. So we talked about how it'll be hard to figure out like.

977
01:48:55,830 --> 01:49:00,540
How like the over-the-counter hearing aid use will change outcomes,

978
01:49:00,540 --> 01:49:07,439
like because there's a lot of hope in it, but like the access to them, if they're going to be general,

979
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:22,800
like customizable, like an adjustable for people like and insurance, like how insurance and like paying for them is going to be worked out like.

980
01:49:27,110 --> 01:49:31,040
There's going to be a lot that needs to be worked on. Yeah.

981
01:49:31,460 --> 01:49:38,030
And I don't know if anyone else and whether there's any some professionals who could assist

982
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:46,309
to assist them to choose the right here massive because maybe over the counter that maybe

983
01:49:46,310 --> 01:49:53,900
the pharmacist didn't receive the right training before is a problem that's going to be so

984
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:58,580
important to train pharmacists to be able to then answer the questions about which are.
