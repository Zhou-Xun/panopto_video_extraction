1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:08,980
Okay. They said, Can you see us?

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,360
Yes. We see you?

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,990
Yep. I think it's good. Why is the front back? Hmm.

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,560
Sorry. We have a little technical issue here.

5
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,840
We can see you and your PowerPoint, but for some reason, we're not seeing us, which isn't the end of the world.

6
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,870
Maybe it's this. All right.

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,510
Well, I think we we we may not record us, but that's okay. I think as soon as getting you.

8
00:00:37,810 --> 00:02:07,530
Sorry about that. Thank you. They jump in might be.

9
00:02:07,530 --> 00:20:54,690
Best said, we're not going to have access to chat from the classroom. And.

10
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:56,230
Then. And.

11
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:14,830
It is 1211. So you're in good shape, I think.

12
00:44:14,760 --> 00:54:22,860
I have. Well, first, a round of applause for Dr. Richard.

13
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:31,906
Leaders need. And know this.
