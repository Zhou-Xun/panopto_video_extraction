1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:10,170
In this module, we're going to be talking about how to build capacity for learning about diversity and how to engage in difficult dialogues

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,240
that often come up when we are talking about issues of diversity,

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,630
I hope when you think about this topic of diversity, of equity, of inclusion,

4
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,000
that it's exciting and that it feels like there's a lot of hope and a lot of possibility.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,900
But if we're being honest, most of us who have engaged in many of these conversations know that it can be difficult.

6
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:46,740
It can bring a lot of intense emotion and I think that we think we dive in we'll solve the problems, but often to effectively communicate

7
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:54,690
to come up with new and useful solutions, we've got to have some skills for dealing with this.

8
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,390
So this is probably one of the last modules that you're looking at.

9
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:05,370
And it really is probably the one that requires the most of everything that we've learned up into this.

10
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,650
So I encourage you as going through this module to be practicing mindful awareness of your body,

11
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,570
notice what's coming up, notice how you're talking to yourself about it.

12
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:25,410
Take what you need to use the mindfulness strategies and also be talking about this in healthy relationships that can help you sort through it,

13
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:34,850
one of the things that's really different about doing this module this way is it usually this is an interactive conversation where we can clarify

14
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:40,340
as we go, because that's not in it online, in a virtual format,

15
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:46,200
we want to make sure that you're having opportunities to process the thoughts, the feelings, the questions.

16
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:59,770
So I wanted this whole section in this module is going to be talking about why is it difficult and kind of normalizing that.

17
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,240
Because I think that it's kind of like that question, why can't we just all get along?

18
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:14,230
I think we assume it should be easy and so when it's difficult, either we think we shouldn't be bothered with it anymore or that somebody is doing it wrong,

19
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,870
when in actuality, there's a lot of reasons why it's difficult. So we want to get into that

20
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:24,910
we want to normalize it. If you think about the module that we talked about, about skills, for doing difficult and hard things,

21
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,240
this talking about diversity can be one of those difficult and hard things.

22
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,130
So we want to normalize that process so we know how to move through it.

23
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,600
If I was going to try to run a marathon, that would be very hard for me.

24
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,240
That would take a lot of preparation and endurance,

25
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:50,370
and it would take me knowing from the beginning that it was going to be that way so that I would have kind of the stamina to be prepared.

26
00:02:50,370 --> 00:03:00,770
One of the things that happens often is a lot of us grow up in kind of homogenous environments not all of us, let me say what I mean by that.

27
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,080
This is actually becoming increasingly the case in the United States,

28
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,190
like people are kind of hanging around more people in their own political affiliations,

29
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:14,240
their own religious groups, their own ethnic groups, their own socio economic status groups.

30
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:22,590
So it's easy to grow up in a neighborhood where people have the same ideas as you, a lot of the same experiences as you,

31
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:33,630
and it can form an idea of the world where everybody should think, oh, I think and everybody must be having the same experiences that I have.

32
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:44,400
But when we come to these conversations, often we are like immediately kind of bombarded or made aware of the idea that,

33
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,640
in fact, even though a lot of us have been neighbors and in the same classrooms and things like that, that we have different values.

34
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:59,040
We have different ways of seeing the world. We've been told the same histories in very different lights, from very different perspectives.

35
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:06,330
We have different ways of showing how we care, how we achieve in different ways of solving problems.

36
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:15,390
And so we bring those all into the room, and I think we think that my goal here is to make people see it my way.

37
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:22,470
In reality, I think as we interact with more people and with diverse people, all of our ideas kind of get stretched.

38
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,120
Some of them, we realize, just don't really work anymore and kind of shatter.

39
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,290
And hopefully we develop newer, bigger,

40
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:38,550
more robust ideas that help us think globally about the way that we impact each other and our interconnectedness.

41
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:47,780
But that process of having your ideas stretched and sometimes broken because they don't really work is uncomfortable.

42
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,680
It takes a lot of effort and energy to manage. And so we want to normalize that

43
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,990
that's the case. We also want to normalize even why we might see something differently.

44
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll just give a couple of examples of this, this doesn't capture fully what happens in the real world.

45
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,340
But if you always flew, but you always flew in first class,

46
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:14,550
you have not a lot of idea what happens behind the curtain with people that are sitting back towards back.

47
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,150
And so you might hear their stories and just think like gosh they're being dramatic.

48
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:28,190
But in reality, if you haven't sat back there in those seats, what you've seen is just what's happening in first class.

49
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:38,330
If you went to a movie theater and you were sitting right under the vents and it was cold but other people weren't,

50
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,530
you might not understand why some people were saying it was freezing when you weren't experiencing that.

51
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:53,840
Or if you don't have any sound or light sensitivity, then you might not understand why other people were having a difficult time.

52
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:01,470
For example, if there were flashing lights and one person had a seizure, you might not understand that that wasn't your experience.

53
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:10,730
And so part of coming to these conversations is realizing there's a whole world of experiences that are very real that I've never had,

54
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,970
thatt I want to learn about that.

55
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:21,260
The very same experience, even as something like eating at a restaurant, depending on whether you're sitting by the bathrooms or sitting by

56
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,350
the window can be really different, and for example,

57
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:31,620
if you've gone to the restaurant and had lots of money to spend versus not a lot or couldn't even get in or get a reservation,

58
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,100
these are different experiences.

59
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:43,070
If you've gone and you didn't have any food allergies, you might not understand what it's like to be somebody who has a lot of allergies.

60
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,450
And so we just want to know that

61
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:53,110
even though we were in the same place and maybe thought we have the same experience, the experiences is can be really different.

62
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,790
So we want to just know that as we come to these conversations,

63
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:11,700
so that our first thoughts are not to doubt and critique other people's experiences but really to listen and learn and have our ideas expanded.

64
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:21,650
Often when we encounter these difficulties in having these conversations, we do a couple of things we want to rush past them,

65
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:30,330
we want to make them go away as soon as possible. And so a lot of times we want to put answers on things we want to put a quick band-aid on things.

66
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:37,110
And really, we need the capacity to stay with the conversation to keep seeing it through.

67
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:46,620
Often we create detours, like we wanna just go around it around the hard parts and we actually need to develop skills around dealing with the hard parts.

68
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:57,450
An example of this is when people came up with ideas of like, we're just colorblind we don't see color, that sounds really nice,

69
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:04,450
but all of the sudden it made it much more difficult to talk about real experiences of how people were being treated

70
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:13,240
that had different that were of different races, different colors, and so sometime we'll come up with an idea or a solution that sounds good,

71
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,970
but actually it doesn't really address the problems it kind of sweeps conflict indifference under the carpet.

72
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:26,060
And that's not what we wanted to do, but it's easy to do as a way of trying to get out of the difficulty.

73
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:32,830
And another thing that we can do is just kind of want to cover our eyes, cover our ears, stop hearing.

74
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:38,390
Because a lot of times some of the experiences that we're going to hear about can be painful and can be uncomfortable.

75
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:43,990
So we want to try as much as possible to sometimes take breaks.

76
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:53,710
And because it can be overwhelming, it can be uncomfortable but we want to try to keep our ears and our eyes open and our hearts open.

77
00:08:53,710 --> 00:09:00,160
to what's happening around us. It's kind of like we've this is, again, an oversimplification

78
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:08,740
but if you think about if you've ever had Christmas lights or jewelry that's gotten all tangled up, it is quite a mess.

79
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:15,580
And in some of these issues that we've created around oppression and discrimination are kind of a mess.

80
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:20,590
The undoing of them takes some care, some calm, some patience.

81
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:27,400
And most of us know if you ever tried to untangle any of the things, we just kind of start yanking and pulling, we break things

82
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:38,230
It doesn't work so well. And so we want to bring a different way of being to these conversations.

83
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:43,840
Another part of what makes them so hard is that they bring up

84
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,770
If we'd let them, especially a lot of sadness,

85
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:56,600
a lot of us have trauma related to some of our experiences of being excluded or being discriminated against and being oppressed.

86
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,380
And when we're on the hearing end of it,

87
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:11,220
we can all we can suddenly have some really painful and simplistic thoughts about like I'm I'm bad or they're saying that I'm bad.

88
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,540
You can feel shame for not knowing things or not getting things right.

89
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,060
And that shame can kind of paralyze us.

90
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:24,780
And we can start kind of dividing people and ourselves in the role of who's good and who's bad and all of that shame

91
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:30,830
and it shut it activates our fight or flight system, it shuts down our front brain.

92
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:35,870
And it makes it leaves no room for empathy or hearing.

93
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:42,140
And so we as we're in these conversations, we need to be aware of the shaming messages coming up.

94
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,810
And it's like, OK, this is probably not about me being bad.

95
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:58,540
It's probably about me needing to learn. It's probably about me needing to possibly be more active and or something like.

96
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:06,610
If the message is coming up that I'm I'm just a horrible human being, it's probably not a helpful message.

97
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,940
The reality is it has taken a lot of people to create the difficulties that

98
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:15,220
we've we're experiencing and all of us probably have some stake or part of that.

99
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:22,390
And we want to be involved in the hearing so that we can be empathic and be creative in finding our of solution,

100
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:30,690
but that the pool to divide things up into who's good, who's bad in the labeling is really.

101
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:42,960
Even, for example, when people are saying things like this is racist, this is homophobic, these ideas are that way, the structures are that way,

102
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:48,690
that people are this way when they're showing those behaviors and ideologies,

103
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:54,090
often it's a form of trying to hold people accountable and saying these things have this impact,

104
00:11:54,090 --> 00:12:03,240
got to look at them, we've got a name that we've got to address. It's less about seeing the world is full of good people and bad.

105
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:11,340
That's not usually a really effective way to solve problems or to talk about these things.

106
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:19,690
So there's the intense emotions that come up. There's a chain in the blame can come up within ourselves or in the conversation.

107
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:29,980
There's also this concept of cognitive dissonance that comes up, so sometimes if we have

108
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:39,570
behavior's and ideas and they don't match or we have feelings and ideas and behaviors that don't match.

109
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:46,430
That creates this internal feeling of discomfort and so we want to resolve that.

110
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:52,820
So if somebody is saying something like, I have privilege or

111
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:58,950
I am saying things that are homophobic,

112
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:06,780
if that doesn't match with what I've been told previously and I want to hold this, I'm a good person, I love people,

113
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:15,880
I don't do those types of things, I don't think bad things often instead of updating my ideas

114
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:22,450
changing my behavior, it can be easier to just kind of double down and

115
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:28,070
create rationalizations and justifications for why it's OK.

116
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:35,080
And so, knowing this is an invitation to say when something is coming up, that doesn't match,

117
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:41,470
like my behavior isn't matching with my values or the new thing that I'm being taught doesn't match with how I thought or felt

118
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:49,650
before knowing that that discomfort is going to come and being able see can I sit with it with some curiosity?

119
00:13:49,650 --> 00:14:01,650
as opposed to just trying to shut it down, which often gets in the way of new change ideas and behaviors being able to be brought into our.

120
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:07,080
So this is also where because we know this is taxing, because we know the emotions are going to come up.

121
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:16,870
We need a lot of self care. We need a lot of awareness. We need a lot of good self coaching these interactions.

122
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:22,640
The other part of this that can make it difficult,

123
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:31,480
is that so many of our ideas of how things work formed so early.

124
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,390
So as human beings, we have this natural tendency to group, it's kind of it simplifies,

125
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:42,280
you know, if I can say all of those colors are are orange, all of those animals are cats.

126
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:48,660
Categorizing helps organize the world and kind of simplify the world.

127
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,390
And so for something, this is really useful,

128
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:59,710
but sometimes we realize we've oversimplified it or we've made associations and groupings together that don't actually go together.

129
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:10,890
And this is what we see pretty early on with kids, they began to see how the world works and we began to hear the things that adults say.

130
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:20,640
And they understand which groups they're in which groups they're not in, so, you know, am I a boy or a girl?

131
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:27,030
And most of them aren't even hearing until much later things about when they're on a continuum.

132
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,820
But they're not only learning which group I'm in,

133
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:36,030
they're very quickly beginning to pick up on which group is the most powerful and which group is a more valued.

134
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:42,200
And that starts to form the ideas of who's good or bad, who we want to be.

135
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:48,980
And you see the like in preschool age kids, these differentiations being made and

136
00:15:48,980 --> 00:16:00,450
anything that they kind of like absorb at that age becomes hard to unpack and unlearn later so they might learn a lot of really broad rules about

137
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,180
what's OK for girls or what's OK for boys?

138
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:08,190
I mean, you'll often hear kids at this age starting to say things like, Oh, I want to be skinny, I wish I was lighter.

139
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:15,110
I wish, because what they've learned is that being in that group

140
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:20,810
gives me more power. It makes me more valuable, and so we started all of these associations,

141
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:26,380
we kind of absorb them from the world that we're moving in and at that age we don't really question it.

142
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:35,620
And they're going to possibly talk to us and all of our interactions, so as we get older and we update and we unlearn.

143
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:45,010
It can be difficult and even honestly be really difficult to even admit that we have certain biases that when we hear about immigrants,

144
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:53,320
certain ideas come to mind. When we hear about the inner city of certain ideas come to mind when we hear about the homeless,

145
00:16:53,320 --> 00:17:00,010
when we hear even ideas about, you know, being fat or skinny, there so many different things, different religious groups.

146
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:06,570
We have a lot of ideas, a lot of neuralizations that are automatic that come to us without even thinking.

147
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:15,720
And that filtering through these discarding updating is not an easy process.

148
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:25,060
So I want you to think about it, we frequently hear the idea that hate is taught, that bias that discrimination is taught.

149
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:33,120
And I want you to we see pictures often kids hugging like they didn't they weren't born with these ideas.

150
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:46,000
So if you think about this idea of kind of holding your arms out, like you've got a big beach ball in the middle and thinking about inside your arms, including

151
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,850
all the people that you care about, all of the people of that you value and hold in high regard and that you wouldn't want to

152
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:58,090
see anything bad happen to that would go out of your way to make sure we're treated well.

153
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:06,770
Most of us, when we're born as we're really young, that includes everybody, like just humans or humans.

154
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:13,960
But slowly, we're kind of started to shrink that in that these different ways of valuing human beings.

155
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:20,350
Some people deserve more to be in this group of mine and some people deserve less of that.

156
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:24,460
And it's done so subtly, so implicitly

157
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:32,210
It's hard to distinguish. But what we start hearing often, what kids hear and then what they start to repeat is a lot of dehumanizing language.

158
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:43,960
So we start talking about other groups as having negative characteristics, and it can be so subtle that we don't even really realize we're doing it.

159
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:53,170
And so part of the work of these conversations in a really celebrating and embracing diversity to start to realize who we've excluded from

160
00:18:53,170 --> 00:19:02,380
this and to start bringing back bringing back in and really wanting everybody to be treated with the same level of respect and dignity,

161
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:11,290
to have access to the same things. But it first kind of takes us admitting that that's not really how the world works and

162
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:16,990
that we've also absorbed from our surroundings some ideas that don't fit with that.

163
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:26,570
And so it's a process, we will as we go through it, often have to relearn some things about our history,

164
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:31,510
relearn some things about our heroes, and that can feel really difficult.

165
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:37,480
We can also have to sometimes relearn things about some of the values that we've been taught.

166
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,770
So, for example, in American culture, a lot of us have been taught meritocracy.

167
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:50,790
That the harder you work, the further you go in life and that you earn that, and when we really look at the research,

168
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:59,810
it's not that simple that working hard doesn't make everybody equally able to access the same things,

169
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:10,910
that kind of rugged individual do it yourself, pull yourself up by your own bootstraps, that that value doesn't work equally well for all people.

170
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:17,030
And the unlearning of that could feel really uncomfortable. So we just have to know the best.

171
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:24,590
And sometimes we're shifting even when you think about the problems. So, for example, a lot of us have been talking of scarcity.

172
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:31,730
That the reason why people don't have food or they don't have homes is because there's just not enough

173
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,320
and so it's just how it is.

174
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:40,520
But when we really look at the data, we have enough food to feed people, we have enough homes so there are other things getting in the way.

175
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,900
And so often we have to shift from a perspective of how to take care of me and

176
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:52,490
mine to how do we think really creatively to make things accessible to everyone.

177
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:56,660
And if that's not the way that we started, then conversations are framed

178
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:07,400
that way we can feel really difficult. We can feel like giving up power or access or like we're being asked to do something impossible.

179
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:18,640
And so in these moments where something just seems like it doesn't fit and often it's a good time to pause and say, like, am I creating an

180
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,900
where there doesn't have to be after, you know often we think the people are kind of attacking us with new ideas

181
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:34,640
when in reality I think they're asking us to hold them and consider them next to our own and to right size these integrate these things.

182
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:44,710
There's a lot of things that we'll talk about this that are complex. We want to keep that in mind.

183
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:53,380
Another piece of this that makes it really hard is that most of the things that we do around diversity or like what I'm doing with you right now,

184
00:21:53,380 --> 00:22:06,290
is giving you information and talking to your. But the reality is that in day to day interactions that have to do with a lot of these things.

185
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:16,220
A lot of the information is kind of sort of our emotional information or emotional learning, our feeling of safety and belonging.

186
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:24,470
The part that kind of gets activated and angry or worried or afraid or defensive are all in our back brain.

187
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:34,390
And we've been really socialized to when politics comes up, when religion comes up, when difference comes up, to kind of go into fight or flight.

188
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:38,920
And we've seen I'll show you the slide again, but we've seen how that affects our communication,

189
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:50,290
it makes all of our best thinking kind of go offline and gets really rigid and blocks into all or nothing conversations.

190
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:56,560
And so in preparation for conversations about diversity, we have to know how to compromise.

191
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:03,190
We have to know when we're going into kind of the

192
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:10,020
aggressive or the passive, sometimes when you're talking about your own experiences

193
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:16,900
it can be easy to get really worried about how it's going to be perceived by other people and start

194
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,730
watering down or dismissing your own experiences or aggressively not hearing other people's.

195
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:35,960
And so we want to know what our tendencies are. We want to prepare our bodies and ground ourselves before during the conversations and after.

196
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:44,800
I think the other thing to note, too, is that we've kind of been socialized by seeing things on TV sometimes to be really desensitized.

197
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:53,530
And we want to think about what we've seen throughout history, sometimes with new eyes,

198
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:58,430
because one of the things that we can do if we don't experience a thing

199
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:04,700
In our own lives, if I don't experience homophobia because I'm straight,

200
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:11,840
I can get used to seeing really painful things done to people because they're not my group, my empathy might not get activated in my body.

201
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:19,160
And so we want to notice when we're numb or when we're defensive.

202
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:34,520
And sometimes building empathy means going back and rereading the news through the lens of empathy, rereading history through the lens of perspective.

203
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:42,140
Asking ourselves sometimes when we see people who are elderly or who are dealing with different types of disabilities,

204
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,820
is that how I would want to be treated?

205
00:24:43,820 --> 00:25:00,630
Would I let the people that are in my circle of caring be treated that way, really do some stretching of ourselves and our capacity in that way?

206
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:08,300
So I want to talk about this kind of ladder of hierarchy, ladder of valuing, ladder of

207
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:16,370
oppression and I want us to use the exercise kind of what we've been talking about, what to think about this

208
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:24,350
and we want to breathe and be in our body and feel grounded and we want to look at it

209
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:32,240
with just kind of new eyes and eyes of empathy especially if this is kind of a newer way of looking.

210
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:39,350
But for imagine imagine for a moment that you're not on this ladder,

211
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:47,220
that we're just kind of you're an alien arriving at this planet and you're just noticing observations.

212
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:53,760
And you're thinking about you're watching how people are treated, how people are allowed to go, how people

213
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,130
If they have access to, what the consequences are for their behavior.

214
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:09,800
And based on what you're watching, you're trying to see how different bodies, different people are being valued.

215
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:16,800
And so kind of on on this ladder, on the on these steps, when you think about age.

216
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:26,560
Who are the people who are getting the most using valuing. When you think about physical abilities

217
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:31,900
or mental health issues who's being

218
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:43,000
most valued, seen as most worthy and whose seen as least. And you can think about this with all of the mentions down the side.

219
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,760
What religious groups are being kind of the most esteemed, the most valued, which are being the least valued?

220
00:26:49,760 --> 00:27:01,840
Same with race, skin color, hair texture, sometimes it comes up with different nationalities or ethnic groups,

221
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:08,220
body size is who's seen as most valuable and least.

222
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,920
Socioeconomic status, educational attainment,

223
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:23,670
sexual orientation, gender identity. And if you think about something like educational attainment,

224
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:28,740
sometimes some of these things we're so used to we don't even question them.

225
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,840
We think we'll, like one person, just worked harder so they almost kind of associations,

226
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,560
that they're smarter, that they deserve almost for their voice to be listened to.

227
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:48,350
And really, these things are what we learn them starting in kindergarten, the person gets A's how better the person is when in reality both people

228
00:27:48,350 --> 00:28:00,430
are equally valuable and really deserve for their bodies to be treated with the same safety, same dignity, same respect, same access.

229
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:09,190
to resources. And so we want to become better observers of how this works

230
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:15,010
In our everyday life, because it's going to inform a lot of the conversations and the ones now,

231
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:22,250
this is where we we no longer we take ourself out of being the alien visiting the planet and we start realizing.

232
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:29,150
For each of these different things, what are my Identities and where do I fall in this ladder?

233
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:33,260
And hopefully we get to a place where we want the ladder

234
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:40,760
we want to just get rid of it. We want everybody to have the same amount of value and respect in safety.

235
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:48,060
And so hopefully if I'm higher up on the ladder, I'm being treated as if I have more value.

236
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:55,770
Because I'm straight or because I'm cis gender or because I have a PhD or because I'm a middle class,

237
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:59,860
then hopefully I'm really listening to the experiences of people who are being valued less

238
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:11,490
so that I can learn that I can amplify their voices so that I can help them have the same access to safety resources that I have.

239
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:16,680
And so just consider this try this on and notice sometimes when people are bringing

240
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:24,150
up experiences that fall on this ladder and when we're having a hard time listening.

241
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:32,070
Or when sometimes we are engaging in practices and beliefs, that keep people further down the ladder.

242
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:38,720
A really important thing for all of us to be paying attention.

243
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,570
So i've talked a lot about why it's difficult before we go to the next module and talk about how to deal with these things,

244
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:49,460
some of which have already kind of alluded to, I want us to know why it's worth it

245
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:55,070
because, you know again, why would we do all this difficult stuff if it wasn't worth it?

246
00:29:55,070 --> 00:30:01,360
And so I like this quote by Reverend Angel Williams.

247
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:10,040
"No one who has ever touched liberation could possibly want anything other than liberation for everyone."

248
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:18,080
And so a lot of times as these conversations are coming up, we're like, oh, this means changing the language that I'm using,

249
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,090
this this is if we deconstructed this, this would disrupt so many different things,

250
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:31,880
it would be so inconvenient or this conversation is going long and it's so inconvenient or I don't I don't

251
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:41,640
know if I want to my neighborhood to look more diverse or to create more access for some of these things.

252
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:49,860
But I think oftentimes what we don't realize is that we are missing out as, for example, as films have got more diverse,

253
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:57,810
there's so many cool movies that we're able to see now that wouldn't have been produced, education looks different and enriched.

254
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:04,640
All of these things look different and enriched and so even when we're thinking that, it may mean

255
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:14,790
things changing and being more uncomfortable. It may mean resources being shifted to some people are better taking care of.

256
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:23,040
Ideally, we have in mind this place where everybody's needs are met that is really thriving and that we want that for everybody,

257
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:31,710
that is the thing that we're heading In the direction of, and when I think about this you probably have different images that come to mind,

258
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:39,750
I think about this idea of like just big meals with lots of music and lots of different food and just connection and think about for you,

259
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:45,430
like when you think about unity, liberation,

260
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:50,890
diversity, what does it look like and what does it sound like, because if you don't have images that draw you to it,

261
00:31:50,890 --> 00:32:01,270
it's going to be hard to push through those things. Often even maybe in different countries or learning different languages these times that are uncomfortable

262
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:07,610
before you experience all of the really cool growth and experience.

263
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,800
And so my hope is that as you're moving through this,

264
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:22,040
you really have a vision of what and how amazing it can feel for you and how amazing it can feel for a community to be different, more just inclusive.

265
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:28,420
The other thing is, this is a great quote by Martin Luther King,

266
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:34,020
Is that we kind of have an imperative at this point in that the planet can only survive,

267
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:41,080
we can only survive as people hopefully for so long if we don't take these things seriously.

268
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,680
And so MLK said you know we must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools.

269
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:53,790
And so when you feel fatigued by this work, when you feel frustrated by this work, when you're tempted to feel

270
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:58,810
hopeless about this work. You have to come back to the idea that really

271
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:06,000
we have no choice but to really engage it and figure out how to do better or else we all really suffer

272
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:14,310
together and things only get worse. So think about what images inspire you towards this work.

273
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:22,030
Think about what quotes, what leaders inspire you towards this work and keep those things in mind

274
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:28,900
fuel yourself with yourself them, feed yourself them so that they'll motivate you when the work is hard

275
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:37,301
and they'll help you be more inspired to practice the skills for navigating these conversations that we're going to talk about the next module.
