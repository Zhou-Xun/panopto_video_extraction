1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,860
That's so weird.

2
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:39,030
The building so quiet and probably a lot of the class has been canceled or rescheduled.

3
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,079
Okay. Let's get started. Happy Thanksgiving holiday.

4
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,750
And hopefully you will have a few days break and catch up a few things.

5
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:40,760
So anyway, I'd like to start with a little bit discussing about the presentation scale.

6
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:46,670
Oh, this sketch you saw so original.

7
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:52,580
I want to just kind of presentation the thing one sort of class,

8
00:01:53,450 --> 00:02:00,800
but I feel that probably we cannot put every like six sort of presentations within one class.

9
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:05,530
So I was trying to find like to solve lectures to do that.

10
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:15,860
So we're, you know, we want to do December 1st and but we can but and I said, maybe it's nice to do this within one week,

11
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:28,030
but if you don't think this schedule is something like we can always put it December 1st and December six, I don't know which one you like.

12
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,830
Any comments? As you have a question.

13
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,010
Another question. When are we supposed to submit?

14
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,450
Next Tuesday. I see there's a due date for the project yet.

15
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,750
Yeah, there's. If I could. November 29th on the on the project description assignment.

16
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,940
What I was supposed to submit next Tuesday is a problem group project.

17
00:02:53,220 --> 00:03:00,380
Yeah. So what we're supposed to submit? Yeah. Oh, that just be the report.

18
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:09,460
It's a report. Right. There's no detail about the project, what you're supposed to submit.

19
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,340
There's like objectives, but not exactly. You know, what is the deliverable?

20
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:22,760
That's not the question here. Okay. So.

21
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,600
So first of all, of course, you would have the data available.

22
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,850
You some you submit your data to the data issues, right?

23
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:45,710
That's yeah. Okay. Yeah. Then of you know, then you need to, you know, do a QC and then you need to write a some simple analysis.

24
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:54,169
So you need to write a report, right, to explain what data has been captured, where you capture raw data,

25
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:59,740
how you capture your data, and what variables are available in the in the data.

26
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:04,070
And then just do a little bit analysis to how data looks like.

27
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,860
Is that clear? Or just like a datasheet and a like a report?

28
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,670
Yeah. You just send me data separately, right?

29
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:22,170
So then you have a report that described where the how data is captured or where it's data is captured and how data are clean.

30
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:27,590
If you have no data cleaning, then you don't write how you typically write.

31
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,370
So you need to, you know, clean up the data, Carol.

32
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:44,190
Just describe those two part one. Right. So the data, call it quality control and then you prepare a dictionary and.

33
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,700
Okay, so that's the description of your dataset. Right.

34
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,129
And then you, you know, you display the data a little bit.

35
00:04:53,130 --> 00:05:03,450
And so that suppose that you have a presentation to that, that it's going to share with the dataset with your class,

36
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:10,020
what you're going to tell them, not only just, you know, a, you know, data set.

37
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,260
That's that's a target. And here's the data.

38
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,050
Whereas this is the website capture, this is monthly data.

39
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:23,370
Weekly data. And you know what data is about, right? So then here is data, how there looks like and so on.

40
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:33,780
Right? So right. So that you could do a little bit, you know, this data visualization and give a little bit,

41
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:44,519
explore data analysis and then this certainly will be something related, something like what do you plan to do in your final project, right?

42
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,670
So that you can make a plan in a project.

43
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:56,250
Right. So. So based on what I observed down here is something I plan to do for the for the next analysis.

44
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,990
Right. So you can calculate some summary statistics and, you know,

45
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:09,300
so you conclude the project with one major study aim that you're going to explore in your final project.

46
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:20,370
So clear what you plan to do. I mean, what you supposed to do in so presentation?

47
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:26,880
Yeah. Do you want us to also describe the data capture QC and clean up in the presentation as well.

48
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:34,980
Yeah. Okay. Certainly, yeah. Okay. So people can have a good understanding about how data looks like.

49
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,030
Then they can judge whether or not the data will be used in their project.

50
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:48,239
Right. So, you know. So do you think it's okay to schedule the presentation within one week and six and eight?

51
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,240
So we will have relatively easy last final week of the of the semester.

52
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:02,790
Yeah. Because I, I really want to leave some time for people to, you know, to ask questions.

53
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:14,670
Right. So. So I want to schedule each presentation like 25 minutes too, because each team would have 2 to 3 team members.

54
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:20,540
They need to take time to give a presentation and to explain things.

55
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:33,730
And so, you know. I knew the word, just like all the adoption data.

56
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:43,360
I don't expect you just to have 20 minutes, but I think 20 minutes must have some.

57
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:50,140
Some of the memories of Yamamoto. Yes, we cover all of you.

58
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,530
Yeah. So, Tim, roughly, you need a 15 slice, right?

59
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,740
So then each person prepare three slides.

60
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,600
Then what? Three slides do you need? Four from each team.

61
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:08,469
And we help it to slide. So you will have three teammates, right?

62
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,500
So then you will each person will contribute three slides.

63
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,740
But of course you can allocate what you want. Talk about one person, talk about data cleaning.

64
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:25,950
Yeah. Like you can have like slides where the data is captured and how to organize the other variables and you know,

65
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,460
then not talk about data cleaning or how data is organized.

66
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,450
Then you could have what person to talk about temple trend, right?

67
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,110
How data looks like about twin pole things.

68
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,430
Right? So I don't know what data you captured from by your team.

69
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:47,469
Oh yeah. We're our our devices is data.

70
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,010
So it doesn't have much has very little data.

71
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,129
It's more spatial spatial spatial resolution.

72
00:08:54,130 --> 00:09:02,410
Right. Yeah. So yeah. So then you have the spatial data and then you show the, you know,

73
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:10,900
these spatial data and tell people the spatial structures and what you can room mean to look at Michigan data.

74
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:17,470
I mean, you could have a little bit more to show people, right? So rather than just here's the map, here it is.

75
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:28,990
I mean, this is opportunity to to say feel more like when you have a research meeting as a statistician, you know,

76
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:37,689
the the scientist of PI sitting there and say, here's my data, that's not enough for a statistician to see.

77
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,870
You need time to give a little bit more details.

78
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:50,409
You know, you mentioned that there there will be a purpose of the of the data.

79
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:57,550
For example, as I said at the very end, you will come up with some major study aimed at are going to use your data to do some analysis,

80
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:06,640
deep heart looking extended, why you believe this will be the case and how you're going to do this and make a some kind of plan in the very end.

81
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:14,290
Right. So if you have some kind of simple analysis result to support your plan, that would be ideal.

82
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,650
But you can talk a little bit more on that.

83
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,180
A 20 minutes is not a lot. You can easily, quickly use that 20 minutes.

84
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,180
Right. And I will have questions.

85
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,649
People will have questions. You don't use all your your time.

86
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:36,470
I will ask you questions. Yeah. So, so, so give me a bit of time to ask questions still.

87
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:44,890
Yeah. Yeah. So how shall be the record for the day that they have to deliver.

88
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:56,520
We're not full pages. There's no I don't printed don't print or data of course that it's too many pages to be used to just give me the summary.

89
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:07,920
Right. So. Right. So there's a journal called Science Data, I think.

90
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,210
So science has a journal that only publish data.

91
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:20,460
So it's called science data. I think I reviewed the paper paper a few papers from that science journal is signed.

92
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:32,340
Science has a dearth of science, of course. Then you have science only human behavior, science, translational medicine.

93
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,900
And there's so one sort of series is called science data.

94
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:46,470
So you can't go there and just see how people, you know, write a paper or something just for data.

95
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,510
There's a template.

96
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:58,830
You can see how people if people won't write a report to give you information so that our readers can use their data, how they organize that.

97
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:09,420
Yeah, sure. My crew just kind of took it based on the group project description where we have part one, the data capture QC,

98
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:14,240
and part two, where we put graphs with figures and then give a description of each graphs.

99
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:20,350
Mm hmm. Do you want something more? Yeah, more. It's like, how do you plan to your super data for the final project?

100
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,430
If that's the case, what you like to do.

101
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:32,100
You want that in the report as well? Because I do not I do not think that as part of this group report that's here, here, here.

102
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:37,770
Okay. Let me just open up and the viewer and we're stopped.

103
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:51,379
Give me the. Because at the very end here, I think that will be a very natural discussion.

104
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:58,940
Right. Ultimately, the project will be conclude at least the one major study and that will be explored thoroughly in the final project.

105
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,809
So when I read that, I just thought that was like a side note.

106
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,590
That's something we should think of, not something to include in Tuesday's report.

107
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:13,309
Well, why not? If you if you view this as a chance that you can think about it, what you like to do,

108
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:17,420
or you say, I'm not going to use this data for my own project, that's the conclusion.

109
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:22,190
That's fine. Or you think the data is not suitable to be used in final project.

110
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,120
That's also fine. But you give me a conclusion which which.

111
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,220
Every day you tell me why this data is not suitable to be used in your final project.

112
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,719
Okay, that's something I just haven't considered right.

113
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,400
This specific. Yeah. You still have some time to consider with.

114
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,560
Yeah. You don't.

115
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,209
I think this is a very natural thing to after to recapture data.

116
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:56,520
And you analyze a lot of, you know, vaccinated infection data.

117
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:03,840
You know, there's a mortality that and, you know, you think that, wow, what are the data I capture?

118
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:09,059
It would be very useful to be, you know, the part of a sort of analysis.

119
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:13,260
And and probably you have one aim.

120
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,520
I'm just trying to sort of discuss this.

121
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:21,430
I'm not saying you have to do that to say here is one aim that's quite relevant.

122
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,410
Our team plan to do and this to we won't give away.

123
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:33,970
And there are other things that, you know, also be possible for, you know,

124
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:42,160
kind of analysis or some study if other teams are interested in that, can take one of those aims for their analysis as well.

125
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:49,979
Right. So so I mean, some data set probably richer and more interesting.

126
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:58,100
And one team got their political segregation data, which probably it's quite interesting.

127
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,540
Some groups want to use that data as well. Right.

128
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:10,050
So, you know, and I think that's the the time where we can see how many different types of the data available.

129
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:22,460
And and, you know, you make some suggestions and people can like the class can take some of suggestions we build into their final project.

130
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:29,340
Right. So yeah, I think the only problem that will be faced with having the presentations to six of

131
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,209
the eight is that we don't find out about everyone's data dataset until the eighth,

132
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:40,020
which gives us a week lesson. Yeah, we kind of switch to 1 to 6 or even next week if you want.

133
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,770
And I don't I don't know what would be best just given this shortened timeline of the semester.

134
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:53,249
Yeah, I understand that. I also consider that. Oh, okay. I think what you said is pretty reasonable.

135
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,969
We can do first in six. No.

136
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:01,480
What's the time? Yeah, I don't.

137
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,500
I just want to give you guys time to prepare. It's just, you know, don't want push your too hard.

138
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:16,139
But I know your die. Why don't. I don't have to resubmit the the the reports and the data set next week.

139
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,100
You first put it on canvas so everybody can already see this before the presentation.

140
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:26,960
Okay. Do you want me to share the projects with him?

141
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:31,620
Okay, so maybe we can do first and six about that.

142
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,640
It's more reasonable in terms of timing.

143
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,830
Mm hmm. Right. Okay. So I can change that so people can learn a little bit more.

144
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:45,420
At least the first that we could learn three.

145
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,500
Project six. We know a lot of projects. Yeah.

146
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:55,600
And we still have to look for. So where do go for it?

147
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,190
Yes. Yes.

148
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,889
Okay. There will be two.

149
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:06,310
Simple. I want to practice lube. The special part.

150
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:15,040
You know, I think my worry have been doing both the presentation and listening to the final project due less than two weeks after the presentation.

151
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:18,950
I think it was a lot of time for another former set.

152
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,690
Considering most of us, it should be a very short homework.

153
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,500
Yeah. And could you post it like today or.

154
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:33,879
Oh, yeah. Yeah, because I personally don't have time to do it next week or the week after with totally fine exams.

155
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,550
And I have problems there. I just don't want to add something to your holiday break.

156
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:46,210
But if you want to work during a holiday break, I'm happy to release tonight anyway.

157
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,780
Okay. Per your request, I hope I'm going to release it.

158
00:17:50,620 --> 00:18:00,680
Okay. So but it took two shorter questions so that I think that you need to practice a little bit to your spatial data for.

159
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:08,979
Yeah, I can do that for sure. I just wanna give you a little booking for it in terms of preparing or slides and you know,

160
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:13,810
and you give a bit of time to, you know, enjoy your holiday break.

161
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,200
But if you want to do it, that's fine. I appreciate it.

162
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,950
Really? Yeah. Happy Thanksgiving holiday to me.

163
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,040
So any other questions? Okay.

164
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:42,600
Good. So let me just quickly I don't know how many of you have been, you know, programing the Muslims see.

165
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:49,520
Right. So so so, you know, MSNBC programing.

166
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:56,270
Right. So you have the the sort of this coding.

167
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:08,830
And so this of course, they need to know a little bit the the function of the emcee see coding.

168
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:15,170
Right. But this is simpler than the typical coding that we have.

169
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:18,410
Basically, you need to just specify them all. Okay.

170
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:30,470
Essentially, you need to sort of code the and based on the simulation polygons in some is basement build up the simulation from a certain model.

171
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:40,270
So for example, Norm is the, you know, the the one that you generate the normal outcome, right?

172
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:49,489
So you remember that in the this GL example where we transform the number of fatal car accidents

173
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:56,900
divided by the teenager population and make a transformation and data looks like very normal.

174
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:03,649
Right. So then you see how the outcome is generated that you can use portion D plus one where

175
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:09,800
you d norm based on what the dispute you want use where you specify the parameter.

176
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:16,310
So parameter here is the mean. Meaning, of course, is depend on some of the covariance.

177
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,730
So here I have. Mm hmm. So there's x, y, x, two and a time.

178
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:31,220
What is x ranks to the. Here is the model.

179
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:42,140
Uh, I think there are C. So here is the why, right?

180
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:48,180
This is a long transformation and you assume this normal distribution because the curve looks like normal.

181
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,810
So the norm is the distribution that you going to.

182
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,660
So x y is the unemployment rate. X two is the reality index.

183
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:06,930
Okay. And then you put into the model here for X flags two and then.

184
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:19,499
Then you have this random facts. You is the random you is the random facts and then you is rand facts.

185
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:30,780
And then and then you generate the from the normal distribution is the processing parameter the is, you know, the car model.

186
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:37,709
Okay. So you just specify this. There's two types of the same.

187
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:46,290
And why is this to to think there's two or I think in the article it is basically a random simulation

188
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:54,689
is generating random numbers just like whether we write in there in the mathematical notation,

189
00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:02,010
random variable follows certain but there some assignment is this Erol this is deterministic assignment.

190
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:06,420
So you have this structure to assign a value to a object here.

191
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:17,100
So this part is basically prior that you specify, okay, so the prior specify and then you know,

192
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:30,900
after you just define this our code and you put to our check and then it will automatically do the sampling from sampling and then you can generate,

193
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:42,930
you know those are sort of the non random numbers simulated from the random numbers will be generated from

194
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:50,700
your random facts as well as the speed of hand or anything that side with the of the prior distribution,

195
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:56,310
you will have some posteriors and then you can sample from keep sampling that.

196
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:03,359
Basically you get the D off the TS of your simulated values and after you judge

197
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,190
for the bearing that you can start to use the sample values to make conclusion.

198
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,610
Okay, that's basically how this works.

199
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:19,559
You know, for the Muslim C context, if I don't know how many of you have had experience of the of the same C programing,

200
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:27,330
but this is basically the way that we do this are Muslim say sample is pretty

201
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:33,450
straightforward it is but you need that little bit experience to prep that practice a bit.

202
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,230
And so let me move on to the next lecture.

203
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:52,210
So so let me talk about this. Sarah Automata, in fact, is this prediction.

204
00:23:52,590 --> 00:24:00,970
Okay. So this is not a way to model the spatial sort of spatial correlate data.

205
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:15,940
Okay. So similar to Automata is still very popular in statistics, but this is very popular in engineering and in actual many aptly applied field.

206
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:28,690
I don't know if they are this not genetic sort of how to see that spatial transcriptome analysis in genetics, which is very, very popular nowadays.

207
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:36,159
I don't know if anybody has used this sort of framework to model spatial transcriptome because this is very,

208
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:41,590
very important spatial modeling approach than the one we do.

209
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,700
Statistician has Kamal a little sample, but this is coming from women.

210
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:57,670
This a totally different way of knowing that is you know here has a genius behind his wishes that are quite different.

211
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:08,470
Okay. So this is already in a proposed by Phil Norman and Stan alone in 1940s and later in the by Stephen Wolfram.

212
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:21,850
This is very, very famous applied mathematician and in 1980s and so not many people are aware of this pseudo ultimate spatial modeling.

213
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,810
But I like to give you a very simple introduction about this.

214
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:37,570
It's basically is a automata system in which cells act spatially with their neighbors, create a complex, intelligent pair.

215
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:44,630
So here it's not just spatial dependance is it's more than a spatial structure topology.

216
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:48,970
There's a sort of particle movement in the system.

217
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:55,570
And so. So but at bottom line is a spatial modeling.

218
00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:09,190
Okay. So basically trying to capture how neighbors are factors, you know, the mechanism of the the, you know, this spatial structure.

219
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:22,900
So, see, zero ultimate in short, represents a new way of computational thinking via evolution of simple rules to generate complex dynamics.

220
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:33,320
So this is probably coming from following my mind of binary, because that is the wild, the, you know, pioneers who create a computer, right?

221
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:39,760
The original computer is the architecture in the binary operation.

222
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,219
That and a follow in the same thinking.

223
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:53,290
Then basically think about how do you use this binary coding system, operating system to create to create a complex spatial structure.

224
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:59,830
That's what he wants to buy, sort of model among many applications of C,

225
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,630
we focus on the use of C for prediction of spatial evolution of fashion disease.

226
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:13,400
Okay, so, so let's see how we're going to do it. I'll just give a quick introduction of this there.

227
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:22,880
If you search this pseudo automaton, there are just columns on paper, but it's very, very unknown to statistician.

228
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:30,520
It's kind of pity that we focus too many things on the traditional linear model

229
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,930
rather than thinking more engineering you from the engineering perspective.

230
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:41,080
So but this is one thing that architecture is really important.

231
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:46,840
Okay, so let's talk about this architecture of pseudo automaton.

232
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:53,680
So upgrade of cells in which each cell updates its state according to state of its neighboring cells.

233
00:27:53,890 --> 00:28:01,330
Okay. It's very clear. Okay. So you basically have a process, a separate spatial process,

234
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:13,720
where each cell will update its status according to the status of the situation with conditions of neighboring cells.

235
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:23,409
This is you can see that there's evolution. There's a dynamics happening because the the conditions of neighboring cells will

236
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:29,170
change so that the chance you will cost the change of the cell target cell.

237
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:35,860
When target cell changes, then the condition changes that will factor, you know, the neighboring cells.

238
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:43,120
So there see special sort of interaction between our cells and then the change of the.

239
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,840
Conditions of the cells will change the full system.

240
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:56,530
So the simplest of the aim is defined by this sort of binary situation.

241
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:07,780
So the state basically is the the condition where the appearance of the state or the value of this state of itself is in this situation is binary.

242
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:15,720
You can make it more at higher levels. But I just want to introduce very, very simple pseudo automata.

243
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:25,180
Okay, so it's a binary situation. Okay, so you have zero one state could be continuous, but here is zero one state is popular.

244
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:30,010
So here you can in the in fact, this context you can think zero.

245
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:33,170
Is it meaning that this cell is infected?

246
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:37,990
There's no confirmed infections in that cell.

247
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:49,090
Could be a county, could be a polygon, could be a building, could be something is just a you know, a one unit in a spatial structure.

248
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:56,260
Okay. So whichever you use the the way that you want, define a cell.

249
00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:06,190
Your particular application could be a country. In our case, like error on the opposite means y means that this cell is affected.

250
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:20,530
Okay. So if think about the spatial transcript on that, you can have this sort of create of cells right in in by this 2D of 3D gray points,

251
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:25,300
you know that you can't artificially define cell or steel structures,

252
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:32,140
but in your everyday that analysis polygons are defined like coordinates census track

253
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:37,720
according to counties where the cells have been defined which are fixed that boundaries.

254
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:44,020
But in some applications you can define the cells but so you have image and data that you can

255
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:50,920
define whatever T cells according to certain points according to certain resolution level.

256
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:58,690
So our term two for one may consider number of infections, you know, each cell greater than zero one.

257
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:03,160
You can consider number of infections, each cell as your outcome of interest.

258
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,320
So this is the first thing you need in this system.

259
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,240
Number one is, of course, neighbors,

260
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:21,400
because so would consider a spatial sort of architecture or topology that you need the neighbors a spatial topology to be define event events.

261
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:27,100
You most of time you have to really define your neighborhood adjacency matrix.

262
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:36,729
You can define according to you know queen this year do you know the the points or similar boundaries like roots or you

263
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:46,720
can define or according to due distance whatever you come up with the the definition of the the neighbors neighborhood

264
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:56,590
this neighbors that's something you need to I mean r function you know the like ESP spatial can can help you to

265
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:05,790
define this adjacency matrix for this neighboring structures there you need to come up with a rule of state updated.

266
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:10,980
So how you're going to change the state according to conditions of memory.

267
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,880
So you have to define a rule.

268
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:22,480
Okay, so this is more like a mapping function to how to when the condition changes in the neighborhood, how you're going to change the target.

269
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,750
So updating function is arguments of values in neighbor neighbors.

270
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:34,959
Okay. That that's basically this a pseudo automata includes three elements.

271
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,630
One is state not always neighbors is basically adjacent makes it who is neighbor

272
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,000
with who and not otherwise how you're going to change their the condition.

273
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,290
What's your updating room? Okay, let me just give you a simple example.

274
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:59,920
Okay. So you you start, let's say right down to the sort of K you start this one D cell.

275
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,360
Okay. Oh, what do you see here? Okay, so your simplest niemeyer.

276
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:13,330
Okay, sure. My top here. So your for example, blue indicates one, black indicates zero.

277
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:20,290
So there are so one cell that's been affected. Okay, so, so all the other cells are unaffected.

278
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:25,900
Okay, now this is the current state of this pseudo matter.

279
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:30,280
Okay? So there a one, one single cell that has been affected.

280
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:41,440
Okay, so and blue because I talk about a banner of blue indicates value one and black indicated that is zero.

281
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:52,140
Okay so now. You can say that for four for each sale because it's a meteorite that, for example, for the blue one, there are two neighbors.

282
00:33:52,410 --> 00:34:02,100
Okay. So if it's not the sort of the sales on the two edges, you always have the two neighbors in the nine here see a situation.

283
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:07,230
Okay. Now, this is your. Okay. What is your operating room here?

284
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:12,480
So, I mean, there are over 200 different ways to update this.

285
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:20,310
But let's pick up a simple one. A simple updating function would be if a cell is infected, then eight eight remain.

286
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:27,780
It remains infected, and B its neighboring cells will be infected in the next generation.

287
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:38,740
Clear. Okay. So if a cell is a fact that is in the blue color, then in the next generation, tomorrow, for example, think about it.

288
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,680
Right. Because this system will have overlooked right over time.

289
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:48,150
So the blue cell will remain blue. Okay.

290
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:58,620
In fact, the cell will be remain infected and neighboring cells will be become infected cells.

291
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:03,390
Okay. So next one. Okay. So you can see that for this one.

292
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:11,130
So next generation, this this cell will be black because all the neighboring cells will be unaffected.

293
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:24,420
So this will get infected and then this cell will be become blue because this this is the are the neighboring US cell of this one.

294
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,900
And because they share a common point, this is the Queens like adjacency.

295
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:38,970
Okay. So you can decide to put the this so neighboring definition in a different way.

296
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:44,070
The neighboring cell is defined according to shared lines.

297
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:47,700
Now, the point that if that's the case, then this will not change.

298
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:55,320
But if you define the neighboring cells as not only they share the common line, but also common point,

299
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:03,270
then because this two cells share a common point, then this one will be regarded as a neighboring cell of this one.

300
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,800
That would certainly in the next generation becomes infected.

301
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:13,890
Okay. So here this this one becomes blue because they share a common line.

302
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:18,690
This one, you know, to do to the right also bring them back.

303
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,890
Because here a common point. So also force. Okay.

304
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,440
So that's essentially what's happening in the next generation.

305
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:35,130
This is one rule according to this two conditions that we stated how this infection or this evolution happens.

306
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:44,140
Okay. So if you just keep going.

307
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:54,630
Okay. After four generations of starting this one single, uh, you know, affected fact that then the second generation, third generation,

308
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:03,380
you know, the first, second, third and fourth generation, that you can see how the neighboring cells will be gradually colored in blue.

309
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:09,810
Right. So this is actually evolution from the initial condition to four generations.

310
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,920
Okay. So you can see the evolution, the change of that.

311
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:20,490
That's one rule. So you can change the rule like a different updating rule.

312
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:29,729
Okay. So here that so becomes blue went either neighboring cell was blue, wild becomes black.

313
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:32,730
If both member cells become more black.

314
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:38,250
Okay. So this is a little bit different from the previous one.

315
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,580
Okay. So becomes this become a blue.

316
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,720
Either of the neighboring cell is blue. Okay, that's fine.

317
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,040
And the. The only thing is differences here.

318
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:54,990
Okay. So here in the previous update, you rule this should be blue.

319
00:37:55,620 --> 00:38:00,870
But each this rules modify the previous sources well becomes black.

320
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:06,750
If both nipper and cells are black because they are both black, then this one becomes black.

321
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:11,160
Dark blue. Okay. So this is a modification from previous one.

322
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:18,450
So if you're doing this rule, then you start to see the evolution this way.

323
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:23,640
Okay. So that you always have a one black cell in the middle.

324
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,860
Okay. So this becomes this one. This is certainly different from this.

325
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,440
The previous one that has everyone is color.

326
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:41,280
Now you have this cells or turned become blue in the alternatives sort of position.

327
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:48,120
Okay. Then you can change the rule. So this one says that okay.

328
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:52,950
Becomes pro either. Now both are of the neighbors was blue.

329
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:59,820
Otherwise become black. So this you can see that if this bows up, move.

330
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:10,190
This becomes black. Okay. So it's either why is it, you know, that both right becomes blue,

331
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:20,070
so so that you add this additional condition on that then so it becomes, you know, the this type of thing.

332
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:26,910
Okay. It looks more sort of variations of various that you can see.

333
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:40,620
Okay. So basically it says that the the the the sales conditions is not complete depend on the the still current state.

334
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:44,250
Right. So so you can see that.

335
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:53,680
Right. So this one.

336
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:00,240
What's this common sense? Let me think why I made this comment.

337
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:10,250
This is still current to stick. So this one becomes blue or black.

338
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:17,970
It depends on. Not the first.

339
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,060
So. So this one is black. That becomes blue.

340
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:33,010
And this is blue then becomes black. And so right.

341
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,660
So this is black and it becomes blue and so on and so forth.

342
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:50,050
And so the current state of this cell is not really determining actually the status of that next movement.

343
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:56,680
Probably that's what I see. But it will generate different of the situations.

344
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:04,150
Now, this is a famous Slurpy shirt, peacekeeper gasket.

345
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,820
So if you use this rule, I just talk about about.

346
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:16,450
Right. If you just move this more and more generations, it becomes this kind of a shape.

347
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:29,260
Right. So the once every other cell is blue, the central region turns to fully deactivated, leaving only the end points blue.

348
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:35,049
That's so you can see that the middle part becomes more and more so empty.

349
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:43,390
And then these structures are mostly concentrated on the edge and as the central part becomes more mostly activated.

350
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:53,249
That's what happens. And another thing is that I see a lot of similar self similarity in this structure,

351
00:41:53,250 --> 00:42:01,210
and you can see that you have this little triangle, dying field triangle, so you have this upside down triangle there.

352
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,030
You know, there's a lot of same similarities.

353
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:12,520
Like you have microstructure, you have mob microstructure, you have, you know, the local structure and global.

354
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,200
So they all have very, very similar structure.

355
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:20,800
You can see that there's a little one they have, you know, the bigger one they have the bigger one and so on.

356
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:25,330
So of course, this is very famous shipping Kiska Gasket.

357
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:28,960
This is how this formula is generated.

358
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:39,670
Okay, so the rule is very simple, but and, and this can generate very, very complex structure, especially over generations.

359
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:50,860
Okay. So people use this actually to model a lot of spatial structures, for example, to firms and lifts.

360
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:57,160
They have a lot of similar similar self similarities inside the structure.

361
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:04,050
Right. You can see these little things here and they are very, very similar.

362
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:09,760
So we have the you know, the micro structure and micro structure that are very, very similar.

363
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:19,840
Okay. This this is somehow the norm and tries to mimic to understand this shape by using a simple opted in rule over generations.

364
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,940
Okay. And if you look at the jewel the coastline here.

365
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:29,680
Okay. Also, he forms a lot of similar structures.

366
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:33,040
Okay. And, you know,

367
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:43,900
we have this little of the water system and somehow the natural force created a lot of similar structures for little islands or a little bit,

368
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:54,910
you know, how to see the are so the open place versus the land place.

369
00:43:55,630 --> 00:44:01,630
There are a lot of similar structures so so that people try to use this see

370
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:08,270
this system to generate this kind of the complex structure by simple rules.

371
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:15,190
Okay. So that's self similarity is very important spatial pattern that people trying to create.

372
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:19,950
Okay. So you can generate more complex. You don't need to really do one rule.

373
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:25,030
And one time you could even go for more rules in the updating procedure.

374
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,960
You can create a more and more complex system by just a binary.

375
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:38,320
Okay, so in total, according to the literature, there are more than 250 rules in this cell of matter.

376
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:49,750
Okay. That there are so many different rules. How do you utilize the neighboring conditions to activate or deactivate a cell?

377
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:56,320
Okay. And typically, people can classify those rules into four categories.

378
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:07,240
Okay. Among the 250 different rules in their creation of zero automata, they can create different ways for categories,

379
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:14,110
essentially unify multi repetition, random and accomplice or unpredictability.

380
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,890
Okay, so there are four categories to classify this.

381
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:21,889
Over 250 rooms. Okay.

382
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:24,380
So this has been used in fashion.

383
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:33,920
This is small because you can see that 01a fact that you can in fact be very natural things, people trying to understand in the fashion this context.

384
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:43,420
Okay. So you may feel that the fact that this is updated functioning can be modeled by a spatial logistic regression model with culverts.

385
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:47,420
Okay. So that's where you want to activate or not activate.

386
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:55,950
You are not doing this deterministic sort of sort of rule, for example, first.

387
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:59,150
Right. This is neighboring of this one.

388
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:02,250
But you can put a probability on the topic.

389
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:09,540
Right. So you whether or not this second generation, this cell become blue according to the probability.

390
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:17,060
So your model, the the rule according to certain probability through logistic regression model in this

391
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:24,320
process where you can incorporate some covers of the neighboring structure into this.

392
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:29,960
Okay. So that's why in the effect it this modeling, this becomes quite a useful.

393
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:33,550
First of all, it's a is a process, right?

394
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:39,530
So every facet is this star is one single infection.

395
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:48,140
And then this infection propagate and, you know, spread out in a spatial sort of fashion.

396
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:57,200
And then this spread out pattern or the evolution pattern is a source of this many factors and in the probability

397
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:05,390
fashion so that this becomes the very natural way to describe this movement or evolution of infection dynamics.

398
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:09,980
Okay. So that people are trying to really do this.

399
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:18,340
Mm hmm. And in the spatial modeling context, that neighbor, neighboring states were never.

400
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:27,220
Neighborhood may be more complicated because like Seattle and Detroit, as I just said, you know, when you have this airway connection.

401
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:38,930
Right. So the traditional sort of a pseudo armada has to be extended because this very sort of simple

402
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:46,190
neighboring cells may now be really something worth thinking about because you have the,

403
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:56,810
you know, availability of airports or other transportation of options that you can really bring people closer to us,

404
00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:01,010
especially when they have airplane or something like that.

405
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:07,100
So that when you define neighboring sort of counties in infectious disease,

406
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:14,750
you have to take this into consideration the human mobility and the ability to move from one location to another.

407
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:25,130
Right. So it's a little bit more complex, but people trying to modify full knowing this pseudo ultimate in the infected is smaller because it's pretty

408
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:37,580
simple and natural sort of mechanism that people can use to model this infectious and predict infection.

409
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:43,460
Okay. That's basically the the paper we wrote for our Harvard Data Science Review.

410
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:56,780
And one of the purposes really, I want to introduce the pseudo matter into the sort of spatial modeling for the county level COVID 19 risk prediction.

411
00:48:57,290 --> 00:49:01,930
I think that in statistics now, so many people are aware of this pseudo argument.

412
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:09,560
I just want to sort of disseminate somehow to tell people this is another powerful way to make a prediction.

413
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:19,830
Okay. And the other thing we like to solve is that this this is our model is mostly a model for tempo modeling.

414
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:26,870
Right. You look at you have a lot of experience, like if you look at the dynamics over time.

415
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:35,810
But the original mode comparable model is IRCA, remote art not really built up around this spatial sort of domain.

416
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:45,230
So we're trying to see how that, you know, classical motorcar model can be extended to incorporate some spatial structure into it.

417
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:53,600
Our first choice, of course, is to see how the whole norm, as you know, the City of Matter,

418
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:59,180
can be integrated with the system of differential equations, and so that that we can,

419
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:05,660
you know, make prediction and utilize this strains of see in modeling or dynamics to

420
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:11,030
understand that interactions how neighboring counties will be a factor each other.

421
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:16,250
So it's a very very natural thing to for bring multiple pieces together.

422
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:28,620
So that's the. The work we did and finally things that we revised this paper seven times and wasting, I think, three weeks or so.

423
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:36,960
So that I that was published I think in mid-July and may work I think it's May on June two, 2020.

424
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,440
And they've had a lot of pressure to publish something.

425
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:44,769
And so when we submitted then Harvard Data Science,

426
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:52,020
they want us to revise several months of revision within the next three weeks, finally to get published here.

427
00:50:52,290 --> 00:51:03,210
It just won't give you a little idea what we did here of namely that this is echoing back to the original motor command model.

428
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:09,780
And now we have extended extension to the OH by adding some spatial structure.

429
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:19,800
Okay. So basically in the to this situation, you can have the, for example, this once and number, then you can have the neighboring counties.

430
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:26,040
Of course, the neighboring countries should be Polygon rather, and this rigorous sort of like rectangles.

431
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:35,250
But you understand idea what we're doing. Okay, so now you have neighboring ones and now you're basically seeing that how this

432
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:41,670
neighboring counties will be affected according to this spatial so connectivity.

433
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:52,590
Right. So the first one is called empathy rule. So basically this one is in fact, in fact, that county has, you know, none zero confirmed cases.

434
00:51:52,590 --> 00:52:04,140
It will not. The neighboring BNP is a full formula manual and only the neighbors sales cell, the share sharing the the common lines will be affected.

435
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:08,520
Okay. So that's why this one would be a fact in four of them.

436
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:15,420
Okay, so that's full knowing that. So in the to the situation, this is the Morse rule.

437
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:25,140
So never if this is the county at the red in the red cover is affected then in a next generation that

438
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:33,630
the neighboring counties define both sharing the common line where the common point will be affected.

439
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:45,480
Okay, so that's the Morse rule and not otherwise called a m for no s rule basically states that you text for in this situation like two steps.

440
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:51,240
Okay, for example this one. So you take two steps, okay?

441
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:58,590
It can affect the neighboring counties of this, the distance of two steps here.

442
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:05,100
And this one is also you take two steps right here, here or you go here and here.

443
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:13,070
Okay. So so you has this sort of the second order neighboring a faction, okay.

444
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:21,930
By, you know, this sort of buffer of two sort of steps in the spatial distance.

445
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:32,849
Or you can see that this extended, if you have one sort of the county that has this sort of the in fact,

446
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:38,820
the case has been all the counties in this space will be possible, will be affected.

447
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,600
Okay. That's probably more like in the case of infectious disease.

448
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:46,350
You never know how the infected is will be eventually.

449
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:56,550
Oh, you're not traveling to any place in the U.S. If you have one case in a neighbor, you never know.

450
00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:00,630
Like, you know, where and when this this virus can be.

451
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,700
It will travel to anywhere in the country. It potentially every country is at risk.

452
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:14,820
Okay. So so that's could be a very oh, you know, realistic situation in infected disease.

453
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:17,520
So basically this is what happens, right?

454
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:28,920
So so you have a the red color means this affected countries and then the green one, would you basically remove this state?

455
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:36,779
Right. So that's the county that has or is a place that has been removed from the system

456
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:42,930
due to the foot infection or something like that at this given the type of so that,

457
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:46,380
you know, do have some a susceptible state. Okay.

458
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:55,319
And so on, so forth. So so that that could be a structure that that we use in the most comparable model.

459
00:54:55,320 --> 00:55:03,720
You have this susceptible sort of county you have infected come to you and you have removed county at given time.

460
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:12,090
So now if you want use this sort of full nomads rule of two.

461
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:18,120
So after this process here, you can see that at a given time, some counties are.

462
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:22,140
Some counties are currently infected.

463
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:31,679
Some counties are successful. Then you move to next time using this updating route and you can see more and more countries are become.

464
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,360
Rhett big factors okay some companies have become a little bit so on so forth so.

465
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:48,840
So you want to somehow incorporate this more compound model dynamics into this spatial sales to really model this dynamics.

466
00:55:51,480 --> 00:56:03,389
So here is the model that we proposed. So first of all, we introduced see in the past subscript where it indicates A to United States,

467
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:15,060
we have the once three in 100 oh nine counties in the continent, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.

468
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:20,820
Okay. So we have about 3990 900 counties, I think.

469
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:25,560
So now you feel that this motor company model on the each county.

470
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:31,980
Okay. So this thing to counter you have it has its own sort of transition dynamics.

471
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:36,420
Of course there's an interaction interplay between companies.

472
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:39,900
Sure. Okay. But anyway, that's what we started.

473
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:50,750
So this each county that you have this sort of the the differential equations like this Theta S-t knows the, you know,

474
00:56:51,060 --> 00:57:03,120
probability of what the proportion of people in this county, in the county see are being sort of susceptible.

475
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:11,339
Right. So so given time, then you have this up to this this this first part is really just this item.

476
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:18,390
All right. So there's internal transmission within each given county, right?

477
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:24,600
So now, of course, that you have this spatial part into this consideration,

478
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:31,890
not only that you have this sort of this in county transmission, this is a fashion.

479
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:41,760
But the all told, the the infected cases from other countries will be part of the yellow part of this infection dynamics.

480
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:48,780
So so how do you sort of incorporate that part into the into the model?

481
00:57:49,500 --> 00:58:03,000
So from, you know, the the the time that you have more people moving to a compartment within this county, the same time you have additional in fact,

482
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:10,920
the cases cost the by interaction of the residents of this county you see with other countries see crime.

483
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:22,260
Okay. So we use the capital to this as we seek to do, you know, the the all the counties in the United States except that county under consideration.

484
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:26,070
So so this notation denotes that, you know,

485
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:35,940
the all the counties expect counties see so same prime is a generic notation for any other counties except you know then the county seat.

486
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:43,799
So this C prime NC prime is total population of the county seat, prime of state,

487
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:55,500
r c prime I is a t minus one is the number of if the probability or proportion of individuals in County C prime being affected.

488
00:58:55,950 --> 00:59:05,339
So this n times this c c i c prime state are c prime itemize y is total number of people

489
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:11,860
infected in that county divided by this and c which is the population of county.

490
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:17,159
You see this basically tells you the chance that how likely a individual from county

491
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:25,080
C will be attracting virus with will meaning a individual from Campisi Prime.

492
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:30,960
Okay. The new manager is the total number of infected individuals, obviously prime.

493
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:37,110
So what's the chance that all of these NC individuals in the population in the county see?

494
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:45,240
What's the chance that that the one person will be likely to, you know, meet the infected person from Country C prime?

495
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:55,010
Because if there is no way that they can this two counties are connected, then this will be not going to happen.

496
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:55,260
Right.

497
00:59:55,830 --> 01:00:08,040
So that this omega c c prime basically tells you how strongly this to, you know, how tightly this two counties prime are connected to each other.

498
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:18,330
Right. If they are very, very near each other or like maybe this C prime county is Wyoming or, you know, Idaho, maybe it's very unlike.

499
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:23,780
It to be that. But if this is from New York, then it's more likely to be like that.

500
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:25,400
So. So the omegas.

501
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:37,130
So this is prime just describe how tightly this two companies are related so that this could be adjusted according to the connectivity stress.

502
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,520
Okay. But this is the additional.

503
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:49,490
In fact, it's caused by the fact that, in fact, the individual outside of the company see due to this spatial dependance.

504
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:53,980
So you have one part as cost the by the internal faction.

505
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:58,250
In fact, the people within country. That's the same model.

506
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:06,350
But you have additional neighboring countries that could also cause this additional infection.

507
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:12,390
But the infection source is coming outside. Can't you see this is due to the spatial dependance?

508
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:15,650
So that. That's the part of you. So this part is easy.

509
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:23,450
Okay. So you have additional infections pass from this in country passed additional infections from

510
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:33,620
Costa by or the result from the interaction of the countries see with the other countries.

511
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:36,930
Okay. This is if the model would be allowed. Okay.

512
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:40,730
The question here is the order parameters are relatively straightforward.

513
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:45,710
The question here is how do you define is only got cc prime t.

514
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:55,249
Okay. So that becomes a somewhat ad hoc way to to do this because this describes this connectivity

515
01:01:55,250 --> 01:02:00,950
coefficient that quantifies both volume and accessibility from country to country.

516
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:09,290
C prime. And this E coefficient is the weight of countries being a transportation or medical center.

517
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:14,600
And the DCC prime is due distance between county city in the state prime.

518
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:20,330
H t could be a time of major gathering because at time that, you know,

519
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:30,140
we have this presidential camping and there are a lot of major gatherings because of political campaign.

520
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:40,460
So we want to build up that sort of major event where you have big gathering of big party and, you know, thousands of people coming together in a one,

521
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:48,490
you know, indoor place for some some activities that people are more likely to, in fact, that each other.

522
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:53,090
So so that time we're trying to build up something into that model.

523
01:02:53,180 --> 01:03:02,980
Okay. Not only geo distance, but also the big gathering where, you know, people from different places will come to the,

524
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:12,440
you know, the big party that can create some additional, you know, so sort of chance of infection, the connectivity.

525
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:17,300
Okay. So that's something we're trying to wait. Just explain this.

526
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:27,379
So one purpose of doing this speech modeling, of course, is to see which counties will become infected.

527
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:38,750
What's the the chance of in fact, as I said, that the theta C that I see is the actually the proportion of confirmed cases.

528
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,320
In fact, the cases. Okay. For countries.

529
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:45,530
See, this is something we're interested.

530
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:53,810
Okay. We are not only interested in yes or no, we're interested in a probability of of, you know,

531
01:03:54,380 --> 01:04:03,290
being contagious or being affected or proportion of people in the countries c being affected.

532
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:11,150
So, so that's something we're trying to model so that you really want to estimate this thing or even predict this thing.

533
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:11,900
Okay.

534
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:22,610
So at that time in May of 2020, we already know that people started to develop some of antibody because they had this sort of contract, the virus.

535
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:28,360
Then they develop their immune system that can, you know, get some that to immunization.

536
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:38,030
So we purposely created a compartment, the compartment of this virtual of contraction of the B bears.

537
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:43,130
So so that's the something went out of tourism model.

538
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:54,260
Okay. So, but anyway, this is, um, differential equation extending the SRM model to s air model.

539
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:59,210
And also here we are not looking at zero one situation we're looking at.

540
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:09,020
So those are, you know, proportions of being affected, proportion of removed and proportion of being natural immunized,

541
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:13,610
naturally immunized, and proportion of individuals at risk.

542
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:18,140
So we use this differential equation to study that and.

543
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:21,500
Across all the countries. Okay. So.

544
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:25,940
So that's something we like to make a prediction. Okay.

545
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:34,920
So we can do one day risk prediction for a given country.

546
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:40,080
That's the whole purpose of the paper to have the high resolution prediction with country level.

547
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:43,020
So T zero is the current time set today.

548
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:53,730
So what you like to predict is what is the proportion of individuals being affected and tomorrow for this country?

549
01:05:54,120 --> 01:06:01,500
So this is the actually one of the differential equations that specified this SDR model.

550
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:11,580
So so you just plug in that. Okay. So so this is the the value we like to predict.

551
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:20,100
So how do you do this? T They are ahead of risk prediction.

552
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:24,450
Then you need to use the entire system to. To make a prediction.

553
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:36,340
Right. So. So your first, you know, predictor of proportion of individual susceptible individuals, then you predict that they are moving forward.

554
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:44,850
You have done three you know that you use predictive to sort of observe that and do folder prediction and then you predict

555
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:53,340
that the proportion of so here this and those are t no no it should be t now t zero because this t can be t days away.

556
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:53,760
Okay.

557
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:08,210
Anyway, so you then you do this folder prediction for this proportion of the being affected and so proportion of individual removed from County C,

558
01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:10,740
so on and so forth. Okay.

559
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:18,350
So now after you do this, T they ahead the risk of prediction using this differential equation that you can calculate risk for.

560
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:29,580
Okay. So risk score is. So for individuals who are leaving this particular copies, you seen how likely that you will be affected in the next two days?

561
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:39,420
Okay, here's the calculation. So at you know, suppose the word t zeros today.

562
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:47,460
So this is theta state acit0 plus one is the chance that we're being affected tomorrow.

563
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:51,520
What's the chance that you'll be infected in the country? C If you're living in countries?

564
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:54,660
C What's the chance that you are being affected tomorrow?

565
01:07:55,410 --> 01:08:05,910
This is the probability effects. And now if you are now going to be factored tomorrow, what's the the probability that you'll be factored in two days?

566
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:08,930
If you are not being factored in the next two days,

567
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:15,420
one of you the chance that would be factored a third D from today, so on and so forth, up to two days.

568
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:20,040
So you get this cumulative probability, you calculate this way.

569
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:23,190
We call this risk for over 80 days.

570
01:08:23,610 --> 01:08:33,840
Okay. So so your source exclusions of sort of probability law to do this condition, probability to calculate the risk score.

571
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:43,500
So to get the total chance that you'll be, in fact, in the next ten days, any day during this period of t days, what's the chance of that?

572
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:49,010
Okay. And also, at that time, I contacted Google Map.

573
01:08:49,400 --> 01:09:00,780
We really want to predict I want to put this all the prediction in the Google map and so that we wanted to create a travel sort of risk prediction.

574
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:05,700
Okay. So if people can open up Google map, then they can, you know,

575
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:13,319
see what my chance if I want to travel for two days at multiple locations, you know what?

576
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:20,770
My chance of being infected. Okay. Because we give this counter level prediction across all the like 300,

577
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:32,310
3900 counties in the U.S. And then you can calculate what is, you know, the risk for a certain given plan of plan of travel trip.

578
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,390
Okay. So here is a simple example. We we did that.

579
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:42,220
We did not happen, but it's kind of something like I feel regret.

580
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:48,720
Otherwise this whole thing could be a bit more impactful. But I saw it.

581
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:55,280
And so I made a proposal to NIH know NSF.

582
01:09:55,290 --> 01:10:04,910
I hope that I can get some money to pay Google to, you know, add this sort of thing on the Google map.

583
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:09,240
But that proposal was not approved. I don't know why they do not give them a month.

584
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:17,460
They did not give me money to do this. I, I feel this a very cool thing to add the Google map so people can calculate risk for their travel.

585
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:24,330
So this is a simple calculation just for the simplicity of understanding how this works.

586
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:27,450
You know, this is very simple situation.

587
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:36,000
We just want illustrated how to utilize that, predict the value of county level prediction risk to, you know, tell people the risk of travel.

588
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:42,720
So let's say be a set of counties that a traveler plans to stop over in next two days.

589
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:49,760
Okay. That's the thing. Your plan. First, suppose the traveler stop one country per day.

590
01:10:49,770 --> 01:10:53,820
This is very ideal sort of setting, but you can modify that.

591
01:10:54,330 --> 01:11:01,410
So stop a one county per day. And you know that according to this sort of plan, say one to city solved.

592
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:07,940
So you have two days travel each day, you stay to one county, and this is sequence of the stops that you plan to do.

593
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:12,540
CJP In the country visit a t day t zero plus g.

594
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:18,190
So now you can calculate using similar formulas to calculate the risk of the travel.

595
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:22,540
Suppose that your first state will state and countries see one.

596
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:27,430
So what is this predicted risk or for that county's c one?

597
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:34,990
So you feel now getting the fact that the county C one, then you the next day you moved to county C two.

598
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:39,250
So what's the chance that you, this traveler, will get, in fact,

599
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:45,130
in the county c two if this guy is not in fact they come to ac1 and so on and so forth.

600
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:51,220
So here you involve this T many different counties and that are predicted by this.

601
01:11:51,370 --> 01:12:00,640
Okay. This is the value that we like to put on the Google map, talking about a little bit, the connectivity.

602
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:13,540
Okay. So what we did here is that we not only geo distance here our but also we look at some the airport, this inter-county mobility factor.

603
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:26,590
And so we sort of did the categorization and created five categories to sort of indicate that this inter-county mobility factor,

604
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:33,340
essentially this is from University of Maryland Transportation Research Center.

605
01:12:33,730 --> 01:12:37,310
They have this sort of mobility. I mean,

606
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:44,620
they're counting the mobility data where the you track people's iPhone to see

607
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:49,390
how what the level of mobility for the individual during that period time.

608
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:59,140
So. So the the lower the more sort of the mobility.

609
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:05,600
Right. So. Yeah.

610
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:10,060
Anyway, so. So that's what we did here.

611
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:17,220
And also we look out at the Inter-county connectivity using this travel distance.

612
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:22,810
So we basically say that within 500 kilometers, people are more likely to drive.

613
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:35,830
Okay. So this basically you just use a geo distance to indicate that the distance or the locations of two counties that are more than 500 kilometers,

614
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:40,560
that people tend to more likely to fly rather than drive car right.

615
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:46,209
To driving. Okay. So that, you know, then when you use airports,

616
01:13:46,210 --> 01:13:55,050
then you kind of can't you wonder now did two counties would have the airport within county or, you know, in the neighboring counties?

617
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:59,410
So here that is like suppose airport air and airport, a prime.

618
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:06,940
There are two different possible airports for country C and then and C prime.

619
01:14:07,330 --> 01:14:17,140
And then you calculate the the distance between the the actually the location of county and to the airport location.

620
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:24,430
So that's another way that you calculate this entire sort of county connectivity.

621
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:37,870
So based on that, we just made this county level prediction and so made a seven days prediction from May 2nd, 2020.

622
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:46,690
So we have all the data we there. So 3100 or nine counties in the continental United States.

623
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:55,090
So we made a five this prediction. This is the I don't know which state this is.

624
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,700
I think the seventh day, the prediction.

625
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:07,840
Okay. So this is actually, you know, the risk score we predicted.

626
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:16,470
Okay. For seven days now, particularly, we predicted the risk score for New York because, you know, workers,

627
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:26,860
they stay where they has this antibody survey so that we can really have more precise data for a compartment, antibody compartment.

628
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:38,110
So so that really is the state that we want folks on to really build up a more reliable a compartment in the prediction.

629
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:50,150
So how accurate the prediction would be is when we when we have the time when the paper was accepted in the final round revision.

630
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:57,340
I think that's lead to me. So we already observed the data from May 3rd and May nine.

631
01:15:57,350 --> 01:16:00,710
At the time we finished the writing the paper.

632
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:05,010
We do not have that data, but at a time we are about to publish the paper.

633
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:11,030
We already have observed data unites States for this seven days for one week ahead.

634
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:16,870
So the added editorial mean, the editor of the Journal asked us to make a comparison.

635
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:24,590
We see that's what we do here. Okay, so this is log ten based transformation.

636
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:30,530
So here's minus four, minus six, minus ten, minus ten, -12.

637
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:36,510
Okay. So this is basically predict the theta I the risk.

638
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:44,180
Let's see that. I think so. So this is the distribution for all 3900 countries.

639
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:50,450
Okay. So you can see that the accuracy is to up to 10 to -8.

640
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:56,840
Okay. So so the the prediction is pretty accurate.

641
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:06,400
Okay. So, so the average is around like 10 to -8.

642
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:10,659
This is difference, the prediction accuracy. Okay.

643
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:14,780
So, so you can see that this is pretty powerful model.

644
01:17:15,190 --> 01:17:21,910
We didn't know we do not know the data. And with time we published paper to the editor ourselves to really calculate this,

645
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:27,129
you know, prediction, accuracy and predicting actually is actually very accurate.

646
01:17:27,130 --> 01:17:30,170
10 to -8. Okay.

647
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:35,980
So so yeah, I felt that the single ultimate model is very powerful, actually.

648
01:17:36,130 --> 01:17:43,450
According to this exercise we did and that we just made this very fine example to show people how to calculate travel risk.

649
01:17:43,810 --> 01:17:52,299
Suppose you start from another right Washington now and you're going to Chicago to the Cook County.

650
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:59,170
That's the biggest county in Chicago. Right. So that you have all the travel wrote like this way.

651
01:17:59,530 --> 01:17:59,890
Okay.

652
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:15,730
So that we sort of make this stop somehow, like a subway stops or so that you tackle this predicted risk and then the total risk is given an end.

653
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:25,420
So if if this is some kind of road that you're going to drive your car and stop and different places, and that's this is the total risk.

654
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:28,720
In a few days we calculated.

655
01:18:28,930 --> 01:18:36,430
So one on one time where we want to put this into Google map that you know what what this is going to be.

656
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:41,559
And unfortunately, I did not get funding from NSF to do this whole work.

657
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:48,460
But it's quite fun work that we're trying to, you know, come to build out.

658
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:52,540
So risk assessment in the United States.

659
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:55,970
But the the backbone of this whole work is sue.

660
01:18:57,170 --> 01:19:07,690
Okay. It's the the model, the framework that allows us to extend a MULTI-COMPONENT model from the national level or state level to Congo level.

661
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:20,230
And using this inter-county connectivity of mobility to add to this spatial sort of neighboring room into this infection model,

662
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:24,160
that really gives very high, accurate prediction about the risk.

663
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:40,900
Okay. So that's something I enjoy quite a bit on this paper and and it's quite a nice work, I think, according to my own sort of study on this.

664
01:19:41,290 --> 01:19:45,940
Okay. So that's all I want to say for this today.

665
01:19:46,090 --> 01:19:54,310
No questions. Yeah. Are we fully prepared to do the homework with today up to today's lecture?

666
01:19:55,240 --> 01:20:01,150
Oh, no, it's. No, this requires the CMC.

667
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:05,780
You should like the homework that you will be providing us today.

668
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:09,220
Will we be able to do it with what we've learned up to this point?

669
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:12,630
Yes. Yes, yes. Yes. Yes, correct. Correct. Yes, yes.

670
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:15,730
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, that's it.

671
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:16,740
Yeah. Thanks.
