1
00:00:01,234 --> 00:00:06,574
So as I mentioned, we have the remote recorder pilot. This would be in classrooms only.

2
00:00:07,144 --> 00:00:09,544
And it's a very hands off, as I mentioned,

3
00:00:09,784 --> 00:00:18,914
all you would need to do is come in and log in to the computer and we'll set it to start and stop and record everything you do.

4
00:00:18,934 --> 00:00:23,764
Similar to what I just set up recording still posed to canvas.

5
00:00:25,714 --> 00:00:30,424
The only sort of gotcha is that you can't use other audio video tools.

6
00:00:30,724 --> 00:00:39,304
So perhaps you have a guest speaker coming in in person, but maybe they need to switch to joining in over Zoom and you're going to pull up Zoom.

7
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:44,644
We can't use both of those tools at the same time because they both want to use the same devices.

8
00:00:45,724 --> 00:00:51,814
And so in that case, we would just need to cancel this scheduled recording on our end.

9
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:58,573
Here are some of the classrooms that currently have the room over quarter installed.

10
00:00:58,574 --> 00:01:16,214
The room I'm in right now is 1655 in one 3755 in each one has it installed and m 1122 and am 4318 and a speech to currently have it installed.

11
00:01:17,024 --> 00:01:18,944
If this seems like something of interest,

12
00:01:19,844 --> 00:01:29,654
shoot us an email at the instruction you mentioned Edu and we'd be happy to include you in the pilot for that.

13
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:36,384
I also mentioned the Web based reporter, and that is called Panopto Capture.

14
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:44,844
So again, this would be if I need to record something when I don't want to install the desktop recorder tool like we just saw.

15
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:50,994
So if I'm teaching in a classroom outside of a speech or even if I'm creating a video

16
00:01:50,994 --> 00:01:55,884
for my computer and I don't want to install a pro a new program on my computer,

17
00:01:56,004 --> 00:02:04,314
I can use the Web recorder. Let me show you what that looks like so I can launch this also from my campus site.

18
00:02:06,434 --> 00:02:15,884
Using the create button. And this second option here Panopto capture record and browser that's going to open a new tab.

19
00:02:16,754 --> 00:02:26,624
And the most important thing to get this to work successfully is to approve access to your camera and microphone.

20
00:02:28,724 --> 00:02:35,774
So I would need to click allow here so that the browser can access my devices,

21
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:41,804
at which time I would see a preview here in the center and I would see audio waveforms here.

22
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:49,244
So this is a great tool for a quick recording and easy way for your students to do recordings.

23
00:02:49,244 --> 00:02:59,953
If you do like a student media assignment, I'm not going to allow that right now just because I'm already using too many devices as it is,

24
00:02:59,954 --> 00:03:06,014
it's going to look like it's not going to be happy.

25
00:03:06,824 --> 00:03:13,184
So here's where I would be able to set my audio, my webcam, just in case my computer has more than one device.

26
00:03:13,754 --> 00:03:17,203
And then what screen or application I want to share.

27
00:03:17,204 --> 00:03:25,664
So if I'm on a multi if I have two screens or maybe I only want to show my Chrome browser, you know,

28
00:03:25,754 --> 00:03:27,812
like a slide deck or my campus site, I can set that up and then that will also upload right here to your campus.
