1
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,770
So my area of research is on the health effects of ambient air pollution.

2
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:20,490
And in doing work in this area, I've had the wonderful good fortune of being able to work with the U.S. Environmental Protection

3
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,770
Agency as they do their schedule reviews of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

4
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:33,420
Periodically, the agency needs to go through and evaluate the science in order to try and understand whether

5
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,330
or not there's good evidence that a pollutant is a causal risk factor for adverse health.

6
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:48,380
Effectively the job is to go through and compile all of what's been seen in the literature and what's been studied in the past.

7
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:55,810
In order to make a determination as to whether or not certain pollutants are likely to have causal relationships with health,

8
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,900
whether or not something is suggestively but non conclusively causal,

9
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:07,400
whether or not there's inadequate information to determine causality or whether or not something is not likely causal.

10
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:15,229
In this way, the government is setting themselves up with information as to whether or not they need to modify existing national

11
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:22,310
ambient air quality standards for different pollutants based on the scientific certainty of our knowledge.

12
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,850
So how do we set these classifications?

13
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:36,190
Well, the truth is that it takes a synthesis of all that you've learned to date and an ability to think critically about existing studies.

14
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,820
So let's say you want to evaluate a particular paper for that paper, perhaps a report that you're looking at.

15
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,410
You want to walk through systematically a series of different questions.

16
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,270
First are the methods and the paper well-defined and well described.

17
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,890
Second, are there any flaws that you can see in the research?

18
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:03,040
Third, are there any other likely explanations for the findings that are being reported?

19
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:10,180
Next, do the results make sense? And finally, are the findings that they see important?

20
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:19,840
Hopefully, in thinking about these questions, you should be remembering issues of study, design, biases and confounding,

21
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:27,310
because they're all the concepts that we've talked about to date in this class that are going to help you to critically appraise different studies.

22
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,260
In this unit,

23
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:37,150
we're going to walk through each of these topics one by one and think about what you want to evaluate with respect to each of these questions.

24
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,330
We'll start first by discussing how to best synthesize and critically appraise the literature.

25
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:51,700
Then we'll spend a little bit of time talking about whether or not the findings you see are important from a population health perspective.

26
00:02:52,780 --> 00:03:00,190
In doing this, we're going to talk about the role of chance and we'll cover what epidemiology really thinks about P values.

27
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,800
We'll also talk about whether or not you can generalize findings to other populations.

28
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,100
For me, this unit is a perfect capstone for the class because what you're doing is you're bringing

29
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:18,130
all that you've learned to date to bear on understanding real world epidemiological studies.
