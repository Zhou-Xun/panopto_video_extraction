1
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,960
That's great. So we can we can get started.

2
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:21,010
First the football schools Neil Mills England Wales and one nil.

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,400
US Iran on very us out there.

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,000
I hope you all have a good Thanksgiving. Thanks for bringing me while I was away in Kenya.

5
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:37,690
What did everybody think about the movie? So it is a book as well.

6
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:47,090
People know that. Does anybody want a copy of the book? Okay, I'll read it.

7
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,390
I have to go. Great.

8
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,320
So today's class is going to be all discussion based.

9
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:09,989
I was going to include a lecture on climate change, but just seeing how much discussion we could have around the movie decided to omit that.

10
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,020
What I can do if people are interested in climate change is let me know.

11
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:20,790
And I can recall the lecture I was going to give on that. So today you're going to split into three different groups.

12
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:34,240
And the way we would do that is. If two people can maybe get together and then get it to people on Zoom.

13
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,490
One group will discuss the beginning of the movie.

14
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,090
So from there the movie begins and the revolution.

15
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:50,200
Up until then, you should leave Syria.

16
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,009
One group will discuss the journey from Germany.

17
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:59,080
So when they fly to Turkey and then across the sea and a journey through Europe to Germany,

18
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:06,190
and then one group will discuss that time as asylum seekers in Germany.

19
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,430
So when they with that train and what you're going to do is you're going to try to figure out

20
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:19,570
if you were working for an NGO or for the government coming in to just what drove me on.

21
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:24,790
How with the population at each one of these stages, you're going to discuss what you would do.

22
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,470
So what are the health impacts they would have?

23
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:32,860
What health impacts would it have on prevention or detection of disease or treatment of disease or just the overall burden of disease?

24
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:40,360
And what would you do to to to remedy these past years health impacts?

25
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:49,180
And you can pick any health topic you want, which we've covered over the semester, for example, LGBTQ plus health care,

26
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:56,170
broad nature, nutrition, immunization programs, HIV and reproductive health, maternal and child health.

27
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,420
One health, diarrhea, vector borne disease, cancers. Really, whatever you want to pick.

28
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,950
Suspend maybe about half an hour. And your group's talking about that.

29
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:12,440
And you can do it however you want. Maybe you want to all work on one one health topic and really go in depth and that

30
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,970
maybe you want to break it up and maybe one person works on one health topic.

31
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,040
Everything's fine, and after half an hour,

32
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:24,580
we'll come back and each group will have about 15 minutes to go back to class for what they've kind of discussed.

33
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,670
Feel free to open up Netflix and rewatch bits from the movie as discussing this.

34
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,840
And so I do have it open over here if you want to.

35
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,510
While you're discussing with the class, go to different clips in the movie and say this is going to have a health impact because of this.

36
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:45,510
Any questions? Okay.

37
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:52,200
So I'll let you get into your own groups and whichever group has the smallest number of people.

38
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,370
If you could just open the computer and add Rachel Nevin, please.

39
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,970
So it's a.
