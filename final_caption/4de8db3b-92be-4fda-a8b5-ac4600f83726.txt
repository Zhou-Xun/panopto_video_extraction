00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Injury. Part five. Intentional violence in this final segment of the lecture, we will examine deaths due to homicide and suicide in the United States.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Violence can occur in many different circumstances, which makes it complicated to address gangs and crime are a major source of violence.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Other examples include youth violence, elder abuse and sexual and partner violence.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This presentation will focus on suicide and homicide in the United States with examination of key demographic factors, temporal trends.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Some international comparisons and the role of firearms in intentional injuries and intentional injury deaths in particular in the United States.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Recall that intentional injury deaths, in particular,

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
deaths by suicide and homicide taken together are among the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Suicides outnumber homicides by more than two to one.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:34,000
However, as we shall see, while there are some underlying similarities, there are also some important differences between these two categories.

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's begin by focusing on deaths by suicide. Suicide rates differ by sex and age.

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Suicide rates have been consistently higher among males than among females for all age groups.

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Overall, more than 75 percent of suicides occur among males.

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
There is also considerable variation in suicide rates by age, particularly among men.

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Notably, firearms were the most common suicide mechanism among males, whereas poisoning was the most common suicide mechanism among females.

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The overall suicide rate in the United States has increased since 2009.

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This pattern has been consistent for all major categories of race and ethnicity.

17
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But there are important disparities among these groups, notably while American Indians and Alaska Natives have had the highest suicide rate overall.

18
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The suicide rate among whites is also high and has been roughly twice as high as the rates among blacks and Hispanics.

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:01,000
During this same time period. This slide provides an international perspective of suicide deaths in the United States.

20
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The graph on the left displays the rate of death from suicide for the entire

21
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
world and for the United States during the period from 1990 to twenty seventeen.

22
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The death rate from suicide in the entire world declined by 35 percent.

23
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,000
In contrast, the death rate from suicide in the United States increased about six percent during the same period.

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And for the last decade or so, the U.S. rate has exceeded the overall world rate.

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The graph in the right panel includes the United States in the world,

26
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
but also includes many of the high income countries against which the U.S. is more appropriately compared.

27
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Please note that the vertical scales on these two graphs differ, which is important to keep in mind when comparing them.

28
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:04,000
In 1990, the death rate from suicide in the United States was about 12 per hundred thousand, which was in the middle of the pack.

29
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
However, while most of the other countries, particularly those with the highest death rates,

30
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
experienced substantial declines over the next twenty seven years, the rate in the U.S. actually increased slightly.

31
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So that by 2017, the United States had the second highest death rate from suicide among these high income countries.

32
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:35,000
In other words, the United States has fallen behind most of its peers.

33
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This graph displays the current mental health status of suicide decedents in twenty seventeen from thirty six states by sex.

34
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Suicide is strongly associated with mental illness, particularly bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and depression.

35
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And though not shown here, suicide is also strongly associated with substance abuse, including alcohol and other substance abuse problems.

36
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The United States is also an international outlier in another respect, which is that firearms are the dominant cause of all intentional injury deaths.

37
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Firearms are the cause of death.

38
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:30,000
In just over 50 percent of all suicides in the United States and about 75 percent of all homicide deaths in the United States.

39
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So it is impossible to have a discussion about prevention of suicide and homicide without also talking about guns.

40
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Brigs and Tabarrok studied the relationship between gun ownership and suicide on a state by state basis.

41
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The vertical axis in this graph is the population rate of suicide by firearm.

42
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The horizontal axis is the estimated proportion of adults who live in a household with a

43
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
firearm based on multiple national surveys conducted by the Centers for Disease Control,

44
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:18,000
specifically the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, or B-R f SS as can be seen in this graph.

45
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:27,000
There is a strong positive correlation between having firearms in the household and the rate of suicide by firearm.

46
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
States with the highest prevalence of gun ownership have more than four times the rate

47
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
of suicide by firearms compared to states with the lowest rates of gun ownership.

48
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:49,000
In other words, having a gun in the home is a significant risk factor for death by suicide.

49
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Now, let's focus on homicides as shown in the left hand graph over the last century or so.

50
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The homicide rate in the United States has gone through major fluctuations.

51
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
In the 1960s, the homicide rate increased very sharply.

52
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
More than doubling from the nadir in the 50s. And it remained elevated for almost 30 years.

53
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The rate then dropped sharply in the 90s,

54
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,000
back to where it had been approximately prior to the increase in the 60s, as can be seen in the right hand graph.

55
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The rate continued to decline until 2014, and since then it has shown a modest increase.

56
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Homicide deaths in the United States display large disparities by sex and by race.

57
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And these differences have been relatively consistent over the last 60 years.

58
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Overall, males are two to three times more likely to die by homicide than females.

59
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This excess of males deaths by homicide is similar to the pattern for suicides.

60
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
However, there is a very different pattern for race.

61
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Unlike death rates by suicide, in which the rates for whites are about double those seen among blacks,

62
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
blacks in the United States are far more likely to die by homicide than whites.

63
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And this disparity is particularly extreme among black males.

64
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Black males are seven to 10 times more likely to die by homicide than white males.

65
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Black females are three to five times more likely to die by homicide than white females.

66
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
These racial disparities vary somewhat by age and are most extreme in both sexes.

67
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:52,000
For those between the ages of 15 and 40 for.

68
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
As shown in the graph on the right, there are many countries that have far higher homicide rates than the United States.

69
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The homicide rate is about the same as the mean for all countries in the world.

70
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Clearly, the United States does not have the highest homicide rate in the world, but it is nevertheless an outlier.

71
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:24,000
All the comparison countries in the graph on the right are low or middle income countries with very high rates of gang and other criminal violence.

72
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
These are not the appropriate countries for comparison with the United States.

73
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The graph on the left displays homicide rates for the US, for the world and for 16 other high income countries.

74
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Note that the vertical scales of the two graphs differ. The overall homicide rate in the United States is at least three, and it most case,

75
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
and in most cases 10 or more times greater than other high income countries.

76
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Which is why the U.S. is considered to be an outlier. With respect to homicide deaths among all high income countries.

77
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:13,000
As previously noted, about 75 percent of homicides in the United States are related to firearms.

78
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:25,000
In this regard, it is notable that the U.S. has the highest gun ownership rate in the world.

79
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Given that the majority of homicide deaths in the United States are due to firearms,

80
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:39,000
this slide displays graphs showing international comparisons but focused exclusively on homicides due to firearms in each country.

81
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Please note that the vertical axes for these two graphs are different.

82
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Again, as seen in the graph on the right, the United States does not have the highest homicide rate in the world due to firearms.

83
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But again, the countries with higher firearm related homicide rates are all low or middle

84
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
income countries and are not appropriate for comparison to the United States,

85
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
which is a high income country as can be seen in the graph on the left.

86
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The homicide rate due to firearms in the United States is more than double the rate for the rest of the world,

87
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
but it is nine times to more than 50 times greater than in other high income countries.

88
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It is accurate to state that the United States has had and continues to have an epidemic of homicide deaths due to firearms.

89
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:46,000
A key pillar of the public health approach to addressing public health problems is to conduct research that can then inform policy decisions.

90
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Unfortunately, the track record and domain of firearms has been dismal.

91
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
A key justification for widespread gun ownership, often given by gun advocates,

92
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:10,000
is that possession of a gun or having a gun in the home is protective of oneself and or one's family from robbery, assault and or murder.

93
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:19,000
While there have while there are many conspicuous anecdotes that align with this assertion, anecdotes are not scientific data,

94
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and they are contradicted in this instance by scientific research based on more representative data.

95
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Having a gun in the home increases the risk of death by firearm by almost threefold.

96
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The risk of firearm deaths related to having a gun in the home is due almost

97
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
entirely to either suicide or homicide related to intimate partner violence.

98
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Analogously,

99
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:56,000
personal possession of a gun actually serves to increase the risk of being shot by more than four times compared to those who did not possess a gun.

100
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:06,000
When assaulted. Amazingly and somewhat unbelievably, in response to intense lobbying by pro-gun advocates,

101
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
the U.S. Congress's response to these studies has been to pass legislation that blocks the Centers

102
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
for Disease Control and other public health agencies from funding firearm related research.

103
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So for more than 20 years, there has been little or no federally funded research on firearm safety and public health.

104
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
There are a number of key messages related deaths from intentional injuries.

105
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:49,000
There are significant racial and ethnic disparities with intentional injuries, but these disparities differ markedly for suicide and homicide deaths.

106
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The United States is an outlier for rates for both suicide at Hama.

107
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The homicide deaths compared to all other high income countries. These differences are not natural and suggests that great progress could be made.

108
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:11,000
The United States has a unique and difficult politics in history related to guns and gun violence.

109
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But for public health to make any advances in this domain as a first step,

110
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:27,000
the Congress needs to change the law to allow federal funding of prevention research related to firearms.

111
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
As with other public health challenges, there are multiple potential approaches to reducing intentional injury deaths.

112
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Various forms of gun control might be very effective,

113
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:48,000
but politically very difficult to implement due to intense and divisive politics surrounding the Second Amendment.

114
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,000
There are some avenues for better and smarter law enforcement that might contribute to fewer intentional injury deaths.

115
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
There is certainly greater need for more and better social and mental health services,

116
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:10,000
particularly for addressing depression and substance abuse, which are so often a precursor to suicide.

117
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Education can have a role such as teaching young people about conflict resolution to prevent violence and

118
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:24,000
also contribute to the generally better outcomes when people are better educated and as already noted.

119
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:33,000
We need more and better research about intentional injuries to inform public policy.

120
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
In summary, injury is the third leading cause of mortality in the United States.

121
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Injury, both intentional and unintentional, can be approached successfully as a public health issue.

122
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Great strides have been made in some areas, such as with motor vehicle injuries and occupational injuries.

123
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Unfortunately, in some domains, things have gone backwards.

124
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:05,000
As with the massive increase in poisonings or overdose deaths over the last 25 years or so, and finally,

125
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:18,909
some areas have simply not been adequately addressed, such as falls and intentional injuries, particularly those related to firearms.
