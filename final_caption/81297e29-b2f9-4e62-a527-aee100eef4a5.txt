1
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,280
Today we'll begin to
explore the principles of

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,030
microeconomics by looking
at consumer behavior.

3
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,850
Our learning objectives
are to describe

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,385
the key economic actors
in health and healthcare,

5
00:00:20,385 --> 00:00:22,695
including their objectives
and incentives,

6
00:00:22,695 --> 00:00:24,690
to predict how
economic actors are

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,330
likely to respond to changes
in their incentives,

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,400
and to analyze how they interact

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,140
in pursuit of their objectives,

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,880
and how those
interactions influence

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,255
the cost and effectiveness
of the healthcare system.

12
00:00:36,255 --> 00:00:39,195
Today's focus will be consumers.

13
00:00:39,195 --> 00:00:40,760
We'll also be introducing

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,530
the roles of firms
and government,

15
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,215
and we'll consider them
more thoroughly later.

16
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:47,210
Simply put, consumers are

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,970
individuals or households
that make decisions about

18
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,860
the purchase of goods
and services with

19
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,780
their scarce financial resources

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,835
and the use of their scarce time.

21
00:00:55,835 --> 00:00:57,620
For example,
allocating their time

22
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,450
between labor and leisure.

23
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,790
Firms produce goods
and services for

24
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,040
sale in the market, to do that,

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,710
they must decide what
and how much to produce,

26
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,775
and which inputs to use in
their production process.

27
00:01:09,775 --> 00:01:12,105
Government plays several roles.

28
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,210
While consumers and
firms are thought to

29
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,204
pursue their
individual interests,

30
00:01:16,204 --> 00:01:17,960
government provides a mechanism

31
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,850
for making collective decisions.

32
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,250
Its most basic role is making and

33
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,504
enforcing the rules under
which the economy operates.

34
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,890
Defining and defending
property rights is

35
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,515
probably the most
essential of these rules.

36
00:01:30,515 --> 00:01:32,940
Without clearly defined
property rights,

37
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,500
it's likely the economic system
would devolve into chaos.

38
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,900
Government also may
act to redistribute

39
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,500
income if economic outcomes
are deemed to be too unequal.

40
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,750
Finally, governments
may intervene

41
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,534
to change market outcomes.

42
00:01:46,534 --> 00:01:49,805
Those interventions can
include taxes, subsidies,

43
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:53,330
and regulatory requirements
on firms or consumers.

44
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,070
For example, cigarettes are

45
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,690
both heavily taxed and heavily

46
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,640
regulated via limits on

47
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,295
advertising and
in-labeled warnings,

48
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:02,840
and prohibitions on sales to

49
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,465
minors or where people can smoke.

50
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:08,510
Economists assume that
a consumer's objective

51
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,355
is to maximize their utility,

52
00:02:10,355 --> 00:02:12,350
which means that we
expect them to pick

53
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,790
the most desirable set of

54
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,875
goods and services
available to them.

55
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,020
To do that, the
consumers are assumed

56
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,255
to have a stable
set of preferences,

57
00:02:20,255 --> 00:02:22,010
which allow them to rationally

58
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,025
evaluate the desirability
of alternatives.

59
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:27,380
Those preferences are
subjective and can

60
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,045
certainly vary dramatically
across people.

61
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:33,230
Rational in this sense just
means that a consumer has

62
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,650
preferences and can use them
to evaluate alternatives.

63
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,360
It doesn't mean
that somebody else

64
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,159
will agree with their decisions.

65
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,020
Scarcity is reflected by

66
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,910
the consumer's budget constraint.

67
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,820
Income and prices determine
which bundles of goods and

68
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,930
services are actually

69
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,540
affordable and hence
feasible choices.

70
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,335
For most goods and services,

71
00:02:54,335 --> 00:02:56,090
we expect preferences to exhibit

72
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,985
a property called diminishing
marginal utility,

73
00:02:58,985 --> 00:03:01,990
I like to call that the
ice cream cone effect.

74
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,245
Imagine it's a hot summer day,

75
00:03:04,245 --> 00:03:06,050
how much happier
would you be with

76
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,155
a single scoop cone then if
you had no ice cream at all?

77
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,910
Probably a lot.

78
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,150
Would you get as much additional
or marginal happiness

79
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,735
from a second scoop as
you got from the first?

80
00:03:16,735 --> 00:03:20,130
Probably not. What
about a third scoop?

81
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,850
In other words, the value
of an additional unit of

82
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,440
a good declines as you get
more units of that good.

83
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,330
This implies that a consumer's
willingness to trade

84
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,945
one good for another depends
on the initial mix of goods.

85
00:03:32,945 --> 00:03:34,955
If I have gallons of ice cream,

86
00:03:34,955 --> 00:03:36,545
but very little pizza,

87
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:38,330
I would willingly trade a lot of

88
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,835
ice cream for only a
slice or two of pizza.

89
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:43,220
Conversely, if I had
several large pizzas

90
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,675
and very little ice cream,

91
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:45,980
trading ice cream to get

92
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,460
even more pizza wouldn't
seem like such a good deal.

93
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,250
In this graph, we
use a tool called

94
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,300
an indifference curve to

95
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,060
characterize a
consumer's preferences.

96
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,250
Suppose this
consumer's starts with

97
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,725
a bundle of goods, x*, y*.

98
00:04:00,725 --> 00:04:02,270
The curve passing through

99
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,460
that bundle shows all
of the other bundles

100
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,000
the consumer likes exactly
as well as x*, y*.

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,530
In other words,
those bundles that

102
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,600
the consumer will
be indifferent too.

103
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Now if the consumer could
get the bundle x_1,

104
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,470
y_1 instead, they would
happily make that trade.

105
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,480
Think of indifference curves like

106
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,625
topographic lines on a map.

107
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,250
All points on the
same topographic line

108
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,995
represent places with
the same altitude.

109
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:31,160
A higher topographic line
represents places with

110
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,595
a higher altitude than those
on a lower topographic line.

111
00:04:34,595 --> 00:04:37,040
Similarly, a higher
indifference curve

112
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,240
represents bundles that are

113
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,560
just as desirable as

114
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,930
every other bundle on the
same indifference curve,

115
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,550
but are more desirable than

116
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,950
any bundle that lies on a
lower indifference curve.

117
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,505
Based on the last graph,

118
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:52,430
we expect the consumer to
want to keep moving to

119
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,460
the Northeast to more and
more desirable bundles.

120
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,730
Unfortunately, this is
where scarcity comes in.

121
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,415
The consumer faces a
budget constraint.

122
00:05:01,415 --> 00:05:03,650
Their income and
the prices of goods

123
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,740
determine which bundles they
can actually afford to buy.

124
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,340
Any bundle beyond the budget
constraint is unaffordable.

125
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,410
If a consumer's income rises,

126
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,640
their budget constraint would

127
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,290
move further from the origin,

128
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,975
allowing more bundles
to become affordable.

129
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:19,775
If a price changes,

130
00:05:19,775 --> 00:05:22,580
that will shift the slope
of the budget constraint as

131
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,640
the slope reflects the
relative prices of the goods.

132
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,310
Therefore the rate at which
the consumer can trade

133
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,615
units of one good for the
other in their shopping cart.

134
00:05:31,615 --> 00:05:34,080
Now we can put it all together.

135
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,169
The consumer's utility maximizing

136
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,270
bundle is the one
marked by the dot,

137
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,620
where an indifference curve is

138
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,480
tangent to the budget constraint,

139
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,010
yielding utility or
happiness level of U_2.

140
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,850
Why is this the best
the consumer can do?

141
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,540
Any bundle on a higher
indifference curve,

142
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,800
like the one representing

143
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,025
the higher utility level
of U_3 is unaffordable.

144
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:57,620
Conversely, the consumer
doesn't have to settle

145
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,080
for a bundle on a lower
indifference curve like the one

146
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,390
representing the lower
utility level of

147
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,430
U_1 because a bundle with

148
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,420
utility level of
U_2 is affordable.

149
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,740
Let's try to
understand the utility

150
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,815
maximizing choice
a little better.

151
00:06:11,815 --> 00:06:14,760
Using calculus, which
I promise we won't,

152
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,580
the slope of the
indifference curve can

153
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,350
be shown to equal the ratio of

154
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,760
the marginal utility of

155
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,490
good X to the marginal
utility of good Y.

156
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,260
This ratio tells us

157
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,635
the consumer's willingness
to trade good X for good Y.

158
00:06:27,635 --> 00:06:29,600
It tells us the relative value

159
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,940
of those two goods at the margin.

160
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,995
As we saw two slides ago,

161
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:35,840
the slope of the budget
constraint equals

162
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,765
the ratio of the price of good
X to the price of good Y,

163
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,000
which reflects the
consumer's ability to

164
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,835
trade good X for good Y
in their shopping cart.

165
00:06:43,835 --> 00:06:47,800
This shows us the relative
costliness of the two goods.

166
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,500
To summarize, the best
affordable bundle is at

167
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,285
the tangency of an
indifference curve

168
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:55,115
and a budget constraint.

169
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,840
What that means is that the

170
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,550
consumer's willingness to trade X

171
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,200
for Y equals their ability

172
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,075
to make that trade at the store.

173
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:05,120
That is, there's no way the
consumer could rearrange

174
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,899
their consumption that is both
preferable and affordable.

175
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,710
What are the key implications of

176
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,025
our characterization of
utility maximizing decisions?

177
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:20,165
First, we see the consumers
make decisions at the margin.

178
00:07:20,165 --> 00:07:22,280
What matters is how
much utility is

179
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,100
generated by the last
unit of each good.

180
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,320
I might like ice cream a lot more

181
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,240
than pizza in some
absolute sense,

182
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,820
but if I've already eaten
a lot of ice cream,

183
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,350
a slice of pizza might be more

184
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,200
valuable to me than another
scoop of ice cream.

185
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,660
Second, this will explain how

186
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,735
consumers respond to changes
in their incentives.

187
00:07:41,735 --> 00:07:43,910
If income or prices change,

188
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,110
the budget constraint would

189
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,940
change and the
consumer would change

190
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,945
consumption of X and Y to
return to a point of tangency,

191
00:07:50,945 --> 00:07:54,590
that is, they would find a new
utility maximizing bundle.

192
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,540
In the case of a price change,

193
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,340
consumers will
substitute away from

194
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,965
whichever good became
relatively more expensive.

195
00:08:00,965 --> 00:08:02,885
In the case of an income change,

196
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:05,180
the consumer may change
both how much they're

197
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,985
buying and the
ideal mix of goods.

198
00:08:07,985 --> 00:08:09,470
Remember, when you graduated from

199
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,300
college and got a full-time job,

200
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,760
you might have responded to
that change in income by

201
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,075
buying more shrimp and
less ramen noodles.

202
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:19,550
This characterization of utility

203
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,075
maximizing choices also
underlies the demand curve,

204
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:24,860
which is the key analytical tool

205
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,960
for the consumer
side of the market.

206
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,750
In fact, the demand curve
directly reflects how

207
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,170
utility maximizing choices
change as incentives change.

208
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,700
Finally, the demand curves of

209
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,550
individuals can be summed
into a market demand curve

210
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,010
reflecting the aggregated
behavior of a group

211
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,220
of people with varying
incomes and preferences.

212
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,560
Because the demand
curve is based on

213
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,094
consumer's utility
maximizing decisions,

214
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,430
the demand curve reflects

215
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,080
the value consumers assigned

216
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,240
to each additional
unit of the good.

217
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,055
Economists call that value
the units marginal benefit.

218
00:08:57,055 --> 00:08:59,120
We would predict that
a consumer would

219
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,770
willingly buy any unit

220
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,150
for which the marginal benefit

221
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,340
exceeds the price they
would have to pay,

222
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,520
which would be Q*
units in this graph.

223
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,680
The area of the gold triangle

224
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,690
labeled net value to consumer,

225
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,230
is the sum of the consumers
marginal benefit from the Q*

226
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,300
units they purchase minus

227
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,430
what they actually had
to pay to get them.

228
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,260
You can think of
what they paid as

229
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,880
the opportunity cost of each unit

230
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,615
purchased in terms of less
stability to buy other goods.

231
00:09:26,615 --> 00:09:29,255
Economists also call
that gold triangle,

232
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:31,789
the area of consumer surplus.

233
00:09:31,789 --> 00:09:33,920
To summarize, consumers are

234
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,915
assumed to pursue
their self-interest,

235
00:09:35,915 --> 00:09:37,970
selecting their preferred
bundle of goods and

236
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,240
services from the feasible
or affordable choices.

237
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,250
This process involves balancing

238
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,450
how much they value getting

239
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,085
another unit of each product

240
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,110
against the prices
of each product.

241
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,110
These choices can be
summarized in demand curve.

242
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,670
In another video, we'll

243
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,440
explore the supply
side of the market.
