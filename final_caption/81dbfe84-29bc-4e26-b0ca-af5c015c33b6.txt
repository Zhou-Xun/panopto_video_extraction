1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,390
I feel like, you know, I'm so okay.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:15,930
I'll try to be actually in our paper again as well as like when I'm getting results and I have a better sense of what I know myself.

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:26,640
So if you take me to see compulsively study, I want you to go through that for everyone.

4
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,080
How's everybody doing? How are your brain? Very good. Oh, good, good.

5
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:38,640
I think I heard a little bit of good people. Let anyone have a good story for a break.

6
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,980
But they did. I heard a lot of visiting from some.

7
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:54,340
Family question. They like to sit around and talk about working and living.

8
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:03,790
And we are we ready to be to the conclusion of the term the problem?

9
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:11,600
Yes. No. No. Okay. All right.

10
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,140
I posted your grades for assignment two.

11
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:22,070
You should see those up on canvas. I also posted grades for the rest of what you submitted.

12
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,570
I went back. This was some feedback that I got in the anonymous survey.

13
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,930
Just some request for a little bit additional feedback on stuff.

14
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,960
So I went back and added feedback to your case presentations, just areas that I thought you could kind of work on.

15
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:42,580
I did not change the grades, so the grades remain exactly as they were for those.

16
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:49,010
But I just went in and added it to the rubric with some points for your own future development of your work.

17
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,570
The assignment two submissions were very, very good.

18
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,410
I put in the rubric again the comments where you could kind of improve if you

19
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:04,370
needed areas where you were covering things and in the way that I was looking for.

20
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:12,290
In terms of Assignment three. I want to just kind of quickly recap Assignment three, because I know that's due and it's been many,

21
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:19,930
many dimensions ago and we were talking about it prior to us being here.

22
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,600
So I'm going to just quickly jump over to that.

23
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,320
So assignment three, as you recall.

24
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,480
Is asking you to develop out a strategic plan.

25
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:41,839
So it's a five year strategic plan. You're going to follow the format that I've laid out for you in the references.

26
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,780
Again, follow this convention. You're going to be doing this through a slideshow.

27
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,590
So 15 slides. I'm not going to go through this all in detail, do everything.

28
00:02:50,960 --> 00:03:00,120
I threw it a couple times. I just want to get a quick summary, tableside name of your organization this morning and then you continue on from there.

29
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,860
For the background side, mission, vision, values, financial analysis.

30
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,709
You'll have your strategic goals, remember?

31
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:17,940
So one slide summarizing all of them and then five slides each describing one of the goals here to describe five strategic goals.

32
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,800
And we talked about, if you recall, back in our last session that we were just discussing this,

33
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:27,380
the specificity that I'll be expecting in terms of those goals so that they are smart.

34
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:43,160
The way that I've described it here, in specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time oriented, and you can see them as they are and the data will.

35
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,940
So specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time oriented on the goals.

36
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:05,550
Um, and as you recall, we were talking about, you know, really being specific about how you frame each of them.

37
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,500
So the time components to them is going to be work responsible of how you're going to work through them.

38
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,570
The details are what are important here.

39
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:22,510
So what I'll be looking for in the grading here is, is that is that you're providing a detailed picture of how you're going to achieve what's here.

40
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,510
And this is a very common tool in management that we use for building out a strategic plan,

41
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,930
is to sort of dial in specifically on what it is we're looking to do.

42
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,540
If you're building out a slightly larger strategic plan, you would probably expand on these and kind of set, you know,

43
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:43,869
these are our approximate goals to sort of more discloses, you know, long term, medium term, short term, etc.

44
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:51,849
But we're not going to do a full strategic plan in that way. Rather, I want you to think about it as a higher level strategic plan summary,

45
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:59,020
but with the specificity of the of what's the most important part of a strategic plan which are identifying those goals.

46
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,370
And then finally, you'll have three slides about your evaluation plan.

47
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,590
As you may recall,

48
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:13,780
you're going to also post a video or audio recording of you delivering the presentation as if you were delivering it to the CEO and board.

49
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:20,469
I want you to think of yourselves as serving in this role as Chief Operating Officer,

50
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:27,340
and if you think you know about sort of that role that you've come in to the quarterly meeting or the monthly board meeting,

51
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:32,860
whatever, and then be CEO on the board, have now asked you to present sort of your your approach,

52
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,510
your strategic plan for moving forward questions on this assignment.

53
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,989
I know I've taken some over the last few weeks, so I don't want to put too much of our time on this.

54
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:53,740
But for this slide, like setting on this ship, a little bit like the Center for Financial Analysis, kind of to actually consider your goals.

55
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:00,250
It's a great question. I'd rather you stay within the sort of just so that's fair for everyone in terms of how we're doing it.

56
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,110
Just try to stay true to the guidelines that we have here. Thank you.

57
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:10,400
A good question. I have two questions for the you suggest a timeline.

58
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:19,540
Is that a timeline, including all of the goals for the five year plan and not a timeline for each individual?

59
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:25,980
So, right. So what I'm what I'm looking for is, you know, when these goals are going to be accomplished.

60
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:31,090
So we're looking across the five years, you know, what order is it in, but more specifically, year by year,

61
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:42,310
you know what I mean by this is and I would even suggest that you go more granularly than just 20, 24 and say, you know, Q2 or March or April.

62
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,950
Try to try to think it through. That's what I'll be looking for, is that kind of specificity.

63
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:59,500
Okay. And then when you say who in the organization will implement these goals, like, do you want an actual name of somebody?

64
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:09,100
Yes. Yes. So again, just like we did an assignment to ask you to specifically point to board members, look at the actual folks in the organization.

65
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,460
If you don't have a name for the person.

66
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:18,910
Mean I'm not sure that there's really a case where you wouldn't because you probably know of a position if there's a name attached.

67
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:24,370
But if for some reason you don't have a name and you have, you know, the name of their title, that's okay.

68
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:28,990
But you should really I'll be looking to see that it's specific in that way.

69
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:35,979
So please don't just sort of say the director of planning like that's not that's not an actual person in the organization.

70
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:41,560
So it's not I wouldn't really be very useful to the board of the CEO of the title that doesn't exist.

71
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,600
So know keep that in mind.

72
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:49,900
We're trying to simulate as close as we can to you delivering a strategic plan to the organization that you've been studying.

73
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,819
So it needs to reflect who's on their staff, and you all should be very comfortable with that at this point,

74
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,899
because I feel like you've gotten really clear about the organization structure

75
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,690
and sort of what works there and all that through assignment one and two.

76
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:07,510
So my hope is, is that in doing it this way, you won't be having to do a lot of background research,

77
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:14,910
rather focus in on those strategic goals and kind of build the rest around it based on what you've learned through the last two assignments.

78
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,610
Yes. I'm pretty sure we touched on this last time, but I just want to double check.

79
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:28,080
So it's okay if your organization has goals, establish strategic goals already on their website or something and but say they're not very specific,

80
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,530
like we can kind of flesh out those same goals and make them more specific or they need to be brand new so it's okay to build on those.

81
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:43,560
What I wouldn't like to see is just recapitulation of what they have with a little detail that is not really your sort of perspective.

82
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:50,190
So I want you to be thinking about what it can do. So if they might outline some strategic goals on their site, you can use those to inform it.

83
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:56,430
But I would expect that you're using your own knowledge to kind of assert what you think the organization should be doing going forward.

84
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,280
Some of these organizations that you all have been writing about,

85
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:09,200
they're very organized and so they've got very detailed plans that they've posted and shared.

86
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,200
Part of the trust building is the public accountability that we've talked about.

87
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:21,170
Well, I really, again, want to emphasize your opportunity here to engage with this specific skill,

88
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:27,110
which is to just sort of think of yourselves as being tasked with this with this responsibility.

89
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,110
So, you know, you've been asked to do this. They won't have anything for you.

90
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,300
They're going to be looking to you and saying what you got. Okay.

91
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:46,070
Your submissions have been excellent, so I don't expect that this should be anything different.

92
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:53,870
Um, everyone's really been doing a great job of really thinking about the problems and assessing and analyzing in the appropriate ways.

93
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:59,240
And hopefully a sideshow will be a little less cumbersome at the end of the term.

94
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:08,340
If I was the highest grade for assignment, the second was the highest grade for assignment.

95
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,510
Great question. I'll have to look. I know a few people got 100 on the first one.

96
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:24,430
Um, I look, I think it's maybe too specific, but is there a time limit for this?

97
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,830
No, it's not. That's a great question. In terms of your recording, yeah.

98
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:35,709
So we talked about this. Someone asked us a couple of weeks back, if you if you're doing it in two or 3 minutes,

99
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:42,930
you're probably not doing it much, much, much credit in terms of what you've worked on.

100
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:51,580
But if you're taking 40 minutes, that's probably kind of long. So I would say, let's say on average, 10 to 15 is where it sort of falls.

101
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,030
You don't want to be losing your audience. So think about it.

102
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:02,209
If if the board members are on vacation or they're in some other place remotely

103
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,610
and they weren't able to come to the meeting and they watched a recording,

104
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:11,930
you know, could they get to the gist of what you were saying without sort of tuning out 20 minutes and you're on Slide three?

105
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,120
So to that point, to David's point, I'll give you one quick tip.

106
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,170
As a class, this part is not where I would spend a lot of time.

107
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:26,389
Like this is probably quickly get through this. If you're on, think about who your audience is.

108
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,390
If you're the CEO or the board, you already know this.

109
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,110
You already know this. You probably have heard somewhat about this,

110
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:39,890
although I would I would emphasize that you take time on it because they may not realize contextually why you're suggesting certain things.

111
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,790
So I would imagine that your story might be predicated on this financial analysis.

112
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,220
But this is where the meat of your of your of your delivery should be is is here.

113
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:58,130
And in the evaluation plan includes other questions.

114
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:05,400
How you feeling about this? These involved?

115
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:14,650
All right. That is, do I believe December 13th at midnight?

116
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,240
Okay. We will not meet that week.

117
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:25,090
Your next is our last class, so hopefully that'll give you a little bit of extra time to work through it.

118
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,830
All right. Okay.

119
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,900
That is that. Jump back to our slides here.

120
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,220
I'm going to turn over current events today for Katie and Honey to lead us.

121
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,910
I'm going to ask that we tried to just we have an activity that's built into today's class.

122
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,380
So if you can in your presentations, just seven people here.

123
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,090
Now, if you could just kind of skip to the to the timeframe we've been keeping to that be fantastic,

124
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:59,920
and then we'll have our discussion and then we'll jump to the activity.

125
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:06,250
All right. Whoever wants to go first up a little. I love.

126
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,230
It's crazy. You can do it.

127
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:38,230
Just own. Hi.

128
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,410
Oh, good evening, everyone. Thank you so much for agreeing to listen to me.

129
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:51,340
So today we will be talking about the economic crisis that struck me for this year.

130
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,710
So we like the background of what led to it and what does the current situation with them.

131
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:01,810
So just to start introduction.

132
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:10,480
Sri Lanka is officially known as the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka is an island country in South Asia.

133
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:17,889
It was first colonized by the Portuguese in 15 zero five being the Dijon, then the British, and finally they gained independence.

134
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,370
In 1948, Lipton was founded in Sri Lanka.

135
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,260
It has a literacy rate of around 92%, which is the highest in South Asia.

136
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:35,230
The word serendipity is derived from said India. That's the old name for Sri Lanka, which was given by Arabs and Persians.

137
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:43,420
And currently the economy is expected to contract by nearly 9% and inflation has reached 60%.

138
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:54,570
Giving no background. So in 1991, did Sanctuary City then became a plantation or economy famous for its production and export of sentiment.

139
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,440
Salinity. The mean economic sectors like tourism.

140
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,790
The export clothing. Rice production. The poor.

141
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,690
Capital income. The thousand 5 to 2011.

142
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:14,379
And during the same period the poverty also dropped US economy and in 2016 it was ranked fifth in the gold giving index,

143
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:19,140
suggesting high levels of contentment and charitable behavior in this society.

144
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,940
So now let me go to the current situation.

145
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:30,070
You will see these three graphs which shows on the top that Buddhism, which is one of the major sources of revenue, has dropped drastically.

146
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:37,900
Both the economic pace of economic growth has also dropped, and now slightly it has risen and inflation has risen drastically.

147
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,920
So the current situation, I just hope this.

148
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:51,120
Sri Lanka's economic crisis is unique and island's history has been marked by high inflation and severe fuel and energy shortages.

149
00:15:52,120 --> 00:16:00,960
The economic growth has been hampered by high foreign debt, dwindling foreign currency, the currency, the speciation, and mostly because of lockdowns.

150
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:04,530
And aside from the effect of the COVID 19 pandemic,

151
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:11,969
the crisis was caused by mismanagement of government finances and tax reductions in the Treasury due

152
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:18,960
2024 and for the first time since independence on its debt of $50 billion in need declared bankruptcy.

153
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:25,860
So before we go in to the family that was responsible for this crisis,

154
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:34,530
misunderstand the debate about the down mean both in the era jukebox was there involved in the politics of 1950s and sixties,

155
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:38,970
but he never had any prime minister or president position. But he was a prominent figure.

156
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:43,170
And then his three sons came into the picture.

157
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,680
The elder son, though, got those and cold one.

158
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:51,570
So. Yeah. So what exactly did they do?

159
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:57,870
So the elder son was selected of elected president in 2005 and under his leadership.

160
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:04,649
So around 2000 when there was a civil war going on in Sri Lanka between the majority population,

161
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:11,820
which is this in Chinese and the minority Tamil population who were demanding a separate state and that civil war was very intense.

162
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:19,950
Under his regime, Mahinda was able to bring that under control and stop that though all civil war.

163
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:25,259
And that's the reason people look at him as a hero. And that one thing was that he banged upon it a lot.

164
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:30,100
And he's the one who can save the country from the crises that went on.

165
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:35,210
And so and during that time, his younger brother was the defense minister.

166
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:47,640
The Civil War ended in 2009. They all know the I mean, as leaders continued in 2015 and 2015, they unexpectedly lost in that election.

167
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:55,739
Then what happened was in 2019, during the of rule, the other party, not the main party,

168
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,510
there was like Easter bombing that happened in 2019 by the ISIS militant group.

169
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:08,040
50 people died. So this all in this incident affected the tourism of the country drastically.

170
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:13,109
And again, the region finally was able to, you know, portray themselves as savior of the country.

171
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,790
That, look, when we were not involved with this incident and had we been involved with this wouldn't have happened.

172
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,440
And all this had them come back to power in 2019.

173
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:32,930
And after the game Back to Poverty 2019, the audience gathered to be the president, then another brother to be the litigation minister.

174
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:39,960
Finance minister basically became like a family business and publicly thought they take this nepotism seriously.

175
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:45,030
They were not employed on the basis of their qualifications because of the family they were appointed.

176
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,979
And like you can see, at one point,

177
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:56,240
there were more than 40 members of that family who held top government positions and the from the dominant royal family and the parties.

178
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:02,590
And the last point was that the largest of the projects were intended to profit the and down the, you know,

179
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:08,430
supporters and their family and which is often cited as a major cause for Sri Lanka's bankruptcy.

180
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,640
So this is the bottom line of protests or any prison the emergency was declared

181
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,759
is the time for the elder brother was made to resign the prime minister.

182
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,710
Then the president's house was like, you know, all the protesters went inside the house and burned the house.

183
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:30,270
Nothing happened to the president. He fled to Maldives after moving towards here.

184
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,420
He immediate his resignation and then he fled to Singapore.

185
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,000
So. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

186
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:42,919
Next slide. So basically, what were the policy is they did swing the 2019 election.

187
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,940
They said that if we come to power, apart from that, we can save the country.

188
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:54,319
They said that we will reduce taxes. So as soon as they came to power or they reduce their taxes, not because they reduced the taxes,

189
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,070
the government, the money that the government was collecting,

190
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:05,520
they did so to convert this time to printing money, despite IMF warning to them that, you know, this is not the right way.

191
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:12,479
I mean, if you start printing more money and start circulating in the economy, the value automatically goes down and inflation increases.

192
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,670
So that is what happened. This was one those that reason was the.

193
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:24,019
What this government did was they had this aspirational goal of becoming like an organic farming country.

194
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:29,420
So they immediately banned all the inorganic pesticides and chemicals without any backup plan.

195
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:37,580
The farmers of the country did not have that purchasing power to purchase the organic and the goods, and that led to a lot of protest.

196
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:41,659
The government eventually ripped through the policy, but it was too late.

197
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:48,350
By then the harm had been done. The crops had been not up to the mark and the economy was dwindling.

198
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,720
Today they are still in debt, which was increasing continuously.

199
00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:01,599
Then no tourism. So the COVID 19 is owned by not the major sources of income for the country.

200
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:10,180
Is tourism poor with 19 pandemic affected by tourism drastically and also and it had started dwindling after the Easter bombings in 2019.

201
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:17,140
Then what happened was Russia, Ukraine, border. So the majority of what is them was coming from these two countries that I share with them.

202
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:21,190
So I got the message about you sort of materials from Sri Lanka.

203
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:27,070
So both of them drastically hampered the economy and corruption as we saw them, family politics.

204
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:33,970
So this was the thing. So this is like a brief time line with all the main civil war that ended 2000.

205
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:39,280
I think the tax cuts were introduced, then the pandemic hit bottom of and organic fertilizers.

206
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:46,690
Protest began. Then the everybody who resigned at the IMF then arrived to offer their support.

207
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,970
So what about the impact?

208
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:58,150
Everything poverty, fuel, insufficiencies, inflation, dwindling education of medical sector was impacted, exports and diplomatic relations.

209
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:04,930
So these are few quotations. So Sri Lanka has universal health insurance, so it is covered by government.

210
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,709
So that is one of my station was saying that to the heart patient.

211
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,880
She has to make medicine everyday. Only the hospitals would issue medicine.

212
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,130
But because of this crisis, she has to buy from pharmacy now, which does not have money for that.

213
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:22,810
So she is like taking medicine only one after time.

214
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,659
This is another photo which was bedecked on a biscuit.

215
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:31,870
And this is not only mean the post it was having for the entirety that so because the inflation had

216
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:37,180
risen significantly and the materials would less the government governments are controlling everything.

217
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:44,739
So people like to buy like you know, everything was getting ration because there was not much available to them.

218
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,309
Significantly, the country also ran out of printing paper,

219
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:53,230
which is why government canceled exams of millions of school students and that all regulation

220
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,580
was in fact in the last for the was to the country that was completely out of fuel.

221
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:06,879
It was when people standing in queue at the fuel station despite reports that they have run out of food in extreme weather just standing,

222
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,230
that if some if they get the supply they would be the first to get on standing.

223
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:20,480
And you would accuse. So the notion is like on 4th September 2022, I have like reached a preliminary agreement to provide $2 billion,

224
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:29,350
$2.9 billion over four years to help recover from its worst economic crisis and help restore financial

225
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:35,510
and macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability as well as underpin the country's growth potential.

226
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:43,610
Sri Lanka receives $600 million from World Bank in the US and provided support for locating.

227
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:50,600
So there's a lot of lagging juice currently working in Sri Lanka, including you win some of them.

228
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:57,560
But this is one region found interesting because they were covering like all the regions and various domains.

229
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,710
So what they say they want,

230
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:09,350
do they believe in creating awareness about less fortunate than empowering the people who then with dignity it's so 50103 job feeding and clothing,

231
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:16,090
the homeless, being the underprivileged, the marginalized, the disabled and the elderly in providing disaster relief worldwide.

232
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,480
This is based in California.

233
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:26,570
So I think they sold their media things they did for us towards the pope in a good style, which they this was invented and manufactured.

234
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:31,910
Interesting. And it's funny because I didn't for low income families living in flats and we

235
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:38,600
do not have gas so they distribute them this way defined limits on this in some

236
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,310
regions then another thing that they were running a soup kitchen though that's the

237
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:48,830
point was that they were like feeding or once a month orphans and poor people.

238
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:56,690
Then another thing they did was with Children's Nutrition Breakfast Program, and they were feeding this for children like every day.

239
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:03,680
And because they think that this might be like their only meal for the entire day that they would be getting.

240
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:10,660
And lastly, the essential household items and hygiene, which they distributed in some regions,

241
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:16,950
all from Sri Lanka, but they are also like having financial constraints on their website.

242
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:23,540
So it seems that we need to donate them things like organizations so that they can help the country.

243
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,450
Oh, finally, I like my questions.

244
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:34,520
I like, you know, given that no inflation goal despite experiencing and every country struggling to take care of its own people.

245
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:39,319
And so how can the international organizations in other countries prioritize,

246
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:46,190
streamline the aid they give to other countries, given that there are so many things going on in various parts of the world?

247
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:55,710
And so I think that then sends out something. I know I always add.

248
00:25:55,710 --> 00:26:00,450
So I wanted to add one. One question to your question is excellent, another excellent presentation.

249
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:03,990
Thank you for getting us through all the different details. It's very helpful.

250
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:09,299
One other component maybe to add to your question here, maybe you're getting it.

251
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:15,270
This is this is this question related to also and we talked about this a bit last few times,

252
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:24,780
is is how much can one organization expect to do given that the problems are affecting all the organizations?

253
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:31,360
Yeah, I mean, like like how we saw that in the U.S., India, everybody provided support to Sri Lanka,

254
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,540
but they also provided support to say during the Ukraine, during the sense of what is going on.

255
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,860
So there are so many things happening. Right. And inflation is rising in those countries.

256
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:58,050
So how do they do this? Is it too simple to say that each one should choose their task and then go forward?

257
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,260
I know that seems like the best. Like divide and conquer.

258
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:08,160
As a parent, I know it would be hard with multiple stakeholders in the communication and interaction.

259
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:11,909
Organizations in general just have so much issue in coordinating.

260
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:21,750
But. But do we think?

261
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:32,110
It's hard. Usually by the time.

262
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,480
It's. They're really big problems then. I don't know if there's an obvious solution.

263
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:45,770
I would have come up with the five out of. Yeah, I think we're saying these are problems everyone's experiencing.

264
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:51,160
So it's really hard to kind of triage the needs of the country as those competing politics are.

265
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,920
You know, it's kind of a struggle sometimes to give international aid when your own country is struggling.

266
00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:01,249
That doesn't always go over well politically. So that's kind of another consideration.

267
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:08,510
And you still have competing factions. Just to add on to like Mark's point, like I don't know how many organizations are coming to like Sri Lanka,

268
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:13,460
but are they less likely to come to aid because of this like partially the fault of corrupt government?

269
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:19,040
Like, you know, when it's like a natural disaster, like everyone keeps running towards it because,

270
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,829
you know, there's not one there wasn't someone at fault.

271
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:26,780
And so I'm just wondering, you know, like, would they view it as not their responsibility to provide any aid?

272
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:30,290
Because, you know, it's kind of like the government's fault.

273
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,700
How that affects even more people.

274
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:41,010
What they were seeing was like the government government's fault, but like the poor people have to pay.

275
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,470
The prices will rise, but nothing to do with it.

276
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:52,680
So when IMF and World Bank did give like these loans, they make sure that those countries, you know, implement certain policy changes in place.

277
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:57,579
Or do they have to agree to that so that they get the loan?

278
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:02,020
But yeah, like the poor people, the other ones who suffer, like the families and residents fled.

279
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:14,470
So you pose a very interesting question, honey. And I and I and I'm hearing kind of signals of this as we're talking it over the last month or so.

280
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:26,109
So I just frame it for all of you as a question. Um. It seems as though we keep coming back to this idea that the strength, the macro structure.

281
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,969
So we're of course, not organizations, right?

282
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:36,340
So the macro structure of our fiber 1c3 is that we keep coming back to is very much oriented around a narrow mission.

283
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:41,410
Right. We've talked about that. The mission needs to be broad enough, but it also you need to have a specific offering, etc.

284
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:47,410
But that much of this is really, you know, focused on each organization kind of doing its own piece.

285
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:57,510
So up until we've had a more global challenge like we've just experienced in the last two years, an organization that maybe serves one country.

286
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:03,430
If there's a perception that there's stability in other parts of the world, then that organization maybe can say,

287
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:07,659
you know, hey, give it to us right now and, you know, defer on other crises.

288
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:18,790
Now, whether or not that's meritorious, meaning that those other crises 25, 30 years ago were not worthy of of of support as separate.

289
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:27,580
But but the culture seems to be that, you know, one organization or one group of organizations say this is the, quote, crisis of the moment give here.

290
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,880
And, you know, we'll focus our efforts on solving that.

291
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:36,280
So some of you've talked about natural disaster response and, you know, other isolated incidents.

292
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:42,970
But how do you what you've gotten at here and I think some of you've talked about it's really almost a challenge to the macro structure,

293
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:50,560
which is, is it even sustainable to have organizations focusing on one thing when it's all interconnected?

294
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,320
You know, if inflation is affecting everybody?

295
00:30:53,590 --> 00:31:01,210
And how can one organization address inflation in Sri Lanka if it's affecting all the other countries and there's a war in Ukraine and,

296
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:04,310
you know, all kinds of things that are kind of going on.

297
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:09,010
And I, I wonder what your thoughts are and kind of what we've seen emerge out of the pandemic,

298
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:14,320
because in a way, it's in terms of thinking back sort of into sort of moments in history,

299
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:19,569
I can't think of another sort of milestone or maybe you all have one that you ever might have been curious,

300
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:23,980
but another milestone where it was truly affecting everybody.

301
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:29,920
I think like few weeks ago, even Greece was in a similar situation in that I mean, these are immense.

302
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:40,030
I mean, you you like it because it was part of the you like build it up place because even it defaulted on its own or something like that.

303
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,190
I remember in 2015 or something. Right, right, right. Right.

304
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:47,740
In Greece. Yes. Yes. But you were there to support the EU, was there.

305
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:52,360
That's right. And they weren't and they didn't they weren't experiencing some kind of an instability.

306
00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:02,070
So I guess I'm getting it. And you are. Honestly, I don't have a when I come with these questions, do I.

307
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:07,499
It's motivated what you're sharing because I think you all have helped us to really see a very interesting picture,

308
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:14,820
which is that the way that these organizations are organized right now across sectors doesn't really seem to be working.

309
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,600
I'm mercifully in. What are you supposed to do?

310
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,610
Go ahead. Yeah. Listen, I say,

311
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:26,310
I think part of the reason I feel like it doesn't seem to be working is because they're like taking on the role of what should be the government.

312
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:30,640
And these governments are just falling through the cracks early on to correct wrong.

313
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:35,520
But they're just like falling apart. And so, like, I mean, what happens when a government falls apart?

314
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,999
Like, is it the responsibility of a of nonprofits to carry that?

315
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,350
Or like, is there another structure that should be like similar to the European Union?

316
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:50,700
Is an interesting point. So we're looking at across countries and seeing that governments are not functioning in the way they were.

317
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:54,840
How much can the nonprofits hold up under that pressure,

318
00:32:55,170 --> 00:33:01,709
or were they always just there to just be kind of conduits to funnel dollars through to get services more locally directed,

319
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:06,210
but not really the ones who should be responsible for the larger policy issues.

320
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,880
Maybe the second question, I feel like it ties there, too.

321
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:25,770
So this is not like exactly I don't know if in U.S. it's common or not, but this typically happens.

322
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:30,630
I've seen this in England when same thing happened in Sri Lanka when the election season comes.

323
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,209
In order to get the votes, the problem is that if you come to power, we'll do this, we'll do that.

324
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:40,890
And that one of the reasons was that the government did the same thing that like will reduce taxes.

325
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:46,709
And how does that even the expense of you reduce taxes? Like where are you going to spend the money?

326
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:50,850
Where will you get to like will do something about like shooting.

327
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:59,309
They should be like some you would like work towards, you know, educating the consumer that if if a certain government is like promising something,

328
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:02,670
they need to have like a back up of how they are going to manage the expenses.

329
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:07,989
Just seeing that it was we cut taxes, I mean such and then you reduce taxes.

330
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:13,170
So the full. So like nothing is free. Like if you are getting it for free, somebody else is paying for it.

331
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,590
So no self-medication. I don't die of this. I don't that.

332
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,920
But I don't think that free is not good on these.

333
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:29,170
So like like and should there be any policies against these parties coming in promising like freebies during the election just to win the awards?

334
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:37,809
It reminds me of some of what we were talking about a couple of weeks ago, about can the NGO and the nonprofits,

335
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:44,380
the NGOs, can they help to sort of manage community attitudes before folks go to vote?

336
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,839
How much how much can they how much is it their responsibility to intervene?

337
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:59,510
Or is it more a step before, which is to help and help people understand that they're not having to intervene the root cause.

338
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,500
I feel like much of the admissions of the organizations that you are written about

339
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,829
and also that we've talked about in these presentations are all and in our cases,

340
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:13,640
for that matter, they're all intervening, intervening in something that's wrong.

341
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:18,530
But back to Ali's presentation about polio. That outbreak had already started in New York.

342
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:27,589
Where was the organization? So. March of Dimes, for example. Where were they in all those years where polio was supposedly eradicated?

343
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:35,010
But. It was starting to bubble up again. I after to call you about it?

344
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,600
She reminded me.

345
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:50,630
I feel like this like comes back to like your beliefs about individualism versus like communism, but like the idea of a community and solidarity.

346
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:56,360
And it also comes back to like, I think education is necessary, obviously,

347
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:00,620
but there's just like a lot of underlying beliefs that we would have to address here.

348
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,940
And I don't think. Like,

349
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:12,690
I don't think it's necessarily something that we can fix totally in policy because there's always going to be bad actors and we're not omniscient.

350
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:18,720
So like sometimes you just don't know something's going on and that's just kind of the state of the world, unfortunately so.

351
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:26,510
Yeah. The last the abbey?

352
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:33,240
No, I just think it's like kind of on a different note, but like just like certain policies and regulations that prevent like promises

353
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,270
of freebies within the health care market and the pharmaceutical industry.

354
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:43,020
So I think there should be probably some policies to do the same or regulate those promises within like the political views.

355
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:50,159
I think it's essentially the same. I mean, it's always the financial benefit that people get once they're in charge.

356
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,940
So I think there should be policies that prevents them from doing the right thing.

357
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,360
And it's just also going to add, I think, on the like,

358
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,049
I guess political landscape and like how safe I could be because I don't think like in would send

359
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:15,030
people or like invest that work into a country that has a more corrupt political system because their,

360
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:22,200
their program wouldn't really feel like there are some countries or at least votes that people vote don't even really matter.

361
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:28,500
And the person who's going to win has already won, just like that's like a no show thing.

362
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:36,030
Yeah. So, like, I don't know, I'm thinking of Haiti and how, like, Haiti's, um, elections are always, like, corrupt, and,

363
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:40,409
like, the person was running for a really long time and probably has promised those free means and things like that.

364
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:44,639
But like. The the vote of the people doesn't really have that much weight.

365
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,200
And then the NGO is sending people to Haiti to try to do that.

366
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:56,030
I mean, in the past, when America has done that, they've killed people who spoke up against that kind of stuff.

367
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,180
So I don't know. It depends on like how safe that would be to intervene mean.

368
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:16,410
Excellent presentation, Johnny. I. All right, Kerry, Germany.

369
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:34,340
I say? Yeah. Okay, everyone, it's a burger.

370
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:45,710
All right, so my current event for today is about the black history here in Ann Arbor and the housing market in Ann Arbor.

371
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:53,719
And that. Oh, and I do want to acknowledge before I begin that I have lived in Ann Arbor for a long time.

372
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:59,540
I'm a white female who lives in the area, so I'm not an expert on this topic.

373
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:07,940
But as a public health student and as Ann Arbor community member is a strong interest of mine to address health equity.

374
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:09,930
Okay.

375
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:25,250
So housing affordability in Ann Arbor in 2022, the area median incomes experienced the largest jump, which cause ramifications for affordable housing.

376
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:32,120
Instead of letting the free market drive up the growth in the market rate for housing for higher income households,

377
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:38,990
the city has aimed to take an active role in building affordable housing in downtown in Arbor,

378
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:46,940
and the city also has new affordable housing millage that can help make these projects possible by providing financing,

379
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:54,920
which would help leverage other funding sources such as low income tax credits and housing demand.

380
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:05,120
According to the 2020 Housing Needs Assessment, demand for up to 1400 affordable housing units in the downtown area for people with incomes up to

381
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:15,350
30% of the RMI and over 150 850 units for people with income up to 60% of the area median income.

382
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:22,870
And it's also important to note that. The top cause of homelessness is a lack of affordable housing.

383
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:29,020
And a lot of this has to do with structural racism, generational poverty and trauma.

384
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,080
And as we know, these things run much deeper than just in the housing market.

385
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:42,420
But as an attempt to break the cycle of homelessness, it's important to consider the whole system,

386
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:45,670
the whole nation, as well as the whole person and individual.

387
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,880
We can go back, actually. I forgot. I wanted to point this out.

388
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:57,129
If you look at the single person area, median income as of this year in Ann Arbor, it's over $82,000.

389
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:00,750
And, you know, we're all pursuing advanced degrees.

390
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:10,040
Some of us are graduating soon. I know I've been looking into jobs in public health policy and none of the starting salaries are over $80,000.

391
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:18,880
So just to put that into perspective about, you know, I think the university kind of skews the median income in this area.

392
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:31,510
So I think. All right. So moving into the black history, the black business district is was historically located in Kerry.

393
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:39,940
I'm not sure how many of you are from here or live in the downtown area, but students, Kerry Town is there's shopping,

394
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:44,800
there's restaurants, there's farmers markets, lots of activities going on in the area.

395
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:48,670
It's a pretty well-known spot in downtown Ann Arbor.

396
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:56,410
But 60 years ago, the majority of black people in that area owned their homes and their businesses.

397
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:02,860
And since then, almost all of the black history in that area had been erased.

398
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:08,880
In 2021, a mural was painted to honor Mayor Albert Wheeler.

399
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:12,730
There's also a park named after him and other historical black leaders.

400
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:20,950
And since I couldn't spend too much time on this for the sake of a short presentation, if you're interested,

401
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:29,079
the Ann Arbor District Library has a walking tour that dives into more details about the black history in downtown Ann Arbor.

402
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:37,930
And I encourage everybody to look at that. I also posted the link at the end of the presentation, and this is just one image that I pulled.

403
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:43,390
If you go to the next slide, this is just one of the buildings that.

404
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:51,550
Has a lot of black history. So this building is currently now known as Community High.

405
00:42:51,790 --> 00:43:00,340
And again, I don't know how many of you are from here, but from what I know about Community High, it's a very prestigious high school and.

406
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:11,530
Parents enter. So you get in based on a raffle and parents will enter their children to potentially get into the school like years in advance.

407
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:15,280
I didn't research a whole lot about the diversity in the school now.

408
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:21,640
I do know they have started to incorporate some of the history in the building more and more recent years.

409
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:26,970
But historically, this was Jones Elementary and it was a segregated school.

410
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:35,140
But community members who attended the school have very fond memories and want the foundation and the history to be shared and remembered.

411
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:41,860
And I just put a couple of quotes up there from a community member with generational ties to the area who attended the school.

412
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:53,790
And you can go to the next slide. So we've known for a long time that people of color are disproportionately impacted by homelessness.

413
00:43:53,790 --> 00:44:00,350
And this is a quote from the executive director of the nonprofit agency I'm about to get into.

414
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:07,770
But she says, In our community, we know that while only 12% of folks living in Washtenaw County identify as black or African-American,

415
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:13,830
61% of people accessing the homeless response sector identify as black.

416
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:20,260
So considering that's a small amount of our population,

417
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:28,780
that's a very large amount of people who identify as black or African-American who are needing help, homelessness assistance.

418
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,930
And that's from Aubrey Patino. So the nonprofit that I've.

419
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:44,390
Going to be discussing is Avalon Housing and they are a local nonprofit organization working to end homelessness and

420
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:51,830
they are developing affordable housing that is centered around community care and support and supportive housing.

421
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:57,530
They offer supportive housing services that center around the health and well-being

422
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:01,790
of every tenant and provide resources to help folks not only stay in their homes,

423
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:07,430
but thrive in their homes. And their philosophy is based on the Housing First approach.

424
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,390
This means that they consider housing a basic human right,

425
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:19,970
and any social needs or medical challenges come after getting somebody into safe, permanent housing.

426
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,989
And you can see here their mission is to build healthy, safe and inclusive,

427
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:28,970
supportive housing communities and along as a long term solution to end homelessness.

428
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:37,130
And I just listed some of their values, but on their website, they have a much more extensive explanation of their values.

429
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:47,930
So in addition to their mission and values, they have a pretty large section on their website dedicated to equity.

430
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:58,310
And I also used to work for this agency, so I know that this is one of their primary goals, is to weave in equity into everything they do.

431
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,450
And they also recognize housing equity as it relates to health.

432
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:08,150
They promote radical acceptance through a strong commitment to DTI and anti-racism.

433
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:12,170
I just pulled part of their equity strategy here.

434
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,730
If you want to read through that and then a quote from their website.

435
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:29,200
So the most current part of the current event is this housing proposal that has been made from Avalon Housing in the Ann Arbor Housing Commission.

436
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:37,839
They have proposed a mixed use six story affordable housing development that will replace a public parking lot at the corner of Katherine Street

437
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:48,430
and Fourth Avenue to honor the black history in the area and create a sense of community while addressing the economic disparities within housing.

438
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:56,800
Avalon will submit this project plan sometime this month and it will go before the city's planning commission in the end of January.

439
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:00,970
And then just some more details about this actual development.

440
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:14,080
The ground floor would include a community area, a fitness center, potentially small basement business spaces for bipoc ownership, entrepreneurship.

441
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:19,600
And then they want to incorporate art and design to help honor the black history in the community.

442
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:24,040
There will be a total of 66 apartments, nine efficiency units,

443
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:30,729
55 one bedroom units and two two bedroom units for people earning up to 60% of the area.

444
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:36,129
Median income and half of the units will be for people who need supportive housing services.

445
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:43,540
This includes people exiting homelessness. And half of the units they are proposing to be for artists.

446
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:49,990
However, this the artist preference side is not fully finalized,

447
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:57,670
but they are thinking it would benefit the community to house artists who are also being displaced due to housing affordability.

448
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:08,260
Four in a for in affordability. Really, it will be an all electric building with rooftop solar panels and electric vehicle charging stations.

449
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:12,730
This is also in line with the city's carbon neutral carbon neutrality goals.

450
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:18,520
And so the next steps for this program will be to seek funding throughout 2023.

451
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:25,300
Construction will begin in 2024 and the project will potentially be done in 2025.

452
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:31,630
And this is a quote from Johnson. She's a DEA consultant who works closely with Avalon.

453
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:35,979
She was hired to help facilitate this project and continue the ongoing

454
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:39,610
conversation with community members who have intergenerational ties to the area.

455
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:45,220
She says this work is not going to repair centuries of economic violence, but it is a step.

456
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:56,660
And my discussion questions What are some of the financial resources Avalon could pursue in 2023 to help fund this project?

457
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:00,920
What are the barriers to these funding sources and how can they be overcome?

458
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:09,340
Hello. I wonder if there's, like, grand.

459
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:17,040
I'm sure there are, like, probably like grants for I know even just specifically like homelessness, but for people of color.

460
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:27,180
And so I think, yeah, if they go for sources like if it's grants or foundations that are a lot more specific rather than like super general,

461
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,580
because like a lot more people will be applying for like, let's say.

462
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:36,180
Affordable housing, but like if you're going for like affordable housing for people of color, people of displaced,

463
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:42,120
or of people like in areas with a lot of like black history or something like that,

464
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,450
I think that would be a good approach, which I'm sure they're doing.

465
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:55,770
But yeah, and like I mentioned earlier, the city has millage funding, which is like through property taxes, but so that money can go toward this.

466
00:49:55,770 --> 00:50:01,350
But then some of the other resources I thought of were low income tax,

467
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:13,770
housing tax credits that can like subsidize the construction and they help with affordable rental housing for low and moderate income tenants.

468
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:21,450
And then Avalon had has a lot of dedicated donors grants, like you said.

469
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:26,879
HANNON But yeah, I was just curious based on I know you all aren't familiar with this specific agency,

470
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,880
but based on the work you've done with your nonprofit,

471
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:37,680
were there any other funding sources that you found to be intriguing or maybe something that's underutilized?

472
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:48,680
But we can go on to the second question. The second question.

473
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:56,479
Oh, okay. Which is not silly. They can probably reach out to like people of color who would like positions like maybe,

474
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,130
let's say athletes, because there's like some athletes who like really support like causes like.

475
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:07,580
Like you said, though, even the Black Lives Matter and all of that. So I think that could be like one of the approaches.

476
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,370
I was thinking about like the universe and the skin, like being involved.

477
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,740
I know like the other poverty solutions in the school.

478
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:24,560
Like they do a lot of stuff for partying with the community, partnering with policymakers to find ways to prevent, alleviate poverty.

479
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:25,990
So I'm like,

480
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:34,820
maybe that could be an initiative from the university to partner with that and get this awareness out because fundraising to raise that money.

481
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:43,100
Yeah, it's a good idea. And I was going to talk about the program because this is like exactly what it is

482
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:49,729
like tax credits for developers who are building like affordable rental units,

483
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:56,520
basically. But I also know that like, HUD has a ton of grants available for affordable housing.

484
00:51:56,550 --> 00:52:01,310
Um, I was just saying the same thing as the University of Michigan.

485
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:03,620
Like they should definitely use their resources,

486
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:09,439
even if it's like reaching out to a student organization or organization on campus that might not be student,

487
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,370
but like something that's run through the university, I definitely think that that's a great resource.

488
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:15,979
Like, I don't know how much money a student organization can get for that,

489
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:21,890
but it's still good to like bring awareness and have like really smart students help on the project.

490
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,680
I was going to ask, is everyone affiliated with like Avalon Bakery, the housing.

491
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:30,410
Oh, I just going to see what if they get them to like help?

492
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:33,890
Because I know there's one bakery like in Ann Arbor. Yeah.

493
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:38,390
Detroit. Yeah. Have good food or something.

494
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:46,970
Yeah. Maybe somebody something some center within the Southern College of Architecture, I think would be interesting to see.

495
00:52:47,810 --> 00:53:00,920
Yeah. Since it's kind of progressive with being like a fully electrical building using green technology are is questions.

496
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:05,809
So is this project approved by the city of Ann Arbor?

497
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:12,020
Is that so? It's going up for it will potentially be approved in January.

498
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:18,169
You know what the kind of ads that are ever going on, as far as I know,

499
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:24,980
all of their Avalon's projects have been approved and what was the last one they had approved?

500
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:28,610
So Hickory Way, it was one of their newest buildings.

501
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:33,530
It's actually two buildings. I think they're still working on the second one, but that one was approved a couple of years ago.

502
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:39,800
I will say, though, that the construction and politics behind everything often causes a lot of delays.

503
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:45,680
So by them projecting that this project will be done in 2025, it's like realistically it probably won't be.

504
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:54,200
So sometimes there's pushback, but usually the city of Ann Arbor is in favor with.

505
00:53:55,590 --> 00:54:05,540
Proving their properties. I was going to say that I'm in I'm going to close that comment about like how we are going to work on passing it.

506
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:12,220
And actually, last week, people from everywhere came together that that relationship already exists between you and everyone.

507
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,809
So I think it would be realistic to do your back. Yeah.

508
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:21,000
And I think that kind of goes into my second question. I think that's a relationship worth strengthening for sure.

509
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:29,099
I know it hasn't been the strongest relationship in the past, but so can you think of other ways nonprofit organizations can help to address

510
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:33,750
the housing affordability crisis through the through a health equity lens?

511
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:42,360
So this can be other organizations like to partner with or other organizations who are doing have similar initiatives.

512
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:52,200
Yeah. Like either other organizations to help with the housing crisis or other ways nonprofit organizations can contribute.

513
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:58,990
Hello? Yeah, I hope someone knows what I'm talking about. But there's this nonprofit.

514
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:05,500
It became a nonprofit in Detroit. It's basically this house that, like, for kids.

515
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:12,079
Jeez, I really I'm so I forgot the name, but essentially it's not like the kids don't live in there,

516
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:16,909
but just kind of like available for them to walk in if they want to like play, eat food or whatever.

517
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:20,150
And it's just like. Like open all day type of thing.

518
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:25,249
I'm really. I forgot the name. I don't know if anyone knows what I'm talking about. Sorry.

519
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:28,309
Really? Detroit? No. Like she originally started.

520
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:31,310
Like she'd even intended for it to become, like, as big as it did.

521
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:35,570
She, like, had, like, an extra house, but I mean, like, goes into that.

522
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:39,829
And then she saw that there was like a few affordable housing issues.

523
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:42,670
So then she just like opened up her house and like,

524
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:49,950
because I remember I started working with them before it became this big thing and we were just kind of like helping administer like fund events.

525
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:52,330
I forgot what it is. I'll look into it if I'm.

526
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:58,760
But I guess essentially what I was trying to say was that is like that could be a nice way because I know there's I mean.

527
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:04,120
There's going to be like limited units available because like it is such a big issue.

528
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:08,390
So maybe there's just something that's available like during the day.

529
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:11,990
I mean, all the people do need a place to sleep. Like, that's another problem.

530
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:17,440
But, like, there's, like, this safe place for kids to go or anyone to go if they just like.

531
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:26,770
Like heat, food, whatever it is to shower and stuff and then somehow get more money in, like, space available to make actual units.

532
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:34,030
Yeah. No, I think that's that's you bring up a good point. That was I don't know if you had a chance to read any of the other quotes I posted,

533
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:39,610
but one of the community members identified like what Community High used to be Jones Elementary,

534
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:45,520
the children who were although they were, you know, trying to eliminate segregation,

535
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:50,139
they dispersed the children through to other schools in Ann Arbor.

536
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:53,260
And it really disrupted that sense of community that those kids had.

537
00:56:53,650 --> 00:57:03,190
And so I think you bring up a good point, Hanon, by offering those services, because the community aspect of school housing jobs,

538
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:09,790
like it's just so important for people to be able to thrive and obtain the resources and connections that they need.

539
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:15,219
I found but it's called on teenagers village if anyone was interested but that's it's gotten really big

540
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:19,450
like I'm looking at what I'm saying right now they have like she's doing some stuff with Lois now.

541
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:23,049
There's like nurses that go in and out, provide like health services.

542
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:29,110
They always have like drop offs. Like it started off really small. Like she saw a need, opened up her house and then people started coming in.

543
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:30,429
Now it's like this big thing.

544
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:38,410
But yeah, I've heard of houses too that help kids or they'll, they'll be like computers or people to help with homework or,

545
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:42,610
you know, either like she does, like tutoring to like, get out of school.

546
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:49,310
AVI Okay. Wife two One is kind of like an anecdote.

547
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,150
What is an actual answer to your question?

548
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:58,809
So I'll say the answer first is like I think once these affordable housing units get built, taking like success stories from them and like, like,

549
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:04,450
I think a lot of times they get built and people don't really realize how much it's helped or what good it's done to the overall community has it?

550
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:07,930
And so just like the media component to that and sharing that story,

551
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:15,910
which leads into I was reading the newspaper yesterday and Avalon put a housing like housing project.

552
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,970
It's called Hilltop Apartments. And Dexter, I think we talked about this before.

553
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:23,979
Yeah, well, people it was a controversy at first because certain individuals didn't I thought I was gonna bring,

554
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:27,129
like, you know, crime and crime into the community.

555
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:31,960
And it's like Dexter's 90% white, and so there's, like, a racist element to it.

556
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:37,420
So they just published the story, though. That was like giving Banks and Dexter and it's a family of five.

557
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:44,409
Um, the main guy who's like, he wanted to tell his story and like basically say, you know, you guys have given me like, a new life.

558
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:48,340
He was formerly incarcerated, kind of like had difficulty finding housing because of that.

559
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:55,210
His three kids are like in the middle school. Yeah. Like family and just like it was a really sweet story and like, he was just.

560
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:58,870
But I think, like, you know, there's a lot of.

561
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:06,340
There was a lot of talk prior and having these stories published and publicized like this kind of helps break that down.

562
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:12,040
Yeah, there's a lot of power behind charity, like personal stories from people who are impacted by this.

563
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:16,780
Great to hear your question. I think like.

564
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:25,190
Federal assistance is really great, but I think it's a very short term solution and I don't think that it actually promotes equity that much.

565
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:31,990
And there are very few like nonprofit organizations or just programs in general that support low income homeownership.

566
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:41,150
And I think that that is a more equitable goal to move towards because obviously we all know, like home ownership has tons of implications for wealth.

567
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:49,840
So yeah, yeah, that's a good point. I don't know.

568
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:57,040
Did you bring it up or not? The only other thing I was going to add, I also put out here to answer the second question.

569
00:59:57,310 --> 01:00:01,450
Legal Aid is a nonprofit law firm that I know.

570
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:04,899
They're here in Michigan, South Central Legal Aid. I think they're all over the nation.

571
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:08,559
But Avalon has kind of worked with them in the past.

572
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:13,090
But maybe strengthening that relationship so that if they have any tenants who are

573
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:19,090
subject to predatory landlords or facing challenges or legal issues with their housing,

574
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,790
I think that's a good partnership. They can refer clients there.

575
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:30,840
And then another way nonprofits can help with this issue is advocating advocating for policy changes with HUD.

576
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:40,450
There are a lot of barriers to obtain housing subsidies from HUD as well as the housing commission, which is like a more local level, but.

577
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:53,360
And that's the site if you want uppermost ideology. But if you want to check out the actual tour, you can just click on that link.

578
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:05,570
I'm sorry. Closing thought is an important way to give some thought to our quick break here,

579
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:10,220
which is that many of these organizations have existed for a long time.

580
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:18,050
And what is the motivation for policy makers to now be interested in addressing?

581
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:23,860
The challenges that these organizations are looking to focus on versus others.

582
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:29,990
How do the organizations sort of position themselves to be ready for?

583
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:40,170
Resources to come if policymakers, governments, etc., say, okay, we're going to now make this a priority to work on X.

584
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:48,329
So I would just kind of leave you all with that thought that, you know, to connect the two to presentations a little bit,

585
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:51,989
which is, you know, looking across the landscape and saying, all right,

586
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:58,100
if there are 20 organizations that are all working in this area and the government may become interested at some point, you know,

587
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:05,670
what's our unique offering or what is it that we're doing that would make the those partners be interested in working with us?

588
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:13,350
Because Avalon has been in existence for a long time, but these types of priorities from municipal government have not.

589
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:19,920
So, you know, with that interest comes kind of the next iteration, so to speak,

590
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:25,890
of their planning, which is as an organization to say, okay, so now, now what's our next move?

591
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:31,860
I think we'll see it also in the legislative session over the next two years,

592
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:37,440
and especially in Michigan, with the change in the composition of the legislature, you know,

593
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,300
with the administration in the legislature saying that, you know,

594
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:49,290
they're interested in investing in certain areas who are going to be the key champions, then advocating for investments in what category.

595
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:55,320
So we can talk aspirationally about we should address priority one, two or three.

596
01:02:55,950 --> 01:03:03,450
But once there is actual funding available, once you know programs are starting to get established,

597
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:10,770
who has weight and who carries weight and how they get set up and who has access to the resources to get distributed.

598
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:16,590
So something to also just kind of keep in mind, excellent presentations we're going to take.

599
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:32,850
3 minutes. Exactly. 514. Give you I was going to ask, do you think like years ago I when it was hard.

600
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:41,501
Yeah, that's for sure. All right.

601
01:03:41,502 --> 01:03:47,002
People like are back. Okay, we're going to pick up.

602
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:57,952
Let's let's just talk with our case presentation and we will pick up with our activity and concluded at the after.

603
01:04:37,652 --> 01:04:42,992
I going to read now? It's been three years. Hi everyone.

604
01:04:43,002 --> 01:04:46,262
Thank you for being here for a presentation on First Services.

605
01:04:49,532 --> 01:04:53,612
Our case presentation is on the campaign. Be my new trainees, be on the floor.

606
01:04:54,422 --> 01:05:00,092
Before we get into that, our location is Elle Island.

607
01:05:00,752 --> 01:05:04,832
It's located in downtown Detroit. It's the biggest city owned island park in the country.

608
01:05:05,512 --> 01:05:11,282
I was like, you know, I was thinking about it was about like 982 to 987 acres.

609
01:05:11,762 --> 01:05:18,932
It's also home to a bunch of things, including a beach, a museum, a Great Lakes, maritime memorabilia,

610
01:05:18,932 --> 01:05:28,682
an aquarium, the island and a conservatory on the park also offers breathtaking views of Canada and also Detroit.

611
01:05:28,682 --> 01:05:33,992
To the south of the park is also the lighthouse that's in that picture.

612
01:05:34,082 --> 01:05:42,362
To the left is the only lighthouse structure in North America to be built for the George Marvel, which is a really random fact that we found.

613
01:05:43,232 --> 01:05:47,242
I think people have been to Belle Isle. Okay. What's your favorite part?

614
01:05:48,942 --> 01:05:56,562
It would have the same size slide, but lightness begins to slowly settle down to growing up.

615
01:05:57,192 --> 01:06:04,242
Having been on the giant side recently. Now recently. Not as like a teen in that segment as I thought they would.

616
01:06:05,172 --> 01:06:11,682
It's a bit of a challenge with the other parts the people enjoying on Belle Isle.

617
01:06:12,402 --> 01:06:16,472
So the first shot is fine. I mean, I took the first shot. Oh, okay.

618
01:06:16,692 --> 01:06:20,942
But what's your favorite part? I mean, I was just there. I didn't even see the lighthouse, though.

619
01:06:20,952 --> 01:06:22,952
I mean, I just went there, like, dumbfounded.

620
01:06:22,962 --> 01:06:27,092
I didn't even know what you were saying because it was just like things showed up and things to do in Detroit.

621
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:31,572
So it's a lot bigger than I expected.

622
01:06:31,962 --> 01:06:38,132
I didn't realize how big I was surrounding it in 2011.

623
01:06:38,232 --> 01:06:43,092
And really here was it happens that the state assumed responsibility for it.

624
01:06:44,442 --> 01:07:00,282
And this is a very big, very big policy debate about whether or not a city park or city owned park should be under the supervision of the state.

625
01:07:01,512 --> 01:07:07,782
So it's been interesting to see how things have been developed over the last few years.

626
01:07:08,172 --> 01:07:16,632
If you look at a pet ownership like 30 years, they're going to have 30 years, I think was like a degree right to be for it to return back.

627
01:07:17,022 --> 01:07:25,842
So there's all kinds of interesting history with some really good stuff about the aquarium, but I think it just stays shut all the time.

628
01:07:25,852 --> 01:07:29,322
It's closed. Yeah, it's closed. It used to be owned by the Detroit Zoo.

629
01:07:30,582 --> 01:07:34,092
I don't believe there are now anymore.

630
01:07:34,992 --> 01:07:43,442
Okay. Sorry. I was going to try to get into the timeline for the New Jersey Institute of Social Justice.

631
01:07:43,452 --> 01:07:49,392
It was established in 1999 by the Out of Amy Lowenstein Foundation to address

632
01:07:49,722 --> 01:07:53,562
criminal justice reform and other barriers in underserved urban communities.

633
01:07:54,222 --> 01:07:58,302
At that time, the unemployment rate for former prisoners was extremely high,

634
01:07:58,602 --> 01:08:04,122
and it's still pretty high, but it's well above any other country in the world.

635
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:12,432
And in particular, incarceration rate for African-Americans is five times higher than that of white people in America.

636
01:08:13,542 --> 01:08:24,192
Specifically, factors such as barriers to employment and racial discrimination and perspiration, which typically that leads to reentry mask entry.

637
01:08:24,912 --> 01:08:33,282
So the New Jersey Institute of Social Justice specifically is looking at state laws and employer hiring protocols,

638
01:08:33,912 --> 01:08:38,172
which made it increasingly difficult for people with criminal record to find work.

639
01:08:39,462 --> 01:08:45,882
And nationwide, at the time, there was an estimated about 27,000 state laws and regulations making it illegal for

640
01:08:45,882 --> 01:08:51,162
people with a criminal record to work in certain industries or obtain professional work.

641
01:08:51,192 --> 01:09:00,822
So it's just like if you're out of jail, however, there is like this obstacle that they have to jump through in order to find a job and typically

642
01:09:01,182 --> 01:09:08,322
not hire jobs and most of the time needs back into mass reentry of the prison system.

643
01:09:09,552 --> 01:09:14,142
And then also many employers, about 80% ran criminal background checks,

644
01:09:14,502 --> 01:09:21,432
even though these reports often contain inaccurate information for applicants, which was a big issue.

645
01:09:21,792 --> 01:09:30,822
And then also, employers would also ask the infamous question, have you been arrested or convicted question on these applications,

646
01:09:30,822 --> 01:09:41,412
which would allow employees and employers, excuse me, to quickly and easily veto applications simply because they did have a previous present record.

647
01:09:42,282 --> 01:09:45,162
And then also racial discrimination further worsen the problem.

648
01:09:45,792 --> 01:09:54,282
There's actually 23 studies that reveal that a black applicant without a criminal record has less of a chance receiving

649
01:09:54,522 --> 01:10:03,552
a callback at 14% compared to a white applicant with a criminal record who had a 17% chance in receiving a callback.

650
01:10:04,452 --> 01:10:08,092
Which. It's just absolutely ridiculous because.

651
01:10:10,412 --> 01:10:13,622
One has a criminal record and one doesn't. However, it's.

652
01:10:14,572 --> 01:10:21,562
It's just interesting looking at. And then the next point is from 2008, 2009, the legislative session.

653
01:10:22,492 --> 01:10:26,032
During that time band The Box was one of the six three entry reforms introduced

654
01:10:26,032 --> 01:10:31,162
into the General Assembly package called the Fair Release and Reentry Act.

655
01:10:31,492 --> 01:10:37,572
This package included several reforms like providing state aid to those returning home from prison.

656
01:10:38,242 --> 01:10:43,162
Also lifting the ban on food stamp assistance for those convicted of a felony drug charge.

657
01:10:43,972 --> 01:10:48,952
This reentry reform reform also included ban the box it.

658
01:10:50,032 --> 01:10:55,252
And during the 2010 legislative year.

659
01:10:55,762 --> 01:11:02,911
The then governor. John Forenza signed the Fair Release and reentry package would have,

660
01:11:02,912 --> 01:11:10,172
which had a bulk of the demands except for a few in the box due to the backlash of the business community on.

661
01:11:12,232 --> 01:11:14,962
Provided or gave to this campaign.

662
01:11:15,742 --> 01:11:23,182
A lot of the business people in the community found it that the ban the box was really restrictive and provided a burden on businesses.

663
01:11:23,782 --> 01:11:33,681
However, in 2013, the 2012 to the 2013 legislative session and US had their second attempt to legislate ban the box,

664
01:11:33,682 --> 01:11:36,142
and this time they learned from their previous mistake,

665
01:11:36,322 --> 01:11:46,401
which will go into the next few slides and they were actually able to in 2014 passed the Opportunity to Company Act,

666
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:52,222
which is the official name now, and it's no longer considered or called the Be on the Box Act.

667
01:11:54,442 --> 01:12:02,331
So the mission statement for the organization is the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice uses cutting edge racial and social justice advocacy

668
01:12:02,332 --> 01:12:10,432
to empower people of color by building reparative systems that create will transform justice and harness democratic power from the ground up.

669
01:12:10,792 --> 01:12:16,402
And New Jersey such has been the box act of also their vision is to increase social justice.

670
01:12:19,652 --> 01:12:24,002
So the organization had two methods to their campaign strategy.

671
01:12:24,182 --> 01:12:30,782
However, during the first campaign session, they heavily focused on the inside game.

672
01:12:31,622 --> 01:12:35,182
During the 2008 2009 campaign for and the Box.

673
01:12:35,192 --> 01:12:41,672
However, they didn't find success due to their lack of business or their campaign campaign strategy.

674
01:12:42,722 --> 01:12:52,441
So by the 2012 and 2013 campaign, Brooks, who is the CEO of the organization during that time, found it expanding.

675
01:12:52,442 --> 01:12:56,102
Her network excuse me would be a better benefit.

676
01:12:56,402 --> 01:12:59,312
So what they did as an organization was actually recruited.

677
01:12:59,912 --> 01:13:09,242
I don't know how to pronounce two things out of all of it, which was the former when she was a former and James J.

678
01:13:09,302 --> 01:13:13,322
Board member and also affluence affluence business leader in New Jersey.

679
01:13:13,592 --> 01:13:22,202
He had connections to Corpus Christi, Chris Christie, who was then the governor of New Jersey, who was a Republican.

680
01:13:22,952 --> 01:13:29,462
And the organization felt that it was crucial to align themselves and have a relationship with the then governor,

681
01:13:29,912 --> 01:13:34,592
to find a common ground in order to pass the baton, in order to pass this legislation.

682
01:13:35,282 --> 01:13:39,331
And also, Brooks cultivated other important relationship with other politicians,

683
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:45,452
specifically Republicans, to gain public support for being in the box of increasing their campaign.

684
01:13:45,452 --> 01:13:49,741
They found they focused on persuading business leaders and organizations for local

685
01:13:49,742 --> 01:13:54,122
church evictions to pass their own fee on the box before filling the state of Virgin.

686
01:13:54,752 --> 01:13:58,892
So that's the inside game, which is just engaging in negotiating with business leaders,

687
01:13:58,892 --> 01:14:05,222
working with individual legislators and the governor's office, and also collaborating with civic leaders to endorse the bill.

688
01:14:05,462 --> 01:14:11,191
Whereas the outside game was more of mobilizing their efforts of media campaign and really

689
01:14:11,192 --> 01:14:15,962
just involving themselves deeply within the communities that they're trying to work with.

690
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:20,942
So they started staging events to showcase the support they've gained for Ban the Box.

691
01:14:21,572 --> 01:14:26,132
And Brooks saw that it was important to religious leaders and saw them as an ally to work with.

692
01:14:27,422 --> 01:14:31,262
And they also went on a media campaign and organized a major press conference.

693
01:14:31,532 --> 01:14:34,792
At a press conference that they did was at Princeton, New Jersey.

694
01:14:34,802 --> 01:14:36,092
It was at Princeton, New Jersey.

695
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:45,992
And they found that the organization had their greatest success through partnering with grassroots organizations like Women Who Never Get Up, Give Up.

696
01:14:46,322 --> 01:14:52,951
And by working with them and partnering with them in allowing people who have a prison history to speak

697
01:14:52,952 --> 01:14:58,682
at these hearings or forums in Raleigh so they could tell their personal stories to those attending.

698
01:15:02,592 --> 01:15:06,312
All right. So I was going to start off by asking you all I'm assuming everyone said the case.

699
01:15:06,312 --> 01:15:08,741
So I was going to ask you guys, what do you guys think is the situation here?

700
01:15:08,742 --> 01:15:16,032
But as we all can see now, that it was a decision that was made in response to like a cascade of emerging problems.

701
01:15:16,572 --> 01:15:23,112
It was the problems were like the issues that ex-convicts faced while entering the job market.

702
01:15:24,342 --> 01:15:27,462
The problem was also an evident lack of opportunities for the target group,

703
01:15:27,462 --> 01:15:30,972
which was directly related to the high rate of recidivism in certain areas,

704
01:15:31,452 --> 01:15:37,781
and that the initiative was aimed at decreasing the discrimination against applicants who may have a criminal history,

705
01:15:37,782 --> 01:15:43,361
further highlighting the equity issue for this population. So we had a great point and chose to ask.

706
01:15:43,362 --> 01:15:46,692
So since he gave you that, that's what they determined.

707
01:15:47,052 --> 01:15:50,381
Do we agree or are there other do?

708
01:15:50,382 --> 01:15:54,281
Did others interpret this differently? I'm not labeling.

709
01:15:54,282 --> 01:16:06,872
This is incorrect. I'm just saying what would reportedly make. Everyone replicates the question.

710
01:16:06,872 --> 01:16:24,222
Look. Yeah. I mean, to me, in some ways it felt like more of an evaluation of just like the different options for handling,

711
01:16:24,402 --> 01:16:27,942
you know, the approach that that was how I interpreted it because they went for all those different,

712
01:16:28,572 --> 01:16:30,131
you know, the outside and inside game,

713
01:16:30,132 --> 01:16:35,112
the different resources that they had to kind of evaluating what was going to work or a combination of the two and.

714
01:16:38,082 --> 01:16:47,442
Those. I.

715
01:16:49,052 --> 01:16:55,012
All right. So the initial proposal that came out from the AngelList gave rise to a few questions,

716
01:16:55,372 --> 01:17:01,372
such as like at what point in the hiring process could an employer inquire into the applicant's history and background?

717
01:17:02,332 --> 01:17:05,692
Also, some questions like were smaller seasonal businesses kind of exempt?

718
01:17:06,112 --> 01:17:12,862
Or if so, like when did the logic in with them? And like some bigger questions such as like what were the enforcement mechanisms in the law?

719
01:17:12,862 --> 01:17:17,722
Like did an employer have to keep or filed the goods that demonstrate the compliance with the law?

720
01:17:20,632 --> 01:17:26,841
So some questions that would help that we felt would help address the decision options were given the barriers

721
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:31,312
like what would be the effective measures to improve the hiring process of those who were incarcerated.

722
01:17:31,822 --> 01:17:35,451
And again, like the fact was, I spoke about like,

723
01:17:35,452 --> 01:17:40,942
should you follow an internal or external approach or should they focus on approaches, approaches together a separate U.S.?

724
01:17:41,422 --> 01:17:45,352
And how should the organization allocate the resources depending on the approach that they're using?

725
01:17:46,372 --> 01:17:53,302
And there are some questions that address the head. Equity and systemic racism issue was like leading to more black people experiencing

726
01:17:53,302 --> 01:17:58,122
incarceration and that people of color would make majority of those who were incarcerated.

727
01:17:58,132 --> 01:18:03,652
Therefore, higher rates of unemployment among people of color. And then again, what photos I spoke about,

728
01:18:03,652 --> 01:18:11,332
like the chances of getting a callback from an employer was much lower for an ever convicted black male or black individual than a convicted white.

729
01:18:13,642 --> 01:18:20,271
So some recommendations that we propose as a hypothesis are like having a program in place to assist,

730
01:18:20,272 --> 01:18:23,872
assist former prisoners to get jobs at companies that hires former prisoners,

731
01:18:24,412 --> 01:18:29,782
but also offering training programs that are aimed at convicted individuals by partnering up with organizations,

732
01:18:30,022 --> 01:18:33,502
organizations so that such people can have a much better chance at getting hired.

733
01:18:34,012 --> 01:18:42,322
And then including such training programs within the prison systems where people of color would make up the majority of target audience and then

734
01:18:42,862 --> 01:18:50,002
initiating programs within communities where this capacity is more significantly higher and then offering extensive educational workshops in support,

735
01:18:50,212 --> 01:18:53,872
I mean, in addition to the training programs that were supposed to happen in prisons.

736
01:18:57,112 --> 01:19:02,872
So from a hypothesis like we hypothesize recommendations that prove that the fantastically

737
01:19:02,872 --> 01:19:07,222
bright employment can lead to lower recidivism rates in certain areas but in most of the areas,

738
01:19:07,522 --> 01:19:11,902
and would also help ex-convicts develop a better life from like for your second jobs.

739
01:19:12,232 --> 01:19:17,332
And the evidence that we have in support of this was that unemployment boost incarceration

740
01:19:17,572 --> 01:19:23,092
was seen to be a leading risk factor for I think it was a majority of the ex-offenders.

741
01:19:23,722 --> 01:19:31,042
I mean, of the 75% of the ex-offenders, the majority, almost like 70% of those who were once imprisoned and were still unemployed.

742
01:19:31,052 --> 01:19:33,352
What are you going to start with in three years of, you know,

743
01:19:33,382 --> 01:19:39,262
being released to the prison and this number much, much higher when the baseline was five years?

744
01:19:39,712 --> 01:19:45,741
And the second big proof that we saw that how this process is going to work was from the John Hopkins study,

745
01:19:45,742 --> 01:19:55,072
where it was observed that ex-offenders outperformed the current employers in terms of the longevity and so on, low absenteeism at work.

746
01:19:56,092 --> 01:20:01,342
And some actions that are needed to implement our decision of passing the law would be directly engaging with

747
01:20:01,342 --> 01:20:07,251
people who have a criminal record and partnering with businesses and roads that most people are interested in.

748
01:20:07,252 --> 01:20:13,012
But specifically, not if the rule or the organization relates to their existing criminal history.

749
01:20:13,492 --> 01:20:17,962
And then the second good idea was the think tank,

750
01:20:17,962 --> 01:20:24,772
which would help the harbor to employ convicts to become more employable or hirable by improving their literacy,

751
01:20:25,492 --> 01:20:29,782
as you meant, drafting skills and soft skills in addition to providing them with interview boards and,

752
01:20:29,932 --> 01:20:33,292
you know, doing more than using the movie to boost the self-confidence.

753
01:20:35,682 --> 01:20:40,511
Some of the roadblocks that still appeared while drafting the final proposal to

754
01:20:40,512 --> 01:20:44,982
be funded go to prove was the issue of negligent hiring that was constantly

755
01:20:44,982 --> 01:20:49,661
appearing for the employers because there was always an increasing threat of

756
01:20:49,662 --> 01:20:53,682
lawsuits from previous employers or victims of crime who might just come back and,

757
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:59,622
you know, fight a lawsuit saying that this particular person was involved in a crime like,

758
01:20:59,622 --> 01:21:05,212
let's say, getting in a physical fight with a colleague or maybe a customer.

759
01:21:05,232 --> 01:21:11,562
So, you know, there was always a threat of those kind of lawsuits, take off applicant lawsuits, let's say.

760
01:21:11,832 --> 01:21:16,292
As for the proposal, what was proposed was the employer can only, you know,

761
01:21:16,512 --> 01:21:22,512
ask for or do a search for the applicant's criminal history once they have already extended the offer.

762
01:21:22,512 --> 01:21:28,002
But something to offer at this point would make them open to lawsuits that would come again from the applicants.

763
01:21:28,902 --> 01:21:35,951
And the third and the biggest roadblock was compromising because the board kind of in the start realized that most

764
01:21:35,952 --> 01:21:42,162
of the clauses that would be a part of the bill wouldn't be approved or wouldn't be appreciated by employers.

765
01:21:42,762 --> 01:21:48,412
But they still didn't want to lose the support that they had from community because the community would definitely kind of, you know,

766
01:21:48,582 --> 01:21:55,472
rebel against the NGO if they already saw that they were kind of starting soft and weren't like,

767
01:21:55,542 --> 01:21:59,502
you know, addressing all the issues that were needed for for them to, you know, try.

768
01:22:01,272 --> 01:22:07,642
Next. So some of the alternatives were first of all,

769
01:22:07,642 --> 01:22:11,511
the limitations that we saw in the hypothesis was this would require a buy in

770
01:22:11,512 --> 01:22:16,322
from a company and funding as it should benefit the company as And clearly,

771
01:22:16,372 --> 01:22:21,932
an issue of applicant lawsuits would of, you know, kind of create a bad image for the company.

772
01:22:22,832 --> 01:22:29,491
And the only jobs that were available at limited companies were from the employers that chose to participate in this program,

773
01:22:29,492 --> 01:22:34,622
thereby restricting the type of jobs which the ex-convicts would get. And then Ford was able to speak about not to do this.

774
01:22:34,862 --> 01:22:37,892
So the alternatives that we had was lobbying more business leaders,

775
01:22:38,432 --> 01:22:44,072
using pictures previously as a good performance of early adopters and low risk of relapse.

776
01:22:44,552 --> 01:22:50,521
And our second alternative was providing certain tax relief or insensitive incentives to businesses

777
01:22:50,522 --> 01:22:56,432
that employ ex-convicts to increase the businesses that have opportunities for ex-convicts.

778
01:22:57,982 --> 01:23:03,322
And then with the conclusion the act was finally passed by the New Jersey Legislature and it

779
01:23:03,322 --> 01:23:09,262
was obviously renamed as a possible opportunity to compete and it was passed in July 2014.

780
01:23:10,312 --> 01:23:17,152
Governor Chris Christie signed the bill on August 11, 2014, and he made an important statement which focused on the,

781
01:23:17,662 --> 01:23:24,322
you know, providing second chances to felons and ex-convicts because he believes that everyone deserves a second chance.

782
01:23:25,222 --> 01:23:30,052
And stemming from this opportunity to compete again.

783
01:23:30,442 --> 01:23:37,642
On December 17, 2019, the US Congress enacted the fair chance to compete for a job act which essentially prohibited,

784
01:23:37,642 --> 01:23:45,912
like federal authorities and employers or contractors, to, you know, discriminate between applicants in terms of their communities industry.

785
01:23:48,032 --> 01:23:56,822
And then the discussion questions was. So something that actually stood out for both of us while going through the case was we realized that,

786
01:23:56,942 --> 01:24:00,182
you know, the U.S. was inclined to give the best,

787
01:24:00,422 --> 01:24:04,232
but provided that it's a social justice organization like the you think it was

788
01:24:04,232 --> 01:24:10,051
right on to only a few of the testimonials from convicts of nonviolent crimes,

789
01:24:10,052 --> 01:24:13,182
even though the acquittal also covered the contours of pointing guns.

790
01:24:13,442 --> 01:24:16,892
Like it was important, but it wasn't fair. So, like, what do you guys think about that?

791
01:24:26,902 --> 01:24:32,382
Alec Reilly I didn't catch specifics in the article, which I did read the case.

792
01:24:32,392 --> 01:24:39,622
I mean, but I remember them bringing this point up, specifically the things that they knew that they were using.

793
01:24:40,622 --> 01:24:48,622
Imperative to push their agenda that could also be used against them like that,

794
01:24:48,812 --> 01:24:59,332
that it would be possible for someone to counter by proposing a law that would have saved that particular guy's job prospects and no one else's,

795
01:24:59,342 --> 01:25:02,972
because it was sort of such an extreme climate case.

796
01:25:02,972 --> 01:25:10,801
But I don't think you're. I remember them saying that they were careful to tiptoe around that and to to use that some,

797
01:25:10,802 --> 01:25:17,702
but not too much or something in order to try to make sure that the law remained broad and helpful to everyone.

798
01:25:18,422 --> 01:25:21,512
But I don't remember that they said any specific strategies.

799
01:25:22,202 --> 01:25:28,292
So if you remember, they spoke about the Phoebe case, like a guy who was found guilty of some illicit drugs like 20 years ago,

800
01:25:29,102 --> 01:25:33,112
and they were using like his case to I mean, this kind of like testimonials.

801
01:25:33,122 --> 01:25:39,572
They get off to, you know, promote that pitch to employers and, you know, with the decision makers.

802
01:25:39,582 --> 01:25:45,632
But but they also wanted to avoid, like, you know, certain cases that like cases of violent crimes,

803
01:25:45,632 --> 01:25:52,112
which would if a person like if a decision maker listens to it, he would definitely be like, okay, I'm not approving this.

804
01:25:52,652 --> 01:25:57,152
So that that's the question like would kind of be fair to you at all.

805
01:25:57,252 --> 01:26:02,132
Just like because this ad that they're trying to bust this company, everyone like all the criminals,

806
01:26:02,132 --> 01:26:05,672
like people who've been part of line and claims or maybe his activities.

807
01:26:06,062 --> 01:26:09,331
So that was something that stood out for us.

808
01:26:09,332 --> 01:26:13,502
Like, you know, is it fair to just include certain testimonials?

809
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:20,492
And for what I'm saying is I remember them pointing out that, no, that's not fair or even good practice.

810
01:26:21,512 --> 01:26:24,232
And that they they carefully did not do that.

811
01:26:24,242 --> 01:26:31,412
But I don't remember them saying how they avoided doing that and what they they were already using the testimonials from the Beebe case,

812
01:26:31,682 --> 01:26:35,352
but they weren't using any of the testimonials from the lighter crimes.

813
01:26:35,352 --> 01:26:41,962
So that essentially means that they think it's not right. But this is what is the part of the question they are trying to do.

814
01:26:42,212 --> 01:26:42,742
What do you think?

815
01:26:42,752 --> 01:26:50,852
What would you have provided that you were a social justice promoting organization like for you without or I mean, it's like an open road.

816
01:26:52,472 --> 01:27:02,612
It seems somewhat dishonest to me, is my point like that, that they recognize that conflict and, you know, suggested that they weren't going to.

817
01:27:03,662 --> 01:27:10,812
And it's like we're just, like, kind of not to be critical, but like it makes sense that if you're targeting, like, let's say,

818
01:27:10,812 --> 01:27:17,172
a black community, like they had a statement that they wouldn't like a testimonial from a white guy who was an opioid addict.

819
01:27:17,562 --> 01:27:25,122
Do you know what that bench for that community, which kind of still makes sense in this part, but like, again, like of course it's still the same.

820
01:27:25,272 --> 01:27:37,101
But I mean, I appreciate the point that you made. Just like push back against a little bit on it being dishonest.

821
01:27:37,102 --> 01:27:46,011
I feel like because of because there's such a strong stigma against against people who have a history with criminal activity or convictions,

822
01:27:46,012 --> 01:27:54,892
I feel like they had no other choice. I mean, if they had promoted violent testimonies like you, nobody is going to want to work with those people.

823
01:27:55,582 --> 01:28:04,132
So I think they did the best they could with given the circumstances of how we view people with a history of criminal activity.

824
01:28:06,412 --> 01:28:09,322
Olivia, I want to skip over you and something you were going to say.

825
01:28:09,352 --> 01:28:16,102
I was going to say what Katie says because like the loss of already set seven threshold, there they are.

826
01:28:16,132 --> 01:28:23,452
Everyone when they walk into the room, they swear once they're there, it's going to be on whatever they're presenting.

827
01:28:23,482 --> 01:28:30,172
So I don't know. Fair is the right word, but it seems like it's the most strategic option.

828
01:28:32,772 --> 01:28:37,182
I mean, I agree that there is like a PTSD in doing it this way.

829
01:28:37,962 --> 01:28:48,492
I don't think it's in my hands that it would stigmatize like violent crimes, like as people who are working or anything like.

830
01:28:51,082 --> 01:28:56,402
Oh, I was going to say it's the right thing, actually, where it's like kind of I think as a strategy,

831
01:28:56,402 --> 01:29:04,261
it probably makes sense to emphasize the nonviolent, but I think it kind of does a disservice to the overall idea and the larger context here this.

832
01:29:04,262 --> 01:29:11,552
But, you know, a lot of context of, you know, criminalization where the violent offenders kind of get put in this other category.

833
01:29:11,552 --> 01:29:15,031
So that's, you know, irredeemable or something.

834
01:29:15,032 --> 01:29:21,002
When even the case mentioned that, you know, largely people, for lack of a better term, kind of age out of violent crime,

835
01:29:21,642 --> 01:29:29,201
there's just really not a big statistical risk of committing violent crimes as you get older and after you serve your time in jail.

836
01:29:29,202 --> 01:29:33,212
And it's kind of as a society kind of thinking in the concept of, you know,

837
01:29:33,212 --> 01:29:36,991
if we send people to jail and give them worthy to get out of jail, is that,

838
01:29:36,992 --> 01:29:44,162
you know, not enough of a penalty and then kind of, you know, further stigmatizing the type of crime that you did, I don't know from my perspective.

839
01:29:44,162 --> 01:29:50,042
It's like when I get out of jail, you know, in terms of strategy, I kind of see.

840
01:29:54,202 --> 01:29:56,222
And I guess we can call the next question.

841
01:29:57,512 --> 01:30:05,372
In what ways can nonprofit organizations like NCIS contribute to addressing the racial inequality and equity in terms of seeking employment?

842
01:30:05,372 --> 01:30:12,782
And how does this end the lives of incarcerated people in states like Hawaii versus states that do not have any such legislation?

843
01:30:21,952 --> 01:30:26,602
Well, we've set precedent now, so that's a great way for other people to cite it.

844
01:30:27,202 --> 01:30:35,722
Um, that's really impactful, especially like from a legal field, you're always looking for precedent that's done it.

845
01:30:35,722 --> 01:30:40,492
So I would do it. I think since New Jersey has passed this other,

846
01:30:40,522 --> 01:30:51,962
I think like 27 states and like 150 cities or localities where they've implemented or legislated similar.

847
01:30:51,962 --> 01:31:12,582
Ban the ball in the box laws. So this organization took up an advocacy strategy in order to work through this.

848
01:31:12,632 --> 01:31:18,852
And if you recall in the recap of the case, it didn't work out the way that they had initially intended.

849
01:31:18,882 --> 01:31:26,232
What are your thoughts on that? I think back to these two questions. I mean,

850
01:31:26,232 --> 01:31:31,811
the reason this case is sort of here is to think about our discussion on kind

851
01:31:31,812 --> 01:31:35,862
of these organizations and how they work inside of advocacy environments.

852
01:31:36,702 --> 01:31:40,662
We've talked quite a bit about that and you are kind of brought up in your presentations.

853
01:31:41,402 --> 01:31:47,352
You know, what were your thoughts on kind of how the advocacy efforts went off with this organization and what they what they did?

854
01:31:48,822 --> 01:31:54,581
Alex It reminded me actually of what I guess how I feel about that.

855
01:31:54,582 --> 01:32:04,302
First question is that like, you know, that they were up against this pretty solid wall of violence against this group of people,

856
01:32:04,932 --> 01:32:08,262
and they just had to find a crack and chip away at it.

857
01:32:08,272 --> 01:32:17,412
And if that crack is finding someone who hasn't done a single thing wrong in the last four years, then that's the crack you've got to use like that.

858
01:32:18,102 --> 01:32:22,532
And it felt similar when they decided to sort of compromise on their bill,

859
01:32:22,542 --> 01:32:29,772
like they wanted to make progress more than they wanted to just take a moral stand.

860
01:32:30,672 --> 01:32:36,582
And I think it's a balance, but it seemed like a reasonable strategy.

861
01:32:44,172 --> 01:32:51,132
And you think of organizations in Michigan that will likely be working heavily on advocacy coming up

862
01:32:51,132 --> 01:32:56,952
into the next legislative session with changes in the legislature like we were talking about earlier.

863
01:33:00,962 --> 01:33:04,962
It's the same governor, right? The reelection of a governor.

864
01:33:04,962 --> 01:33:10,102
But it's the first time in 40 years that the legislature will be under you know, you're.

865
01:33:11,302 --> 01:33:14,602
Under a unified control of the opposite party.

866
01:33:19,752 --> 01:33:25,202
But there are laws that you are kind of thinking about that you've been discussing or where you see

867
01:33:25,202 --> 01:33:32,402
organizations that might be involved and would have opportunity to advocate in ways that maybe they aren't.

868
01:33:32,882 --> 01:33:39,602
I mean, this organization, as you see, working through legislate, there was a path, a legislative path to work through.

869
01:33:40,472 --> 01:33:45,392
So at the time, Governor Christie was a Republican.

870
01:33:45,392 --> 01:33:48,622
I believe the legislature in New Jersey at the time was controlled by the Democratic Party.

871
01:33:48,632 --> 01:33:52,682
I can't remember. But nonetheless, they had to find a way to compromise.

872
01:33:54,282 --> 01:33:58,782
But in Michigan, there will be, you know, a different situation.

873
01:34:01,172 --> 01:34:07,622
A division like specific to this sort of thinking of us.

874
01:34:07,802 --> 01:34:15,482
This is a great case study that shows us the path that an organization took to address a policy issue.

875
01:34:16,672 --> 01:34:24,741
With state governments. It wasn't just that they were saying, Hey, you should do something about this, or, hey, this is important.

876
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:31,052
We are advocating where they had a strategy eradicating and they think they did it.

877
01:34:34,442 --> 01:34:39,812
It's only. This is only half. Sorry, it's only half answering your question.

878
01:34:39,812 --> 01:34:45,421
But I think we probably all all the organizations in Michigan, like with the current change,

879
01:34:45,422 --> 01:34:49,412
are going to be advocating now for what they want, thinking that they can get it done.

880
01:34:49,742 --> 01:34:51,392
And so I think it'll be more of a priority.

881
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:57,932
And how do you make your your issue stand out against all the other priorities that the government will now be like, you know.

882
01:35:00,302 --> 01:35:06,572
You'll be getting. I can't get the word out to use, but I mean,

883
01:35:06,572 --> 01:35:11,302
they're going to I think they're going to receive like a lot of stuff from nonprofits like constituents and like try to get things passed.

884
01:35:11,312 --> 01:35:15,362
And so like, how do they prioritize? That, I guess is probably what I'm thinking.

885
01:35:15,372 --> 01:35:22,452
So going to be a bigger issue than like who's going to reach out? Put yourselves inside of the organizations.

886
01:35:22,472 --> 01:35:28,352
What do you do? You kind of saw in this case what they did.

887
01:35:28,402 --> 01:35:32,472
What would you do? Here all we're writing about organizations.

888
01:35:34,822 --> 01:35:37,851
It's lawyers who think hard.

889
01:35:37,852 --> 01:35:41,842
Sometimes Republican Congress process works.

890
01:35:44,132 --> 01:35:49,462
So legal expertise may be the sort of identify what you might be able to intervene on.

891
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:57,772
What else? Cultivating relationships and kinds of coalition building.

892
01:35:59,242 --> 01:36:03,562
Legislators who are passionate about these issues are really a gateway.

893
01:36:09,172 --> 01:36:12,081
One thing I've noticed and maybe you all have thoughts on this,

894
01:36:12,082 --> 01:36:23,152
is I've noticed that there seems to be a a characterization of what issues get absorbed based on what is in the news, so to speak.

895
01:36:23,342 --> 01:36:32,152
That's what we're what we're dealing with today, as opposed to maybe things that have historically become challenged or have been challenged.

896
01:36:33,022 --> 01:36:36,712
Thinking back to Katie's presentation and the fact that what you presented,

897
01:36:36,712 --> 01:36:45,171
there was something that's been going on for the last five years and yet tenured and yet it wasn't getting addressed for 60, 70 years.

898
01:36:45,172 --> 01:36:53,162
Just ignored. So you know what would get the attention of a policymaker to say, hey, this is an issue to take out?

899
01:36:53,172 --> 01:36:57,581
I mean, why, why? Why was the legislature interested in this specific issue?

900
01:36:57,582 --> 01:37:02,562
I mean, there are many issues to consider. Why this one why did this one rise to the top?

901
01:37:04,242 --> 01:37:10,782
Because. I mean, that's one of the reasons because it was also contributing to a high rate of crime.

902
01:37:11,652 --> 01:37:12,832
So that's when.

903
01:37:14,342 --> 01:37:19,892
The society, I mean, not the organization itself, but this is like it was like, what can we do to give more importance to this populace?

904
01:37:20,162 --> 01:37:22,982
If it's related to high level crimes, then maybe we should.

905
01:37:23,252 --> 01:37:29,672
And I think I mean, that's just my perspective, like usually when these decision makers, like they ordered.

906
01:37:30,772 --> 01:37:36,492
I mean, that's how see, they can make about a few lives unless they see that the whole society, the whole community is being affected.

907
01:37:36,502 --> 01:37:40,332
That's what it is. They decided, we think. So.

908
01:37:42,212 --> 01:37:43,812
I mean, I think they were really strategic.

909
01:37:43,812 --> 01:37:49,091
And, you know, their case with PBE is that this was something current going on and they were able to tie it into, you know,

910
01:37:49,092 --> 01:37:50,501
it's a problem that had been around for a long time,

911
01:37:50,502 --> 01:37:54,102
but they were able to tie it to something that was happening right then with a very specific person.

912
01:37:54,102 --> 01:37:56,982
And I think it humanizes an issue and brings a whole other element for people

913
01:37:56,982 --> 01:38:00,702
to see when you have an actual case or something like that to bring with it.

914
01:38:04,382 --> 01:38:07,792
Rather than telling us I think I've got a career.

915
01:38:08,412 --> 01:38:19,272
Told us that the agenda comes from having a policy that a policy solution that will fit an

916
01:38:19,272 --> 01:38:26,232
existing problem more often than having a problem and then finding a policy solution for it.

917
01:38:26,322 --> 01:38:32,111
So, you know, this friend, the boxing had come up before the problem was ongoing.

918
01:38:32,112 --> 01:38:39,622
The data were alarming. And and these guys had this policy solution in their pocket.

919
01:38:39,642 --> 01:38:50,472
So then the third the third contributor to the actually agenda is finding a favorable political atmosphere of a moment strike.

920
01:38:51,702 --> 01:38:55,181
And they you know, they had that, too.

921
01:38:55,182 --> 01:39:00,762
They found that they had friends on the inside and that Chris Christie could be convinced.

922
01:39:01,902 --> 01:39:04,072
And I think that's what we're looking at in Michigan, too.

923
01:39:04,142 --> 01:39:13,452
Like, if you have a gun control policy and we just had a mass shooting in a high school and suddenly the legislature flips,

924
01:39:13,662 --> 01:39:19,572
then you have all of the characteristics that you need to turn that into an active piece of agenda.

925
01:39:22,772 --> 01:39:24,402
So you say something interesting,

926
01:39:24,402 --> 01:39:30,732
which I want to connect between what you heard from Scott and what we're talking about here in terms of organizations,

927
01:39:31,182 --> 01:39:39,312
which is what obviously you saying about having lawyers or legal policy experts that you're working on.

928
01:39:39,732 --> 01:39:49,232
What part of the strategic plan is the organization then making sure is honored in the periods where there isn't a favorable alignment?

929
01:39:50,482 --> 01:39:52,962
What's a strategic goal that they could be working on?

930
01:40:02,912 --> 01:40:12,991
But maintaining the coalition building and their relationships with individuals and clusters together until on what's going to potentially happen.

931
01:40:12,992 --> 01:40:17,932
But also I would be interested in lobbying I guess.

932
01:40:18,672 --> 01:40:22,042
And so great one piece.

933
01:40:22,052 --> 01:40:35,142
What else? So live suggests coalition building and in keeping in your your sense there.

934
01:40:36,462 --> 01:40:41,022
But what should the organization have what should they have ready to go policy.

935
01:40:41,032 --> 01:40:45,462
So the policies. Right. So when is it time to start writing policies?

936
01:40:47,202 --> 01:40:51,342
On the time when the legislature flips before yesterday.

937
01:40:52,932 --> 01:41:00,762
So if they're thinking about a five year strategic plan, this is just I kind of want bring this sort of to sort of circle this together.

938
01:41:01,152 --> 01:41:08,412
If they're thinking about a five year strategic plan and it's all focused on just these are the numbers of people who are going to serve.

939
01:41:08,422 --> 01:41:16,302
This is the program we're going introduce all of this. But there are policy levers that they that the organization seeks to change.

940
01:41:16,872 --> 01:41:24,611
Then perhaps it might consider it a strategic plan to be working on specific policy solutions,

941
01:41:24,612 --> 01:41:30,342
not just talking about it, but developing policy and ready to go.

942
01:41:30,762 --> 01:41:35,052
So when the when the climate is there, you're first to go.

943
01:41:36,162 --> 01:41:39,852
For the ones who are still working on it and trying to figure out what to do and when

944
01:41:39,852 --> 01:41:44,772
the climate turns on or when starting when the when the moment becomes available,

945
01:41:45,792 --> 01:41:57,212
they're not there. They're still standing in the back. So it's an interesting I think this is an interesting case in leadership as well.

946
01:41:57,632 --> 01:42:01,022
We talked a little about that next week just to sort of conclude our course.

947
01:42:01,562 --> 01:42:07,502
But it's interesting, I thought an interesting case of leadership in terms of what, you know, is as a leader inside of the organization,

948
01:42:08,012 --> 01:42:14,882
what are you thinking about sort of leading an organization to do what what is its portfolio that it should be addressing?

949
01:42:15,902 --> 01:42:22,022
I think a lot of times we've talked a bit about the organization's approach to different programs and competitive and etc.

950
01:42:22,502 --> 01:42:29,702
I think this case highlights for us how how much power the organizations can have in influencing a policy decision.

951
01:42:30,242 --> 01:42:34,382
But to the point that you are made, if they have policies introduced.

952
01:42:36,312 --> 01:42:41,772
They've worked through or workshopped a role played through because you can't role play when it's time to go.

953
01:42:42,252 --> 01:42:45,972
You have to be ready to go. What do we think?

954
01:42:47,842 --> 01:42:52,632
I'm suggesting that, but I'm not saying that. That's right. I'm smiling.

955
01:42:52,642 --> 01:42:56,622
You can't see my efforts.

956
01:42:58,182 --> 01:43:02,172
What do you think of that book?

957
01:43:03,802 --> 01:43:09,581
Others? Well, I want to thank today's group for helping us get straight to the point here on this case.

958
01:43:09,582 --> 01:43:14,532
I think you brought to us very specific discussion questions that really spoke to them to

959
01:43:14,532 --> 01:43:19,062
the to the core issue of this case and what was important in terms of our considerations.

960
01:43:19,062 --> 01:43:24,732
And thank you for a great presentation. Okay.

961
01:43:25,182 --> 01:43:33,182
I want to turn your attention back to your slides. I know everyone I can see, everyone's just buzzing to get those turned in.

962
01:43:33,192 --> 01:43:36,672
So why don't we get those finished up?

963
01:43:37,362 --> 01:43:41,712
Um, I'm going to make it. I'll just conclude here. And that way you can get to the tournament and.

964
01:43:41,832 --> 01:43:47,322
And then go as you need next week. Next week, will will follow a similar format.

965
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:52,242
So please plan to be here for that so that you can get them submitted.

966
01:43:52,752 --> 01:44:00,492
Um, we will have some current events next week and then we'll have a case next week.

967
01:44:01,482 --> 01:44:03,162
And then we'll will conclude.

968
01:44:03,402 --> 01:44:10,662
So I'm going to reserve time during class next week for you to complete the course evaluations for the course during class.

969
01:44:10,822 --> 01:44:16,152
I'll I'll what I we I had to step out, give you all the time to do it.

970
01:44:16,992 --> 01:44:23,262
But I'll ask that you do it here, just that we we can get a good picture of what what went on is very helpful for us.

971
01:44:23,532 --> 01:44:29,712
For me, for an apartment, etc. And then we'll conclude our course free.

972
01:44:29,772 --> 01:44:40,622
Do other professors do that? I do not know how you will get such more meaningful feedback if you allow time for it.

973
01:44:40,852 --> 01:44:48,632
I just I have found that it provides opportunities for feedback to be a little bit more true to what's going on.

974
01:44:48,722 --> 01:44:54,451
So it should make the others do that to some extent because they kind of insinuated like if you do it on time,

975
01:44:54,452 --> 01:44:58,172
you can like .51 month extra for something. That's what I mean.

976
01:44:59,282 --> 01:45:02,182
I'm sorry, I'm not offering the trades very everything.

977
01:45:03,012 --> 01:45:09,212
You know, I try to make it so that you feel honest and not like you have to be compensated for your time.

978
01:45:11,132 --> 01:45:16,982
I have a question about your logic on your oh on yellow Digg itself.

979
01:45:16,982 --> 01:45:19,021
There is like a specific point marks.

980
01:45:19,022 --> 01:45:25,262
Like when we hit that amount of points, I was like, are we good or should we still keep doing the thousand points every week?

981
01:45:25,472 --> 01:45:30,822
I think you had to hit 15,000 was the total. 14,014 is 14 weeks.

982
01:45:30,822 --> 01:45:40,412
So 14,000 of youth. Mac, if you've got 14,000 points that you are absorbed in response to it, if you have it, then keep going.

983
01:45:40,922 --> 01:45:48,122
And if you're really behind, come talk to me. So did you say that next week we're doing more of this?

984
01:45:48,512 --> 01:45:49,072
No, no.

985
01:45:49,112 --> 01:45:56,702
We'll have another similar so that we should finish this now and just now get this done and then we'll talk about it maybe a little bit next week.

986
01:45:56,702 --> 01:46:04,802
But yeah, but we'll do something similar to people moving in here just to kind of just take a question on this for you.

987
01:46:05,102 --> 01:46:08,362
Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Okay.

988
01:46:09,332 --> 01:46:12,752
So your yellow posts for this. Go ahead.

989
01:46:12,752 --> 01:46:16,831
In January has most. Why do you post it?

990
01:46:16,832 --> 01:46:21,092
Individualistic. I'll get the post anyway. You don't have to.

991
01:46:21,782 --> 01:46:35,282
It'll be a little bit messy up on the board, but I'd rather as well get used to being out here in the confines of the words today.

992
01:46:39,242 --> 01:46:42,542
All right. But that is just go ahead and finish up your slides.

993
01:46:42,542 --> 01:46:45,662
Thank you for all of your great presentations.

994
01:46:45,782 --> 01:46:54,782
I'm always looking forward to our final session next week and grateful for all our lives that are able going to be.

995
01:46:54,782 --> 01:46:57,272
Help us, I say over.
