00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:13,780
Hello and welcome to module seven. For this module, I'd like to talk to you about virus discovery.

2
00:00:16,311 --> 00:00:19,931
So in the last lecture I talked about virus emergence.

3
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:25,731
So the actual process in biology when a virus moves into a new population.

4
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:35,631
Now I'm going to talk more specifically about when that happens, how viruses are initially discovered and characterized,

5
00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:42,921
and ultimately how we think about new discovered viruses in terms of determining

6
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:46,521
what syndromes they actually cause and what health effects they go on to cause.

7
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:03,761
So viral discovery broadly falls into two different modes.

8
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:11,711
One is you have syndromic identification happening first, so you have a person or a cluster of people with a particular syndrome.

9
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:16,511
And testing doesn't reveal that they're infected with anything that you know about.

10
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:25,031
Oftentimes, you have specific epidemiologic hypotheses that are kind of driving the types of testing that you do.

11
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:33,071
The second is genomic identification. So this is where you've got testing happening.

12
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:44,201
That's virus independent. That is simply looking for viruses in clinical specimens and other specimens where where they may be able to be discovered.

13
00:01:44,531 --> 00:01:48,160
So this is sort of a virus first, not a syndrome, first way of doing it,

14
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:52,391
presenting a lot of confusion in terms of figuring out what these viruses actually cause,

15
00:01:53,411 --> 00:01:59,771
which with the real increase and improvement in availability of genomic technologies,

16
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:06,341
this latter category has really resulted in a very large number of viruses being discovered.

17
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:13,911
So now that we are in this era of genomic identification,

18
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:19,671
we're increasingly challenged to demonstrate that a specific virus is linked to a specific disease.

19
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:25,611
Because you can detect viral nucleic acid long after the initial acute infection event,

20
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:36,521
there is a remaining concern that maybe what you're picking up with your genomic tests may not be what is causing the acute syndrome that's happening.

21
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:46,521
And so I'm going to talk to the example of the initial discovery and characterization of Zika virus and

22
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:52,341
the work that had to be done to really establish causation between Zika virus and the clinical impacts.

23
00:02:55,041 --> 00:03:03,621
So in 2007, there's an outbreak report from Yap Island in the Federated States of Micronesia.

24
00:03:05,691 --> 00:03:14,061
And this outbreak was an outbreak of an analyst characterized by rash, conjunctivitis, suggestive feature, arthralgia and arthritis.

25
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:23,871
Some patients were seropositive for dengue IgG at the time, but the presentation of this was very difficult from typical dengue.

26
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:30,050
So samples were tested using allies, plaque reduction, neutralization,

27
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:43,101
test specific and consensus primers for known ARBOVIRUSES and eventually identified that this outbreak of illness was caused by by Zika virus.

28
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:57,761
Moving forward. However, when Zika virus started to spread, particularly in Brazil's where this was, the patterns were noticed.

29
00:03:58,601 --> 00:04:05,441
Zika virus was already a known pathogen, but this was a presentation that people had not seen before or not expected.

30
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:12,130
It coincided there was a 20 fold increase in microcephaly in Brazil about the time that the Zika

31
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:19,391
virus outbreak and really epidemic spread of Zika virus was happening in these regions of Brazil.

32
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:30,851
This is something that that individual practitioners, individual clinicians were noting and had started to communicate among networks of themselves,

33
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:36,431
to start to talk about how they were seeing really unusual patterns in the increases of microcephaly.

34
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:47,471
And there were, you know, and it was first, you know, there was this striking temporal relationship, that Zika virus had emerged in the area.

35
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:50,991
But there was a huge there.

36
00:04:51,521 --> 00:05:02,621
There was a lot of suspicion and and just not a lot of a lot of concern that this correlation does not equal causation and

37
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:08,711
that the Zika virus just happening to appear at the same time necessarily was not necessarily the cause of microcephaly.

38
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:15,730
And there was a lot of kind of blowback in the scientific community saying that it

39
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:19,031
was too early to say that the Zika virus was actually causing the microcephaly.

40
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:23,971
This all changed by this study right here.

41
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:29,561
There was a fetal autopsy that was done in Slovenia,

42
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:37,931
and they were able to when they were doing the fetal autopsy, they were able to actually locate the Zika virus.

43
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:43,961
RNA was present in the brain tissue in the fetus with microcephaly when this autopsy was done.

44
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:48,701
And and this was really a huge change.

45
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:53,590
It was really a landmark event in understanding Zika virus and whether it was linked to these events,

46
00:05:53,591 --> 00:06:01,480
because now you've got a the virus actually being identified in the in the brain tissue and at the site,

47
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:04,841
the kind of intense and anatomic state of concern.

48
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:14,171
So let's talk about the the example of bourbon virus.

49
00:06:14,171 --> 00:06:16,721
Bourbon virus is named after Bourbon County, Kansas,

50
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:28,721
and there was a healthy older than 50 year old and year old male who was identified as having nausea,

51
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,531
weakness, diarrhea, fever, anorexia, chills, headache, myalgia, arthralgia.

52
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:38,111
He was prescribed drugs, cycling for tick borne illness, but this illness was eventually fatal.

53
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:47,261
He had multiple tick bites. Plus there was one engorged tick that was recovered that was available for for testing as well.

54
00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:54,851
He was tested for all sorts of known tick borne diseases, fungal pathogens.

55
00:06:55,631 --> 00:07:02,141
He was negative for all known viral pathogens, and he was negative on a culture for bacterial pathogens.

56
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:10,361
So this article on the bottom describes what they did to identify the STIs, identify and discover this virus.

57
00:07:11,051 --> 00:07:23,081
So what this is showing here is they were doing a plaque reduction neutralization test of patient's sample for Heartland Virus.

58
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:31,060
So basically what they do is they sort of plate the patient sample on this plate.

59
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:36,521
They grow Hartland virus and they see if the patient has antibodies against Hartland virus,

60
00:07:36,671 --> 00:07:46,931
which would then stop the growth of the virus on the cell culture and identify that the individual had had Hartland antibodies,

61
00:07:48,071 --> 00:07:51,550
however, on the plate by chance.

62
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:57,731
And this the arrows with the single head show this there were these big blobs

63
00:07:57,731 --> 00:08:01,181
of viral infection that were starting to take place in this culture plate,

64
00:08:02,891 --> 00:08:05,351
the virus with the double heads,

65
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:14,170
those are the heartland viruses that are added to the plates in order to perform the parents in order to perform the antibody testing experiment.

66
00:08:14,171 --> 00:08:21,551
Experiment. So those so you can see the large plaques indicated by the single head arrows here.

67
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:25,361
Don't look anything like the smallpox with the double head arrows right here.

68
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:31,571
And so here is finally they were able to grow the virus and question it in this individual.

69
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:43,091
So you put this under electron microscopy. And at this point they've figured out that it's a stock photo virus.

70
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:52,391
These viruses are actually known for having a combination of filamentous morphologies and spherical morphologies,

71
00:08:53,081 --> 00:09:02,050
and they're in their various viral particles. And you can see both the electron microscope picture of the virus itself,

72
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:12,581
and you can see here some sections of shear of tissue where you can see extracellular

73
00:09:12,581 --> 00:09:21,400
virions and you can also see the arrows here are showing particles that have been and I say,

74
00:09:21,401 --> 00:09:35,581
tossed into cells. They then did some slight changes to compare the sequences of this new virus to

75
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:43,710
various other viruses and and compare it also to the mix of viruses on the bottom.

76
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:51,511
And you can see how the phylogeny is here to place this bourbon virus alongside similar viruses that are now.

77
00:09:57,251 --> 00:10:01,021
So next, I'm going to turn to thinking about genomic viral discovery.

78
00:10:01,031 --> 00:10:06,220
So these are methods that you can, you know, genomic viral discovery.

79
00:10:06,221 --> 00:10:10,001
You're sort of this is this is really what virus hunting looks like these days.

80
00:10:10,421 --> 00:10:14,921
And you can do methods where you are looking at specifically a virus family.

81
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:16,660
So you've got virus family based methods.

82
00:10:16,661 --> 00:10:25,691
You're using kind of conserved primers for a virus family to look at more members of the family of that family.

83
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:35,321
And so we see this happening very frequently when you've got virus families that are of pandemic potential, pretty pandemic concern.

84
00:10:37,091 --> 00:10:42,851
You know, there has been a lot of efforts in using coronavirus primers that are as conserved as

85
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:47,441
possible over many decades to try to look for new emerging strains of coronaviruses,

86
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:56,651
particularly in animal reservoirs. And then we also have this newer generation of methods that are sequence independent methods.

87
00:10:56,681 --> 00:11:01,810
So you can go into a set of samples with no prior knowledge in terms of what might be there,

88
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:08,470
and use things like random priming and viral metagenomics to amplify anything that might be present,

89
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:18,281
any sort of nucleic acid that might be in the sample. So random priming just real quick requires degradation of the host DNA.

90
00:11:19,091 --> 00:11:24,910
But because the viral capsid protects degradation of the viral DNA and RNA,

91
00:11:24,911 --> 00:11:29,291
you can eliminate the host DNA out of the sample and be left with viral DNA and RNA.

92
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:34,480
You then use you can use random hexamer as you can use this buzz,

93
00:11:34,481 --> 00:11:42,460
which is a different kind of single primer amplification technique to basically amplify anything that's leftover.

94
00:11:42,461 --> 00:11:48,701
And so anything that's left over will be anything that was kind of contained and protected by a viral nucleocapsid.

95
00:11:49,721 --> 00:11:56,711
So this is not a technique that's limited to viruses. Both this and metagenomics are techniques that are used in other spaces of genomics as well.

96
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:04,131
So metagenomics, this is a technique that was originally designed for use with environmental samples.

97
00:12:04,401 --> 00:12:05,781
No priming is needed.

98
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:14,331
It has less to bias determination of all sequences present compared to hexamer based or other sort of random priming based methods.

99
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:25,971
And then the sequence, there's a bidding process to determine the sequences that are present based on the what's being determined.

100
00:12:26,481 --> 00:12:38,331
And then once you've decided that, you have determined that there's a species present that is not something that's previously known,

101
00:12:38,331 --> 00:12:43,761
then you start looking at the degree of homology from that species to the kind of known microbes.

102
00:12:44,511 --> 00:12:51,861
So here's kind of a picture of the metagenomics, the kind of Illumina sequencing process that will come with that.

103
00:12:55,851 --> 00:13:03,260
So one of the challenges as we're having these very sequence based sampling and

104
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:08,421
identification pipelines is trying to figure out what these actually cost.

105
00:13:08,901 --> 00:13:18,051
And so on the left side of this slide is just kind of a roadmap as of things to be aware of as we are building our knowledge of the human virome.

106
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:27,411
And on the left map, on the left, you've got, you know, sampling, knowing where samples come from, both in geography and in the human body.

107
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:35,121
Doing some of these methods have enrichment steps, but getting sequence data kind of inform what we're doing.

108
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:41,031
Then we have to understand what proteins are being encoded by those sequences and what

109
00:13:41,031 --> 00:13:46,821
the type of genome organization and maybe larger structures around the genome might do,

110
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:53,211
and using classification to compare viruses to what's already known in the human biro.

111
00:13:54,171 --> 00:13:59,031
But it's really on the right side of this slide where epidemiology becomes very important

112
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:05,511
understanding both virus replication and protein expression as a way to understand

113
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:11,091
the antigenic targets and how that virus interacts with that body and how that virus may

114
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:15,801
actually be blocked by preexisting cross-reactive antibodies that we may already have.

115
00:14:17,061 --> 00:14:19,491
We also look for in situ detection.

116
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:26,721
So can we visualize this virus in different tissues, in different types of cells to try to understand what's where it's impacting?

117
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:35,751
And then can we develop antibody assays that help us understand how many people around the world have already been infected with this virus?

118
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:45,501
And these tools all together then will form the Initial Disease Association and prevalence studies that happen when a new virus is discovered.

119
00:14:48,571 --> 00:15:01,290
So there have been proposals that metagenomics should become the new you know, the new clinical testing that meets all needs,

120
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:06,201
because you can just put in a sample and you don't need much prior knowledge of what's there.

121
00:15:06,211 --> 00:15:14,311
You get everything back out of that sample. Some of the concerns with that that you'll recognize immediately as good

122
00:15:14,311 --> 00:15:23,011
epidemiologists is this this this concern about what happens when we start detecting

123
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:27,900
viruses at smaller and smaller and smaller quantities without determining whether

124
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:33,421
this is a replicating virus versus this is a presence of viral nucleic acid.

125
00:15:33,841 --> 00:15:39,421
I think one good example is GI samples and ingested genomic material.

126
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:46,681
You can ingest a pathogen that's not causing active replication but could be picked up by metagenomics.

127
00:15:47,131 --> 00:15:50,731
There's actually even happens in single host bodies.

128
00:15:50,731 --> 00:16:01,351
So, you know, it is possible to detect respiratory viruses, viruses and stool influenza, SARS-CoV-2, other viruses in stool.

129
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:08,111
And it's not because there are active replication processes happening in the in the GI tract.

130
00:16:08,131 --> 00:16:11,521
It's because we swallow those viruses and then they travel through us.

131
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:20,071
And so this is very useful knowledge from epidemiologic and public health perspective, because that's why wastewater sampling works.

132
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:24,301
But it's not useful knowledge if we're trying to figure out why somebody has GI illness

133
00:16:24,391 --> 00:16:29,131
and they have got influenza virus or they have SARS-CoV-2 detected from their stool,

134
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:33,991
it is likely coming from something else, not necessarily those pathogens.

135
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:43,800
Now, pathogenic viruses are often low quantity compared to a lot of other things that are in our body,

136
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:50,401
especially compared to phage and phage that may survive some of the depletion in enrichment

137
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:54,661
strategies that are used as part of these protocols and can really create an interfering signal.

138
00:16:56,611 --> 00:16:59,580
So I'm not going to go through this in detail,

139
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:05,431
but this is sort of a proposal of what that would look like and what the turnaround time would be to try

140
00:17:05,431 --> 00:17:14,461
to get to a place where it was random amplification based and and sequence based for clinical detection.

141
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:24,181
The proposal here has a six hour turnaround time for a nanopore based workflow and a 20 hour turnaround time for an Illumina based workflow.

142
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:35,161
So remember that when we first talked about viruses, we we specified that these are obligate intracellular parasites.

143
00:17:35,581 --> 00:17:42,541
So for some newly discovered viruses, however, we don't know the appropriate host host cell to culture of these viruses.

144
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:49,441
We know that they are obligated to sell their parasites, but we don't know either, don't know what cell they're able to infect,

145
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:56,821
or we don't have a culture system that can replicate that infection process in the lab in a way that we can study it.

146
00:17:57,871 --> 00:18:00,990
Unfortunately for us, Cox postulates,

147
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:07,710
which up until the genomic era was used to define whether a whether a pathogen

148
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:14,221
caused a disease depends on being able to use that virus in culture to study it.

149
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:24,931
So without being able to have a clean characterization of Cox Postulates, how do we know that a genomically identified virus actually causes disease?

150
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:30,811
So what we have here kind of introduced in the nineties was Fredrickson.

151
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:41,101
Roman proposed a revision to Cox Postulates that is specifically geared towards microbes that

152
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:51,601
were identified by their nucleic acids or viruses that are kind of characterized genomically.

153
00:18:52,081 --> 00:19:01,771
So a few of the key tenants of this include that you've got a nucleic acid that belongs to that pathogen,

154
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:05,580
and it is present in most cases of the infectious disease.

155
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:09,091
So that pathogen, the nucleic acid,

156
00:19:09,091 --> 00:19:16,651
should be found preferentially in the organs or gross anatomic sites known to be diseased and not in those organs that lack pathology.

157
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:23,701
You can see with this first one alone, this is sort of the tipping point with understanding the relationship between Zika virus and microcephaly.

158
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:32,851
Fewer or no copy now there is a pathogen associated. Nucleic acid sequences should be occur in hosts or tissues without disease.

159
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:39,811
Now, remember, this was proposed in the nineties and we've learned much,

160
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:44,851
much more about asymptomatic carriage of viruses since these were this was drafted.

161
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:49,410
And now it really becomes about fewer than no.

162
00:19:49,411 --> 00:19:54,271
So we expect to see higher viral loads in people with symptomatic disease than we do.

163
00:19:54,271 --> 00:20:01,710
And in people or in tissues without pathology or without symptomatic disease, with resolution of disease,

164
00:20:01,711 --> 00:20:13,051
the copy number of the viral load should become closer to undetectable or should decrease when in sequence copy number correlates with pathology,

165
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:22,351
particularly in a temporal way. So that sequence detection is the Sequence Disease Association.

166
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:29,671
When you've got it is more likely to be causal. When you've got a correlation between viral, viral load and the severity of disease,

167
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:40,201
the any sort of understanding that you have of the proteins that are produced by the virus or for instance,

168
00:20:41,221 --> 00:20:49,351
the viruses that are similar to it in the in the human viral should make sense with what you're seeing, what characteristics.

169
00:20:56,271 --> 00:21:05,661
Along these lines. There is also, you know, I think this this question of causation has been troublesome of viruses for a really long time.

170
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:16,011
And and this. I do also like this 1957, Hubert Hooper's Bill of Rights for Prevalent Viruses.

171
00:21:16,851 --> 00:21:22,430
This is adapted actually from an editorial that was written about a paper that I

172
00:21:22,431 --> 00:21:27,081
had written about a virus that had recently been discovered using genomic means,

173
00:21:27,261 --> 00:21:33,830
using random priming, but then ended up being so persistent for a long time that it was very difficult

174
00:21:33,831 --> 00:21:39,380
to determine what kind of causal relationship that virus had to disease,

175
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:45,261
because once kids were infected with it, they could be positive for it for months, two to over a year.

176
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:54,891
So Huebner proposed what he called the Bill of Rights for prevalent viruses and included things like being able to isolate a virus from a culture,

177
00:21:55,311 --> 00:22:04,191
repeated recovery of the virus, from human specimens, being able to view an antibody response to the virus and human being able to

178
00:22:04,191 --> 00:22:10,821
characterize and compare that virus with viruses that we know caused pathogenic disease,

179
00:22:11,961 --> 00:22:17,721
a constant and consistency of an association of a virus with a specific illness or case definition.

180
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:25,041
As we talked about for case definition matters, reproduction of a clinical illness and volunteer challenge studies,

181
00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:33,051
epidemiologic studies, and prevention of the disease by vaccinating against that pathogen.

182
00:22:33,711 --> 00:22:37,151
Now, number eight, this is we call this a vaccine probe study.

183
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:42,441
Sometimes we we have a vaccine against a pathogen and we know some of the clinical illness.

184
00:22:42,891 --> 00:22:50,361
And that clinical illness has has really supported the development of that in the rationale for the development of the vaccine.

185
00:22:50,781 --> 00:22:55,790
But we don't know the true extent of what that virus causes until we vaccinate against it.

186
00:22:55,791 --> 00:23:01,521
And then we can really see what burden the illness of that virus was causing the population.

187
00:23:01,731 --> 00:23:06,441
So that's what's called a vaccine probe study, and that's what's kind of being referred to by number eight.

188
00:23:07,491 --> 00:23:13,821
Now, I want to highlight for you number six, reproduction of clinical illness in volunteer challenge studies.

189
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:19,191
What does that mean? That means if you if you have a virus and you're not sure what it causes,

190
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:24,801
you can take a bunch of human volunteers and you give them that virus and you see what happens to them.

191
00:23:26,211 --> 00:23:29,781
This is where we are two weeks from now.

192
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:32,841
So next week raised, spend more time talking about emergence.

193
00:23:33,141 --> 00:23:38,871
After that, we're going to start talking about transmission. And I'm going to introduce you to the history of volunteer challenge studies.

194
00:23:39,411 --> 00:23:43,341
These studies actually, they're not as common as they used to be, but they still happen to this day.

195
00:23:43,431 --> 00:23:47,210
And we're going to talk about what we can learn about transmission and what we

196
00:23:47,211 --> 00:23:51,801
haven't learned about transmission by by studying volunteer challenge studies.

197
00:23:51,831 --> 00:24:03,141
So that's a coming attraction. And with that, that closes this lecture for module seven and we will pick up this topic next week.

198
00:24:03,531 --> 00:24:04,281
Thank you very much.
