1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,040
Today, we're gonna introduce you to the action reflection.

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,274
It's very different than the previous types of reflections we've talked about in

3
00:00:16,274 --> 00:00:16,792
the course.

4
00:00:16,792 --> 00:00:19,041
The action reflection is moving forward.

5
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:23,095
The action reflection includes what you might wanna do about this,

6
00:00:23,095 --> 00:00:26,840
not just how you feel about it.

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,064
The key to the action reflection, it's still a statement that ends in

8
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:35,145
the downturn is that it includes some potential change in thought or

9
00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:40,340
action that will help the person move towards change.

10
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,840
Now let's take a look at a few action reflections from our BMI 2 study.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,121
>> We have tried to reduce the amount of television that she watches but

12
00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:51,632
it has not gone so well.

13
00:00:51,632 --> 00:00:56,443
I mean in the morning I get up, I take a shower, I get dressed,

14
00:00:56,443 --> 00:01:01,071
I make some breakfast, and I usually allow her to watch TV so

15
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:04,640
that I can give myself some free time.

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,459
Now maybe in the afternoon, it may work better because then I

17
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:14,240
can get her involved in an art or music project.

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,777
>> Okay, so

19
00:01:14,777 --> 00:01:20,140
getting her involved in something creative in the afternoon might be an option?

20
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,740
>> Yes.

21
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,040
>> I think if she exercises more, I think it's gonna happen.

22
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,072
>> And I think that now that you seem to have found something that

23
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:32,936
might be possible if you could use the treadmill, you say it's downstairs,

24
00:01:32,936 --> 00:01:35,157
it just needs to be put down into usable way.

25
00:01:35,157 --> 00:01:37,494
>> Into a usable way and plugged in.

26
00:01:37,494 --> 00:01:42,452
>> So you can see doing something in the afternoon is a specific action step that

27
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:47,940
mom could take, that Dr. Sarah put into her reflective statement.

28
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,331
Now you may say aren't these really unsolicited advice?

29
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:53,770
Isn't this really against the MI principle?

30
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,040
And the answer is no.

31
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,540
So what differentiates action reflections from unsolicited advice is that

32
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,139
it's based upon what the person just said,

33
00:02:03,139 --> 00:02:06,947
because in my we don't give unsolicited advice or very rarely.

34
00:02:06,947 --> 00:02:11,008
When we say it's based on what they said, you should be able to introduce your

35
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:14,333
action reflection with given what you've said or given that.

36
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:18,509
If that doesn't make sense, then it's probably not an action reflection.

37
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:22,432
Now notice also in addition to given what you've said,

38
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:25,111
look at the tone on those bottom five.

39
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:29,519
They're tentative tone there, might, maybe.

40
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:32,676
We're gonna use that just like we did when reflecting readiness.

41
00:02:32,676 --> 00:02:35,611
We're gonna undershoot, we're not gonna over promise.

42
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:38,540
We're gonna under promise.

43
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,731
Now, when understanding action reflections,

44
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:44,307
we have to go back to basic psychology.

45
00:02:44,307 --> 00:02:46,840
There's two schools of thought.

46
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,746
The action school behavior therapy, act our way into a new way of thinking, and

47
00:02:50,746 --> 00:02:53,019
then there's a cognitive school of thought,

48
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:55,640
think your way into a new way of acting.

49
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:02,052
Perhaps that better, there's do and be and they're different pathways to change.

50
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:04,431
In MI, we're agnostic.

51
00:03:04,431 --> 00:03:07,560
We use both the do goal, we do the be goal.

52
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,540
We will reflect both changes in action and changes in thought.

53
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,690
What do we mean?

54
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,743
Some classic do would be stopping smoking, exercising more,

55
00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:18,581
or taking your medication.

56
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:23,940
Those are clearly actions that you have to do to achieve.

57
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,515
But then we'll also be reflecting changes in thought or

58
00:03:26,515 --> 00:03:30,050
being differently about something, being more relaxed about something.

59
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,140
Thinking about it differently.

60
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,503
For example, giving yourself credit for some of the low grade physical activity

61
00:03:36,503 --> 00:03:41,240
you do like walking to still count that towards your physical activity tally.

62
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,150
Don't think about things all or nothing.

63
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,089
So if you have a glass of wine after saying that you're gonna become absent, if

64
00:03:47,089 --> 00:03:51,343
you have a cigarette, don't catastrophize and say you've completely relapsed.

65
00:03:51,343 --> 00:03:55,080
Learn to laugh it off, be more chill, give it some perspective.

66
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,974
Those are all cognitive or be goals.

67
00:03:58,974 --> 00:04:09,182
So let's take a look at how we could use action reflections.

68
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:13,740
Take a look at the client's statement.

69
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,180
Now, let's see if we can use the structure we talked about earlier.

70
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,481
Given what you said, blank and blank might be an option.

71
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:26,070
Notice we're still using that tentative tone, might be an option.

72
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,140
We've been using that for several weeks now.

73
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,940
So here's what the reflections might look like.

74
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,941
So, given what you've said, if you could find a way to reduce

75
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:38,980
the withdrawal symptoms, you might be more willing to quit.

76
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,600
That's sort of a cognitive shift.

77
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,760
That's sort of a be change, okay?

78
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,961
If you could anticipate that you'll be able to handle withdrawal.

79
00:04:47,961 --> 00:04:50,507
If you have more efficacy or if you had a solution to that,

80
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:52,640
you might be more willing to quit.

81
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,870
Now let's get into more of an action step.

82
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,673
So if you could find something to reduce your cravings or edginess or hunger,

83
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,321
that might be of interest to you.

84
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:05,719
Now you can see how that's sort of inching them towards perhaps medication.

85
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:10,059
Here, in fact, is a whole bunch of action reflections that could have been generated

86
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:13,540
in response to that client statement.

87
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,785
Now you've already seen the first two, now let's go to the third one,

88
00:05:16,785 --> 00:05:18,311
a little bit more specific here.

89
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:22,221
So a medicine to reduce your craving might be worth talking about.

90
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:27,293
Now in terms of that annoyance of people commenting, to handle that, you might

91
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:32,306
wanna invert their barrier and sort of take it and make lemonade out of lemons.

92
00:05:32,306 --> 00:05:36,834
And say, well, if you didn't tell everyone about your quitting, maybe that will

93
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:40,326
reduce that barrier or only talk to the people you really trust or

94
00:05:40,326 --> 00:05:45,340
inform people what's helpful or not helpful for them to comment.

95
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,421
You could even reframe what you're thinking about their comments rather

96
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:53,040
as annoyance but maybe think of them as they're just trying to help you.

97
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,496
So these are all ways that we can use the action reflection to do actions and

98
00:05:58,496 --> 00:06:03,040
cognitions to move them towards quitting.

99
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,260
Okay, let's take a look at another case.

100
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,607
Now you just saw a version of this with Dr. Sarah, so it's similar to that but

101
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:18,210
we're gonna deconstruct it a little bit more now.

102
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:24,100
So what's the action steps that we could reflect?

103
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,490
So here's the action reflections you can use with this mom.

104
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,238
So first of all,

105
00:06:28,238 --> 00:06:32,240
we can cross off the morning cuz she doesn't feel that's negotiable.

106
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,420
And specifically we might want to reflect.

107
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,068
Getting her more involved in something creative or more physically active in

108
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:43,140
the afternoon, it sounds like something that might pay to talk about.

109
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,261
Now notice we've crossed out that bottom one, art is the way to go.

110
00:06:46,261 --> 00:06:47,011
What's wrong with that?

111
00:06:47,011 --> 00:06:52,699
Why is that not consistent with the approach we've been trying to develop?

112
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,410
And I think you figured it out.

113
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,421
It's too definitive.

114
00:06:55,421 --> 00:06:56,341
It's too limiting.

115
00:06:56,341 --> 00:06:59,700
It's absent that tentative tone.

116
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,820
It's absent that autonomy supportive tone.

117
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,740
It's too directive, it's too definitive.

118
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,440
Now, let's look at one more case.

119
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,881
Here's a woman struggling with her weight, she wants to do something about it,

120
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:20,468
but she's a little stuck.

121
00:07:20,468 --> 00:07:21,464
Okay, you've read it.

122
00:07:21,464 --> 00:07:22,347
What would you do here?

123
00:07:22,347 --> 00:07:34,713
What would be an action reflection or two or three that you could do with her?

124
00:07:34,713 --> 00:07:37,233
Well, let's see.

125
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:40,124
So if you could find a gym with members that are more like you,

126
00:07:40,124 --> 00:07:43,925
with whom you might feel more comfortable, that might be worth talking about,

127
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:45,584
that might be a better fit for you.

128
00:07:45,584 --> 00:07:52,729
Or perhaps exercising outside of the gym, maybe in your house or maybe even outside.

129
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:55,821
What this case introduces is something that has been implicit in

130
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:58,924
what we've been talking about but now let's make it explicit.

131
00:07:58,924 --> 00:08:02,893
When you reflect action steps, be it the do type or

132
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:06,781
the be type, try to give them multiple options.

133
00:08:06,781 --> 00:08:09,430
Try and build a menu, do this or this or this.

134
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,519
Any of those are fine, build a little menu.

135
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:17,640
So that concludes our practice in constructing action reflections.

136
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,496
We've shown you what they are,

137
00:08:19,496 --> 00:08:24,090
how they're more forward looking than traditional emotional reflections.

138
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:27,630
The importance of using tentative language in your action reflections.

139
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,790
Building options or choice in your action reflections and

140
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,891
letting the person feel that they're grabbing onto it.

141
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:35,720
They're getting excited about it.

142
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,885
You're just sort of planting the seed.
