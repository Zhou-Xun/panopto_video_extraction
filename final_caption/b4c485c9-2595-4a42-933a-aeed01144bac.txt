1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,180
Frederique Laubepin: that's totally fine Emily, thank you for the, thank you for the heads up.

2
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,840
Frederique Laubepin: And, before I dive into.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,010
Frederique Laubepin: into the sort of a presentation piece we're going to start with a little.

4
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:35,070
Frederique Laubepin: With a little exercise and i'm going to ask you to take a you know, a minute or two to read through this assignment.

5
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,880
Frederique Laubepin: it's a social sciences.

6
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,690
Frederique Laubepin: assignment but take a minute to read through it and then I have some questions for you.

7
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,870
Frederique Laubepin: And if you're able when you're done give me a thumbs up just so I know you're done reading.

8
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,310
Frederique Laubepin: Excellent so and wrong, are you good.

9
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:47,220
Frederique Laubepin: Okay, so um this is pretty typical as far as you know, the type of the assignment that we give just a you know, a list of.

10
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,110
Frederique Laubepin: tasks for people to you know for students to complete what would you say is the purpose of this assignment.

11
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:12,270
Emily Martin: i'm actually a bit, and so I have you know, like if I was a student reading, though this, I think the purpose would be for me to like figure out what I wanted to do when I.

12
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:28,860
Emily Martin: grow up, but I think if it assigning this assignment trying to like project and figure out what the faculty members trying to get out of this is probably trying to figure out like trying to get them to do get them to write and practice interviewing skills.

13
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,020
Emily Martin: would be my guess.

14
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:41,040
Frederique Laubepin: yeah so it's actually not all that easy to decipher the actual purpose of the assignment right, so there is this piece about helping students.

15
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:53,790
Frederique Laubepin: You know, to figure out what they want to what they want to do, but there's all this other stuff that's lumped into the assignment as well and it's not very clear it's not made clear to the students, you know what the.

16
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:09,510
Frederique Laubepin: You know if there is a primary purpose to this assignment what that might be so Emily as you were as you were mentioning there's a number of things that they're being asked to do so, what are some of the skills that students will practice in this assignment.

17
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:23,610
Scott Roberts: Emily mentioned interview skills within that also you know formulation of questions to be part of an interview guide.

18
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:36,510
Frederique Laubepin: yeah so so something to you know pay attention to us, you know it's not just like the you know the skills that will be practicing but some of these are compound skills right so.

19
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:45,300
Frederique Laubepin: You know there's a lot of stuff going on inside those skills so interviewing is not just interviewing it's you know.

20
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:58,020
Frederique Laubepin: understanding what questions to ask and how to ask mom and you know what might be an appropriate question for what person, for example, what are some of the other skills that they have to practice.

21
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,690
Frederique Laubepin: In this assignment.

22
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:07,290
Andrew Brouwer: I mean, they have to call the email professional and be able to do that.

23
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,720
Andrew Brouwer: professionally and in a way that actually secure as an interview.

24
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:13,710
yeah.

25
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:30,030
Frederique Laubepin: So we're already had like you know, probably, you know i'm trying to count I don't know if you can see my video right but trying to like count on my fingers that are like the number of the number of skills, but you know we're probably already had more than four what else.

26
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:45,450
Scott Roberts: I mean come out this exactly applies here, but it's an intro social sciences course and it's but it's kind of presuming they have a defined perspective.

27
00:04:46,140 --> 00:05:03,480
Scott Roberts: Academic discipline and that they know how to identify who is an expert in that area and that might be a challenge if someone's pretty early on there's so so much they don't know about you know how I can make disciplines so many some some fields to them.

28
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:14,160
Frederique Laubepin: yeah absolutely so they you know they have to practice some skills, but they you know, this is also assuming a certain understanding or knowledge about the field.

29
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,790
Frederique Laubepin: Absolutely, what else.

30
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,380
Frederique Laubepin: transcription.

31
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,160
Frederique Laubepin: Trying to uh huh technical skills.

32
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:37,080
Frederique Laubepin: I mean associated with this right they they also have to know how to use audio video equipment right so it's not just transcribing what they've recorded have to understand how to get a recording in the first place.

33
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,900
Andrew Brouwer: Then there's synthesis and reflection.

34
00:05:47,550 --> 00:06:00,960
Frederique Laubepin: Exactly yeah so there's there's a whole bunch of stuff going on in this particular assignment, are you able to tell just by looking at this assignment.

35
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,890
Frederique Laubepin: What are the top two or three skills that students should be practicing.

36
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:25,560
Andrew Brouwer: not really I think I mean I think so like if I look at this i'm like the goal is to interview and reflect in writing.

37
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,160
Frederique Laubepin: yeah um it's.

38
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:41,400
Frederique Laubepin: We don't we don't necessarily know whether that would be right uh we we have a certain we have a certain ability to read.

39
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:56,910
Frederique Laubepin: assignment right we come with a certain experience right a student may not have that ability to parse on assignment so to them, it may be really difficult to you know to distinguish between sort of.

40
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:13,080
Frederique Laubepin: You know what is the, what are the top tasks in there, what are the top skills they're supposed to be practicing because it's sort of this laundry list of you know, things they have to they have to do.

41
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,390
Frederique Laubepin: So the tasks are pretty well delineated right it's you know they're outlined in.

42
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:37,920
Frederique Laubepin: In the steps over here, but the you know the overall purpose of the assignment and sort of what the you know what the students should be focusing on the most is not necessarily clear how it is you know they're doing a good job with this assignment.

43
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,080
Andrew Brouwer: i'll definitely say that how this is going to be evaluated is not clear.

44
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:56,850
Frederique Laubepin: Right there's there's no information on this right no grading criteria, no sort of guidelines in terms of how to do this well no examples of you know what maybe.

45
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,730
Frederique Laubepin: You know, good.

46
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:10,560
Frederique Laubepin: submissions or not so great submissions so the reason i'm using this example to.

47
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:19,200
Frederique Laubepin: You know, to start this presentation about transparent assignment design is because this is fairly typical of the kind of stuff that we give.

48
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:27,840
Frederique Laubepin: To our students right, so the questions will vary depending on the on the discipline but basically.

49
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:44,280
Frederique Laubepin: You know, we give them a handout it has some steps of things they need to do, and we sort of assume that that's you know that's going to be enough for them to do a good job on the assignment, but we often.

50
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:56,820
Frederique Laubepin: we're often disappointed in with students turn in and sometimes puzzled that you know, even though we've outlined all the steps they still missed the purpose of the assignment so.

51
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,600
i'm.

52
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,280
Frederique Laubepin: Just a second so.

53
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:23,700
Frederique Laubepin: i'm going to give you a or talk about a framework called transparent assignment design that helps the instructor to make the purpose of the assignment more transparent to the students and helps the students do better on the assignments, as a result.

54
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,380
Frederique Laubepin: Alright, so we did that so there's.

55
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:40,440
Frederique Laubepin: there's more access to higher education than ever before right it's more and more people are able to.

56
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:50,520
Frederique Laubepin: To get a you know, an education than before, but we often confuse this with equity of experience, which is not actually.

57
00:09:51,090 --> 00:10:09,030
Frederique Laubepin: The case right so equity of access doesn't necessarily mean equity of experience, and we have students coming in from all kinds of backgrounds, with all kinds of preparation some students will come in having practice this.

58
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:17,250
Frederique Laubepin: skill of parsing assignments so, even though the instructions may not be super clear they're able to sort of.

59
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:24,360
Frederique Laubepin: You know, read between the lines and figure out what the instructor wants, and then we also have students coming in, who have not had.

60
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:36,630
Frederique Laubepin: You know this practice or this training and they you know they don't come in with an ability to read our minds and understand what it is that we want them to do.

61
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,170
Frederique Laubepin: there's quite a bit of.

62
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:47,910
Frederique Laubepin: evidence that transparency, improve student success and i'm not going to get into you know sort of the the literature on this.

63
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:59,700
Frederique Laubepin: But transparency basically improves success or Sue now comes through two mechanisms one by improving or increasing their academic confidence.

64
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:12,390
Frederique Laubepin: And the second mechanism is by improving their sense of belonging and both of those are related to indicators of student success like persistence and grades.

65
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:22,650
Frederique Laubepin: What the research on transparent assignment design, which is a specific way to to improve transparency in courses.

66
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:36,780
Frederique Laubepin: Is the research shows that when a course implements a transparent assignment design the gains for students are equitable, so it benefits everybody.

67
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:46,620
Frederique Laubepin: And what's really interesting is that it's their enduring so you might be implementing transparent Simon design in your course, but the students will continue to benefit.

68
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:56,700
Frederique Laubepin: From that even after your courses over right as they continue through the through the curriculum, perhaps even more importantly.

69
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:16,080
Frederique Laubepin: What it shows is that the the gains are even more significant for the people who, basically, you know might need it, the most for students from underserved populations, so it benefits everybody, but it benefits those students, even more, which is something that.

70
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,610
Frederique Laubepin: You know, is great to see, and if that's something we can implement, then we should.

71
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:36,510
Frederique Laubepin: it's also you know if you were a part of the resilient teaching efforts, a couple years ago and you've seen this trauma informed pedagogy.

72
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:44,310
Frederique Laubepin: kind of framework but transparency is also an important component of this trauma informed pedagogy.

73
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:58,650
Frederique Laubepin: And it feeds into some of the other components of the of this framework, because you know of course that's more transparent, is also going to be is also going to increase the sense of safety for students.

74
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:23,340
Frederique Laubepin: it's going to increase the sense of collaboration and mutuality and we'll talk a little bit about how that might happen as well, as you know, the dimension of empowerment voice and choice so it's it's a an important framework and a very beneficial framework on several different levels.

75
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:37,170
Frederique Laubepin: it's i'm not going to get into all the details of these different components, but transparent instruction has a number of benefits that are outlined here.

76
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:49,380
Frederique Laubepin: Perhaps one of the most important ones is that improves metacognition meaning it helps students to reflect on their own thinking to think about their own learning.

77
00:13:51,060 --> 00:14:01,860
Frederique Laubepin: And there's a ton of research in the teaching and learning that shows that metacognition is hugely important, you know as far as a learning goes.

78
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:14,130
Frederique Laubepin: It helps students see how we structure learning so instead of being this black box, where we you know sort of tv's you know just trust me, I know you know I know how to you know.

79
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:29,820
Frederique Laubepin: Teach you this content, it helps the students to see a little bit into our you know thinking processes and and understand why we're asking them to do things in a certain way or.

80
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:42,300
Frederique Laubepin: You know, on a certain timeline it encourages self monitoring and like I said it equalizes the playing field so now there.

81
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:58,920
Frederique Laubepin: there's a lot less of a difference between you know students who come in with disability to parson assignment and students who come in, not having that ability so everybody's kind of starting at the same level.

82
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:11,640
Frederique Laubepin: We you know in this workshop we're going to talk mostly about transparent assignment design so we're going to focus on, you know the assignment piece of.

83
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:21,360
Frederique Laubepin: Your course but there's a number of ways that you could increase transparency in the course and apply a similar you know framework.

84
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:39,870
Frederique Laubepin: You know, in other places in the course and One of those is in the syllabus, so this is an example just an example of a syllabus clearly and you know art is art history where there's an effort to outline for the students, you know what the skills.

85
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,800
Frederique Laubepin: are going to be the, the purpose of.

86
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:54,600
Frederique Laubepin: The different things that will happen in the course so it can be included in the syllabus sort of in in this way, or you could.

87
00:15:55,050 --> 00:16:03,840
Frederique Laubepin: Create sort of a matrix of the assignments in your course and the you know the different competencies and show students, you know how.

88
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:21,360
Frederique Laubepin: You know their assignments mapped onto the course competencies and you can clearly see in this particular example that as time goes on, right as the Semester goes on the complexity of the competencies increases right, so they start with fairly.

89
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:31,080
Frederique Laubepin: You know, low level kind of kind of stuff so use of you know, information technology and they earned with reflective.

90
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:46,020
Frederique Laubepin: You know evaluator you know critical thinking skills, so it can also show the students of how they're progressing in the in the course in terms of you know, getting deeper into things or.

91
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,150
Frederique Laubepin: You know.

92
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,590
Frederique Laubepin: Going farther towards mastering.

93
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,760
Frederique Laubepin: You know the the competencies in the class are the skills.

94
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,060
Frederique Laubepin: That you want them to gain.

95
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:15,990
Frederique Laubepin: So i'm like I said, if you're interested in in other ways of you know infusing transparency in your course we can you know feel free to send me an email or put in a ticket i'm happy to have.

96
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:27,510
Frederique Laubepin: conversations about this, as I mentioned we're going to be primarily talking about assignment design because that's a very easy place where we can.

97
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:37,440
Frederique Laubepin: make some small changes and have a big impact on the student experience and their outcomes, so what is transparent assignment design.

98
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:47,790
Frederique Laubepin: it's basically a systematic way to make it explicit to the student what the purpose the task and the criteria of the assignment is.

99
00:17:48,180 --> 00:18:00,210
Frederique Laubepin: Right, all within with the intention to promote student learning so it's really not rocket science, but it's something that we don't take the time to do and as a result.

100
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,610
Frederique Laubepin: We know students performance suffers.

101
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:15,660
Frederique Laubepin: The the whole purpose of it is to help them understand how and why they're learning.

102
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:34,140
Frederique Laubepin: content in particular ways right so like I said earlier, it's sort of like you know unpacking this black box that we're presenting to them, you know and helping them to understand why the course is structured or certain way, why they're learning certain things and how they're.

103
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,420
Frederique Laubepin: Learning them.

104
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,410
Frederique Laubepin: It has three components.

105
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,600
Frederique Laubepin: You know purpose task and criteria and.

106
00:18:46,830 --> 00:19:00,990
Frederique Laubepin: This is this is what's involved in clarifying each of them so clarifying the, the purpose of the assignment involves making it making explicit what knowledge, the assignment.

107
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:11,790
Frederique Laubepin: Is tapping so if we go back to the the social sciences assignment, for example as Scott mentioned, there is an assumption that.

108
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,220
Frederique Laubepin: The students have.

109
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:21,300
Frederique Laubepin: A certain knowledge about the you know their field but that's not explicit in the assignment.

110
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:35,010
Frederique Laubepin: If you wanted to make that assignment more explicit you would make that you know that assumption explicit right the the fact that they will need to leverage their knowledge of the field.

111
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:44,100
Frederique Laubepin: or they will be applying their knowledge of the field in this assignment it's also making the the skills that they will be using.

112
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:58,950
Frederique Laubepin: explicit and a piece that we almost never see and in assignments, is what is the relevance to students lives right, why should they care so we write a grant, we have to.

113
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:07,980
Frederique Laubepin: You know, we have to you know explain to the agencies that have why this matters, why should anyone care about this research question.

114
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:23,160
Frederique Laubepin: But we never do this with the students right, so how is this, whatever your assignment is, how is this relevant to their lives, right now, a students to their lives later as professionals, how does this, how does this matter.

115
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:30,330
Frederique Laubepin: And you know if you wanted to think about it a slightly different way.

116
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:42,240
Frederique Laubepin: You could think you know, in five years, you know, five years after taking my course what knowledge, should the students have retained from doing this.

117
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:54,360
Frederique Laubepin: exercise this assignment what skills, should they be able to perform from doing this assignment and why are those important, so you know if you're teaching.

118
00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:00,240
Frederique Laubepin: A more technical course like I don't know you're teaching statistics or.

119
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,850
Frederique Laubepin: You know, people are doing.

120
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:19,830
Frederique Laubepin: You know statistical analyses using SAS or SATA or are, or whatever you know how does this matter how you know will those skills benefit them in their professional lives, assuming, you know, five years after taking your course, for example.

121
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,180
Frederique Laubepin: You know what you know why does this matter in.

122
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,520
Frederique Laubepin: You know more.

123
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,940
Frederique Laubepin: You know of courses that are more like maybe it's big.

124
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:43,320
Frederique Laubepin: You know how are the you know the the knowledge and the skills involved in I don't know Designing an intervention, for example, like how.

125
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:48,450
Frederique Laubepin: How is that important, how will that benefit dumb down the line.

126
00:21:49,890 --> 00:22:00,660
Frederique Laubepin: The second step is to clarify the order to make sure that the task is explicit, so we do usually pretty well with this as far as the at least the first.

127
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:12,060
Frederique Laubepin: component goes right, so the productive steps to follow we're usually pretty good at saying you know you have to do this, that and the other thing what we almost never do is.

128
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:19,680
Frederique Laubepin: talk to them about the counterproductive steps to avoid right there's this sort of assumption that.

129
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:29,610
Frederique Laubepin: They need to figure this out for themselves, we don't want to spoon feed them.

130
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:38,100
Frederique Laubepin: You know I don't wanna I don't want to you know, give them everything, but what we often.

131
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,190
Frederique Laubepin: I don't know don't don't do very well as think about.

132
00:22:48,480 --> 00:23:01,290
Frederique Laubepin: You know what are productive ways to struggle and what are unproductive ways for students to struggle right, so there are things that they might struggle with that are really unproductive.

133
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:22,890
Frederique Laubepin: And if that's the case then that's not we should we shouldn't put them through that right that's not something, and we should then make sure that this is outline that we you know, keep them from struggling unproductively or in unproductive directions and then there are other.

134
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,480
Frederique Laubepin: Areas where maybe we do want them to.

135
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,940
Frederique Laubepin: You know, to.

136
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:40,830
Frederique Laubepin: Think through for themselves, you know some aspect of something and so it's really important when we think about this to think about.

137
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:50,970
Frederique Laubepin: Is this really a productive struggle, or is that going to be an unproductive struggle, I know if that's the case, then I should really try to avoid you know sending them down that path, Andrew.

138
00:23:52,170 --> 00:24:05,700
Andrew Brouwer: yeah thanks i'm the, this is a little bit abstract you have like a concrete example of what you know how you might discuss counterproductive steps to avoid.

139
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:15,390
Frederique Laubepin: So this will vary depending on what your assignment is about, but I could imagine that.

140
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:27,240
Frederique Laubepin: I don't know in a statistics class, for example, or some you know something where you want them to do some kind of calculation if the goal is not to have them.

141
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:38,910
Frederique Laubepin: write code, for example, you just want them to you know, be able to you know run some code and look at some results and analyze those results.

142
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:52,920
Frederique Laubepin: Then, having them struggle with the writing of the code is not going to it that's that's a not a productive struggle right on the other hand, if the classes about coding.

143
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:59,520
Frederique Laubepin: Then you know that's a completely different story right so sometimes.

144
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:13,140
Frederique Laubepin: There are things that that students really struggle with that are like you know something they need to do in order to complete the assignment but it's not really like the focus of the assignment.

145
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:19,230
Frederique Laubepin: Right, and you know figuring out to like what those are.

146
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:32,490
Frederique Laubepin: That might be, you know that people might be stumbling upon and and then saying hey you know fyi here's the you know here's the Code, the code is not what you need to be.

147
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:40,620
Frederique Laubepin: struggling with the you know what i'm interested in is your ability to run this analysis and analyze.

148
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:50,400
Frederique Laubepin: The results right so when you run the code and you get your output, are you able to interpret the results correctly right.

149
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:57,360
Frederique Laubepin: So one is you know struggling with writing the code and maybe you know you're like.

150
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:05,070
Frederique Laubepin: I don't know, I made a mistake somewhere on my code isn't working, and you know, and then I can't get to the analysis but doesn't unproductive.

151
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:13,920
Frederique Laubepin: struggle in this particular case now if it's a coding class and they're learning how to actually code then that's a completely different story does it help.

152
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:29,220
Andrew Brouwer: I think so, I guess, maybe I you know I can think of like specific instances where I maybe I want to use this but i'm having trouble imagining that, like all of my assignments would have some counterproductive steps is this is this envisioned as kind of.

153
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:33,630
Andrew Brouwer: Like typical or, you know as needed.

154
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:41,310
Frederique Laubepin: No, I think it's as needed right because and it's it's based on your experience with you know what have you seen students.

155
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:55,710
Frederique Laubepin: struggle with in the past and and was that a productive struggle, or was it not productive and if it wasn't, then you know how can you how can you eliminate that or lessen it so that they can actually focus on on the real.

156
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,090
Frederique Laubepin: You know the real focus of the assignment right.

157
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:10,980
Andrew Brouwer: So for the the interview assignment, you might say, you know don't struggle with typing the entire transcript by hand start from the you know transcribed like.

158
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:11,970
Frederique Laubepin: audio exactly.

159
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,670
Andrew Brouwer: Okay, thanks yeah.

160
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,240
Andrew Brouwer: yeah.

161
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:22,770
Frederique Laubepin: Are you creating you know you could say here here are like three different tools, you could use to transcribe your you know to transcribe your interview.

162
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:38,550
Frederique Laubepin: You know, and then you, you know you might want to clean it up, but sort of you know so identifying you know what might be stumbling blocks for the students and then you know and sometimes you do want them to.

163
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:50,940
Frederique Laubepin: You know you do want them to struggle through some some stuff right, so I don't know if you're asking them to think about designing a study to address a particular research question they have.

164
00:27:51,510 --> 00:28:03,180
Frederique Laubepin: You don't necessarily want to give them all this stuff's because you know some of the things that they will need to do as a professional is trying to figure out to their like what should their sampling size be what should there you know.

165
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:21,930
Frederique Laubepin: You know, is it longitudinal as a cross sectional is it you know, like whatever so um it all depends on on what you're trying to do, and sometimes the struggle is part of the you know developing some professional skills or applying something that they've learned.

166
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,420
Frederique Laubepin: But good question.

167
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:40,620
Frederique Laubepin: Okay, and then the last piece, which is also often missing from our assignments is the criteria So what are the criteria for success in this.

168
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:53,400
Frederique Laubepin: You know in this assignment, how would a student know as they're doing the assignment that they're they're actually meeting the you know your expectations that they can be successful.

169
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:04,890
Frederique Laubepin: And something that you can also include is examples from real life work right, so if you've taught this class before.

170
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:13,230
Frederique Laubepin: But you have some assignments from you know previous years that you could show you know anonymized and everything, obviously, but.

171
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:21,900
Frederique Laubepin: As and discuss, possibly with your students right what made that a great assignment what made that a not so great.

172
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:33,810
Frederique Laubepin: submission, for example, to to further help them understand you know what they need to do in order to be successful in this in this assignment.

173
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:46,200
Frederique Laubepin: So the the transparent as i'm in design framework has these three components clarifying the purpose the task, the criteria there's a fourth one that is not.

174
00:29:47,070 --> 00:30:00,120
Frederique Laubepin: You know, officially part of the framework but that's transparency itself and that's a piece, where you actually asked the students to reflect on the transparency of the assignment right you ask them for feedback right.

175
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:06,450
Frederique Laubepin: Are you able to tell the purpose, are you able to tell the task, do you know what, what do you need to do in order to be successful.

176
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:20,430
Frederique Laubepin: In this assignment so that's that's a little bit of a Meta step that you could include a few if you wanted to but it's it's not the first three or the, the most important ones.

177
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:40,530
Frederique Laubepin: So let's look at a quick example so i'm Just to give you a little bit of a little background, so this is public health five or eight the example i'm going to show you is you know the five or eight version in the online mph Program.

178
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,820
Frederique Laubepin: And this is a class that was developed by Clio Caldwell.

179
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:55,770
Frederique Laubepin: She had this assignment, which is called a proposed social determinants of health structural intervention it's scaffolding.

180
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:08,430
Frederique Laubepin: So it's in four parts, the students do you know, the first pick a topic, and then they keep on adding to the assignment until they have a you know their proposed structural intervention.

181
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,600
Frederique Laubepin: And we have.

182
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:20,580
Frederique Laubepin: And if you just give me one second i'm going to actually grab the link and put it in.

183
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,900
Frederique Laubepin: In the chat for you, so you can.

184
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,510
Frederique Laubepin: Go to the document directly.

185
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:43,110
Frederique Laubepin: So for this year we we applied a transparent assignment design framework to this assignment.

186
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:51,330
Frederique Laubepin: And we're also adding a peer review component to the assignment.

187
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,850
Frederique Laubepin: That hopefully will.

188
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:06,210
Frederique Laubepin: Help us with the transparency as well and you'll see in a in a minute what I mean by this so um this used to be.

189
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:12,630
Frederique Laubepin: You know, basically, you know you need what you need to do in this.

190
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:27,960
Frederique Laubepin: In this assignment is you know design propose a structural intervention that addresses a public health disparity of the students choosing right so that was.

191
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,850
Frederique Laubepin: That was the hell, the assignment was.

192
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:39,810
Frederique Laubepin: was framed before So you can see that already we've made the purpose.

193
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:45,570
Frederique Laubepin: Or you know we've tried to make the purpose, a lot more explicit.

194
00:32:46,740 --> 00:33:00,060
Frederique Laubepin: and especially sort of you know, making it clear that up sorry highlighting the wrong piece, so the primary purpose is for them to apply their knowledge of social determinants of health.

195
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,120
Frederique Laubepin: To an issue that's.

196
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:13,110
Frederique Laubepin: You know of their own choosing that's of interest to them and design a or propose a structural intervention.

197
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:26,070
Frederique Laubepin: And that they're also going to practice some professional skills in terms of giving and receiving quality feedback as part of this assignment.

198
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,680
Frederique Laubepin: we've outlined.

199
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,060
Frederique Laubepin: What knowledge, the students will need to apply.

200
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:35,280
Frederique Laubepin: In this assignment.

201
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:40,620
Frederique Laubepin: As well as the skills they will be practicing.

202
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:45,780
Frederique Laubepin: You know, as part of doing the assignment.

203
00:33:47,220 --> 00:34:01,620
Frederique Laubepin: And then the test, so this is a little long because, like I said the the assignment of scaffolding it's in four parts, so this explains what they need to do for every part of the assignment.

204
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:15,030
Frederique Laubepin: And then we included grading rubric as well, which explains to them, you know what doing well on this assignment and tails.

205
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:24,870
Frederique Laubepin: The piece, that is so, besides applying a transmitter site design framework, as I mentioned, we also.

206
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:36,600
Frederique Laubepin: Including included a a peer review aspect to this assignment in were using critic, which is a tool, what we are piloting.

207
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:45,900
Frederique Laubepin: The this you know this coming fall if that's something that you're ever interested in in your classes doing peer reviews.

208
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:56,730
Frederique Laubepin: But the way critic works is the students will first go through a calibration assignment and to do the calibration assignment I.

209
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:06,120
Frederique Laubepin: am giving them three assignments from past courses one stellar assignment one stellar submission.

210
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:13,290
Frederique Laubepin: One that you know student who did okay sort of like bb plus.

211
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:22,440
Frederique Laubepin: level submission and one submission of a student who completely missed the mark on this assignment and.

212
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:35,040
Frederique Laubepin: I agree to the assignments in critic and the students will read through them, and it will assess them as well right, so they will be exposed to.

213
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:48,210
Frederique Laubepin: Examples of you know, great work sort of like middle of the road, you know quality work, as well as you know, work that didn't meet the standards.

214
00:35:48,810 --> 00:36:03,090
Frederique Laubepin: Of the assignment so on top of having the the assignment rubric they're also seeing examples and evaluating them for themselves right, so they get to see what.

215
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,640
Frederique Laubepin: You know they get to.

216
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:11,820
Frederique Laubepin: deepen their understanding of what doing well, and this assignment by look like.

217
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:13,890
A real.

218
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,980
Scott Roberts: quick question on these like you know.

219
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:19,980
Scott Roberts: positive examples from prior classes.

220
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:33,180
Scott Roberts: As long as you can to redact personal information, do you think it's OK, to use examples, without cuz i'm just worried if can I track down all the students have a group presentation, for example.

221
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:38,610
Scott Roberts: Or do you think you need kind of affirmative permission from prior students.

222
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,580
Scott Roberts: showcase that is like a.

223
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,430
Scott Roberts: You know, a plus example.

224
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,870
Frederique Laubepin: I mean, I think, if you want to showcase a plus.

225
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:56,760
Frederique Laubepin: um I think it's okay to to ask for you know, to reach out to that student and be like, are you okay.

226
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:12,090
Frederique Laubepin: With me using this if you're trying, you know if you need a an example of a very poor quality work that's going to be a little trickier right to reach out to that students say you really bombed this assignment, can I get to use your submission as an example.

227
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:19,110
Scott Roberts: Well, I guess, I guess, where i'm we're asking about the positive example where i'm consuming be able to reach and get an answer.

228
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,040
Frederique Laubepin: isn't it yeah.

229
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:39,390
Frederique Laubepin: yeah as long as you are, you know positive you've de identified the submission and what I did for the the critic calibration is I picked examples epic submissions from.

230
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,950
Frederique Laubepin: When the class was taught like four years ago.

231
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:56,490
Frederique Laubepin: Right so they're not last year's examples there they're now pretty old right these students have most likely, you know moved on and.

232
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:05,550
Frederique Laubepin: still have their friends probably but um yes, you should you know you should definitely be.

233
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:15,330
Frederique Laubepin: careful about you know how you use these these examples and D identifying is probably the.

234
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:18,780
Frederique Laubepin: The major.

235
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,860
Frederique Laubepin: step to go through.

236
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,440
Scott Roberts: Thanks.

237
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,580
Frederique Laubepin: So this is a.

238
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:45,270
Frederique Laubepin: Obviously, an example of a it's a written assignment right, so you might have your different kinds of assignments in your classes, but no matter the you know and depending on the This is also a a sort of like.

239
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:57,210
Frederique Laubepin: term long kind of assignment right, so if you're assigning homework every week you don't have to necessarily be as detailed.

240
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:09,720
Frederique Laubepin: But, yet you know explaining to the students, you know why you know, the purpose of this assignment, as well as some of the skills and knowledge, you want them to practice and apply.

241
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:19,440
Frederique Laubepin: You know, would be really helpful one, I will say one thing people tend to confuse the purpose and a task so when we first start working with.

242
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:32,430
Frederique Laubepin: instructors and you know we help them apply a transparent assignment design framework to their to their assignments when we say what's the purpose of your assignment.

243
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:47,700
Frederique Laubepin: They will often rephrase or restate the task right so let's say you're having them, do you know run a regression analysis, for example on something there will say, well, the purpose of the assignment is to.

244
00:39:48,510 --> 00:40:04,320
Frederique Laubepin: is to do regression analysis on this data set but that's not the purpose that's the task right so when you sit down and try to think through this you know be mindful of the difference.

245
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:09,540
Frederique Laubepin: that the purpose and the tasks are not the same.

246
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:23,100
Frederique Laubepin: What questions do you have on other this example, or the the framework more generally.

247
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:43,080
Frederique Laubepin: And in the you know so after this session i'll send you the slides i'll send you some examples of.

248
00:40:44,280 --> 00:41:02,490
Frederique Laubepin: You know assignments that have been redesigned from different disciplines, you know so less transparent, more transparent, we also have a template and some other resources that you know you can use if you're interested in applying this.

249
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:06,600
Frederique Laubepin: Alright, so let me just go back to.

250
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:12,840
Frederique Laubepin: This for a moment, so we.

251
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:32,190
Frederique Laubepin: haven't done the kind of research that people in the tilt world tilt is stands for transparency in learning and teaching and they're, the ones who came up with this framework and who have done quite a bit of research into the.

252
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:38,460
Frederique Laubepin: The impact we didn't quite do the same kind of.

253
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:44,820
Frederique Laubepin: Research in terms of the impact for public health.

254
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,720
Frederique Laubepin: But we did have some interesting results.

255
00:41:49,770 --> 00:42:01,290
Frederique Laubepin: After applying transparent assignment design in this in this course, which was designed in as taught by Sharon Cardio This is, of course, in the online program again.

256
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,450
Frederique Laubepin: and

257
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,700
Frederique Laubepin: She she does a number of things in.

258
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:18,120
Frederique Laubepin: In the course including running a simulation exercise through a different platform called yelling and i'll talk a little bit about this.

259
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:38,040
Frederique Laubepin: In a minute, but you know just like I did with five await we applied a transparent assignment designed to her assignments, you know so outlining the, the purpose of the assignment, as well as the task, these are just you know some screenshots.

260
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:45,480
Frederique Laubepin: And when we surveyed those students at the end of the at the end of the course there was overwhelming.

261
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:53,610
Frederique Laubepin: Agreement that this was beneficial to them right they had a better understanding of all the steps that you need to follow they had all the resources they needed.

262
00:42:54,180 --> 00:43:13,170
Frederique Laubepin: They could see clearly the purpose of the assignments, and you know deeper understanding of the course content they could also see more clearly how the assignments were aligned with the course goals so from the students perspective, this was a positive change.

263
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:30,150
Frederique Laubepin: There were things that we saw that we certainly didn't expect such as the fact that late submissions in this course decreased dramatically by you know some 67% so.

264
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:47,970
Frederique Laubepin: You know students were really struggling before transferring assignment designed to complete their assignments, on time, but after, as you can see here on the on the graph after the implementation of transparent Simon design, you know the delete submissions fell too.

265
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:51,510
Frederique Laubepin: Much more reasonable number.

266
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:53,730
Andrew Brouwer: kind of.

267
00:43:53,820 --> 00:44:04,740
Andrew Brouwer: amazing to believe, I mean, so I know i'm curious exactly what was done in this city ID implementation is it really just like a couple of paragraphs about.

268
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:06,510
Andrew Brouwer: Or you know.

269
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,280
Frederique Laubepin: A couple of lines yeah and.

270
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:17,820
Frederique Laubepin: yeah and we didn't even you know because um I think the hardest part for instructors to do is actually outlining the criteria.

271
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:29,880
Frederique Laubepin: And so we actually weren't able to get Sharon to articulate the the grading criteria, so it was an incomplete application of transparent Simon design in her course and yet.

272
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,100
Frederique Laubepin: This is what we saw.

273
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:44,400
Frederique Laubepin: Right, and this is as the course doubled, like the the enrollment had doubled in size right so in 2021 I think she had.

274
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:56,340
Frederique Laubepin: i'm not sure about the exact number let's say around 40 students in 2022 when the course run she had double that number of students in the class right.

275
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:57,570
Andrew Brouwer: So it was.

276
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:05,070
Frederique Laubepin: It was about 40 students in 21 and about 80 and 22.

277
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:09,270
Andrew Brouwer: Okay does make me wonder if it's a compound effect but.

278
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:22,470
Frederique Laubepin: But um it's it was it was like a dramatic difference in sort of what you know what was happening in you know in this course.

279
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:32,160
Frederique Laubepin: In terms of the simulation so i'm not going to get into the details of how the how the yellow works, but.

280
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:45,720
Frederique Laubepin: yellow duck is a is a platform where we can set a point goal, that is, you know the scenes, have to work toward that point goal, and we can set a minimum goal for the for the week or for the class.

281
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:54,990
Frederique Laubepin: So you know, we had we saw an increase in the percentage of the class that made the point goal.

282
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:07,830
Frederique Laubepin: And we had an even bigger increase in the number of we call them overachievers the people who didn't just you know meet the point goal but exceeded it.

283
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:21,360
Frederique Laubepin: So in this was also a pretty significant difference right so not only did people do what they needed to do, but they actually went above and beyond, in this particular.

284
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:34,380
Frederique Laubepin: In this particular case, and then, as we talked to Sharon after the course was over, she told us that transparent assignment design improved her own experience.

285
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:47,280
Frederique Laubepin: In a number of ways right so she got fewer assignment instruction questions right, so you know, fewer people needed to have things clarified for them, it was.

286
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:49,950
Frederique Laubepin: You know, things were.

287
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:53,550
Frederique Laubepin: spelled out clearly enough in the.

288
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:59,160
Frederique Laubepin: Instructions she got fewer requests for re grades as well.

289
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:17,790
Frederique Laubepin: And she noticed that the assignment quality was better there was more engagement in the class and the grading process for her was easier, probably as a, you know as a result of all these factors, so it was a better experience for the students.

290
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:27,630
Frederique Laubepin: You know better, learning outcomes and also a better experience for the instructors for sort of you know, managing grading and.

291
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:34,530
Frederique Laubepin: Things related to these assignments so kind of.

292
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,050
Frederique Laubepin: kind of an interesting.

293
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,610
Frederique Laubepin: You know, some results we weren't necessarily expecting.

294
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:53,490
Frederique Laubepin: I think we may not have enough time for those, although I would be very happy to spend a few minutes if you have an assignment that you know.

295
00:47:54,390 --> 00:48:11,400
Frederique Laubepin: Your you know your students tend to struggle with right it's you're not getting the quality submissions that you, you want to get or you know you know that the students have a lot of trouble completing these assignments, you know i'm happy to sort of.

296
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,490
Frederique Laubepin: You know brainstorm about.

297
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:34,800
Frederique Laubepin: You know how transparent Simon design might help to address some of these issues, or you know also as always feel free to reach out and schedule, one on one consultation, because that's always something we're happy to do so.

298
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:40,620
Frederique Laubepin: Emily did you have a question.

299
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:48,900
Emily Martin: nope, I just wanted to come back and say thank you, this is really helpful, I might do some one on one stuff as, I might try this and then.

300
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,690
Emily Martin: And then get your opinion.

301
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:58,530
Frederique Laubepin: yeah absolutely I mean we've done that I know Carlos and distantly on.

302
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:11,820
Frederique Laubepin: You know, he attended there was prepared diamond but he attended one of these workshops and then he tried it out and then he would send his drafts and be like hey Am I am I, on the right path with this is this is this what i'm supposed to do so we're happy to.

303
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:16,740
Frederique Laubepin: You know we're happy to help, however, however, you like.

304
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:22,050
Frederique Laubepin: But this is a, this is a very like I said it's you know.

305
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:25,500
Frederique Laubepin: This is not rocket science like we're not talking about.

306
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:43,800
Frederique Laubepin: You know, doing things like wildly differently we're just talking about making some things a little bit more explicit a little bit more transparent, and this little change has a really important impact on the student experience and that's something that we should.

307
00:49:45,660 --> 00:50:00,780
Frederique Laubepin: We should really try to to leverage as much as we can, especially, knowing that the students can benefit the most are the the students who may not, you know come in having an ability to read our minds and parse our assignments so.

308
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:16,230
Frederique Laubepin: i'll just leave you with this, you know, this is, this is actually evidence based right so i'm not just talking, because this is a This is something a framework, I write about and I like this quite a bit of research on supporting this.

309
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:28,080
Frederique Laubepin: it's a it's an accessible tool and like I said it's it's not very complicated, although it might require you to think about your assignments, a little bit differently.

310
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:37,680
Frederique Laubepin: it's a small change that can lead to very big improvements and a pretty significant impact on the student.

311
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:51,090
Frederique Laubepin: outcomes and you don't have to do this, you know everywhere, all the time, the research shows that there is benefit, even if it's not something that you do consistently in every assignment every course.

312
00:50:52,080 --> 00:51:07,230
Frederique Laubepin: So you know, even if you did it in two assignments in your in your course that would already have a beneficial impact on the on the student right so don't feel like you know you have this mountain to climb, you know it's okay to start small.

313
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,450
Frederique Laubepin: always good to you know seek some.

314
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:24,540
Frederique Laubepin: Peer feedback so whether that's you know by coming to us, or you know grabbing one of your colleagues, and you know, showing them your assignment and say hey does you know, does this make sense.

315
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:26,640
Frederique Laubepin: and

316
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:32,640
Frederique Laubepin: You know, do they have any ideas about making it, you know, making things even more explicit.

317
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:46,440
Frederique Laubepin: And like I said it's not a bad idea to involve your students, also in that process and say you know I am applying a transparent assignment design framework here, did I succeed.

318
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:55,710
Frederique Laubepin: Right, are you able to see the task the the purpose the you know, are you know, can you tell you know from reading this.

319
00:51:56,130 --> 00:52:13,830
Frederique Laubepin: How to be successful in this assignment, because the students are going to be the experts in telling you whether this is transparent, or not right if it doesn't make sense to them, then you know you have some more work to do, and you need to refine things some more so.

320
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:22,920
Frederique Laubepin: You know contact information feel free to email or putting the ticket i'm also in the office most days.

321
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:30,930
Frederique Laubepin: Now, and i'm always happy to see people in person, if that's you know if that's something you'd like to.

322
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,180
Frederique Laubepin: you'd like to do.

323
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:42,180
Frederique Laubepin: i'm really pleased to see you here and see that you are interested in at least thinking about applying.

324
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:52,440
Frederique Laubepin: or increasing transparency in your courses like I mentioned, this is something that's really important, and the more we can work towards transparency, the more benefits.

325
00:52:52,830 --> 00:53:03,660
Frederique Laubepin: To the students, whether it's transparent Simon design or just you know, making a few things more explicit in the syllabus or however you want to work it into your courses.

326
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:14,730
Frederique Laubepin: You know your students will benefit, so thank you so much for taking the time to attend today, I appreciate it, and you know we're here to help.

327
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,040
Frederique Laubepin: If you decide that that's something you want to.

328
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:18,360
Frederique Laubepin: explore some more.
