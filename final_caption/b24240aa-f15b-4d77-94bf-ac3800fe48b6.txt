1
00:00:07,855 --> 00:00:13,855
in epidemiology. First, we will talk about representativeness and sampling.

2
00:00:13,855 --> 00:00:17,855
Then we'll talk about challenges in conducting cohort studies.

3
00:00:17,855 --> 00:00:24,855
I'll go through some interesting examples of important cohort studies which have provided us with landmark epidemiological evidence.

4
00:00:24,855 --> 00:00:34,855
And I will introduce reporting guidelines for cohort studies. Representativeness is very important in a cohort study.

5
00:00:34,855 --> 00:00:39,855
And this is the idea that the people recruited into a longitudinal cohort study should

6
00:00:39,855 --> 00:00:45,855
represent the underlying source population that the study is intended to represent.

7
00:00:45,855 --> 00:00:51,855
And there are many different types of source populations that a cohort study can represent.

8
00:00:51,855 --> 00:00:58,855
The first and probably most obvious is the general population. And this is typically the general population of a country.

9
00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:01,855
A good example is the US Health and Retirement Study,

10
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:11,855
which is operated here at the University of Michigan and is a nationally representative cohort of U.S. adults aged 50 and over.

11
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:17,855
We can also be more specific with respect to the geographic locations that cohort studies represent,

12
00:01:17,855 --> 00:01:22,855
good examples are the Framingham Heart Study, which I'll talk about in a few slides.

13
00:01:22,855 --> 00:01:27,855
But as representative of a town called Framingham in Massachusetts, another example.

14
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:33,855
And again, this is another Michigan-based study, is the Tecumseh Community Health study.

15
00:01:33,855 --> 00:01:38,855
Many cohort studies are also representative of specific professional groups.

16
00:01:38,855 --> 00:01:49,855
Examples include the British Physicians Study, the US Nurses Health Study and the Whitehall Studies of Civil Servants in London, England.

17
00:01:49,855 --> 00:01:57,855
Cohort studies can also represent specific, high risk or vulnerable health groups or specific occupational exposures.

18
00:01:57,855 --> 00:02:06,855
So some examples include cohort studies that recruit sex workers or miners into their studies.

19
00:02:06,855 --> 00:02:14,855
So how do we achieve representativeness? Well, we do this through our methods of sampling people into a cohort study.

20
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:18,855
There are two general ways that we perform sampling.

21
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:28,855
First, we can do random sampling of the source population, but sometimes we have to do stratification of the source and study populations.

22
00:02:28,855 --> 00:02:33,855
So random sampling is also referred to as probability based sampling.

23
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:42,855
This is the idea that selection of participants into a cohort study is based on a known probability of being included in the study.

24
00:02:42,855 --> 00:02:50,855
If every person has the same probability of being recruited into our cohort study, then it is a simple random sample.

25
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:54,855
And this is a very good thing to be able to do.

26
00:02:54,855 --> 00:03:04,855
Having a probability based or random sample in a cohort study is often required for estimating population specific parameters.

27
00:03:04,855 --> 00:03:13,855
Specifically, this is the ability to estimate the prevalence and incidence of a disease in the underlying source population.

28
00:03:13,855 --> 00:03:21,855
So accurately conducting a probability based random sample of an underlying source population

29
00:03:21,855 --> 00:03:27,855
makes the cohort study population representative of its underlying source population.

30
00:03:27,855 --> 00:03:32,855
And it makes us really confident in drawing inference about the actual prevalence

31
00:03:32,855 --> 00:03:39,855
or incidence of a given disease outcome in that underlying source population.

32
00:03:39,855 --> 00:03:42,855
Sometimes we have to do what's called stratified sampling.

33
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:49,855
This is when there is independent selection of subjects or participants from various strata and

34
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:56,855
strata are mutually exclusive sub populations that we want to recruit into our cohort study.

35
00:03:56,855 --> 00:04:04,855
We often do this in order to balance different strata that are unequal in the source population.

36
00:04:04,855 --> 00:04:13,855
A good example here is a form of stratified sampling that is based on geography and in fact, this is done in many different cohort studies.

37
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:19,855
So imagine a cohort study that aims to be representative of the general population of the United States.

38
00:04:19,855 --> 00:04:28,855
We would obviously need to identify people to recruit into the study based on their geography or where they live, but it can be hard.

39
00:04:28,855 --> 00:04:38,855
We know, though, if we did give an equal probability to all people in the United States of being sampled.

40
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:46,855
Not everyone would have equal probability of actually responding and taking part in the study.

41
00:04:46,855 --> 00:04:55,855
And so simple random sampling can give individual people an equal likelihood of being contacted to be recruited into the study.

42
00:04:55,855 --> 00:05:04,855
But at the same time, their actual enrollment into the study depends on the likelihood that they actually respond and agree to take part in the study.

43
00:05:04,855 --> 00:05:14,855
And so there may be certain geographic locations where a people are either harder to reach or they may be less likely to take part in a cohort study.

44
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:22,855
And there's a big body of research about participant factors

45
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:29,855
that make people more or less likely to be willing to take part in epidemiologic research.

46
00:05:29,855 --> 00:05:34,855
That's potentially a topic for another day and kind of relates to selection bias.

47
00:05:34,855 --> 00:05:42,855
But what we might do is we might stratify the United States into smaller geographic regions, which would be sampling units,

48
00:05:42,855 --> 00:05:54,855
and then we would do random sampling within those geographically to find strata or sampling units in order to balance enrollment across each of

49
00:05:54,855 --> 00:06:07,855
those geographic locations to make the study representative of the United States and not skewed towards specific geographic regions or strata.

50
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:17,855
So there are actually many types of variables that we can stratify our source population on that we wish to recruit into our study.

51
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:23,855
So in addition to geographic place, we can also do stratified sampling based on known risk factors,

52
00:06:23,855 --> 00:06:29,855
calendar time, or our main exposure variable. So, for example, if our exposure is very rare,

53
00:06:29,855 --> 00:06:35,855
we can increase the probability that people who have that exposure get sampled into our study

54
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:43,855
in order to get a sufficient number of people who have the exposure enrolled into the study.

55
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:50,855
A good example of a cohort study, as I mentioned earlier, is the Framingham Heart Study.

56
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:57,855
The Framingham Heart Study was established in 1948 when just over five thousand residents of the town of Framingham,

57
00:06:57,855 --> 00:07:03,855
Massachusetts, who were aged 30 to 62 years, were enrolled into the study.

58
00:07:03,855 --> 00:07:08,855
And this was two thirds of the entire population of the town of Framingham.

59
00:07:08,855 --> 00:07:16,855
The Framingham Heart Study is still ongoing. And so they are assessing exposures and outcomes on a regular basis.

60
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:24,855
Exam 32 ended in 2014. I think there have also been more recent exams since then.

61
00:07:24,855 --> 00:07:30,855
Another example, and this is based on an occupational cohort study, is the gas workers study.

62
00:07:30,855 --> 00:07:39,855
The gas worker study was conducted in London, England, and was set and it sampled based on a list of all pensioners who had reached 60 years of age.

63
00:07:39,855 --> 00:07:45,855
As of nineteen thirty eight or in the following 10 years, they used the recorded date of birth,

64
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:51,855
the date of entering the pension scheme and when applicable, the date and cause of death.

65
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:54,855
And this cohort study found that gas workers had one hundred and eighty one percent

66
00:07:54,855 --> 00:08:02,855
greater risk of developing lung cancer when compared to other occupations in London.

67
00:08:02,855 --> 00:08:05,855
And that becomes a community health study.

68
00:08:05,855 --> 00:08:15,855
This was established in 1957 when all eight thousand eight hundred residents of the twenty four hundred households into comes out were canvased,

69
00:08:15,855 --> 00:08:20,855
and there were three rounds of data collection conducted in the 1950s and 60s where

70
00:08:20,855 --> 00:08:25,855
interviews and medical examinations were conducted with remaining a new household residents,

71
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,855
which gave a sample of over 11000 people who were examined at least once.

72
00:08:29,855 --> 00:08:37,855
And over 4000 people who were examined during all three rounds in that time period.

73
00:08:37,855 --> 00:08:47,855
Another famous example of an occupational cohort study is the British Physicians Study, which was conducted by Doll, Hill and Peto in October 1951.

74
00:08:47,855 --> 00:08:54,855
They wrote to all registered physicians in Britain and they recruited over forty thousand people into this study.

75
00:08:54,855 --> 00:09:04,855
And this was really one of the first studies that provided solid epidemiological evidence that smoking caused lung cancer.

76
00:09:04,855 --> 00:09:12,855
In a cohort study, we do the ascertainment of the outcomes separately in the exposed and unexposed groups.

77
00:09:12,855 --> 00:09:22,855
And so while our entire cohort, of course, contains both the exposed and unexposed groups and we may study multiple exposures in a cohort study,

78
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:31,855
it's important to look at the outcomes and the dropout from the study separately in the exposed and unexposed groups in

79
00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:39,855
order to determine whether there is differential lost to follow up or drop out from the study according to exposure status.

80
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:46,855
In this hypothetical example, which is from the Beyond the Basics textbook by Szklo,

81
00:09:46,855 --> 00:09:53,855
the author here has shown the cohort size in the exposed group and then unexposed group.

82
00:09:53,855 --> 00:09:57,855
You can see that we start with five hundred people who are exposed in the initial cohort,

83
00:09:57,855 --> 00:10:02,855
as well as five hundred people who are not exposed in the initial cohort.

84
00:10:02,855 --> 00:10:08,855
When we follow them up over time, we can see that there are four hundred and ninety three people who were exposed to

85
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:12,855
remain in the study and four hundred and ninety six people who are not exposed,

86
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:18,855
who remain in the study. The diagonal arrows indicate study dropouts over time.

87
00:10:18,855 --> 00:10:25,855
When we see that there is greater drop out from the study in the exposed group as opposed to the unexposed group.

88
00:10:25,855 --> 00:10:34,855
This can potentially be a cause for concern because the reasons for dropout may be correlated with the exposure as well as the outcome.

89
00:10:34,855 --> 00:10:44,855
This can introduce selection bias and we'll talk about this later in the show, later in the course during the selection bias session.

90
00:10:44,855 --> 00:10:51,855
Let's talk about some challenges in conducting cohort studies. Well, there are many different challenges in cohort cities.

91
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:56,855
Earlier I told you that the longitudinal cohort study is considered to be one of the

92
00:10:56,855 --> 00:11:01,855
strongest observational study designs for inferring causality in epidemiologic research.

93
00:11:01,855 --> 00:11:09,855
And this is in large part due to its ability to establish temporality of the exposure occurring before the outcome.

94
00:11:09,855 --> 00:11:14,855
However, this does not mean that there are no limitations in a cohort study.

95
00:11:14,855 --> 00:11:19,855
The main challenge or limitation of cohort studies are lost to follow up.

96
00:11:19,855 --> 00:11:23,855
And this is also referred to as study dropout or attrition.

97
00:11:23,855 --> 00:11:33,855
And that's exactly what I showed you in the previous slide where we looked at people dropping out of the study according to their exposure status.

98
00:11:33,855 --> 00:11:41,855
And another challenge is missing data. So, of course, lost to follow up creates missing data when people drop out of the study.

99
00:11:41,855 --> 00:11:46,855
But sometimes we can have missing data when people refuse or declined to answer questions

100
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:53,855
in the study interview or declined to give their data on various for various exposures,

101
00:11:53,855 --> 00:12:00,855
covariates or outcomes that we try to measure. Cohort studies can take a long time to conduct.

102
00:12:00,855 --> 00:12:06,855
This is an this is what contributes to loss to follow up in large part.

103
00:12:06,855 --> 00:12:12,855
If someone has to commit to take part in a cohort study for a very long time, and this can be a number of years,

104
00:12:12,855 --> 00:12:21,855
such as in the Framingham Heart Study, then it could be more likely that they just decide to drop out and no longer take part in the study.

105
00:12:21,855 --> 00:12:31,855
It also means that it can become very expensive in order to conduct a study and collect data for a large number of years.

106
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:39,855
Cohort study can be inefficient. For rare outcomes. So in an outcome that has a really low rate of incidents or a low prevalence,

107
00:12:39,855 --> 00:12:48,855
we actually need to conduct a very large study in order to observe a sufficient number of the outcomes in the cohort that we are following.

108
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:54,855
Exposure classification can be complicated, as we talked about in part two of this session.

109
00:12:54,855 --> 00:13:02,855
And of course, as I mentioned earlier, prospective cohorts can be expensive because they take a long time to conduct.

110
00:13:02,855 --> 00:13:09,855
In retrospective cohorts, we rely on existing data such as medical record data or occupational history data.

111
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:14,855
So data may be incomplete or of poor quality.

112
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:22,855
Lost to follow up, as I said before, is probably the most important major limitation in prospective cohort studies.

113
00:13:22,855 --> 00:13:25,855
Lots to follow up can lead to bias, which again,

114
00:13:25,855 --> 00:13:29,855
is exactly what I showed you in that previous slide where we saw that there was

115
00:13:29,855 --> 00:13:35,855
greater drop out among the exposed group than there was among the unexposed group.

116
00:13:35,855 --> 00:13:44,855
This can also lead to loss of statistical power. So if many people drop out of a study, we may end up with very few people at the end of the study.

117
00:13:44,855 --> 00:13:50,855
So this would mean we have a small sample size, which can lead to a lot of random error.

118
00:13:50,855 --> 00:13:56,855
There may be issues of generalizability when there is a high rate of loss to follow up.

119
00:13:56,855 --> 00:14:04,855
So if people are dropping out of our study and we can usually assume that loss to follow up does not occur randomly,

120
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:11,855
the people who drop out of a cohort study are often those who are in worse health and to have different

121
00:14:11,855 --> 00:14:19,855
socioeconomic characteristics or other socio demographic characteristics from those who remain in the study.

122
00:14:19,855 --> 00:14:24,855
This means that the people who are in the cohort at the end of the follow up period ultimately

123
00:14:24,855 --> 00:14:33,855
may not represent the underlying source population that the cohort originally represented.

124
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:42,855
There are several strategies to minimize loss, to follow up, and we can implement these during enrollment as well as during follow up.

125
00:14:42,855 --> 00:14:48,855
During enrollment, we can exclude those who are most likely to be lost sometimes.

126
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:54,855
This would not be recommended because we may want to especially keep those people in our study.

127
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:56,855
But individuals who are either, let's say,

128
00:14:56,855 --> 00:15:05,855
planning to move out of the geographic region that the study represents or who indicate that they may not be sure about their willingness to return.

129
00:15:05,855 --> 00:15:09,855
They may not be we may choose not to include them right from the beginning,

130
00:15:09,855 --> 00:15:17,855
but we must also make sure that doing this doesn't lead our study to be non representative of the underlying source population.

131
00:15:17,855 --> 00:15:22,855
We can also obtain information from participants to allow for future tracking,

132
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:28,855
such as contact information for that study participant or a family member or a friend.

133
00:15:28,855 --> 00:15:38,855
And during follow up, maintaining periodic contact with study participants can often help minimize loss to follow up.

134
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:42,855
Here's a great example of why cohort studies can be challenging to conduct.

135
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:53,855
So here is an example of an epidemiological cohort study called intake of vitamin D and risk of type one diabetes, a birth cohort study.

136
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,855
And you don't need to read everything on this slide.

137
00:15:55,855 --> 00:16:02,855
But I'm going to read the methods section out because I think it indicates why it's so hard to conduct cohort studies.

138
00:16:02,855 --> 00:16:03,855
So in the methods for this study,

139
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:13,855
they say a birth cohort study was done in which all pregnant women (n=12055) in Oulu and Lapland,

140
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:18,855
northern Finland, who were due to give birth in 1966, were enrolled.

141
00:16:18,855 --> 00:16:27,855
Data was collected in the first year of life about frequency and dose of vitamin D supplementation and presence of suspected rickets.

142
00:16:27,855 --> 00:16:34,855
Our primary outcome measure was diagnosis of type one diabetes by end of December 1997.

143
00:16:34,855 --> 00:16:41,855
And so the first clue here is that this study required a 31 year follow up in order to

144
00:16:41,855 --> 00:16:48,855
assess the relationship between the intake of vitamin D. and the risk of type one diabetes.

145
00:16:48,855 --> 00:16:55,855
And let's see what they found. So this is a table from that study, and again, you don't need to read all of the text in the table.

146
00:16:55,855 --> 00:16:58,855
And I'm sorry that it's a little bit small,

147
00:16:58,855 --> 00:17:07,855
but what this table shows are the incidence rates per one hundred thousand years at risk and the rate ratio

148
00:17:07,855 --> 00:17:11,855
- and that is actually an incidence rate ratio,

149
00:17:11,855 --> 00:17:21,855
even though they don't give it the full name - of type one diabetes by the use of vitamin D supplements and suspected rickets in infancy.

150
00:17:21,855 --> 00:17:28,855
So if we look at the first column, or, I suppose the second column, which is titled type one diabetes,

151
00:17:28,855 --> 00:17:38,855
we can see those are the total number of cases of type one diabetes, according to these three different exposures that they've looked at.

152
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:47,855
And you can see the numbers are extremely small. It took them 30 years of follow up to observe this number of diabetes cases,

153
00:17:47,855 --> 00:17:57,855
which was less than one hundred in total out of twelve thousand women who eventually gave birth, who took part in this study.

154
00:17:57,855 --> 00:18:03,855
And then you can see the incidence rates are correspondingly also very, very low.

155
00:18:03,855 --> 00:18:08,855
So this was probably a very expensive study to conduct. And it took a very, very long time.

156
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:14,855
I mean, this is the type of study that would take someone's entire career to conduct.

157
00:18:14,855 --> 00:18:24,855
OK. Examples of important cohort studies in epidemiology. So as I've been saying, and as you've probably inferred from this entire session,

158
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:29,855
cohort studies have formed much of the bedrock of epidemiological evidence over the past century.

159
00:18:29,855 --> 00:18:34,855
I briefly introduced the Framingham Heart Study. I'm going to talk about it a little bit more now.

160
00:18:34,855 --> 00:18:43,855
Another important study is the Multicenter AIDS study, or MACS, and its role in giving us evidence on the prognosis of HIV AIDS.

161
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:51,855
And I'm also going to briefly talk about a special example, which is radiation effects research among survivors of the atom bomb in Japan.

162
00:18:51,855 --> 00:18:58,855
And here, this was a cohort defined by a rare exposure to an atom bomb, radiation.

163
00:18:58,855 --> 00:19:02,855
The Framingham Heart Study was really focused on cardiovascular health,

164
00:19:02,855 --> 00:19:10,855
and it's a great example because it is a study that has flexibly investigated multiple exposures in relation to multiple outcomes.

165
00:19:10,855 --> 00:19:16,855
Evidence that has come out of the Framingham Heart Study has shown us that cigaret smoking increases risk of heart disease,

166
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:21,855
that increased cholesterol and elevated blood pressure, also increased risk of heart disease.

167
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:28,855
They found that exercise decreases risk of heart disease while obesity increases risk of heart disease.

168
00:19:28,855 --> 00:19:33,855
They have found that elevated blood pressure increases the risk of stroke,

169
00:19:33,855 --> 00:19:39,855
and they have found that postmenopausal women are more likely to have heart disease than premenopausal women.

170
00:19:39,855 --> 00:19:43,855
And they've also found that psychosocial factors affect risk of heart disease.

171
00:19:43,855 --> 00:19:50,855
This is a great example of how cohort studies can be used to study multiple exposures.

172
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:56,855
The Framingham Heart Study has also been very useful in predictive epidemiology.

173
00:19:56,855 --> 00:20:02,855
So in the very first session, we talked about the aims of epidemiology being descriptive epidemiology,

174
00:20:02,855 --> 00:20:08,855
predictive epidemiology and analytic epidemiology, which is focused on causal inference.

175
00:20:08,855 --> 00:20:14,855
In this course, we don't talk about predictive epidemiology very much. But here's a great example.

176
00:20:14,855 --> 00:20:16,855
You may have heard of the Framingham risk score,

177
00:20:16,855 --> 00:20:25,855
which is essentially a checklist or risk calculator where it collects information on an individual patients risk factors.

178
00:20:25,855 --> 00:20:37,855
And it very accurately predicts that patients 10 year risk of future coronary heart disease events based on their Framingham risk score.

179
00:20:37,855 --> 00:20:46,855
Because Framingham has been going on for so long. It actually has now expanded in size to include multiple generations.

180
00:20:46,855 --> 00:20:49,855
So there was the original framing him cohort who was enrolled,

181
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:57,855
but then the children of those original Framingham members were also included in the what's called the Framingham Offspring Study.

182
00:20:57,855 --> 00:21:02,855
And their children have now been included in what's called the Framingham Gen3 study.

183
00:21:02,855 --> 00:21:04,855
And if you go to the Framingham Heart Study website,

184
00:21:04,855 --> 00:21:09,855
you can learn more about the multiple generations that have been included in the Framingham Heart Study.

185
00:21:09,855 --> 00:21:18,855
And it's really interesting because it allows us to study intergenerational effects on cardiovascular outcomes.

186
00:21:18,855 --> 00:21:22,855
Another great example is the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, or MACS.

187
00:21:22,855 --> 00:21:29,855
This is a really innovative study that has had really high impact in understanding HIV and AIDS.

188
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:33,855
It was implemented in nineteen eighty four and nineteen eighty five in multiple U.S.

189
00:21:33,855 --> 00:21:40,855
cities as a prospective study of four thousand nine hundred fifty four gay men.

190
00:21:40,855 --> 00:21:49,855
They have examined and provided blood samples every six months, including information on seroconversion, onset of AIDS and death.

191
00:21:49,855 --> 00:21:54,855
It was initially established to characterize the risk factors for the natural history of AIDS.

192
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:59,855
And recall, we really knew nothing about this in the 1980s when this was set up.

193
00:21:59,855 --> 00:22:04,855
But as we have learned more about HIV AIDS, as new treatments have come out,

194
00:22:04,855 --> 00:22:10,855
it has changed its focused and it has provided information on the effects of therapeutic interventions.

195
00:22:10,855 --> 00:22:18,855
For example. And here's one of the earliest papers that came out of the max study,

196
00:22:18,855 --> 00:22:26,855
which looked at the determinants of prevalent infection at enrollment in the cohort in nineteen eighty four and nineteen eighty five.

197
00:22:26,855 --> 00:22:32,855
This table shows a logistic regression model for HIV zero positivity at baseline

198
00:22:32,855 --> 00:22:38,855
for over 4000 men who were enrolled into the MACS study in 1994 and 1995.

199
00:22:38,855 --> 00:22:46,855
So this was some of the first epidemiological evidence that came out about HIV AIDS.

200
00:22:46,855 --> 00:22:57,855
And a subsequent paper, as the cohort was followed up over time, they were able to look at the predictors of incidents of new HIV infection.

201
00:22:57,855 --> 00:23:04,855
And as more data was accrued, as follow up went on, as our knowledge of epidemiological methods evolved.

202
00:23:04,855 --> 00:23:11,855
So not only our knowledge about HIV AIDS and the sort of testing and treatment environment has changed,

203
00:23:11,855 --> 00:23:16,855
our the epidemiological methods that we use to study health outcomes have changed

204
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:21,855
and improved over time since the 1980s when the study was originally conducted.

205
00:23:21,855 --> 00:23:32,855
And this table shows this evolution and methods and what they've been able to let us do in terms of understanding the epidemiology of HIV AIDS.

206
00:23:32,855 --> 00:23:38,855
The MACS study has given us a lot of key evidence, including the incubation period of HIV,

207
00:23:38,855 --> 00:23:45,855
the rates of CD4 cell decrease and predictors of decline in CD4, viral load as a key determinant

208
00:23:45,855 --> 00:23:54,855
of CD4 cell count decrease determinants of prognosis and the effectiveness of various treatments.

209
00:23:54,855 --> 00:23:59,855
Another great example and the final example I want to show here is radiation effects research.

210
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:07,855
So since the atom bomb was dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, at the end of World War Two,

211
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:12,855
there has been research that has investigated the health effects of ionizing radiation.

212
00:24:12,855 --> 00:24:19,855
I think this is a really good teaching example because, one, it shows us what a period effects of period effect is.

213
00:24:19,855 --> 00:24:25,855
So if you recall from one of our previous sessions, we learned about age, period and cohort effects.

214
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:31,855
And so this the atomic bomb that was dropped in 1945, or the two atomic

215
00:24:31,855 --> 00:24:35,855
bombs that were dropped in nineteen forty five in Japan are an example of a period

216
00:24:35,855 --> 00:24:40,855
effect that happened at a specific point in calendar time that affected everybody

217
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:46,855
who was exposed regardless of their age or the birth cohort that they were born in.

218
00:24:46,855 --> 00:24:53,855
Second, it's also a good example of how a longitudinal cohort study can be used to study a rare exposure.

219
00:24:53,855 --> 00:25:01,855
Of course, in the absolute total population. Not that many people end up being exposed to ionized radiation.

220
00:25:01,855 --> 00:25:09,855
Of course, this is a very, very good thing. But it allowed the investigators to recruit people who were survivors of the atomic

221
00:25:09,855 --> 00:25:21,855
bomb into this cohort in order to understand the health effects of this rare exposure.

222
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:26,855
And there have been multiple cohorts that have been established by the researchers

223
00:25:26,855 --> 00:25:31,855
of the ATOMIC who were originally studying the atomic bomb survivors.

224
00:25:31,855 --> 00:25:37,855
And so you can see here from the slide the different cohorts that have been established.

225
00:25:37,855 --> 00:25:43,855
For example, there was an in utero court established in nineteen fifty six of two thousand eight

226
00:25:43,855 --> 00:25:48,855
hundred people who gave birth subsequently after the atomic bombs were dropped.

227
00:25:48,855 --> 00:25:53,855
There was an adult health study cohort that was established in 1958 with twenty thousand

228
00:25:53,855 --> 00:25:59,855
people and an even larger lifespan study cohort with one hundred and twenty thousand people.

229
00:25:59,855 --> 00:26:05,855
There have also been intergenerational cohort studies where a cohort of atomic bomb survivors,

230
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:14,855
children, was established in 1947 and 1958 with eighty thousand people.

231
00:26:14,855 --> 00:26:20,855
Mortality studies have also been conducted of those directly exposed as well as those exposed in utero.

232
00:26:20,855 --> 00:26:29,855
And again, of the children of survivors. The researchers have been able to reconstruct radiation doses using dosimetry,

233
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:38,855
and they have also been able to characterize the physical risks of radiation exposure with the key outcomes being leukemia as well as solid cancers.

234
00:26:38,855 --> 00:26:42,855
Researchers or epidemiological researchers specifically have demonstrated the linear

235
00:26:42,855 --> 00:26:47,855
increase of cancer risk with increasing dose and results from the atomic bomb.

236
00:26:47,855 --> 00:26:53,855
Research has been used to establish global standards for exposure to ionizing radiation,

237
00:26:53,855 --> 00:27:02,855
and fortunately, no genetic effects have been detected among children of the atomic bomb survivors.

238
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:08,855
OK. Let's briefly introduce reporting guidelines for cohort studies. This is very, very brief.

239
00:27:08,855 --> 00:27:13,855
So reporting guidelines and associated checklists that can be used to make sure

240
00:27:13,855 --> 00:27:16,855
that you are following these guidelines are available for all study designs,

241
00:27:16,855 --> 00:27:24,855
not just cohort studies. And so the goal here is, and I'm quoting from a existing guideline,

242
00:27:24,855 --> 00:27:28,855
that research should be reported transparently so that readers can follow what was planned,

243
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,855
what was done, what was found and what conclusions are drawn.

244
00:27:31,855 --> 00:27:37,855
So following reporting guidelines is very, very important for ensuring the reproducibility,

245
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:41,855
transparency and eventual replication of epidemiologic research.

246
00:27:41,855 --> 00:27:46,855
And we're actually going to hear more about that later on in the semester.

247
00:27:46,855 --> 00:27:53,855
It's important to follow reporting guidelines because incomplete and inadequate reporting of research can hamper the assessment of

248
00:27:53,855 --> 00:28:02,855
strengths and weaknesses of the studies reported in the literature and hamper their reproducibility by subsequent investigators.

249
00:28:02,855 --> 00:28:08,855
There are a lot of different forms of reporting checklists for observational studies.

250
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:17,855
We use what's called the strobe guidelines, and these exist for a cohort case control and cross-sectional designs for randomized controlled trials.

251
00:28:17,855 --> 00:28:23,855
We use what is called the concert guidelines and for systematic reviews and meta analysis.

252
00:28:23,855 --> 00:28:31,855
We use what are called the prisoner guidelines. And each of these reporting guidelines comes along with a checklist.

253
00:28:31,855 --> 00:28:34,855
And essentially when you conduct your study,

254
00:28:34,855 --> 00:28:42,855
you would make sure that you are able to tick off every single item in the checklist that goes along with the reporting guideline in

255
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:50,855
order to make sure that you are adequately following the reporting guidelines for when you write up and report your study findings.

256
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:55,855
Here's an example of what this looks like. So here is the strobe statement for a cohort studies.

257
00:28:55,855 --> 00:28:59,855
Again, you do not need to read every single word on this slide.

258
00:28:59,855 --> 00:29:07,855
And again, I'm sorry, it's a little bit small, but basically what this strobe checklist does is it lets you, too.

259
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:14,855
It allows you to go through the report that you have written based on the results of your cohort study all

260
00:29:14,855 --> 00:29:19,855
the way from the title and abstract through the introduction methods and then results and discussion.

261
00:29:19,855 --> 00:29:26,855
And that's on the next slide. And it lets you to just kind of it lets you go through and make sure that you have ticked each of

262
00:29:26,855 --> 00:29:31,855
these boxes to make sure that you are reporting all of the important key pieces of information.

263
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:34,855
This is a checklist that I've used myself many times.

264
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:43,855
Many journals in epidemiology require that you submit this checklist alongside your study, regardless of the design,

265
00:29:43,855 --> 00:29:49,855
in order to make sure that you are reporting according to transparent and clear criteria.

266
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:58,855
So here is the strobe checklist. Here's what they recommend for the results and what they recommend for the discussion.

267
00:29:58,855 --> 00:30:02,855
You don't need to memorize these. I just want you to see what it lists.

268
00:30:02,855 --> 00:30:04,855
So please actually do read through it.

269
00:30:04,855 --> 00:30:12,855
After the session, just to familiarize yourself with the key pieces of information that should be reported in a cohort study.

270
00:30:12,855 --> 00:30:19,855
And then keep in mind that similar checklists also exist for case control, cross-sectional studies,

271
00:30:19,855 --> 00:30:32,694
randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews and meta analysis, which our study designs that we will get into later this semester.
