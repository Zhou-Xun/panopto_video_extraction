1
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,160
And so, you know, I guess I feel like it's my obligation.

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,940
Like a speech, though. Yeah. I don't know why.

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,720
I guess maybe it was just getting some support or something.

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,760
There's this class. It's more generic, you know, less focused.

5
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,910
Yeah. How likely is this one? 55 years.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,970
This way. Very particular. Places.

7
00:00:39,530 --> 00:01:14,800
I guess I'll just be like, I'll be interested to let me know. You and your voice.

8
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:23,349
Yeah, I think I might just get out of it once it comes, you know, just like.

9
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,590
Oh, maybe no. Said it to every second here.

10
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,090
It's literally not your obligation. No. But also it complained a lot.

11
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,660
Yes. I think we we have a report with that. And so we put it that way.

12
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,250
Recording in progress, if you ask me directly, that's not wrong.

13
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,260
I said more about the page books mostly, but.

14
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,320
You're not wrong. It's also civic duty.

15
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:15,550
It's also. Hello.

16
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,530
Seriously? Okay.

17
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:33,690
Good morning, everyone. Morning. To implement what we are going to do today.

18
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:41,850
We're going to keep working on the design and we've had enough time.

19
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,150
And then I'm going to finish this problem.

20
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:59,940
Then I'm going to talk to you for a few minutes about the class in general, and then we will proceed with a class problem.

21
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:08,700
So if you remember, what we were doing last time was a problem in which.

22
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:21,250
Eli Lilly and. Eli Lilly.

23
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:34,410
Mr. Murray wanted to make it so they were negotiating which part of the new company they can't control.

24
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:46,230
Right. And there are some points that are more important to aspect, that are more important to me and importantly to Pfizer.

25
00:03:46,260 --> 00:04:00,840
So we give them a hundred points and then they divide in those hundred points and they feel right that they will get around from it.

26
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,640
You don't seem able to decide what rates are going to be in Indianapolis or New York and so on.

27
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,830
Right. So they list the last one.

28
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:25,110
We said that we are going to treat that as a proportion. So we want to we want to determine what percentage of our leads view.

29
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:35,370
And I said you will predominate in the label, then we'll be, you know, in the lay off.

30
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:42,840
And what we want to do is first compute the total points.

31
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,200
And so this is this is it is can you right.

32
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,900
This is a an assignation. And this is these variables are zero or one.

33
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:58,469
And in these these numbers, these here are between zero and one.

34
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:04,110
And we see them with this. Now, all of these, the total would be equal to one.

35
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:13,320
So what this is one is dealing with this is the one is growth is that we want to be able to integration.

36
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,240
So the thought of this song was out of control.

37
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:26,580
So the first thing we did was calculate the point and suppose though I may not be it and then I multiply.

38
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,410
So I saw the points that correspond to need.

39
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,030
How what's the utility of lily?

40
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:44,360
If they get their name, they get to the point what they chairman is going to be on the board and then the you company

41
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:53,820
and you know 60% of revenue predominates or is present in the in the late of 60% and in

42
00:05:53,820 --> 00:06:03,420
that you really get to get 50 points utility and the same thing for Pfizer and then we

43
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:12,540
calculated what would be the utility of Lily if Lily were assigned the assignment of Pfizer.

44
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:23,100
So we would lead to the values of Lily and then with multiplied times the assignment of Pfizer and say, okay,

45
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:38,400
if it's Lily had had the assignment that Pfizer had, this is what the utility of of Pfizer of Lily would have been.

46
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:47,520
And the same thing for Pfizer. Right. So what what we want to make sure is that when when you look at your opponent,

47
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:53,550
what we you look at your the person you are engaged in these transactions,

48
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,070
you look you know,

49
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:07,799
you look at them and have no that meaning that what you get has to be greater than or equal to what you would have gotten if you had the assignment.

50
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,510
And the. So this is the knowing no envy clause.

51
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:26,470
And same thing here. Mom and dad.

52
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:35,440
And what we want to do is make sure that these the actual bonds for Lilly and for Pfizer are the same.

53
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:40,540
So they look at each other and they then one doesn't have more points than the other.

54
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:46,210
So they believe they must be zero. And we want to maximize any of them.

55
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,920
Either they vote for any war they want or Pfizer.

56
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,550
This can be performed to a reasonably objective function.

57
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:02,050
Does not matter because they are not going to be the same. So we made a constraint that this is this really has to be zero.

58
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:17,950
So let me go back here and make sure that we have the you know, the correct configuration.

59
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:23,730
So this is the assigned finding officer with the value of meaning.

60
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,720
So that's what that's how Lilly looks at what Pfizer got.

61
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,740
Right. And then and we got 50.

62
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:45,000
Right. And then here is the assignment of Lilly, you know, with the value of Pfizer.

63
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:51,910
So this is how how Pfizer would feel if we had gotten Lilly, Lily's assignment.

64
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,390
And in this case is 53.

65
00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:01,270
So there's envy here, right? Because, you know, Pfizer got 47.

66
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:08,200
And this point to if if if Pfizer had switched to working at 53.

67
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,120
And so with that, we are going to Solberg.

68
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:31,280
And then what we want to do is maximize right and maximize the objective function, which is the points on really or the points of Pfizer.

69
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,700
It doesn't matter. So in this case, points only.

70
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:51,820
Importance of feeding youth. And then by changing what sells, that's going to be the goal of yourself.

71
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,510
You and Lillian will somehow decision variables.

72
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:04,370
And then I'm going to put the constraints. Yeah.

73
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:21,440
I'm going to put the constraints. And the constraints are that is some of the all these these pitfalls which is here must be equal to one prize.

74
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:27,410
One went to some and to each one of them that for each one of those homes.

75
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,940
Most people go through one thing.

76
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:46,640
They think one thing that I want is that they know me because I've got no point difference.

77
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,930
So this number, the difference must be equal to zero.

78
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:59,420
At least number will be equal to zero.

79
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:14,660
The third one is that I won no NBA, so the actual points must be greater than or equal to what you think your opponent got.

80
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:28,170
Right. And then I'm going to add that I is the numbers which be greater than or equal to these two.

81
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:34,620
I. And then there are some other constraints.

82
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,450
So I cannot allow this number to be a bolt on 0.1.

83
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:48,310
That's what we call the binary constraint. So this is a new set of new kind of variables called binary.

84
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:56,880
They can be either one or zero. We going to specify that they are in the year, but there is more constraint than in the year in this case.

85
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,590
They have to be either one or zero, not any integral.

86
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:16,780
So I am going to highlight. These sales not delay or strain because they one zero are the decisions on without delay.

87
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:25,480
And then I'm going to specify that they are binary and they must be binary.

88
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,350
I'm going to add another one that says these two numbers.

89
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:41,760
They have to. Well, they they are greater than or equal to zero.

90
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:51,180
And and and the sum has to be less than equal one.

91
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:59,090
So I don't have to put any more constraints on that. Right. But I don't think would say, oh, they, they need to be less than one.

92
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:13,200
But it's not necessary because there's no way that that two numbers would be in more than one and one because the most that one.

93
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:20,400
But if you are you want to be exactly.

94
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,930
Express exactly all the constraints will this list.

95
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:42,840
Okay. Although is a redundant clustering. So these two will be greater less than or equal to one in the study requirement, you know.

96
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:55,800
And I think we are done. We need to change these to simply be and aliens and learn.

97
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:10,620
So with that, then I want to maximize the value of of living or, you know, if I we do the same thing then.

98
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:22,410
Okay. So we get the actual points for Reilly and Fischer.

99
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:33,300
We got it to be 51 points each, one thing which is greater than the 48.

100
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:39,030
So, you know, if they switch, you will be getting 48.6 or something.

101
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:51,659
And this is the maximizes. I mean for Lilly we use like so the this is said that in order to max it you know to get that can you so there are

102
00:14:51,660 --> 00:15:02,280
no ways in which we can get with the combination of that we have a higher utility for the Lilly or Pfizer we found,

103
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:07,650
you know, without harming the other one.

104
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,480
So we got the Lilly gets their name.

105
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:23,990
They had warriors. So decided no fighting gets the name Lilly, get the word Pfizer, get the chairman and CEO Lilly.

106
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:41,500
And 45% of Lilly's view and 54% of 55% of Pfizer view are prevail in the lay of those proceedings.

107
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,110
Right. So. Okay.

108
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:58,330
So this is a an interesting problem when you are trying to, you know, allocate between opponents if you want to get into some kind of resolution.

109
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,750
Could you show your solver again? I got a different answer.

110
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:08,830
Yeah, I did. To let you get to what was the I don't know.

111
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,880
I didn't do the very last part of the solver option for the layoffs, and I got 58 or something.

112
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:20,140
But I did the last one. I still got it so I can see.

113
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:26,800
Yeah, I couldn't see. You can't see it.

114
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:38,390
So the. Float. Could you read it off?

115
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,520
I'm sorry. Could you read it off? Yeah. So we can show James.

116
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:50,209
He goes the B 14 to 17 is binary.

117
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:57,590
So we need 14 here to see 17 how to be by the results zero to the one.

118
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:08,240
The second one is B 16 would be 18 to see anything less than or equal to one.

119
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:20,700
B 18. Be a teen to see see a teen.

120
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:26,610
Those two have to be less than or equal to one independently.

121
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:30,590
So that's why I said that. I don't think that's necessary, do they?

122
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:54,640
If the adult one day I got be 22 to 22, so be 22 to see went into greater than being 24 is 24 greater than being 2420 before I did,

123
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:01,040
I got to be 14 to the 18 so easily flipping.

124
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:12,290
The 14 to the 18 is equal to one.

125
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,650
So all these sums would be equal to one.

126
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:24,980
And finally, that be the 22 inches each one has to be zero.

127
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:35,110
Right. What's your set? My objective function is in two.

128
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,790
Oh, that's an issue I added.

129
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,780
Yeah, you're right. I am not getting my function right.

130
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:47,090
So? So. Like the importance for me.

131
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:54,260
So one. So now what is my problem? Sorry. Okay.

132
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,530
Yes. So we've got 58%.

133
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:22,810
The problem, of course, is so. And get all the.

134
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:54,920
Any questions about? So let me save that.

135
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,630
Let me talk a little bit about what I wanted to talk to me about.

136
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,760
So, you know, I have your exams graded.

137
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:17,180
And in general, they are verifying that the distribution that I was expecting, there was no surprise.

138
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:23,240
Right now, they mean I think is 72%.

139
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,590
But that's typical. That's nothing to worry about.

140
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,930
The high grade was 85%.

141
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:39,100
So there are people in the 1980, 76 system.

142
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:53,299
So. So as I told you in the beginning of the class, I what I want is for people to figure out where they made the mistakes and come to me.

143
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,740
And, you know, I'll help you to understand when you make a mistake.

144
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:10,480
So but unfortunately my grades are on this but several potential I got I these kind of.

145
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:27,000
Great so or it's that so they're not going to say that 0% for sure.

146
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:33,090
But they are quite, you know, in three, let me put it this way.

147
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,610
So I have to follow up with that.

148
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:49,500
And if some of you I asked you to come and talk to me is not in any way making any accusation, I just want you to explain,

149
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:55,710
you know, where you got some certainty answers that, you know, I don't see how you got the answers from.

150
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,870
There are some answers that I type. There are the right answer.

151
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,290
But you don't see any any indication where they coming from?

152
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,400
They are. I don't know.

153
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:20,909
You know, in, you know, students that came out with the exact same answer, meaning committing the same mistake in the same cells in the same.

154
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:24,480
So that I would like an explanation for that.

155
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:32,970
So in essence, I cannot let that go, right, because is the integrity of the class that is invoked.

156
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:43,170
So and again, this is so everybody knows what the deal is.

157
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:53,360
If anybody, you know, think that I made a mistake and I, you know, you know,

158
00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:03,840
I was desperate and I got some answer from so I can say and if you tell me that, then I will, you know,

159
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:19,620
you got your exams and they probably will give you a zero in that exam, but you will have the chance to go to the if you have all your homework,

160
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:28,139
then you have a guarantee and B you get a decent grade or not even a decent grade.

161
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:37,110
Someone nice, you know, not catastrophic trophy grade in the final, you might get to be a B-plus, right?

162
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:45,150
And who knows? And if you manage to get like in the nineties and a hundred widows, then, you know,

163
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:53,670
grade your initial exams and things that you did and, you know, maybe give you a higher grade.

164
00:23:53,790 --> 00:24:05,180
But that is, if anybody comes to me before I call them and say, this happened, right?

165
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:17,280
If I have to call you and then we have a talk and then there is absolutely no question that there is something wrong.

166
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:32,460
So you know that the consequences are a zero on the test and a maximum grade of a C in the class as was specified in your,

167
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:37,850
you know, you know, students car.

168
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:52,050
Can I this that. I know I don't going to do that unless there is plenty of evidence that some academic misconduct occurred.

169
00:24:53,190 --> 00:25:06,690
But, you know, there's usually in those cases is it is a pretty straightforward case.

170
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:22,010
So that, of course, is if that happens, will be totally sealed and almost nobody will know about that.

171
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,960
Right. So and so we won't publicize or anything like that.

172
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:33,300
It's not going to be even on your transcript or anything, but there's going to be a letter going into your file.

173
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:49,620
And the idea is, if there is other if there is other infraction for you in the in that file, and then you get another one and they will look at both.

174
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:55,470
That's the dean's office. And then that's a conversation between the dean's office and the student.

175
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:01,680
But and, you know, that usually doesn't go well.

176
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:10,920
So so, you know, if you come before and tell me there's not going to be.

177
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,220
Any reporting from the even though I shouldn't do it.

178
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:26,040
But they will not. If you come and you tell me what you think, and then, you know I get your penalty.

179
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,750
If you don't, then it is going to be everybody.

180
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:46,319
And, you know, I understand that you are under a lot of pressure and then you need to think.

181
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,750
You need to my game is start doing great.

182
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:57,660
You know, almost everybody, you know, getting phone calls and all this stuff and you think that's a mark of that,

183
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:09,390
is that if you get something less, then you are signaling that, you know, something is wrong with you and maybe that's not the case.

184
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:15,390
What signal that something is wrong with you is if you cheat in grad school.

185
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:25,980
And that's, you know, hurtful for me personally and for the program.

186
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:30,810
And, you know, so my word, really.

187
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:33,910
Yeah.

188
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:48,750
I think goal is to have, you know, students that are talented, but most importantly that the honor, integrity and courage to maintain their integrity.

189
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:53,729
So if there's someone first, you know, I didn't tell the you know,

190
00:27:53,730 --> 00:28:01,320
for the professor being and explaining this very well or whatever, don't take the easy way out.

191
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,479
You'll simply even.

192
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:15,960
Even though I told everybody that you are not going to fail in this class and that there is plenty of opportunities and and you're going to get,

193
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:33,180
you know, most likely the minimum that you can get is a B, and most likely everybody gets a B, B, because they made me thin my impression.

194
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:42,630
And I'm not talking to most of you who are here or all of you who are here because you are always here.

195
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:53,579
Right. But I have to say that they are, you know, students that usually never come to class.

196
00:28:53,580 --> 00:29:02,130
And when I do, when I look at their activities on campus, they don't want to be news.

197
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:09,479
They don't watch the classes after that. So how are they going to learn that?

198
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,760
I said it. There's a huge set of activity during the week of the exam.

199
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:22,350
Right. But you can learn all that and practice all that in a week if you haven't done anything before.

200
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:31,080
So that's impossible. And that that flexibility that I gave you is because you are a graduate student.

201
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:39,839
No longer you're not advanced undergrad grad student means that you are in charge of your learning.

202
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,739
You are responsible for your learning. And you want to be here.

203
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:53,580
You want to learn, and you want to be excellent in your career and in many aspects of your career.

204
00:29:54,420 --> 00:30:05,340
So, so remember and the about a week and a couple of years ago,

205
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:17,309
I heard a student complaining about the classes and the program and saying, oh, you know,

206
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:30,570
I it's no wonder God, you know, we feel I don't being number one because, you know, this class, I don't understand this class and this is poorly done.

207
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:34,260
And and then they get these rankings, you know,

208
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:43,380
to not in there because of the problem that we put out is not they are not looking at what classes are taking now.

209
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:49,530
You know the professional thinking now they they're looking at you out.

210
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:57,660
And if you perform well and you perform better than the others, then you have a relative ranking higher.

211
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:05,340
But if you there's no discrimination, they are not saying in the University of Michigan,

212
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:11,670
the student is better than the University of Washington student or something like that.

213
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:23,130
Then they are. You know what? Why would we get any points in higher points of any other institution?

214
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:39,040
Right. And the thing that really. I think was remarkable for many years is that there was no this for me.

215
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,099
There was these great competition, right.

216
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,390
People, you know, get the grades they got and they were happy.

217
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:57,070
And then they studied hard to get the grades. But the number of you know, totally, you know,

218
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:13,210
perfect 4.0 in a in a in a cohort in a in a tough and supposedly and very rigorous institution, they'll send some, you know, well.

219
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:21,460
And so it means that creates an environment in which what you need to do,

220
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:32,890
what you want to do is get the highest grade you can go to learn is like I need to get that A because everybody have a the one I get,

221
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:37,690
you know, anything less than my 4.0 and then you do, you know,

222
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:49,560
you get justifications in your mind and you start saying these class is not well taught, so it's okay to keep oh, oh, you know, too much work.

223
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:59,080
How come, you know, they say that questions were incredibly hard is okay you we never were never exposed to these

224
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:08,110
in class is not continue and that's not the case right the idea for it but example these

225
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:18,249
classes not every intention of course it is you know take abstractions from what you do and

226
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:24,010
apply to see the way you and so the situation you can recognize if you know the theory,

227
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,820
you can recognize how to apply those directly.

228
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:32,169
If you understand the concept, you can apply those directly.

229
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:44,200
But you have to think about that. And I am absolutely sure that each and every one of you, instead of saying I cannot learn these,

230
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:52,280
put more time into, you know, working on the class, you will get this thing.

231
00:33:52,630 --> 00:34:00,630
There is absolutely no question in my mind that everyone here is capable of, you know,

232
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:06,160
working in a type of class where any type of problems that these class can,

233
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:15,670
you know, have order and finance or what's affecting the chances of any other class in the curriculum.

234
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:30,970
But the point is for you guys that I don't take responsibility for in your learning.

235
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:43,719
So I am sorry. I have to say that at this point in the great class, it is not pleasant in a graduating class.

236
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:56,210
But I have to alert you that I think in general some of you have the wrong objective.

237
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:01,120
It. Now, having said that, you know,

238
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:12,690
I think grades and the participation in the class and for those of you who come to class and the ones that I know that are,

239
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:23,380
you know, some reading like doing the exercises that, you know, at home, I I'm really pleased with your performance.

240
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:31,239
I think that, you know, even though you might miss on points or not, you can, you know, always government talk to me.

241
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:38,830
And some of you go to my office hours and ask questions or ask questions and how can I do office hours online?

242
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:50,080
Well, you know, most of given that you have that resource and you in general that I am available pretty much all the time,

243
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:59,350
I don't get almost, you know, many calls from individuals day to day in the case opposed to don't show the office hours.

244
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,840
They don't send me an email saying I don't understand these but so.

245
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:17,200
My point is you have resources that you can use there, something that you need, an extra explanation.

246
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:30,920
You can. You don't have study groups, but you can clothing, you know, and I'm perfectly fine even doing office hours during the weekend.

247
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:35,030
I might think what I want you to do is to learn.

248
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:41,240
I want to do my job right now. I don't want just just you to be happy.

249
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,880
I want you to learn how being is in the process helps.

250
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,570
But you know, my goal is for you to learn.

251
00:36:50,840 --> 00:37:00,319
Not that I am a nice professor or that, you know, is easy and that, you know, that makes, you know, say so.

252
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,040
God, I want you to be proficient in this.

253
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,910
If I'm not helping you in that way, please tell me.

254
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:13,430
I don't think of things of that. But don't be uneasy, you know.

255
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:27,440
Shocker. Okay. So then it was wanted to say, is there any representative here for me is good in front of class reps.

256
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:36,190
Yeah. I would like to meet with a second year student rep is you know,

257
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:44,870
please let's set a time and I would like to meet with you and he's got some of his work after class.

258
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:54,560
Yeah. All right, so let's.

259
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:03,380
Any comments? Yeah. When can we expect like the other homeworks to be graded?

260
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,310
They are being graded like right now.

261
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:16,910
So they. Grazer told me that he would like to have all the grade building homework rated by next week,

262
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:24,320
by Monday or Tuesday next week, and you will get your exam grades today.

263
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:32,270
So most of the homework grades are going to be fine, they're going to be good,

264
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:38,090
you're going to get feedback, but you're going to be you know, it's the feedback that you got in class.

265
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:50,720
We saw all of that. All right. So you know what the answers are and what they and the procedures are.

266
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:58,640
But you are going to get all that right. And most important, you know, the discriminator in this case is your exam.

267
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:11,540
And and the homework is important for me to know what you are progressing doing in the class so it can give you a safety net of any.

268
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:12,440
Right.

269
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:24,350
There's nothing you can do if you do like failing the exam or something, even your homework, then, you know, I have to say, that's what I promised.

270
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:28,540
Debbie So you going to be as good?

271
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:38,830
And I need that to avoid pretty much anxiety because it's important.

272
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,930
Doesn't someone here this is a totally new way of thinking.

273
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:46,520
And as some people get anxious about that and then say, I'm going to flunk on your blog.

274
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:54,050
You know, I think so. Good.

275
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:15,980
So let's. It's still a mix.

276
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:20,330
Our problem is that probably 4.85.

277
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:37,110
And then I'm going to also open data for 25.

278
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:55,560
Okay. So now let's go back to the.

279
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:23,559
Right. This is how it reads administer the process of Medicare claims at the beginning of month one.

280
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:34,600
They have a backlog of 40,000 difficult claims and 60,000 is claim they think is 60,060.

281
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:49,870
60,000 is a claim. The predicted claim volume for month one through eight is listed in the file for 85.

282
00:41:50,260 --> 00:42:05,260
That's what you get in the the data that is the predicted volume of difficult and easy claims from month 1 to 8.

283
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:30,300
Now. At the beginning of month, one administrator has 70 experience claim process so each mall can hire up to ten trainees at the end of each month.

284
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:36,540
5% of experienced employees quit and 20% of trainees are white.

285
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:42,030
Each worker is available for 160 hours per month.

286
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:48,540
The number of minutes needed by each worker to process each type of claim is listed in the same

287
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:56,300
five star one ending inventory for 2 to 7 to be no greater than 50,000 of each type of trade.

288
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:02,310
All claim must be processed by the end of the month of month eight and eight.

289
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:08,519
What is the minimum number of trainees that need to be hired during moment 1 to 8?

290
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:15,870
So those are going to be I don't know what our decision value is, but not all.

291
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:20,309
So no trainees mostly in two years experience work.

292
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:24,299
It will probably end up being fractional. You have two options.

293
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:32,460
First, you can ignore the fractional values, and second, you can use the round function to run them to the nearest integer.

294
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:38,760
However, these makes them more lenient so you won't be able to solve the simplex ultimatum.

295
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:45,090
So we are going to try the first and the second method, which is solving as normally.

296
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:54,900
So let's go to the model and then this.

297
00:43:55,290 --> 00:44:01,919
The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to translate that transcribed.

298
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:10,170
So the information that we have is as we have is.

299
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:17,150
David, this is the audience for 1128.

300
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:22,100
Difficult and easy. So this is the new body.

301
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:26,540
This is the expected body. So we can make these.

302
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:37,340
So I'll be and then go to.

303
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:46,480
The template right here beginning of month inventory is easy.

304
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:57,340
So we have the new claims issue and it claims to be process 1 to 8 and then beginning maintenance,

305
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:04,450
easy inventory and new easy claims to process a new hard claims to process.

306
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:07,630
Right. So those are from month one, two eight.

307
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,780
Those are the new easy claims and the new part.

308
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:24,610
So we based. And it can be we're.

309
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:50,410
So we have that in. I think it's like the first line is, see?

310
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:54,590
I mean, oh, that's easy.

311
00:45:54,590 --> 00:46:03,709
And I mean, if you look yeah, there's the is is the first line is difficult.

312
00:46:03,710 --> 00:47:02,400
So I need to sweep that. Okay. Okay.

313
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:12,750
And then these are 1.48.

314
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:22,260
Okay. So we have the beginning inventory of AC.

315
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:44,920
We'll see years. At the beginning of month one, they have a backlog of 40,000 difficult and 16,000 is 60,000 easy.

316
00:47:50,790 --> 00:48:19,760
40,000. Okay.

317
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:40,740
So now we have. At the beginning, one of the admin staff has 70 experience claim processors and each month each can hire ten trainees.

318
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:50,410
So seven. 70.

319
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:58,350
Needed experiencing month long 70.

320
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:06,670
And then you can hide in three of you.

321
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:10,530
So the upper limit of hiding is in.

322
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:22,810
So was kidnaped. And this is this is going to be a decision very will zero range ranging.

323
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:31,530
So that they know was right.

324
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:38,620
Okay. And what else do we said?

325
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:48,570
At the end of each month, 5% of experience employee quit and 20% of trainees are final.

326
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:56,969
So the point is that you hire a trainee one month and it really works for one month.

327
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:04,530
And then if that trainee is not hired, the three need next month because they experience empathy.

328
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,940
Right. So that's how they are. So if we are.

329
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:22,630
If we have 70 experience at the beginning and zero trainees this year,

330
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:38,809
we have a place here to put that number of hours per employee permanent, and then a person with an experienced workweek is 5%.

331
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:49,390
Right. And 20% of complaints of just three days are 5%.

332
00:50:53,960 --> 00:51:03,160
And 20. Since the hours.

333
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,090
61, 61, 60.

334
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:26,000
Oops. So what seems to long?

335
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:32,710
You're in there.

336
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:45,830
All the parameters that I would like to put here, minutes per claim for each type of worker experience and easy an experience hard to.

337
00:51:49,700 --> 00:52:00,019
Smooth experience easy and experience hard so hard fought and six easy and hard forensics.

338
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:07,940
I'm just going to do the forensics that.

339
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:19,990
So good. Four, six, seven.

340
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:27,430
And we have the minutes we have.

341
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:43,810
And then we have all the fun we need to do an interview about the moms with all these these number of employees.

342
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:52,690
And we have the number of hired and let's see how we can then be gaining experience of next moves.

343
00:52:53,110 --> 00:53:04,750
So this is going to be equal to the beginning experience of who he didn't win.

344
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:10,930
So this one was a win with 3.5%.

345
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:22,510
And then I know that. And in the new higher amplitude screen?

346
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:28,160
No, actually, it is the beginning experience.

347
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:37,220
So is the the number of trainees that were hired last time who were not fired.

348
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,700
So when I was 20, was it.

349
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:57,510
Right. Right now, this is vague. Remember that we are going to get fractions of experience.

350
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:10,730
What we are going to think of that later. But now let's format these so it doesn't show decimals.

351
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:23,430
But from. Look.

352
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:36,730
So that should be the number eight goal.

353
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:52,270
I'm doing what I need to do now. I am going to get the ending inventory of easy the ending inventory part and all of that.

354
00:54:53,410 --> 00:55:10,840
So I think before I, you know, I decide on that what one way new what what do I need to know?

355
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:18,260
Before I can compute the ending inventory. What we need to know.

356
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:30,170
So I have the beginning inventory of easy and the new claims to the process.

357
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:37,639
This is new lives and claims the process.

358
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:57,550
So we have these two. We have these 60,000 here and 75,000 is some of these to win that that was the beginning inventory of over.

359
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:07,440
But what I need to process in the you know the first moment only the amount that I have to work in the first month.

360
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:22,370
So. So one of the things we need to decide right, is how many easy by experience and easy by trainees.

361
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:26,900
These are by experience and how by trainees. I can have found.

362
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:30,120
So that's going to be another set of this is your bearings.

363
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:33,360
Right. So from one.

364
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:51,950
A. I think those because I don't know these all these numbers, I need to design them.

365
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:59,690
So I have a number of employees working and the manager needs to tell them, okay, you are, you know,

366
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:12,340
you you are going to process these many he's making this maybe a sign blank space and and by training he's

367
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:22,010
right and the thing is that you have constraints on those that you cannot exceed 17 amount of is put in.

368
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:29,520
If to start, we may. It's a very.

369
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:51,800
We want to. The 40.

370
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:09,110
And those are going to be decision makers, right? All right.

371
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:20,810
So now I think we can make a we can calculate the ending inventory of easy and the ending inventory of hard, right.

372
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:32,180
Because if we have the beginning inventory of easy to know the new process, the new claims to process,

373
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:45,200
the easy claim to process minus the claim process by trainees and easy by trainees and easy by experience.

374
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:51,230
Then then we got the final ending the inventory of easy way.

375
00:58:51,890 --> 00:59:11,550
So this is going to be. Close to the beginning inventory easy was the new easy claims to process and then miners.

376
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:29,410
The easy process, life experience minus the easy process by three means handling in the process by training.

377
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:36,940
And then you get. I said.

378
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:45,389
The ending inventory of card is going to be equal to the beginning.

379
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:48,930
Inventory equals hard dollars.

380
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:59,890
A New Heart claims to process Midas.

381
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:06,400
The Heart claims to work by experienced workers.

382
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:13,570
Miners. The heart claims that were handled by trainees.

383
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:30,590
Okay. All right. So now I think we definitely know what the beginning inventory of easy for next months is going to be is going to be one.

384
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:39,820
35,000 athletes are going to be in England, Antonio, from this month.

385
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:50,450
And then this is going to be to the ending material part from the beginning.

386
01:00:53,830 --> 01:01:06,250
And these two scores, they can just copy this formula and they can copy everything they can.

387
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:23,250
And then I have my ending inventory of easy ending inventory of hard, you know, all the calculations, correct?

388
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:32,410
No, I know that they every month they open limit on easy on the upper limit on the part is 50,000.

389
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:37,090
Yes. So it's 50,000.

390
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:52,839
And the. Only four months.

391
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:56,410
237000 people. Only four. One, two, two, seven three.

392
01:01:56,790 --> 01:02:07,660
Yeah. Thank you. Think.

393
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:29,750
Okay. So this one is from 2 to 7.

394
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:46,849
And I know that the ending inventory of easy and hard has to be zero because

395
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:54,170
they want to pull the process clean or the clean process by the end of the.

396
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:25,030
Okay. Now the moon's run to the.

397
01:03:51,040 --> 01:04:08,970
So we think we. India is bleeding the most, but they are saying it cannot be lost.

398
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:27,730
So what we know about these constraints is that the ending inventory, both easy and hard, has to be less than or equal to the respective over limits.

399
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:34,990
So. His family.

400
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,960
These lesbians they had to be able to consider.

401
01:04:54,780 --> 01:05:01,320
Okay. Now, let's see what we have here.

402
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:12,360
These three knees higher and the number of trainees has to be less than or equal to ten.

403
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:32,510
Right now because these is dumb.

404
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:38,260
These are going to be also this issue that he was let me put that in yellow.

405
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:49,210
And I am going to put you know, any number is eight nine in each one of the.

406
01:05:56,450 --> 01:06:01,380
Okay. Right now.

407
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:19,310
So we can assign some, you know, some some easy, you know, something some planes to go on expedient or to phases.

408
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:22,970
Now, let's see. Mobile number one here.

409
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:26,300
I need to check on the strains on the minutes.

410
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:35,730
So we need to know how many minutes are going to be used by experience and how many minutes are going to be used by three need.

411
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:48,440
So let's compute the month one. That means by experience, right is going to be the easy experience times.

412
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:57,790
What mean how many minutes an experience worker needs to improve it?

413
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:10,640
We need to process an easy claim and the means by train these times.

414
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:30,760
And they. And so. And it means that that the number of hard claims and how times how much time it takes and experience one third to handle it partly.

415
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:36,239
So it's going to be equal to. So we're talking about experience.

416
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:44,460
Here is my experience. Times when we go in and process easy by experience.

417
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:51,990
Experience easy for maintenance and then pain and loss.

418
01:07:53,700 --> 01:08:01,940
Then we need to, you know, look at experience hard, okay?

419
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:09,970
And then we multiply that times experience heart broken speed and cognitive ability.

420
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:21,350
And then we have both day meetings. And this is, of course, and we have all the minutes that have been used by experience worth.

421
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:37,040
So we make these. You have.

422
01:08:45,000 --> 01:09:01,799
And they know I'm going to do the same. They may not used by trainees is going to be a number of claims of easy easy, clean process by trainees.

423
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:06,440
Easy by training times. Easy by trainees.

424
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:16,080
You. We had no.

425
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:22,210
Easy hired by trainees.

426
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:28,750
It's great to be here. Times are wider in these.

427
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:56,340
I think we can cope with that by. Now because we put the same number, so we get the same number of minutes.

428
01:09:57,030 --> 01:10:06,370
Now we know that that means you'd have to be less than or equal in the minutes available.

429
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:17,969
Right? And the means available are, you know, but we're looking at all the employees that are all the trainees and all they experience.

430
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:27,450
Right. And we know that they can work at 60 hours per week.

431
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:47,250
Do it. So now this this look at all the minutes available by experience is going to be equal to the social experience worker, which is this one.

432
01:10:48,930 --> 01:10:58,920
Okay. So those are the ones that we have lost the means times.

433
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:17,470
It means so reasons that the union experience times 160 hours probably per month.

434
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:28,620
Then if we want to get done in 2 minutes and we have more than 60.

435
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:36,120
So those are the.

436
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:50,670
And then the minutes available by trade knees are going to be equal to the number of trainees that they have,

437
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:57,930
in this case, three times the same thing.

438
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:12,270
160 times 60 minutes.

439
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:22,730
And then. No, I can only.

440
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:34,890
This is made at millions of animals by rabies and millions of animal life experience.

441
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:43,860
Finally, then we out the total number of higher materials that some.

442
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:54,050
Most. Only three of these items.

443
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:05,540
Our 72. We want to minimize that amount by.

444
01:13:20,030 --> 01:13:26,030
Okay. Okay.

445
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:29,450
I think we have the computations done.

446
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:35,660
Now we need the constraints and, you know, to specify the constraints.

447
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:43,580
And so this is you can see that we have time for neurons.

448
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:56,420
So and you're going to help me with this. So let's and when I do this, you're going to realize that we are missing a a constraint.

449
01:13:56,630 --> 01:14:05,000
And then I wanna see if you can solve where is the constraint that we are going to be missing, you know.

450
01:14:22,850 --> 01:14:37,230
Yeah. So we know will will do the the blue and the computations later so is easy easier for

451
01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:43,130
for us to remember what what is what what is computation and what's that hard data.

452
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:47,210
But for now, let's, let's start to solve this problem.

453
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:54,829
And the first time we're going to solve this problem, I'm going to ignore that.

454
01:14:54,830 --> 01:15:00,990
Here we have fractions of beginning of experience working.

455
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:06,170
So I'm going to solve it as fractions of XP of work, which is fine.

456
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:27,890
So I am going to go to solve, very easy to solve and I'm going to minimize right from the projective function we

457
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:38,210
use to minimize the total training time and then by changing which cells will.

458
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,580
Right now we have two logs, right?

459
01:15:41,090 --> 01:15:55,370
We have the number of trainees higher each month and how we allocate the the claims between trainees and that experience.

460
01:15:56,210 --> 01:16:11,660
And so we have this is going to be one and homework one and then this is going to be another clock.

461
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:21,380
So those two ones, okay, now let's get the constraints.

462
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:25,400
So what the constraints are going to be. Let me.

463
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:47,690
The obvious constrains that we have right now is that the ending inventory from one to 2 to 7 have to be less than or equal to this 50,000 here.

464
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:56,420
So the Excel will understand, you know, the balance and the sell side.

465
01:16:58,550 --> 01:17:09,950
So I'm going to add that these to an inventory of eight be equal to zero.

466
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:21,830
So that's why we also know that the number of employees.

467
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:33,200
And the number of employees hired.

468
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:41,360
Must be equal to ten.

469
01:17:46,690 --> 01:17:55,000
So do we also know that the number of employees must be an integral number?

470
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:58,990
So we kind of lean 9.5 to 2.

471
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:13,450
So we're going to specify that those are the used and they went to the experience worker probably ending up with B fraction and sorry.

472
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:17,980
I mean, the experience could end up being fractional.

473
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:27,230
Yeah, but we said that we are going to lend the experience workers B fraction first, you know,

474
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:35,980
and then we are going to make the constraint that we know that the thing is is easier

475
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:45,549
to put constrains in the decision variables than is done in the calculated variables.

476
01:18:45,550 --> 01:18:52,030
So and it's going to increase the number of of going with the complexity pretty high.

477
01:18:52,390 --> 01:19:09,940
So what the problem suggested is that for these numbers instead of just first, so we like these and the second is to round that with no decimal.

478
01:19:10,510 --> 01:19:12,820
That means that we hope that this email solved.

479
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:24,610
The problem is that if you do that, the problem becomes nonlinear and then you need to solve not with the simplex algorithm but the usual solver.

480
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:30,280
So which might take some work done. So we are going to do both.

481
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:46,530
And this time I want to play you more.

482
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:49,540
So we are going to finish this next time.

483
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:12,380
The challenge for you is and when I bring you more things too, why should it be used for you is to show this.

484
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:15,950
See if you can solve it. Now let's born in the constraints.

485
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:19,470
And so. So spirit. Very.

486
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:34,890
It is just.

487
01:20:37,870 --> 01:20:50,840
Oh. It comes interested.

488
01:20:55,280 --> 01:21:04,100
I don't think that's why the. Let's go.

489
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:10,610
Yeah. I'll look out for you now.

490
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:16,460
Yes, indeed. Wait a minute.

491
01:21:17,570 --> 01:21:20,620
You have some time so I can go get some.

492
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:27,610
Most people are businessmen for years.

493
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:38,060
But first of all, these people who are absolutely real men.

494
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:43,070
So quick. Thank you.

495
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:11,820
Thank you. It was right now.

496
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:35,600
And then you can honestly say that it's a sign of the things that you're going to talk to me.

497
01:22:36,770 --> 01:22:50,610
Okay. Yeah. So let's do that, because I have three people right now in both sides.

498
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:54,140
Yeah, I need to meet some individuals in my office.

499
01:22:55,670 --> 01:23:02,390
So I will be. You can look at those people.

500
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:14,990
Okay. So I see that Zoom security panel thought that I submit for eight or nine slots.

501
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:23,780
So that should be fine. I will I will send out your email to you if you think you will.

502
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:36,260
You know what? You can you can do. You can grow you this.
