1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,960
On free clinic is a free clinic here at Michigan that is for underinsured or uninsured people.

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,980
They can come and get free services and it's in collaboration with other schools.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,590
But then you have EMS for medical pharmacy, all that kind of stuff.

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:23,940
Appointments are conducted through students, and we're looking for student volunteers to come and join our team.

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,510
We will train you guys. They'll do.

6
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,170
It's like a motivational interviewing, nutrition counseling.

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,910
So if you decide to come do it, you're like training in how to do motivational interviewing, how to counsel.

8
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:47,459
You won't be doing these appointments by yourself. You'll be a registered dietitian on the call with you who can jump in and give you you can

9
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,040
help with the appointment and also to give you notes afterwards on like what was good,

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:59,879
what could be better. And yeah, we'll training through all of this, but if that's something you're interested in, like feel free to reach out to me.

11
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,900
I can leave my email or my phone number or whatever is helpful.

12
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,749
Let me see if I. Yeah.

13
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,670
So appointments are Tuesdays and Saturdays and you sign up just on a volunteer basis.

14
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,530
It's really low commitment.

15
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:24,290
It's great just to get experience and counseling and working with like dietitians and just other conflict related assessments.

16
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:31,620
Yeah. Yeah. And then when you get signed up, I will get you set up with like a Google voice as you use your phone number,

17
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,700
but it's not actually your phone number just to connect with the patients and the dietitians.

18
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:45,360
So once you get signed up, will be set up with that. You know, I'm also part of NASA Nutritional Students Students Association.

19
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,200
Oh, nice one. Right. One, there is a few spots left on our board.

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,370
So the first year representative and professional development chair is also paged.

21
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,270
You represent an interface to students as well.

22
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:07,060
And so this is a great way to gain leadership experience, resumÃ© and just connect with second years and just be a part of the sciences.

23
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,680
So those nominations are still open I think until Friday.

24
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,460
So you can self nominate nominate someone else. But yeah, it's a great way to get involved.

25
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,820
Yeah, I'm just going to leave my email up here and if you're interested in volunteering,

26
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:27,450
you should maybe email that I will help you in with are keep you updated on trainings and stuff like that.

27
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,470
So earlier I advocated for those for you all to get involved.

28
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:42,570
I know the first semester folks may be, you know, taking it, you just getting used to being in grad school.

29
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,850
But I really encourage you to get involved in student organizations, especially those of you in dietetics.

30
00:02:48,270 --> 00:03:00,270
And I just wondered, Jen, when we as faculty are writing your recommendation letters and we are asked about your efforts in professional advancement,

31
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,069
leadership and so forth,

32
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:09,900
it's really nice for us to be able to look at your resume and see that you've been involved with a student organization taking some leadership role.

33
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:15,950
That's not the only way to gain leadership experience, but it's certainly a great way to do so.

34
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:22,920
So and I also just want to put a plug in to the student run free clinic.

35
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:30,030
I just talked to some students who started up their first year, got oriented,

36
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:37,660
trained, didn't necessarily you know, it wasn't a it wasn't a terrible time for me.

37
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,020
It was it was a it worked for their schedule and they said the experience was just amazing.

38
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:51,060
So and for somebody to plug in that, that's just feedback from some of your students who did it their first year.

39
00:03:51,120 --> 00:04:00,300
And you will be taking a course in counseling and medication interviewing with Dr. Sonego.

40
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:09,570
This is a great way to already have your feet on the ground and go in with a perspective to sort of elevate your standing that much further.

41
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:17,130
You have to have any questions. Yeah, what I said already said it was like, is it worth working on your schedule?

42
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,989
Like, yeah, so appointments are on Tuesdays and Saturdays and it's on a volunteer basis.

43
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:27,990
So you just sign up on the time slot that you have and then the patient will be assigned if we if we have patients,

44
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,850
it's really a lot of time commitment hands. You don't have a huge high volume of patients right now,

45
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:38,570
but that could change when we're we're trying to get more involved with the med students to get with people,

46
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,750
to get more referrals and like when to refer to all remote.

47
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,910
Yes, it's all remote. Yep. So you can do it anywhere.

48
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:51,540
It's just if on your phone they also won't have your phone number, you'll be set up with like a Google voice number so they can't contact you.

49
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,070
You can contact them. Well, this merger between the dietitian, you and the patient.

50
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:04,150
Thank you. See. Okay, well, feel free to shoot me an email if you're interested.

51
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,750
It's up there. If they're interested in an essay.

52
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:15,160
Oh, yes. I can hear what they said on the email for the Google form, but it implied that I'd be able to as well.

53
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,070
So good to see you, too, Cynthia. Thank you for telling us all for him.

54
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,270
Absolutely. I want to thank you.

55
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:51,140
Okay. So today we're going to start talking about the monitoring in the United States.

56
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:56,420
Again, this is an activity that's conducted in all countries and varied.

57
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:03,230
You know, the activities of the monitoring system may differ a little, but there's a lot of similarities from country to country.

58
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:10,729
Some of the topics that we're going to be going over will revisit in nutrition assessment,

59
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:17,480
because these are sometimes broad stroke assessment approaches at a population level.

60
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:22,849
So we'll talk more about them as we go through them.

61
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:27,020
So the first system I want to talk about is the food availability data system.

62
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,040
But before I get to that, I can announcement there's an NIH seminar opportunity.

63
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,910
It's not a full day webinar. It's just a video cast.

64
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,940
And it's about the gut microbiome and dietary acculturation, which looks really interesting.

65
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,250
So it looks like all you need to do.

66
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:58,240
I have a link down here, but if you just type in the title, it'll take you to very two very informal sites.

67
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,820
One looks almost like a nightclub anyway.

68
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:07,160
Either of those sites will get you to the link so that you can register.

69
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:18,649
So again, a great resource because these again are going to be all individuals who research focuses on these topic areas.

70
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,020
And actually, I think it's only a small panel at this point.

71
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:29,840
Also, just a reminder that your food for thought assignment is due Friday at noon PM.

72
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:43,730
And also, Carol, Shannon is going to be coming in to class next Monday to go over using library resources for lunch literature searches.

73
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:49,939
Okay. So those of you who are undergrads may be already familiar with the system,

74
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:55,429
but those of you new to Michigan, this is a really good use and important resource.

75
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:01,520
And students have said afterwards it was really a good refresher on how to conduct literature searches.

76
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:10,090
And so she'll actually do some search activities to get you guys thinking about how to improve searches for reviews and again,

77
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:21,140
for this course, but also beyond. And the point is, Carol has a couple required modules that are on canvas for Monday.

78
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:32,530
And so if you could work through as many modern, you know, modules as you can, that would just provide you a background for when she comes in to talk.

79
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:42,220
Okay. So today we're going to talk about food availability, the supply data as a part of the framework for monitoring,

80
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:49,610
understanding the basis of the data, the significance of loss adjusted as well as applications.

81
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,300
So has anybody worked with food availability data, the food supply data?

82
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,890
No. And just a reminder that, again,

83
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:15,710
nutrition monitoring is critical activity and it is part of our assessment of nutritional adequacy and food availability in the United States,

84
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:28,490
but also in other countries. This is the framework that is nutrition monitoring in the United States.

85
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,060
And you can see off to the left here is the food supply.

86
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:42,710
Next to it is consumption by individuals. How do we assess consumption by individuals in the United States?

87
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,150
That's our sort of cornerstone surveillance.

88
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,430
Of food consumption. Food intake of individuals in the US.

89
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:02,340
And Heinz? Yeah. So we're going to talk first about food supply that we're going to talk about and Heinz.

90
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:09,960
We will get to some of these other components of the nutrition monitoring in the United States on Wednesday.

91
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:15,040
And in other classes. Okay.

92
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:21,710
So food availability data system is part of the USDA.

93
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:35,530
So it's USDA and the specific agency within the USDA, United States Agriculture Department of Agriculture is the Economic Research Service, IRS.

94
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:43,480
So they are that that's the agency that is responsible for the supply data.

95
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:52,150
This data tracks food availability since the early 1900s.

96
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:57,850
And so we can look at trend data. We can look at certain commodities.

97
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:04,610
What's a commodity? Grains beef.

98
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,940
Yeah. Yeah. So that's those are examples of commodities.

99
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,999
It's just a basic good or the other way to think about it.

100
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:23,190
It's a basic agricultural product that oftentimes can be consumed as is,

101
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:30,880
but then many of them are often then they disappear or taken into the retail or marketing.

102
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,290
I'm not marketing, but manufacturing of food to make other products.

103
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:45,600
Okay. So, so the data series tracks, food availability tracks these commodities year to year.

104
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:54,600
And again, we have data that goes back to the early 1900s and they track about 200 basic food commodities.

105
00:11:55,210 --> 00:12:04,530
And we have two different data series. We have food availability, which is the primary food supply data system.

106
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:15,360
And then we have lots adjusted. And I'll talk about one suggested once the food availability system or the food supply,

107
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,970
it's sometimes called food supply data, it's sometimes called disappearance.

108
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:28,140
And it simply means the food supply that disappears into the retail system,

109
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:33,389
either food like apples disappearing into the retail because consumers are buying the

110
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:39,300
apples or it disappears into the retail because it's being manufactured into applesauce.

111
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:47,390
Okay. So sometimes the ability we call it food availability in this country, some countries call it food supply.

112
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,020
Some call it food balance or balances.

113
00:12:51,320 --> 00:13:01,940
So it's called different ways depending on the country. But the food supply data is based on what food is available, available in a given year.

114
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:15,330
So obviously any food produced in that year is going to be part of the food supply imports.

115
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:24,370
I'm looking at this box here on the far left. So production of food or production of basic goods imports.

116
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,030
So any produce that we import or grain.

117
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:34,440
Anything that we import, plus any beginning stocks.

118
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,630
So what might we have stocks of from the last year?

119
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:51,630
So anything that did not disappear into the retail system from the prior year is ending stocks and becomes the beginning stock for the following year.

120
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:54,720
So what might be stocks? What kind of commodities?

121
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,020
Corn. Corn grains?

122
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,920
Yeah. Anything that can be stored. Right.

123
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:11,490
So those on the far left box, that's what's in the food supply that we have in a given year.

124
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:27,900
But we have to subtract from that data, any of that product that was a produce that might be used for animal feed or it might be used.

125
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:32,490
Some corn is used to produce ethanol for fuel.

126
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,380
So commodities that are produced or imported.

127
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,930
Any of that that's not used for food, for human consumption has to be deducted.

128
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:55,250
That's why it's called the balance sheet food balance. And that generates our total annual food supply of a given commodity.

129
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:03,670
I'm. So and that's in pounds.

130
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,470
So if you look, we may have tons. You know, it's oftentimes it's in tons.

131
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:15,280
If you look at the actual data sheets, tons of grain or tons of sugar or so forth,

132
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:22,480
then what they do is they divide the total annual food supply of a given commodity.

133
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,020
They divide it by the total population, which we get from the U.S. Census Bureau.

134
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:38,010
And that gives us the per capita food availability per person food availability.

135
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:48,570
And that's generally how it's done. And that's your basic balance sheet, food balance sheet.

136
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,350
So production imports minus.

137
00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:03,120
Any kind of, you know, food or not food, but commodity product that is not not used for human consumption gives you total supply,

138
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:18,520
which then you divide by the total population. It's very important to not interpret this this per capita food availability as individual food intake.

139
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:27,310
It is not and should never be discussed as individual consumption.

140
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:41,950
It's a proxy because it's per capita, but it's it's not cannot be used to call that individual food intake.

141
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,640
It's just not a measure. It's just a proxy customers.

142
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:51,249
This is the balance sheet just in graphic figure.

143
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,250
But the reason for putting this up is in years past,

144
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:59,860
I've had some students really interested in the whole food supply or food availability data system,

145
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:11,770
and the National Academies put out a review of the food availability food supply system in the United States to review it,

146
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,339
to see if there's places that need tweaking and adjusting and so forth.

147
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:21,280
And this is a really good overview of the food availability system for those of you interested in.

148
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,209
So this is a workshop report. So again, I just put that out there.

149
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:32,260
For those of you that are interested, it just goes and explains a little bit more about the process and data and so forth.

150
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:41,810
One thing that I wanted to say also is some students have been curious about what the data actually looks like.

151
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:47,959
There is a agency within the USDA or maybe even the Economic Research Service.

152
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:57,440
It's called the National Agriculture Statistics Service, and that is the group that generates all the data.

153
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:03,920
I mean, it's just spreadsheets and spreadsheets of data on the food balances.

154
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:14,390
So for those of you interested, you just would do a search of NASA and then have to get into the technical reports.

155
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:24,350
In other countries, the data on food supply may come from Ministry of Agriculture and think what others

156
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:32,420
or any other agency that's agriculture based may also be the source of data.

157
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:38,630
Our food supply data. This is an example of food availability.

158
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,989
This is beef, pork, chicken and fish. Shellfish.

159
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:51,350
Again, it's in pounds per person, per capita, and it's showing trend data from 1910 all the way up to 2010.

160
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:57,440
And so you can see the utility of this. It's kind of nice to be able to just see how.

161
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,360
You know, food preferences have shifted over the years.

162
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:14,410
We certainly are consuming more chicken than we did in the early 1900s.

163
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:21,880
Beef consumption was pretty high in the 1970s and into the eighties, and then that came down.

164
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:27,490
Somebody have any idea why beef consumption was so high in the seventies and eighties?

165
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:32,710
If you think of it from a marketing standpoint or.

166
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:42,540
Actually from that standpoint, it would be marketing. The dip is probably coming from other public health messages.

167
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,080
So what kind of marketing might have been going on? Was it the beef?

168
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,900
That's what's for dinner campaign that the USDA is doing.

169
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:57,149
Yeah, but at the same time, like the chickens going up, the beef going down around 1977 when US dietary guidelines were first instituted,

170
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:00,770
when they were talking about eating more lean meat, less saturated fat. Right.

171
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:11,370
So we were getting more information about the concerns of beef consumption being associated with cardiovascular disease risk.

172
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:19,890
And so it's not too difficult to go back and look and see how consumer trends shift

173
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:25,080
based on the public health message messaging coming out from research or again,

174
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,080
the research. You know, what's what was it? What's for dinner?

175
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,330
Meat eaters? What's for dinner? Beef. What's for dinner? Right. Right.

176
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:42,870
So there was some pretty strong, strong word, pretty, I would say aggressive beef campaigns in the seventies and so forth.

177
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,059
Did the U.S. ranchers eventually sue Oprah for like she got into an argument

178
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,720
with them saying beef was not what it was for dinner because she's so powerful?

179
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:56,150
Yeah. Marketing perspective. I actually think there was something where they sued her about.

180
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:06,770
Yeah, yeah. This one is showing from 1972.

181
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,490
2020. Trends in fresh vegetables.

182
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:23,980
So what do we see here? What's noteworthy in this figure, Mark?

183
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:31,410
What's more, potatoes gone down. So potato consumption has gone down.

184
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:42,630
But it's gone up. Yeah.

185
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:48,240
Tomatoes. Yeah. You have to ask, what's the form of the tomatoes going up and up?

186
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:54,930
So we had something. We're just saying the greens are very similar.

187
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,180
So I've tried to think which ones that have, but it's from the romaine.

188
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,660
I know, I know. I don't know why they did that, I'm assuming.

189
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:10,750
Well, it's not the even the legend is not in the order. So. Yeah, you can't tell really what I think.

190
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,700
Headlines. He's gone down.

191
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,420
I think there's more green consumption. So I suspect one of those the one that's going down is okay.

192
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:33,100
I'm just noting that broccoli has gone up disgusting. I just think it's interesting that the tea has gone down.

193
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:37,610
I think statistically, is it like French fries that because vegetable that people eat like.

194
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,420
Yeah. Yeah. Overall, though. Yeah. It would be interesting.

195
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,390
So, you know, these are the kinds of questions then researchers might see.

196
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:53,540
You know, this is sort of a good first sort of overall glance at what's going on in terms of trends in food supply.

197
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:59,360
But then that's where NHANES comes in, where we can see much more at the micro level.

198
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,290
What are people reporting in the last 24 hours?

199
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:06,799
And take a look at total consumption that's going down.

200
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:12,260
But what forms of potato are we seeing? Yeah, I thought that this wasn't consumption.

201
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,469
I thought this was food failed. It's food availability.

202
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:19,010
NHANES, we can look at the micro level for the actual consumption.

203
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:25,090
Yeah, but I mean, if it's going down, that means consumers are purchasing less of it.

204
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,320
So more demand is going down. Right. Right.

205
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:34,489
Yeah. Sorry, I didn't mean to say consumption twisted here, but yes.

206
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:41,960
So if food supply and disappearance is going down, that means fewer consumers are purchasing.

207
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:48,829
And so then the following year, when they do the forecasting, there's a recognition that, oh,

208
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:58,580
we need less potato because consumers aren't buying as much potato or there's less potato going into the manufacturing and so forth.

209
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:04,640
So somebody had their hand up. I was going to say, that could just be like a production.

210
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:15,470
Well, it could be, you know. So, for example, we probably are going to see some really quirky things going on because of the pandemic with production.

211
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,850
But when you see a trend like that, you know, over several years,

212
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:27,950
that means especially with potato, there's a lot of different manufacturing routes for potatoes.

213
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,129
So something like that is beyond just manufacturing issues.

214
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,550
The consumer is purchasing less potato.

215
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:46,989
Or the better way to say this, less potato is disappearing into the retail system, fewer pounds of potato.

216
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:51,880
That's better. But I say that fewer pounds of potato are disappearing into the retail system.

217
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:59,570
So interesting. Yeah. Any other thoughts about?

218
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:13,810
This data can also be used to compare just looking at the general sort of basic food groups.

219
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:23,200
So if you just look if you lump the commodities kind of into various food groups and compare it to the dietary guidelines,

220
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:29,080
we can see how we're doing again relative to the guidelines.

221
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,530
So the gold bars are in 1970, the blue bars.

222
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:44,110
And because we've seen and we can see that although vegetable and fruit, well, not really fruit, but vegetable intake has increased a bit since 1970.

223
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:52,420
We still have a long way to go to actually meet the dietary guidelines of, you know, intake per day.

224
00:25:54,580 --> 00:26:05,350
So again, this is just another way of using supply data to sort of approximate get a sense of where food is disappearing,

225
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,750
how it's being used or consumed.

226
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:16,989
Do you think that with dairy that that for because it actually dropped below like the ones where just as time went on it actually got lower.

227
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:22,720
The consumption isn't. I suspect both fruit and dairy are probably not statistically different.

228
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:32,560
I do think that dairy in general, if we look at trends in sugar and dairy, I think in general dairy has kind of gone down.

229
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:41,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

230
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,340
Want to shift gears and talk about loss adjusted data.

231
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:59,780
So this is where they estimate the loss that occurs with commodity products going from the orchard,

232
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:05,990
where it's grown to the retail site and then to the consumer.

233
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:16,610
So if we think about this as an example with apples, we can think about the loss that could occur just going from the orchard to the warehouse.

234
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,720
Right. Some apples are going to perish.

235
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:29,420
There's loss from the warehouse to which probably includes storage to stores, retail stores.

236
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,150
You know, loss can happen. I've seen apples that shouldn't even be on the shelves.

237
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:40,910
Even if they're ugly, they're spoiled and some are ugly and still good.

238
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,640
And then once it's purchased by the consumer, there is loss.

239
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:53,630
I don't know about you, but I don't eat the core. And that adds to the weight.

240
00:27:54,410 --> 00:28:02,750
Right. So loss adjusted data is going to provide more accurate food supply data.

241
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:10,310
So ideally, you want loss adjusted data for every single commodity.

242
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,310
Just let me finish that thought here. Hang on.

243
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:26,900
The problem is, is that determining where loss occurs when each commodity at every step requires research and money.

244
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:31,010
And so we don't have a loss adjusted data for every single commodity.

245
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:39,920
And in some countries, they don't have the economic infrastructure for economic.

246
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:47,280
Basis and infrastructure to do a lot of loss adjusted.

247
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:59,130
So important point here is just to highlight that loss adjusted data is going to be more accurate if you just looked at apples.

248
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:07,170
Just the food availability of apples that pounds per capita are going to be an overestimate

249
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:13,980
of the actual amount that's available to disappear because we know there's a loss.

250
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:24,270
And so loss adjusted data is going to give us a more accurate estimate of what's available to disappear into the retail system.

251
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,680
And if it's not loss adjusted, you always want to be thinking, oh,

252
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:36,710
this is actually probably an overestimation of what's actually available, but actually available consumption is likely lower.

253
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,370
Yes. So what's happened to something like Collapse of the farm?

254
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,790
Wait. Start with an entire cow or just that we started processing.

255
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:55,120
So with meat there is a different approach. And if you get into the loss adjusted data, they have technical reports for each of the commodities.

256
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:03,459
And you can take a look. I would go through them and there's so many if this, then that if this, then that.

257
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:09,700
I can't even begin to remember to share it with you.

258
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:20,140
So what I do is it's a great question. If you're interested in loss adjusted data, just do a quick search of lost adjusted data to the IRS website.

259
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:25,450
And there's technical reports that talk about how they do the loss adjustments.

260
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:34,690
Yeah, you know, like with meat, I assume that right from the get go, they don't count bone in the things that aren't consumed.

261
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:38,540
But at some point, you know, some people trim fat off, others don't.

262
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:46,180
So there's some loss adjusted that I'm sure a made I just can't remember off the top of my head how they did it but.

263
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:55,470
Any questions about Glass suggested? Yeah. I just want to clarify what you were saying about, like, the overestimate.

264
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:00,120
That's just if you can't get the loss adjusted data right.

265
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,290
That we're going to have lost adjusted data for every commodity.

266
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,929
And in some countries, they don't have any loss adjusted.

267
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:16,260
So it's important to recognize that food availability data, if it's not loss adjusted, is likely an overestimate.

268
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:24,240
But the very reason that we know there's always some loss along the system.

269
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:31,680
Thank you. And where this comes into play and why this is important, I thought I had a slide on it, but I don't.

270
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:40,680
Sometimes they will use food availability data to just approximate the calories that are available per capita.

271
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:52,680
Well, if you don't have loss adjusted data that cone calories are going to be overestimated that are available for our per capita.

272
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:00,540
So that's an example where if I was reading a paper and they were talking about the only

273
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:06,570
data that they had regarding the food available to the population of that country.

274
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:16,590
And they were talking only about food availability without loss adjusted and it was talking about potentially the term in calories or pounds.

275
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:21,060
You know, it's an overestimation because it's not loss adjustment.

276
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:27,030
Yep. And then just to clarify, too, so since this is looking at country wide,

277
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:35,280
is the underlying assumptions that everybody has equal access to, like a food available, like you have it like per capita.

278
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:42,390
It is per capita. You are not making any assumptions about who has access demographics.

279
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:47,620
They got it just. And so I guess that is an assumption that everybody is in the same field.

280
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:53,850
Are you because it's simply dividing by the population of the country?

281
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:59,640
Yeah. Now, in some countries where they don't have we'll talk about this in nutrition assessment,

282
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:08,490
but this is a very broad stroke means of assessing food available to the population of a country.

283
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:17,070
The next step would be to assess household level food consumption or food availability.

284
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,580
At that point, we can talk about it as consumption at the household level.

285
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:29,520
And then the micro level is when we assess food intake at the individual level, which we can do it.

286
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,080
And hence in some countries where they may not have that micro level detail,

287
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:40,530
they sometimes will use food balance or food availability to make some assumptions,

288
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:48,080
and they try to bring in some more data sometimes maybe they might even bring in some household data to try to get at a micro level.

289
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:52,440
But it's still estimates, right? Only estimates.

290
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:02,100
Okay. So in general, it's used to monitor the average level of food intake.

291
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:08,209
Again, it's proxy. So that first box there, they talk about it in the documents.

292
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:18,860
But I just want you to know, this is just a proxy estimate because it's really just per capita food availability per capita.

293
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:27,350
It shows trends in food consumption. Again, we're really, really saying shows trends in food disappearance.

294
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:33,990
Estimate consumption trends, and it's used to develop and assess policies.

295
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,620
In these documents, they just, you know, they state right at the beginning.

296
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:42,360
Food availability data is a proxy of individual consumption.

297
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:51,600
But I just want you to be comfortable with saying it's really through it's appearance in the retail system and it's a per capita value.

298
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:58,300
In pounds. Limitations.

299
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:05,090
Again, it doesn't measure individual food intake. It only estimates basic food commodities.

300
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:11,730
So it does not estimate like processed food and use.

301
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:20,090
It's just estimating commodities. So data is derived from both food production.

302
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:27,080
So it can't estimate where the food is consumed or whether it's consumed at home versus fast food,

303
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:31,250
and it's not stratified by a region or any other category.

304
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:39,410
So again, if you think about what data is actually being collected, it makes sense that we really can't look at it at a micro level.

305
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,890
Well, we don't at the moment look at it at a micro level.

306
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:58,690
For those of you who are doing international work or you're here for a global MPH, so forth.

307
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:03,190
Just note again, food availability is.

308
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:09,839
I collected in most, if not all countries. I'm assuming it's collected in all countries,

309
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:21,240
but I always hate saying all I could be wrong and that the FCO provides the food supply data from all the different countries.

310
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,620
So again, for those of you interested, you can just access.

311
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,450
So when you go into this website,

312
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:34,499
you select the data tab and then it will have all the different countries that have food supply data and you can go into that country.

313
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:41,040
And then there's all sorts of different menu options for looking at food availability.

314
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:48,569
And that data is also like a per capita data, and that represents a range overall so that there might be some differences in different countries.

315
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:53,670
In terms of regional data. I'm just saying, in the United States, we don't have regional data.

316
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:57,170
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

317
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:03,540
Any questions about food availability? I might.

318
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:12,790
You use it? I use it at all.

319
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:18,720
I'm going to go back real quick to the slide. You can see trends.

320
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:28,440
You can see trends. Yeah. And you potentially use it for like tax support or support for farmers to produce certain commodities.

321
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,280
So for farmers, this is. Yes. Potential use?

322
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:35,970
Absolutely. Yep. I was just reading something about farming.

323
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:44,940
To not know like a farmer would definitely want to see something like that. He was being considered for, you know, not disappearing, right?

324
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:56,580
Yes, absolutely. Farmers, I am sure, must use this data on some level or, you know, if they're part of a group that is monitoring food trends,

325
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:07,440
because this is really how we can monitor food consumer trends aside from and Haines is what are this is maybe again not at

326
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:16,080
the micro level but we can see if certain fruits that are imported are being disappearing at a higher level and so forth.

327
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:23,550
Yeah. As nutrition protect our public health professionals, how might use this data.

328
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:37,059
Yeah. Trying to potentially look at it as like certain deficiencies in the population.

329
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:44,400
So like, I mean, more green vegetables are being lower in.

330
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:54,040
There's a lot you can use this as just, you know, as part of your sort of background of what's going on in the population.

331
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,670
You might even use this for presentations.

332
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:07,389
If you're giving if you are doing any kind of education of other professionals or community health workers, you might access this data.

333
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:15,010
And I reason I went back to this is if you pull up that link at the top,

334
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:22,480
there is data products and if you select that link, there's all these interactive charts that you can use.

335
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:30,100
I think there's like almost 7000 different interactive charts on commodities that you can use.

336
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,960
Some of it includes food security.

337
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:38,950
So, you know, this is just a potential source that you might use professionally if you ever need to give a presentation.

338
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:44,649
Yeah, I was thinking more from like the research stance of maybe a fruit or vegetable with decreasing,

339
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:50,710
why it was decreasing and if there was an outbreak of a disease that might have occurred and what people are buying up produce.

340
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:58,059
Yeah. Yeah. So you could use it from reading, from research and I have seen food availability data used in research.

341
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:11,380
So there was maybe four or five years ago there was a paper out about salt consumption and this where it's all kind of back in the in the it's not,

342
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:20,740
it never left. But we're revisiting it with earnest effort to from a public health standpoint to get salt consumption down in this country.

343
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:28,899
But there was a paper out that looked at salt consumption based on NHANES and and then they also looked

344
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:35,560
at the disappearance of salt to see if it was showing a consistent trend with what Heinz was showing.

345
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,759
So that's another way is, you know, sort of two different sources.

346
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:46,360
One is sort of, you know, lens out looking at it broadly using food availability data,

347
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:52,600
whereas at the end Heinz level, we're looking at for individual consumptions.

348
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,600
So that's another. Yeah. Research, absolutely. Yeah.

349
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:04,670
The government is a policy making and trends and concerns about do we need to subsidize potato farmers because consumption is going down so little,

350
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:08,380
we need to then start training them to grow other crops. Can they grow other crops?

351
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:13,600
It is quite yes, it is used what it is used all the time for agricultural policy.

352
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:19,000
And then I think like the USDA is tasked with marketing U.S. agriculture.

353
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:24,730
And so they see that there's training down in something of how they should use sales marketing standpoint.

354
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:31,660
Yes. I'm not sure.

355
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:38,530
So, you know, to be honest, I don't see as much marketing coming out of the USDA as I did.

356
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:45,969
So was it during the Obama administration when Cheese was I can't remember which administration.

357
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:51,790
It might have been the one before where it was a promotion for cheese because we had a lot of cheese.

358
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:56,889
But I'm not seeing as much promotion coming out of the USDA.

359
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:06,520
And frankly, I don't like to see promotion coming out of the USDA for promoting commodities, but that doesn't mean that they're not.

360
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:16,570
You know, if we have an abundance of one commodity beans, you know, of the manufacturers aren't using as much as the consumers are buying as much.

361
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:27,970
There may be policy or discussion on how to use that product or to train to help farmers make adjustments in what they're actually growing.

362
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:32,080
So, yes, one long answer to yeah, yeah, it is.

363
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:40,720
So that's exactly it. It doesn't really show, but it's that bottom left, that bottom right box used to develop and says policies.

364
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:52,720
That's huge. And that's why we have a whole national agricultural statistics service to inform those who are forecasting policy.

365
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:59,880
So, yes. Okay. You guys doing okay?

366
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:10,060
You want a five minute break? Now, the voter through would take a break.

367
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:15,840
You take a break. Let's take a five minute break and break.

368
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:31,084
Yeah. What are you doing? I'm writing this, so I have one reader to speak of since we usually get a lot worse.

369
00:43:33,328 --> 00:43:36,988
I mean, any of these things, like she contacted the president.

370
00:43:38,818 --> 00:43:48,048
That's next on their list, essentially. But she did it like it's like like I said.

371
00:43:50,998 --> 00:43:55,318
Okay, let's finish up with the end.

372
00:43:56,848 --> 00:44:01,908
Certainly anybody you work with means anything.

373
00:44:02,158 --> 00:44:19,198
You put it in an emptiness survey. But when you're a student who had participated, we were just running questions for you.

374
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:28,618
Okay, so here we just be able to explain the role of NHANES in national nutrition monitoring.

375
00:44:28,918 --> 00:44:35,577
One of the objectives of names in this country describe in general with the survey format, just needs some general,

376
00:44:35,578 --> 00:44:44,248
familiar familiarity with names, as well as identifying some of the indicators that are collected measured by agencies.

377
00:44:45,298 --> 00:44:49,198
So again, going back to our framework of nutrition monitoring in the U.S.,

378
00:44:49,498 --> 00:44:55,858
we talked about the food supply component, and now we're going to be talking to consumption of individuals.

379
00:44:56,488 --> 00:45:01,288
And so here with NHANES, we're collecting 24 hour recalls.

380
00:45:02,938 --> 00:45:07,258
As well as a bit of food frequency information.

381
00:45:09,238 --> 00:45:18,298
In addition to nutrition, there's a whole culture and demographic and economic component to the survey.

382
00:45:20,678 --> 00:45:24,248
So again, it's our cornerstone of nutrition monitoring.

383
00:45:24,668 --> 00:45:29,378
So it assesses both the nutrition and health of adults and children in the US.

384
00:45:31,148 --> 00:45:36,158
So it provides national data. This national data is accessible.

385
00:45:39,018 --> 00:45:47,867
People can download it. Researchers can use it to conduct research to look at everything from just descriptive data on

386
00:45:47,868 --> 00:45:54,768
dietary intake to relationships between dietary intake and disease and other health outcomes.

387
00:45:56,438 --> 00:46:05,418
The examination includes a nutrition component medical, dental laboratory, biochemical tests, as well as physiologic measurements.

388
00:46:05,438 --> 00:46:18,887
So it's it's pretty broad. The goals of RN Hanes again as part of our nutrition monitoring is to estimate the number of

389
00:46:18,888 --> 00:46:32,298
percent of individuals designated subgroups that have disease risk risk factors or have disease.

390
00:46:34,168 --> 00:46:41,698
Monitor trends in the prevalence and awareness, treatment, control, risk behaviors, environmental exposure.

391
00:46:42,088 --> 00:46:53,338
Some of this is self-report, but some of it is backed up with biochemical data and then analyzed risk factors for selected diseases and so forth.

392
00:46:53,548 --> 00:47:04,138
And this provides the data that researchers can then again, look at diet and disease relationships or health outcome relationships.

393
00:47:09,078 --> 00:47:12,458
The history of engines is actually kind of interesting.

394
00:47:12,468 --> 00:47:21,978
If you are interested, if you just go to this link and just get rid of this and go back to enhanced this, a historical link.

395
00:47:22,848 --> 00:47:30,708
And it is kind of interesting to look at how our survey came about in this country, and it's been through a number of iterations,

396
00:47:32,028 --> 00:47:43,847
but you can see here in the top box there, there was periodic engines conducted as early as 1971 and then as of 1999.

397
00:47:43,848 --> 00:47:47,388
It is now continuous. It's done annually.

398
00:47:48,078 --> 00:47:56,028
We did have a survey that was done in the early eighties that focused strictly on our Hispanic populations.

399
00:47:59,758 --> 00:48:04,708
Since then, what has happened is they just oversampled our.

400
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:14,068
Subpopulations so that there is, there is.

401
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:24,448
What's the word I want? By oversampling it, it improves the data for statistical analysis and so forth.

402
00:48:24,448 --> 00:48:33,927
So our sub subpopulations, minority populations, ethnic, racial pregnancy, women who are pregnant and so forth.

403
00:48:33,928 --> 00:48:36,837
Again, those populations, younger children,

404
00:48:36,838 --> 00:48:47,008
older adults will be oversampled or have been oversampled in earlier surveys to improve the data estimates.

405
00:48:47,578 --> 00:48:53,518
I noticed in one of the documents I read that as of 2021 they were no longer oversampling.

406
00:48:54,778 --> 00:49:04,648
So I didn't. There was no explanation as to why. National Representative Sample of non institutionalized U.S. citizens.

407
00:49:04,888 --> 00:49:10,468
It's conducted annually for in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.

408
00:49:12,178 --> 00:49:20,038
Columbus conducted annually 5000 individuals and the data is released every two years.

409
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:26,668
So we get continuous data and it's put out descriptive, wise description.

410
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:31,708
Descriptive statistics are put out by the USDA,

411
00:49:32,758 --> 00:49:42,958
and then researchers will often dig deeper into the data and we get much more refined in our data coming out of research.

412
00:49:43,828 --> 00:49:50,608
When I say non institutionalized, that strictly incarcerated or any kind of so is incarcerated individuals, those in prison.

413
00:49:50,608 --> 00:49:57,808
It is anyone who is in some sort of mental health facility.

414
00:49:58,048 --> 00:50:03,358
And it is also our older adults who are in long term care.

415
00:50:13,878 --> 00:50:17,568
These are some of the subgroups that have been oversampled in years past.

416
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:25,008
And again, as of 2021, apparently they are not oversampling.

417
00:50:25,008 --> 00:50:31,368
So I'm not sure if it's just from a methodological standpoint, they no longer have to or if there's a different approach.

418
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:43,348
And as I said, it is just the 50 states and the District of Columbia.

419
00:50:43,378 --> 00:50:52,368
I was trying to remember if I could remember, Puerto Rico had been included, but it's not it doesn't appear to be in the news.

420
00:50:53,708 --> 00:51:01,728
Okay. These are the medical conditions and health indicators.

421
00:51:01,738 --> 00:51:08,488
These are just some of them that are assessed and some of which are.

422
00:51:12,258 --> 00:51:15,648
Self-reported and some of which is collected directly.

423
00:51:18,478 --> 00:51:26,908
And there's overlap for some of these in terms of self-report as well as being actually assessed by a doctor or nurse.

424
00:51:31,178 --> 00:51:39,787
And his survey includes an in-person questionnaire with a focus on health and demographics.

425
00:51:39,788 --> 00:51:47,228
So either somebody from name staff will visit someone in a house or it will be conducted over the phone.

426
00:51:48,218 --> 00:51:53,588
So that's the first step, is in-person at the house or through via phone.

427
00:51:54,138 --> 00:52:01,328
There's questionnaires, multiple questionnaires that these folks have to respond to.

428
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:07,238
This is the self-report component on your campus page today.

429
00:52:07,508 --> 00:52:11,378
At the very bottom, under optional readings and resources,

430
00:52:11,738 --> 00:52:20,518
there is a brochure that outlines the questionnaire that's done, the in-person questionnaire or the telephone line.

431
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:30,098
It's done initially. Then it has the segment on which you guys have, which is the in-person medical examination, the laboratory component.

432
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:36,008
And then there's a follow up examination survey, and that's not done in person.

433
00:52:36,008 --> 00:52:46,958
That's done by phone. So you guys have the whole brochure that shows what's covered on the various three bullets.

434
00:52:48,158 --> 00:52:52,718
I have a handout that just has part of the brochure that we'll revisit in a minute.

435
00:52:53,138 --> 00:53:02,228
The post examination questionnaire is a follow up, so the physical examination and laboratory component is the in-person,

436
00:53:03,728 --> 00:53:14,708
where they actually go to one of those trailers and they meet with a dietitian or staff that collects a 24 hour recall and some food frequency.

437
00:53:15,338 --> 00:53:22,148
The Post Examination Questionnaire. There's a follow up, 24 hour recall that is conducted over the phone so that we have to.

438
00:53:22,898 --> 00:53:28,298
They also ask some follow up questions regarding prostate screening.

439
00:53:28,628 --> 00:53:33,728
And I think there's a hepatitis C follow up based on some of their lab work.

440
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:39,218
So this post examination questionnaire is just a follow up from.

441
00:53:39,788 --> 00:53:44,378
The second is you want me to just make sure I've got it all here?

442
00:53:50,048 --> 00:53:54,688
Yes. All right.

443
00:53:55,258 --> 00:54:00,298
So if you if you take a look at this is the brochure.

444
00:54:00,598 --> 00:54:08,938
This is the table of contents. So table one, which you don't have, but it's on that PDF that's on your campus page for today.

445
00:54:09,748 --> 00:54:22,258
Questionnaire components for table one refers to the first all the in-person questionnaire or the either conducted in their house or by phone.

446
00:54:26,338 --> 00:54:30,738
Table two, which is on page seven with you.

447
00:54:30,758 --> 00:54:33,298
And you don't have page seven either.

448
00:54:33,718 --> 00:54:41,278
That's the post examination questionnaire, and it just shows the different topics that are covered on that questionnaire.

449
00:54:42,598 --> 00:54:46,108
And what you have is part three and four, table three.

450
00:54:46,108 --> 00:54:50,458
And for the components of the questionnaire and the laboratory.

451
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:11,498
So the first page, eight and nine, is of all the different examination components, they're measuring everything from hearing loss balance.

452
00:55:12,198 --> 00:55:19,148
Now, so if you take a look at the different, you know, the sample description for balance,

453
00:55:19,688 --> 00:55:25,238
that makes sense that you're actually accessing adults middle age to older age.

454
00:55:25,418 --> 00:55:29,388
Right. Why are we concerned about balance?

455
00:55:31,818 --> 00:55:35,178
Because poor balance increases risk of falls. Right.

456
00:55:35,688 --> 00:55:40,138
Yeah. Why the pressure?

457
00:55:40,168 --> 00:55:45,958
Eight years and older. So just take a look at the different measurements here on page eight and nine.

458
00:55:49,698 --> 00:55:55,618
If it's one thing I just to orient you, we have the indicators on the far left.

459
00:55:56,218 --> 00:55:59,528
We have the actual sample description in the middle.

460
00:55:59,938 --> 00:56:04,948
And then on the right. If it's dark, it means that the data was collected.

461
00:56:04,948 --> 00:56:11,668
Or at one point the data that was collected is slightly different than the original sample.

462
00:56:11,698 --> 00:56:16,438
If there's a white bar, then that means the data is not collected.

463
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:26,078
And you can see at the top there is all the different NHANES survey iterations from 1999 all the way up to 2019, 2020.

464
00:56:26,098 --> 00:56:29,218
So you can see when data was collected, when it wasn't.

465
00:56:31,678 --> 00:56:35,308
The age ranges or the ages in which they do collect data.

466
00:56:38,098 --> 00:56:46,978
And then on page ten, from ten to page 17, are all the labs that are collected depending on the age group.

467
00:56:55,258 --> 00:57:00,688
So for example, are they collecting data on nutritional status?

468
00:57:01,978 --> 00:57:11,858
How do we assess nutritional status? For our record, that's assessing nutritional intake adequacy.

469
00:57:11,878 --> 00:57:13,318
How do we assess status?

470
00:57:13,768 --> 00:57:26,458
BMI, that's a proxy, but how do we actually assess nutritional sense as they're looking at different vitamins like vitamin B6, B12?

471
00:57:26,468 --> 00:57:34,468
You can see looking at the serum levels, we're actually looking at the biochemical levels in a person right now.

472
00:57:35,278 --> 00:57:44,398
So nutritional status is assessed generally with biochemical tests, there are some deviations that but in this case.

473
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:48,258
So they're looking at.

474
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,408
So they assess some of the micronutrients. Right.

475
00:57:51,418 --> 00:58:00,248
Folate is assessed. Iodine is assessed iron.

476
00:58:03,628 --> 00:58:08,128
They're not assessing all. So what would they be focusing on?

477
00:58:16,328 --> 00:58:24,548
It's expensive to collect biochemical samples and then run them through a lab for this many subjects.

478
00:58:24,638 --> 00:58:31,838
So why would enhanced include some reasons for including or not including nutrients.

479
00:58:32,468 --> 00:58:36,158
Cost. Cost. Okay. Yeah.

480
00:58:37,418 --> 00:58:40,957
I was going to say some nutrients like have links to a lot of different diseases.

481
00:58:40,958 --> 00:58:44,438
So if you're able to find like the more like portfolio and stuff.

482
00:58:44,618 --> 00:58:46,598
Right. An indicator for more than just one. Yeah.

483
00:58:46,718 --> 00:58:53,648
So some nutrients, there may be a fair amount of research going on and interest and continued research interests.

484
00:58:53,648 --> 00:58:56,798
And so they're going to continue to collect. What else?

485
00:58:58,738 --> 00:59:07,378
Yeah. There might be some kind of immediate concern about something that occurred recently that they want to find out.

486
00:59:07,468 --> 00:59:08,728
Yeah. Yeah.

487
00:59:09,108 --> 00:59:18,897
Maybe it was a nutrient that we weren't collecting data on, but now there's some information that's come out of research from multiple researchers.

488
00:59:18,898 --> 00:59:24,508
And so it's recommended that a particular nutrient should be monitored.

489
00:59:24,868 --> 00:59:30,808
So it's like the glucose and the cholesterol part of that because I this is like that that it's still in progress.

490
00:59:31,348 --> 00:59:35,888
Yeah. And. Yeah.

491
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:45,568
You'll note that glucose and cholesterol, I'm assuming this cholesterol glucose has been collected since they started, as well as cholesterol.

492
00:59:45,658 --> 00:59:49,978
Yeah. So there's some that is collected all the time consistently.

493
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:57,238
So when you look at something like Mercury, why are there specific subgroups for mercury assessment?

494
00:59:58,138 --> 01:00:01,198
It's going to be depending on location.

495
01:00:02,218 --> 01:00:10,258
People are closer to water. And so that could be.

496
01:00:12,298 --> 01:00:17,668
But here they're describing certain age ranges, that type of exposure.

497
01:00:19,618 --> 01:00:28,978
Yes. Eating versus working at industrial sites or what could be the water versus mother's milk?

498
01:00:29,068 --> 01:00:36,478
Yup. You're on the right track. What's the concern with exposure to developmental?

499
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:42,568
Like the way it affects the development children or females who are pregnant.

500
01:00:42,748 --> 01:00:48,567
Right. So you'll note that mercury is assessed in children and women of childbearing age,

501
01:00:48,568 --> 01:00:58,648
and mercury is particularly problematic for those to some populations, children who are in their developmental phases.

502
01:00:58,678 --> 01:01:02,208
Mercury can adversely impact likewise.

503
01:01:02,608 --> 01:01:07,048
Mercury can adversely impact women who are exposed to it and are pregnant.

504
01:01:07,438 --> 01:01:11,488
Okay. So those are just some examples of why.

505
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:16,018
So they may be monitoring mercury, but it may only be in a subpopulation.

506
01:01:16,858 --> 01:01:23,638
Likewise, why would researchers be interested in chlorate or thorium cyanide?

507
01:01:24,808 --> 01:01:31,318
So that's actually assessed in urine and what subgroup is being assessed and operate in by assigning.

508
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:47,768
Takes it over. Yeah. So why might that be?

509
01:01:53,378 --> 01:01:57,457
Development, which is so developmental issues, but it's six and over.

510
01:01:57,458 --> 01:02:08,078
So this is also a concern for adults. What interaction can perchlorate and so cyanide have with particular nutrients?

511
01:02:08,078 --> 01:02:11,828
Anybody know? That's kind of the key here.

512
01:02:12,308 --> 01:02:24,198
One of the reasons why they're they're also monitoring it because perchlorate is an industrial waste product is found in like fuel for airplanes.

513
01:02:24,218 --> 01:02:28,418
It can be part of that. There's multiple industrial.

514
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:39,438
Avenues for perchlorate to end up in our water supply is that has an interaction with a particular nutrient.

515
01:02:39,618 --> 01:02:45,768
So anybody know what it might be? Is it iron? It's not iron that I know of.

516
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:57,138
Iodine? Yes, iodine. So you guys will learn next semester in vitamins, minerals.

517
01:02:57,438 --> 01:03:09,048
But chlorate and thylacine mate can bind to the transporter that takes up iodine in the thyroid gland.

518
01:03:09,768 --> 01:03:15,538
And if it binds to the transporter, it's going to prevent iodine from being taken up in the thyroid gland.

519
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:18,828
And we need iodine to produce thyroid hormones.

520
01:03:19,278 --> 01:03:28,398
And so this is particularly concerning for children, but also very concerning for women who are of childbearing age.

521
01:03:29,058 --> 01:03:37,338
So this is it's being monitored for a number of reasons, but that's a link with a nutrient as to why that's particularly concerning.

522
01:03:38,988 --> 01:03:47,658
So I like this for sure because it's kind of interesting to just kind of go through, take a look at what has been survey, what hasn't.

523
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:57,798
And, you know, some things are, as you guys had highlighted, they may be assessed at one point, but not assessed.

524
01:03:58,638 --> 01:04:02,778
Again, that just maybe it was a research interest at the time they got the information they

525
01:04:02,778 --> 01:04:07,408
needed and decided that it wasn't something that had to continue in some cases.

526
01:04:07,428 --> 01:04:15,348
Like, for example, I think it's vitamin D and E, it's just periodically assessed because vitamin E and vitamin A,

527
01:04:15,348 --> 01:04:22,008
we tend not to have a very high degree of vitamin E or a deficiency.

528
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:28,128
If anything, with vitamin D, we have problems with over consumption.

529
01:04:28,848 --> 01:04:34,188
So those are only tend to be periodically and then others we just obsess all the time.

530
01:04:34,268 --> 01:04:39,588
Yeah. How long does this take to collect all this data?

531
01:04:40,248 --> 01:04:43,428
There's a reason why it's only put out every two years.

532
01:04:43,488 --> 01:04:48,287
Because it takes a while to know, just like from the individuals going through all of this testing.

533
01:04:48,288 --> 01:04:52,818
And then they're like in person questionnaire, like for that survey or how much.

534
01:04:53,538 --> 01:04:59,328
So if you get into the actual and hence there's a video and I don't know if they talk about how long it takes,

535
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:04,968
but I do know that if you go on to a link in this post that.

536
01:05:08,598 --> 01:05:17,087
Well that offers that. This is just an example of the trailers I was talking about, where they actually do the physical exams,

537
01:05:17,088 --> 01:05:23,477
where the subjects actually participants actually go to the sites and everything.

538
01:05:23,478 --> 01:05:27,108
All the measurements are taken, dietary intake is collected and so forth.

539
01:05:29,218 --> 01:05:33,318
This is just all the different research that's conducted using NHANES data.

540
01:05:34,668 --> 01:05:38,928
I'm trying to get to where is it? Oh, this link here.

541
01:05:39,528 --> 01:05:44,538
If you guys just pull this link up, but get rid of this and just go to NHANES.

542
01:05:44,868 --> 01:05:55,488
There is a to all the documents, there's a procedural manual for the questionnaires and they talk about the estimate for how long it takes.

543
01:05:55,788 --> 01:06:00,138
And I remember glancing through it and I remember thinking, Oh, it would take as long as I would have thought.

544
01:06:00,648 --> 01:06:06,828
So you can actually get the minutia details in those procedural manuals.

545
01:06:07,518 --> 01:06:13,518
I mean, what a nice transparency with all the documents. So that's an important sign.

546
01:06:17,858 --> 01:06:25,148
Many questions. Yeah. Is there an incentive for people to do this besides just like you're being a good person,

547
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:34,808
like they get information back, so they will get lab results and they will get they will get information back.

548
01:06:35,798 --> 01:06:42,048
And so the video suggested that the fact that there is a monetary is there a monetary?

549
01:06:42,068 --> 01:06:45,698
Yeah. And so I guess there's a monetary. And that's not surprising.

550
01:06:45,698 --> 01:06:48,098
I mean, they are dedicating quite a bit of time.

551
01:06:48,908 --> 01:06:55,508
There's at least the day before or two days or however a day before when they have to do that first questionnaire,

552
01:06:55,508 --> 01:07:00,938
then they have this train, you know, where they go through in person and then they have the post.

553
01:07:00,948 --> 01:07:08,528
So that would make sense. That would be a monetary. But they do get information and feedback or some of the results back.

554
01:07:09,088 --> 01:07:13,217
Yeah, I wouldn't do it because it wasn't clear.

555
01:07:13,218 --> 01:07:20,707
Like you'd see a whole families going in and you've called like just the parents or just the two kids out of a go to check our family.

556
01:07:20,708 --> 01:07:26,108
If you're asked to do what is the whole family's done? I don't know how that works.

557
01:07:26,738 --> 01:07:31,358
Actually, I wanted to look out because some of the questionnaires, the the teenagers,

558
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:34,658
I'm assuming, are going to be answering those questions, not the caregiver.

559
01:07:34,868 --> 01:07:38,318
But it really wasn't detailed in the manual how that's handled.

560
01:07:38,648 --> 01:07:42,128
So I'm not sure that level of minutia of how that to work.

561
01:07:42,278 --> 01:07:48,188
Know that's why when we had somebody who actually was there, I was like, well, I'll ask,

562
01:07:48,818 --> 01:07:53,998
but really what you need is a person who has staff involved in the actual collection,

563
01:07:54,008 --> 01:07:59,548
the data to know, I'm sure somewhere it's written but kind of read through some of those manuals.

564
01:08:00,968 --> 01:08:05,318
It's a good question. The government agencies in charge of,

565
01:08:05,318 --> 01:08:10,897
responsible for and hence Department of Health and Human Services and CDC are

566
01:08:10,898 --> 01:08:15,188
responsible for the sampling design methodology as well as data collection.

567
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:25,508
And then the Department of Agriculture and the RS, which I was again with that, is Agriculture Research Service.

568
01:08:25,778 --> 01:08:30,728
They're the ones that do the data, methodology, analysis and processing,

569
01:08:31,028 --> 01:08:38,168
and they put out some descriptive statistics for mandates which you guys will be able to access for your needs assessment.

570
01:08:38,828 --> 01:08:42,458
And you can also use it professionally if you are doing a presentation.

571
01:08:43,778 --> 01:08:58,628
This is where the descriptive statistics as well as other data briefs that provide some information on that data itself you can access.

572
01:08:59,078 --> 01:09:11,018
And so this is really useful data tables and there's even some publications where you can like for your needs assessment.

573
01:09:11,018 --> 01:09:18,608
You can actually like copy that, that figure into a like slide or something.

574
01:09:20,798 --> 01:09:24,158
This is an example of NHANES data being used for research.

575
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:29,768
So this was a large study. Well, it's using and handed out.

576
01:09:29,768 --> 01:09:32,708
So that's a large study being redundant here.

577
01:09:33,278 --> 01:09:42,068
They wanted to know this is assessing the prevalence of nutrient intake adequacy or inadequacy in the US population.

578
01:09:42,338 --> 01:09:52,328
And here we're looking at here it's men greater than 19 years of age and the survey period was 2011 to 2014.

579
01:09:52,808 --> 01:09:58,088
And so we have nutrients here on the left and then we have two columns.

580
01:09:58,418 --> 01:10:01,718
So the values are percentages.

581
01:10:03,398 --> 01:10:06,547
Well, actually the value is the actual mean number.

582
01:10:06,548 --> 01:10:16,958
And then in the parentheses I guess is the percentage is that right now these are percentages of.

583
01:10:21,568 --> 01:10:24,998
Let's see. Food security status.

584
01:10:25,018 --> 01:10:34,468
Now, that is percentage. So it's the prevalence of inadequacy by food status, food security status.

585
01:10:35,128 --> 01:10:39,598
So you can see that for, for example, for calcium.

586
01:10:41,608 --> 01:10:56,457
Food insecurity had a higher percentage of inadequacy when compared to a food secure individual or percentage phrase.

587
01:10:56,458 --> 01:11:02,248
That 25% of food insecure have inadequate calcium intakes.

588
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:08,008
Only 20% of food secure individuals have inadequate calcium intakes.

589
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:16,018
Sorry, that was the way to interpret that. So this is just an example of using enhanced data.

590
01:11:16,468 --> 01:11:21,418
This is looking at inadequacy. In this case,

591
01:11:21,418 --> 01:11:25,858
it was stratified by food security to see if there were differences in the

592
01:11:25,858 --> 01:11:30,147
proportion of the population that had inadequate intakes based on their food.

593
01:11:30,148 --> 01:11:37,788
Insecure or insecure. Okay.

594
01:11:37,938 --> 01:11:43,398
And this is, again, if you're interested in the methods or how to analyze,

595
01:11:43,548 --> 01:11:47,658
these are resources that have all those technical documents that you can access.

596
01:11:49,098 --> 01:11:53,868
That's all I have. Any any questions?

597
01:11:59,658 --> 01:12:12,258
I always hope and Heinz would come to Ann Arbor and think they have it all right.

598
01:12:12,738 --> 01:12:16,668
One thing I did forget at the very beginning, to just do a quick shout out.

599
01:12:17,388 --> 01:12:22,488
Liz got all your topics assessed.

600
01:12:22,818 --> 01:12:24,868
You went through and left comments.

601
01:12:24,888 --> 01:12:33,498
Be sure you review those comments before you move ahead with your background sections and if you have any questions.

602
01:12:33,768 --> 01:12:41,118
I know a couple of you have made comments and to our comments and I will follow up,

603
01:12:41,298 --> 01:12:47,908
but I'm happy to if anybody has any follow up questions regarding or your background.

604
01:12:48,618 --> 01:12:52,308
I think we're done every day. And I'll see you on Wednesday.

605
01:12:52,488 --> 01:12:56,548
Thank you. What do you.
