Hello, this lecture will be
a companion to the previous lecture

2
00:00:10,127 --> 00:00:11,890
on two sample t-tests.

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,480
In this lecture, we will provide
a visual approach to how t-tests work.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,110
Recall that the two sample t-test
is essentially trying to ****

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:25,190
how distinct two populations
are with respect to their means.

6
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,360
So let's return to the example
we used in that lecture.

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,570
The first population were the babies
born to women who are living in poverty.

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,370
Each of the yellow dots represents
one of the babies in our sample.

9
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,890
The second population consisted
of babies who were born to women

10
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,790
who are not living in poverty.

11
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,830
In each of the blue dots represents
one of the babies in the sample.

12
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:54,980
We visualize each of the two samples as
a cluster of observations within a circle.

13
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,830
The sample mean is represented by
a red square in each of the samples.

14
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:05,580
Again, the distance between these two red
squares would be my signal in my data.

15
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,810
The radius of each circle represents
the sample standard deviation or

16
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,340
how far the observations spread
around their sample mean.

17
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,242
These two radii represent
the noise in the data.

18
00:01:20,242 --> 00:01:24,690
The t-test will quantify how distinct
the two clusters appear from each other

19
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,520
by measuring the distance
between the two sample means

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,690
relative to the amount of
variability around those means.

21
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,400
This first plot,

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,500
plot A represents a t-test that would
give a highly non-significant result.

23
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,170
The two squares although
distant from each other

24
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,580
are not strong enough relative to the
amount of overlap between the two circles.

25
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,750
We see a vast number of yellow dots
that fit within the blue circle and

26
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,270
a vast number of blue dots that
fit within the yellow circle,

27
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,430
meaning that these two samples
are not distinct from each other.

28
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,640
There is too much noise in the data for me
to see a difference between the two groups

29
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,800
and the distance between the two sample
means is lost among all the noise.

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,890
If we move the circles further apart,
I have now increased the size

31
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,810
of the numerator of the t-statistic, which
is the distance between the sample means.

32
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,936
Although the noise is the same,
the size of the circles is the same.

33
00:02:20,936 --> 00:02:25,210
The distance between the circles grows,
which pulls them apart.

34
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,080
There is now less overlap
between the two samples.

35
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,120
And therefore the t-statistic
will be larger and

36
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,650
the p-value will become smaller.

37
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,170
If we move these two circles even
further apart, the sample means are now

38
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,420
much further apart and there is no
overlap between the two samples.

39
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,600
It is very easy to see that
we have two samples of data

40
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,490
that come from two distinct populations.

41
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:55,200
The p-value therefore, from these data,
would be very, very small.

42
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,093
Now, let's return to Plot B, but instead,

43
00:02:58,093 --> 00:03:01,535
we keep the two sample means
the same distance apart.

44
00:03:01,535 --> 00:03:05,598
But I increase the size of the circle
corresponding to the babies born to

45
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,760
mothers who do not live in poverty.

46
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,800
We see that although we have signal,

47
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,330
a difference between the two sample means,
that signal is harder to see, because now

48
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,930
the larger circle is overlapped with the
yellow circle more than it did in Plot B.

49
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:25,125
There is now increased noise,
the denominator of the test statistic.

50
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:30,758
And this leads to a smaller test
statistic and therefore a larger p-value.

51
00:03:30,758 --> 00:03:33,450
Conversely, I could take Plot B and

52
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,130
I could instead reduce
the size of the blue circle.

53
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,430
In this case, although the sample means
are the same distance apart, it is easier

54
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,460
to detect this difference because there
is less overlap between the two circles,

55
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,220
due to the smaller amount of
noise in one of the samples.

56
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,000
Hopefully these visual representations
give you some more intuition

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,804
underlying just how a two
sample t-test operates.
