1
00:00:10,524 --> 00:00:13,627
In this module, I'm going to talk
with you about occupational health,

2
00:00:13,627 --> 00:00:16,785
an incredibly important
discipline within public health.

3
00:00:16,785 --> 00:00:18,935
You might ask why is this so important?

4
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:22,115
Well, unless you have a trust fund
once you finish this degree or

5
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:24,985
perhaps already you're going
to be out in the workforce and

6
00:00:24,985 --> 00:00:28,025
you're going to have exposures
in the occupational environment.

7
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:33,420
So hopefully this lecture maybe more than
most has a personal connection to you.

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,462
Why should we care about occupational
health beyond that personal connection?

9
00:00:37,462 --> 00:00:40,390
I want to compare and
contrast occupational health to some

10
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,470
other common public health maladies
that we face in the United States.

11
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,970
So let's talk about the number of people
who die each year from some major sources

12
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:53,130
of mortality in the US and
also the estimated cost.

13
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,317
So cardiovascular disease is the top
killer of Americans, it kills about

14
00:00:57,317 --> 00:01:02,121
635,000 people per year at a cost of
almost half a trillion dollars per year.

15
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:04,391
That's a huge public health problem.

16
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:11,517
Cancer kills slightly fewer people, about
600,000, at a cost of about $219 billion.

17
00:01:11,517 --> 00:01:18,230
Stroke kills 142,000 Americans,
at a cost of about $63 billion per year.

18
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:23,230
Finally, the lowly influenza virus
kills over 50,000 Americans a year

19
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,730
at a cost of $20 billion.

20
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,675
Those are huge burdens.

21
00:01:26,675 --> 00:01:31,285
We've dedicated a lot of resources to
addressing them and had some success.

22
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:35,246
On the flip side, if we look at
occupational health, in the US in any

23
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:40,193
given year we kill somewhere between 4 and
6,000 workers directly on the job.

24
00:01:40,193 --> 00:01:43,524
And another 50 to 60,000
workers will die of

25
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:48,110
occupational related illness at
a cost of about $52 billion.

26
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,278
So in the workplace, we're killing more
people than the flu kills at a cost

27
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,944
approaching that of stroke.

28
00:01:53,944 --> 00:01:55,867
But unlike the flu and the stroke,

29
00:01:55,867 --> 00:02:00,259
we don't really have national coordinated
efforts to address this problem.

30
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:01,701
If we zoom out globally,

31
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:06,310
almost 3 million people die each year
as a result of occupational fatalities.

32
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,797
That's about 7,500 people each and
every day, or

33
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:14,914
about 5 to 7% of global deaths, of which
the vast majority of from disease, but

34
00:02:14,914 --> 00:02:21,420
about 1,000 out of those 7,500 are from
immediate acute fatal injuries.

35
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,300
So we've covered the exposure disease
framework in several other modules.

36
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,310
I'd like to return to it here just to
refresh your mind and focus on the fact

37
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:35,270
that in occupational health, all of these
steps are occurring within the workplace.

38
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,340
We've talked about other agencies that
regulate environmental health generally.

39
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,510
In the US, there's one agency
that's specifically responsible for

40
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,340
regulating occupational health.

41
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,280
And that's the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, or OSHA.

42
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,980
This agency was established by
the Occupational Safety and

43
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:57,010
Health Act in 1970 and given very broad
powers to regulate workplace conditions.

44
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,260
Unfortunately, a lot of the exposure
limits that OSHA has for contaminants and

45
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,190
hazards in the workplace were adopted from
voluntary guidelines that existed all

46
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,120
the way back in 1968.

47
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,490
Most of those have never been updated.

48
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,560
OSHA does have something called the
general duty clause, which basically says

49
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,300
employers can't simply expose
workers to unsafe conditions.

50
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,316
Even if there's no specific standard or
limit that applies to them.

51
00:03:21,316 --> 00:03:25,010
People often are unaware of
OSHA's limitations, though.

52
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,230
OSHA has no jurisdiction over federal or
state workers.

53
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,080
OSHA is a very small agency.

54
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,931
They have about 1 inspector for every
60,000 workers and they're responsible for

55
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:39,380
covering and
enforcing 9 million workplaces.

56
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,810
And so while some industries will say,

57
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:46,730
we're very concerned that OSHA could come
inspect us at any time, statistically

58
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:51,990
the odds of a company getting inspected
by OSHA are once every 57 years.

59
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,670
So if you as a worker are waiting for
OSHA to come around and

60
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,800
check out your work place,
I have a news break for you.

61
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,320
It's not going to happen.

62
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,076
I would like to give you some examples
of standards that OSHA has passed and

63
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,146
now requires employers to comply with.

64
00:04:05,146 --> 00:04:07,567
So employers have to
provide fall protection so

65
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:09,690
workers aren't injured through falls.

66
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,357
They have to prevent workers from
being exposed to infectious disease.

67
00:04:13,357 --> 00:04:18,430
That they are safe when they enter
what are called confined spaces.

68
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,800
They have to ensure that workers aren't
exposed to excessive amounts of chemicals.

69
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,960
They have to put guards or enclosures
around dangerous machines to make sure

70
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,910
people can't come into
contact with those machines.

71
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,012
Employers have to provide respirators and

72
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:35,522
other safety equipment that workers
can wear to keep themselves safe.

73
00:04:35,522 --> 00:04:39,387
Employers have to provide health and
safety training to workers and

74
00:04:39,387 --> 00:04:44,485
absolutely have to communicate information
about workplace hazards to those workers.

75
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,763
Occupational health has come
a long way in this country.

76
00:04:46,763 --> 00:04:47,685
That's the good news.

77
00:04:47,685 --> 00:04:51,103
So the image you're looking at
here is a death calendar for

78
00:04:51,103 --> 00:04:56,080
industry in Allegheny County,
Pennsylvania from July 1906 to June 1907.

79
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,890
Every red mark you see on that
calendar as a worker who died.

80
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:04,760
In this one year period,
195 steel workers died out of a total of

81
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,850
526 total work related deaths in
this one county over one year.

82
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:15,360
Fast forward to 1997, only 17 steel
workers died in the entire United States.

83
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,806
So that is a tremendous improvement.

84
00:05:17,806 --> 00:05:20,317
I'd like to further emphasize
how far we've come.

85
00:05:20,317 --> 00:05:23,133
Take a moment right now and
watch the linked video,

86
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:25,295
which is going to show
you what ironwork or

87
00:05:25,295 --> 00:05:29,740
high-rise skyscraper construction
looked like back in the 1930s.

88
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,190
I think after watching that and

89
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,120
perhaps thinking about construction sites
you've seen more recently, you'll realize

90
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,950
that we do things a lot more safely
today than we did in the 1930s.

91
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,870
So as with all types of
environmental health issues,

92
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,080
we've passed policies to
improve occupational health and

93
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,060
that gives us an opportunity
to evaluate those policies.

94
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,130
One thing we could look at is injuries.

95
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,680
So here we're looking at
several different types of

96
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,180
injuries that have occurred
between 1976 and 2013.

97
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,260
What you can see here is the vast
majority of these lines for

98
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,600
different severities of
injuries decline over time.

99
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,450
That's good.

100
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:09,505
OSHA, remember, was established in 1970
through the Occupational Safety and

101
00:06:09,505 --> 00:06:10,141
Health Act.

102
00:06:10,141 --> 00:06:13,666
So if we look at total cases that
top line, these are all injuries

103
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:18,750
that occur in the workplace, you can see
that trend has been downwards over time.

104
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,740
If we look at things like lost workday
injuries or days away from work,

105
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,080
those are markers of more severe injuries.

106
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,537
Meaning you got hurt,
you couldn't work any more, and

107
00:06:27,537 --> 00:06:30,897
you couldn't come right back to work,
those have also declined over time.

108
00:06:30,897 --> 00:06:34,560
But restricted work, that bottom line,
really hasn't declined over time.

109
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,621
This would be a case
where you're injured and

110
00:06:36,621 --> 00:06:39,606
it's bad enough that you can't do
your regular job any more, but

111
00:06:39,606 --> 00:06:42,386
you could do a different type of job and
still remain at work.

112
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:46,742
Deaths in the workplace is another way we
can look at changes due to occupational

113
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:47,790
health policies.

114
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:52,420
So this graphic here is displaying
fatalities that occurred in coal or

115
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,640
non coal mines in
the United States over time.

116
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,843
I'd like to highlight
a couple things here.

117
00:06:56,843 --> 00:06:58,643
One, you can see that the bars and

118
00:06:58,643 --> 00:07:01,280
the trend lines both
absolutely fall over time,

119
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,859
indicating we're killing less workers now
than we were at the start of this period.

120
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,686
The other thing is you'll see
some gray boxes on this graph.

121
00:07:08,686 --> 00:07:13,378
Those correspond to major legislation that
was passed to make mining more healthy

122
00:07:13,378 --> 00:07:13,996
and safe.

123
00:07:13,996 --> 00:07:17,730
And you'll see after each of those
legislation efforts there's been

124
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,890
a subsequent decline in the death rate.

125
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,568
So here's an example of things
getting safer over time and

126
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:28,158
we can actually start to tease out
what sort of influence the policy had.

127
00:07:28,158 --> 00:07:32,178
Another thing we can consider in terms of
occupational health policy is changes in

128
00:07:32,178 --> 00:07:33,270
exposure.

129
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,811
I'll talk to you for
a moment here about asbestos.

130
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:38,927
Asbestos, of course,
a very potent lung carcinogen.

131
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:43,064
What we're looking at on this graph
is the amount of asbestos used in

132
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:46,220
the United States between 1900 and 2010.

133
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,580
You'll see between 1910 and about 1970,

134
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,370
the amount of asbestos
we use steadily climbed.

135
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:57,380
But starting in the mid 1960s, OSHA and
its predecessor agencies started

136
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,010
to establish limits on how much asbestos
could be in the air in a workplace.

137
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:06,760
And you'll see as those limits steadily
ratcheted down, allowing lower and

138
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,230
lower exposures, the amount of
asbestos also rapidly declined.

139
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,690
So here's a case where we
effectively regulated asbestos

140
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:19,730
out of the workplace environment and
improved occupational health as a result.

141
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,080
But despite these gains, I want to
come back to a very important point.

142
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,310
We've talked in a previous module about
how many chemicals are in US commerce,

143
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,463
about 85,000.

144
00:08:29,463 --> 00:08:33,621
OSHA has PELs,
those are permissible exposure limits, for

145
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:35,749
only about 500 chemicals.

146
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:40,172
And most of those 500
are based on 1968 knowledge.

147
00:08:40,172 --> 00:08:44,586
In fact since 1971,
OSHA has only established new limits for

148
00:08:44,586 --> 00:08:46,037
about 30 hazards.

149
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:49,430
They've proposed many more, but
each time they do they end up in court.

150
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,774
Sometimes the process can
take more than a decade.

151
00:08:52,774 --> 00:08:55,541
Sometimes they have to
abandon their new limit.

152
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,680
They're a small agency
with limited resources.

153
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,013
So they've had minimal success here.

154
00:09:00,013 --> 00:09:00,991
They acknowledge this.

155
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:04,093
In fact, I've taken some
text from the OSHA website.

156
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:08,968
OSHA recognizes that many of its
PELS are outdated and inadequate for

157
00:09:08,968 --> 00:09:11,837
ensuring protection of worker health.

158
00:09:11,837 --> 00:09:15,934
To paraphrase here,
industrial experience, new technology,

159
00:09:15,934 --> 00:09:20,178
new science clearly indicate that
in many instances OSHA's limits

160
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:23,467
are not sufficiently
protective of worker health.

161
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:25,434
OSHA's PELs remain in effect.

162
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:30,098
But OSHA recommends that employers
consider using other alternative exposure

163
00:09:30,098 --> 00:09:35,310
limits because the agency believes their
own limits may be hazardous to workers.

164
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,960
Can you imagine another
federal agency telling you,

165
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,830
well, this is the law but
even we don't believe this is safe.

166
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,570
And yet, this is where we find
ourselves with the situation with OSHA.

167
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:51,040
So we've made great progress, but
there is still tremendous work to be done.

168
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,785
I'd like to end on a high note here and
highlight the occupational health research

169
00:09:54,785 --> 00:09:58,052
and training opportunities right
here at the University of Michigan.

170
00:09:58,052 --> 00:10:01,539
We have one of 18 education and
research centers sponsored by

171
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:04,971
the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health.

172
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:09,495
This training center here at Is designed
to help train occupational health

173
00:10:09,495 --> 00:10:12,223
professionals to go out and
protect workers.

174
00:10:12,223 --> 00:10:16,307
This involves funding for research, but
it also involves funding for training for

175
00:10:16,307 --> 00:10:18,310
example for a master's degree.

176
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:22,330
So if you're interested in in the idea of
specializing in occupational health and

177
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,517
safety, I'd encourage you to
visit the link on the slide.
