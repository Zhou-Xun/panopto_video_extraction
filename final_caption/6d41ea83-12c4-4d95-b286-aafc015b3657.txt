00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:16,550
Hello. My name is Peter Jacobs and I'm Professor Emeritus in the Department of Health Management and Policy.

2
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,930
Today I'll be talking about the United States health care delivery system.

3
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:30,650
So we'll be looking at and general overview of the and that includes key organizing principles and framing concepts,

4
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,840
how the system is structure and how it finance, how health care is delivered.

5
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:42,680
And then we'll talk about how we regulate health care at both the state and federal levels.

6
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:52,610
Keep in mind throughout the presentation, some key questions that you should consider asking and answering.

7
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,710
First, one of the strengths and weaknesses of the U.S. health care system.

8
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,280
Second, human strengths and weaknesses.

9
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:05,480
What changes would you make to improve the system?

10
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:11,630
Third, when you're performing a patient in the United States or in another country.

11
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:23,360
If the latter. Which one and why? And finally, what are the criteria new and use to assess how well the U.S. health care system is performing?

12
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:28,610
So let's look first at some of the key organizing principles.

13
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:38,860
We can start at the top of the circle with the fact that it's a market based system with some governmental oversight.

14
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:49,480
That's what I'm really focusing on today. Effectively, I'm really a non system, in part because it's the centralized management.

15
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,300
There's no single point of system accountability.

16
00:01:54,330 --> 00:02:02,190
When you have such diffuse responsibility, as I said before, with regulation at the state and federal levels,

17
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:11,250
plus how the market regulates or self-regulate and organize into different sectors.

18
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,340
And that's what we'll be considering today.

19
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,460
What are the sectors? How do they function?

20
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:23,110
Second, the system is really characterized right now by rapid change.

21
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:31,120
For one thing, there is considerable consolidation at the level who finances health care,

22
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,140
the insurance, and who provide health care and the consolidation into larger and larger systems.

23
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:45,070
At the same time, it's quite innovative and there's far more entrepreneurial activity,

24
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,530
particularly through the use of venture capital now than ever before.

25
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:57,820
One question to think about, though, you know, how does this affect the mix of profit and nonprofit?

26
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:09,550
For most of its history, health care has been largely nonprofit with will see considerable profit after all are profiting from it.

27
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:19,360
At the same time, we're seeing more and more venture capital shifting a lot of health care to a more for profit system.

28
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:28,270
We also see a mix of public and private providers that include public and private insurers,

29
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:36,520
public and private providers of health care, and a mix of federal and state responsibilities.

30
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:42,790
It's a heavily regulated system as a final organizing principle.

31
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,840
Keep in mind that there is no right to health care.

32
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:56,320
While the Affordable Care Act makes health care more affordable and available to many Americans, especially through the expansion of Medicaid.

33
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,930
We don't have a single payer system in the United States.

34
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,060
And we don't have a right to health care.

35
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,130
So let's look at some of the key framing concepts here.

36
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:22,020
We can start with the fact that public health and medical care are separate system, while considerable interaction among the two.

37
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,220
And between the two systems, they are technically very separate.

38
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:33,510
With medical care serving about 97% of all dollars spent on health.

39
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,990
And 3% going to public health.

40
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:48,570
What you might think about in terms of defining separation is that the health care system is really based on individuals, primarily clinical care.

41
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:56,790
In contrast, the public health system thinks about population health that is keeping the community healthy.

42
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:10,890
Second, as we discussed above, health care really emerging more as a business enterprise with a considerable non profit aspect to it.

43
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,000
So it raises the question of who owns the health care system.

44
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,450
You have the shareholders of the for profit enterprises.

45
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,340
You have the community for the nonprofit health care system.

46
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,350
A third framing concept is the role of competition policy.

47
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,490
I think of competition policy generally as the government oversight of the private sector.

48
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:40,890
That would include how we tap the role of tax exemption.

49
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,470
The role of antitrust in dealing with the consolidation and the health care system.

50
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:56,880
And the role of health policy. The Affordable Care Act, again being the most important recent aspect of health policy.

51
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:03,720
A fourth concept is the employer based insurance system for historical reason.

52
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:15,510
Much of how the system organized construction around and large employers providing health care insurance for their employees.

53
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:21,210
For those who don't work in Lawrence employer, how do they get insurance?

54
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:30,480
We'll talk about that later. As noted, some think increasing consolidation into larger and larger players,

55
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:42,510
primarily the insurers with really three or four major national insurance companies and certainly a variety of local commercial insurers,

56
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,480
but also larger and larger health systems.

57
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:54,990
It's becoming harder and harder for a community based hospital to survive without being part of a larger health system.

58
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:02,990
One concept that continues to be problematic in health care is that the coordination of care is

59
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:11,620
fragmented because the centralized there is no way to coordinate care across different providers.

60
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:20,270
For example, you move from a primary care provider to a specialist to inpatient care, to post-acute care.

61
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:27,080
How is that care coordinated? And then how do we keep people healthy once they leave their health care system?

62
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:39,140
To date, because it's largely a fee for service system, I mean, that payment range based on prescribing fee for a particular service,

63
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:50,270
the emphasis on volume, increasing volume is how health care providers make their money rather than providing value.

64
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:56,270
And one of the policy, how to make the shift from volume to value.

65
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,840
Because of the consolidation and lack of coordination,

66
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:09,260
the policy focus has been on the integration of care and system, and that includes how to integrate population health.

67
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:17,100
Define, I said before, through the public health system, with the clinical care encounter,

68
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:25,410
and how do we provide the right incentives for health care systems to coordinate care?

69
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,040
And the quality is improved and costs are lowered.

70
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:37,170
And one organization has built a conceptual framework for addressing the integration of caring systems.

71
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:43,650
And that is the triple aim that the Institute for Health Care Innovation developed,

72
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:54,810
that when an instead having to improve the experience of health care, improve the population health and reduce per capita cost of health care.

73
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:06,510
So it's an overview to the system and we might look at the fact that it's high cost and model quality relative to European Union countries.

74
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:18,660
Despite the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, we still have around 12 and a half percent or so, 12% of people without health insurance.

75
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,480
Now that's down from 18 to 20% just a few years ago.

76
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:30,390
And the trend is definitely in the right direction, but it's got a long way to go.

77
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,470
We've had robust policy debates.

78
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:47,070
Have you who followed the firstly enactment of the Affordable Health Care Act and then the subsequent attempt in Congress to repeal and replace React?

79
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:54,860
Know that the health policy may have been quite robust with little consensus except for one fact.

80
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:05,480
Almost everyone agrees now that people should be protected from exclusions based on their preexisting health care conditions,

81
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:11,150
that they should be able to get insurance regardless of what their health status has been.

82
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:17,130
And one aspect to keep in mind throughout that we live in a culture of technology.

83
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,420
We think that more technology is veteran for the most part.

84
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,559
That's right. One more dependent on that culture of technology,

85
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:33,440
it tends to have high costs implication and access implications if people can't afford new technology.

86
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:39,210
As a result, the system suffers from several structural flaws.

87
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:45,060
The incentives in fee for service medicine are to increase volume.

88
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,600
No room for poor coordination of care.

89
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:57,990
Very fragmented system access remains a problem, as Enthoven and Crone said in 2009.

90
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,680
We live in a paradox of access and deprivation.

91
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,660
If you look at technology, we have and have the best technology available.

92
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:12,210
While people can't get access to it. It remains very high cost.

93
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:18,270
Our recent data suggest that costs are not rising quickly as they had been.

94
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:27,870
Nevertheless, are still rising. And healthcare absorbs now almost 18% of the gross domestic product.

95
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,620
Quality, I think, is getting better.

96
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,340
But many experts believe that is not good enough.

97
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,490
And in some ways, a very important structural flaw.

98
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:47,550
Maybe the most important is the existence of racial and economic disparities.

99
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:55,829
As I suggested, many economic disparities have been reduced, but not enough.

100
00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:04,530
And we know that there are clear and significant racial and ethnic disparities in how health care is provided.

101
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,460
When you're looking around for sources of information.

102
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:15,460
Some are really very reputable and will give you a different orientation.

103
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:24,910
The Kaiser Family Foundation provides excellent ongoing policy information and I'm with the Commonwealth Fund.

104
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:33,310
Health Affairs present recent research and has an ongoing blog to talk about ongoing events.

105
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,900
Same with Vault online. Dental Economists.

106
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:45,580
For those of you who like to follow the economics of health care and then to on the more conservative side,

107
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:55,460
the American Enterprise Institute and free market based think tank presents a lot of colloquy about health care and the Cato Institute,

108
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,810
a libertarian think tank producing free market based health care data.

109
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:07,570
And I encourage you to read the major newspapers The New York Times, Wall Street Journal,

110
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:16,510
Washington Post, other daily for continuing and up to date news about health care.
