1
00:00:07,565 --> 00:00:14,565
First, we will introduce the basic case control study design. We will discuss why and when we use case control studies.

2
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:18,565
And then I will give an example of a flagship case control study,

3
00:00:18,565 --> 00:00:26,565
which, in this example, was the study that established the link between smoking and lung cancer in the early 1950s.

4
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:31,565
And then we will go over three principles of the case control study design.

5
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:39,565
So recall from an earlier session that a case control study is where we select people with the disease or outcome of interest,

6
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:45,565
and here these are called cases, and comparable people with the disease or outcome of interest,

7
00:00:45,565 --> 00:00:51,565
and here these are called controls. Note here that in this definition, the keyword is select.

8
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:57,565
In a case control study, the study sample is selected on the basis of the outcome.

9
00:00:57,565 --> 00:01:02,565
And now recall that this is in contrast to a cohort study where individuals are

10
00:01:02,565 --> 00:01:08,565
selected on the basis of exposure or other type of cohort or group membership.

11
00:01:08,565 --> 00:01:16,565
And then we follow them forward to look at their outcome or disease status as it occurs with time naturally elapsing.

12
00:01:16,565 --> 00:01:25,565
Here, we take people who have the disease and don't have the disease at the time when we initiate the start of the study.

13
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:28,565
Once we've selected our sample in a case control study,

14
00:01:28,565 --> 00:01:34,565
we then go back in time to compare the exposure histories between the cases and the controls.

15
00:01:34,565 --> 00:01:39,565
And we do this by collecting data from sources such as historical employment records, medical records,

16
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:49,565
residential histories, or self reported histories of lifestyle factors and other exposures in this study interview.

17
00:01:49,565 --> 00:01:54,565
The slide shows a really nice diagram of a case control study and how we can

18
00:01:54,565 --> 00:01:59,565
think about time elapsing in relation to the conduct of a case control study.

19
00:01:59,565 --> 00:02:07,565
So as alluded to in the previous slide, we have the case group and the control group defined at the time at which the study is

20
00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:14,565
conducted, because we select our study sample on the basis of case or control status.

21
00:02:14,565 --> 00:02:23,565
That is, individuals who have the disease or outcome and individuals who do not have the disease or outcome at the time at which we conduct the study.

22
00:02:23,565 --> 00:02:32,565
And, similar to a cross sectional study, we can think about our sample in a case control study as representing a hypothetical cohort of people,

23
00:02:32,565 --> 00:02:42,565
in which cases have occurred over time or have been incident during the time that has elapsed prior to the time at which we conduct the study.

24
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:51,565
And then in many instances in a case control study, the cases that we select are prevalent cases,

25
00:02:51,565 --> 00:02:59,565
and so have survived for a given amount of time. That might be variable between the individual cases who are in our study.

26
00:02:59,565 --> 00:03:04,565
We'll discuss the implications of this later on in the live lecture.

27
00:03:04,565 --> 00:03:11,565
And I will also note that there are several different variations on how we select the cases and the controls,

28
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:14,565
and this sometimes differs with respect to the timing.

29
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:20,565
And so there are several subtypes of case control studies, including cumulative case control studies,

30
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:26,565
density or nested case control studies, case cohort studies and case crossover studies.

31
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:37,565
We will get into these in the live lecture. The basic analytical approach for a case control study is to estimate the odds ratio.

32
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:46,565
And so what we do in a case control study is we estimate the odds of exposure in the disease group, as indicated on the left hand side of this figure.

33
00:03:46,565 --> 00:03:50,565
And then we calculate the odds of exposure in the non disease group.

34
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:59,565
And then we take the ratio of these two exposure odds, which gives us the odds ratio.

35
00:03:59,565 --> 00:04:03,565
So let's work through this with an example.

36
00:04:03,565 --> 00:04:11,565
Many of you may have heard about the flagship study that was conducted by Doll and Hill in the early 1950s.

37
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:16,565
That was one of the first to establish the causal link between smoking and lung cancer.

38
00:04:16,565 --> 00:04:21,565
You might also note here that Hill or Bradford Hill is the same Hill who developed the Hill's

39
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:28,565
criteria or guidelines that we discussed earlier on in the causality section of this class.

40
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:35,565
And so Doll and Hill established this link through conducting a case control study.

41
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:43,565
And in this slide, I show their very kind of basic and old-school two by two table that they put together in their study.

42
00:04:43,565 --> 00:04:49,565
And you can click the link at the bottom of the slide to go and read their original study, which is actually really interesting.

43
00:04:49,565 --> 00:04:54,565
And so they've sort of done a variant of a two by two table here where they actually show

44
00:04:54,565 --> 00:04:58,565
the statistics for the probability test that they conducted in the far right column.

45
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:06,565
And they've separated out their disease group into males and females. But you can see that they have their disease group shown in the rows.

46
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:12,565
So patients with lung cancer. And then here they have control patients with diseases other than cancer.

47
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:19,565
And that's because they selected their controls from patients who are hospitalized for reasons other than lung cancer.

48
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:27,565
And we will get into that in a subsequent part to this lecture slide where we discuss the different ways to select controls in a case control study.

49
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:35,565
And then they show the number of nonsmokers and the number of smokers. So that would be the two categories of the exposure group in the columns.

50
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:38,565
So let's take this into a worked example,

51
00:05:38,565 --> 00:05:45,565
and actually what we're going to do is we're going to flip the exposure and the disease across the rows and columns.

52
00:05:45,565 --> 00:05:52,565
So we have smokers and nonsmokers shown in the rows. And those with lung cancer and know lung cancer shown in the columns.

53
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:57,565
And that is typically the standard that we will use when putting two by two tables together.

54
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:01,565
In this course. We have the exposure in the rows and the outcome in the columns.

55
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:10,565
And then I've indicated the cells as well as the row and column totals with A, B, C and D for ease of presentation.

56
00:06:10,565 --> 00:06:19,565
So I mentioned earlier that the odds ratio is the core measure of association that we calculate in case control studies.

57
00:06:19,565 --> 00:06:28,565
So let's calculate that here. The odds ratio is equivalent to A times D over B times

58
00:06:28,565 --> 00:06:33,565
C. And again, I promised that I would show you or prove to you why this is the case.

59
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:39,565
And don't worry, we will get there. But just trust me for now. So the odds ratio here is 9.1.

60
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:45,565
And this is an extremely strong magnitude of effect.

61
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:56,565
The risk ratio, in contrast, if you recall, is the is calculated as A over A+B divided by C over C+D.

62
00:06:56,565 --> 00:07:04,565
Right. So it is the proportion of smokers who have lung cancer divided by the proportion of non smokers who have lung cancer.

63
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:08,565
And it's only 5.0. This is still an extremely strong magnitude of an effect.

64
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:14,565
But it's almost half the size of the odds ratio. Why does this happen?

65
00:07:14,565 --> 00:07:18,565
Well, actually, I'm not gonna tell you until later on in the class session,

66
00:07:18,565 --> 00:07:25,565
but I like this example because it shows us here that the odds ratio typically tends to overestimate the risk ratio.

67
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:33,565
Another way that this is commonly expressed is that the odds ratio is often inflated with respect to the risk ratio.

68
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:39,565
And I will note here that we should be trusting the odds ratio and recall that it is telling us a ratio of odds.

69
00:07:39,565 --> 00:07:45,565
It is not telling us anything about the incidence of new cases of the disease or risk.

70
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:58,565
And so this risk ratio we should look at as very suspect. So when would a case control study be the best choice,

71
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:09,565
you might have intuited that a cohort study may be a better choice than a case control study for establishing causality and minimizing bias.

72
00:08:09,565 --> 00:08:17,565
When we are doing observational research in epidemiology, you know, in a cohort study, we can establish temporality, we establish a cohort,

73
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:24,565
and then we follow them forward over time to allow cases of disease to elapse, which gives us measures of incidents.

74
00:08:24,565 --> 00:08:29,565
And it's easy to imagine that if we are selecting people on the basis of their outcome.

75
00:08:29,565 --> 00:08:37,565
And again, this might be prevalent outcomes. We have trouble establishing incidents and there might be issues around survival bias.

76
00:08:37,565 --> 00:08:45,565
So why would we do a case control study when it seems like a cohort study might actually be a better study design?

77
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:52,565
Well, a case control study is extremely useful when the outcome of interest is rare.

78
00:08:52,565 --> 00:09:00,565
And here we are defining rare as having a less than 10 percent incidence in the unexposed population members.

79
00:09:00,565 --> 00:09:09,565
And an example here is cancer. And so when an outcome of interest is rare, it's easy to imagine that a cohort study would be impractical to conduct.

80
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:17,565
We would need a huge sample size followed for a very long period of time in order for enough new incident cases to occur,

81
00:09:17,565 --> 00:09:23,565
in order to actually be able to study the incidents and come up with any kind of measure of association,

82
00:09:23,565 --> 00:09:27,565
with any type of precision for a rare outcome in a cohort study.

83
00:09:27,565 --> 00:09:31,565
And so a case control study is much more efficient in this situation.

84
00:09:31,565 --> 00:09:37,565
A case control study may also be the best choice when measuring the exposure is expensive because we can minimize the costs,

85
00:09:37,565 --> 00:09:46,657
because the exposure only needs to be assessed in a subset of the cohort or I would say study population.

86
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:57,542
We will get into this in more depth in these live lecture. But I want to introduce them here.

87
00:09:57,542 --> 00:09:59,542
The first is the study base principle.

88
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:07,542
So the idea here is that controls must represent the same study base or underlying population from which the cases arose.

89
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:13,542
It's easy to imagine that since we sample on the basis of the outcome in a case control design,

90
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:23,542
that we could pull our cases from one base population and then pull our controls from another base population, whether by purpose or on accident.

91
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:29,542
And if that's the case, then it is really difficult to compare the cases and the controls in a valid way, and this can lead to bias.

92
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:36,542
So it's very important to ensure that the controls represent the same steady base from which the cases arose.

93
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:39,542
The other principal is the de-confounding principle,

94
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:47,542
and I would say that this is extremely important to all types of epidemiological study designs, not just case control studies.

95
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:49,542
The idea here is that potential confounders,

96
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:59,542
that is common causes of the exposure and outcome must be measured and accounted for and any unmeasured confounders should vary as little as possible.

97
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:04,542
This is why we use matching in case control studies. So, for example,

98
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:12,542
we may choose to match the cases and controls on the basis of demographic factors like age or sex to try to minimize unmeasured confounding.

99
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:17,542
We'll get into this later. And finally, the comparable accuracy principle.

100
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:24,542
This is the idea here that the accuracy of the exposure measurements should be equal between the cases and controls.

101
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:28,542
So we should be using the same tools and methods of assessing the exposure

102
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:33,542
between the cases and controls in order to ensure consistent measurement of the

103
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:39,542
exposure and potentially and reduce any potential bias that might be induced by

104
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:45,542
having different methods of exposure measurements between the cases and controls.

105
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:50,749
That's it for part one, the next is part two analytical concepts in case control studies.
