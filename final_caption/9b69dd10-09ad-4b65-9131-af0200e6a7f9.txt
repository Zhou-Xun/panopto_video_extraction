1
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:38,140
And this is the race.

2
00:00:46,670 --> 00:01:04,160
I. I. Yeah.

3
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:33,080
Oh, really? Yeah.

4
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:39,640
I don't know what.

5
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,740
I don't. You only get. Yeah.

6
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:15,650
Know. Oh.

7
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:26,420
Oh. How are you?

8
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:33,200
Good morning. Good.

9
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,890
Hi, guys.

10
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,600
Good morning, everybody. Can you hear me? All right.

11
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,880
So I hope you all have a good week in.

12
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,420
If you were like me.

13
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:13,090
In between the work I was doing, I was sneaking a peek at all of the ceremony going on in Britain regarding the Queen and the Queen's.

14
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,270
Passing as well as the new king's ceremony.

15
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,410
I'm a history buff, and so it was really interesting for me to watch things that I've read.

16
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,130
Be, you know, actually put into place.

17
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:42,940
But even if thinking about what's been going on with the queen and the new king, I actually thought, hmm, that's a actually a really interesting.

18
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,020
Visible manifestation of what we'll be talking about today in some ways.

19
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:58,509
Because think about it in terms of the British people that in the passing of the queen,

20
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:04,520
you're seeing these discussions that have always been going on about colonialism going on.

21
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,590
But they're especially present now.

22
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:15,790
And it shows that it's, you know, even in a given community, which you could call Britain a community.

23
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:30,100
So many different perspectives on royalty and the role of the royals and the importance of the royals and the history of the royals.

24
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,810
That really and that really makes an impact on how.

25
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:41,320
British people, members of the Commonwealth have responded.

26
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,370
And it also, you know, thinking about merit worth is significance.

27
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:55,150
The queen was super significant, right? She was you know, everyone loved the queen, even despite things like colonialism.

28
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:04,509
And now that the queen's presence is no more, if there is a revisiting this dynamic, there's there's it's dynamic, there's change.

29
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:16,360
Right? So even people who thought, hmm, it's pretty acceptable for us to retain the queen, even though there's this long history of colonialism,

30
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:22,960
as I expect it, are now starting to really think about different countries, for example, and governments.

31
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:31,340
Yeah, the Queen is gone. So do we really need this system, despite the significance the Queen has held?

32
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,349
So for for somebody who is really in tune to, you know,

33
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:45,670
in the work that I do into engagement and how things can change that fast, I mean, literally, I closed my eyes.

34
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,710
She was alive. And then I opened my eyes about a half hour later and she was gone.

35
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,540
Things change really quickly. And so as.

36
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:04,000
An evaluator. When I'm engaging, I always have to be aware of that potential to happen.

37
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,190
So that was my opportunity. One, just to talk about the Queen.

38
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,110
Because when I finish my dissertation, that's all I read.

39
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,710
British history. It's totally different than what I read before.

40
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:25,510
So today we're going to be talking about engaging stakeholders or invested parties.

41
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,830
I'm trying to stick with the and just so you know, I know I keep going back and forth.

42
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:37,420
It's because I'm trying to stick, trying to make sure that even in the midst of the language change, that you continue to put,

43
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:45,219
you know, what the readings are saying and what even my lecture past lecture notes, if I forget the change a word.

44
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:55,140
You understand that we're talking about the same thing. But what we're talking about is engaging people who are invested in the work.

45
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,150
The lecture note just a tip. The lecture notes that.

46
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,500
I saw that. I posted it yesterday, last night.

47
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,920
I changed the order this morning.

48
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:13,350
So at some point you're going to see me switch to the principles of community engagement sooner than they do in the slides.

49
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:18,480
Just so just a heads up. But you know, you'll see when I do it.

50
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:26,700
So just a few tweaks. A side note that, you know, whenever you're doing any kind of presentation,

51
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:34,229
whether it's a lecture or presentations at the end of this class, all presentations are narrative.

52
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:39,630
And so sometimes the narrative you decide on at one moment changes.

53
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,670
And that's what happened to me last night or this morning. I decided to change the narrative a little bit.

54
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:58,600
So today we'll talk about we'll just briefly go over what we talked about last Thursday and we'll talk start talking about community engagement.

55
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,750
We'll finish that off on Thursday, focusing on strategies for engagement.

56
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:09,850
And but today, we'll talk more about approaches.

57
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:16,360
And then I'll talk a little bit about the email assignment, which will be due soon.

58
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:30,309
First assignment. So last Thursday, we talked about two approaches to evaluation that are undergirding this class culture,

59
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:39,910
responsiveness and equitable evaluation, which are related concepts, remember, but are not exactly the same.

60
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:50,530
When I talk about cultural response of a value evaluation, what we're really thinking about is center and culture in the evaluation process,

61
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:56,290
whether it is thinking about how the tools that we develop are created,

62
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:03,670
how they reflect the culture, how dissemination materials reflect culture and so on.

63
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:15,610
Whereas with equitable evaluation, we're really talking about how does the evaluation process further equity or promote equity or move forward?

64
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:22,149
The conditions that allow us to continue, socially speaking,

65
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:30,340
to continue and as a field to reach toward a place where all can have access to opportunity.

66
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:40,080
So today what we'll talk about is we're finally made it past all that interest stuff.

67
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:47,310
And we're going into the first step of the CDC framework, which is engaging stakeholders.

68
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,460
Before we get into the traditional stakeholder language, though.

69
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,710
I wanted to offer you a definition of community.

70
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,260
Community can mean so many things. But what do.

71
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,820
What are we talking about in this context when we talk about community?

72
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:18,690
I like this definition. Read it. A group of people with diverse characteristics who are linked by social ties,

73
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:27,000
share common perspectives, and engage in joint action in geographic locations or settings.

74
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:38,560
I like this definition. It was actually developed as part of a participatory process for use in participatory public health.

75
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:45,910
So it seemed very pertinent. Not only the way that it was developed, but for what field?

76
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:53,610
And I just note that there are some some key words that I want you to think about and keep in mind.

77
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,960
One, this idea of being linked by social ties.

78
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:06,690
So it's not just about being in the same geographic space, but also the idea of being linked socially.

79
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:18,360
So thinking about people engaging with each other, having relationships with each other, sharing common perspectives.

80
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:27,360
And it doesn't have to. That doesn't necessarily mean that all is in agreement, like, you know, thinking about Britain.

81
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:35,390
They have, they share common perspectives. But that doesn't mean that when it comes to everything, they have the same perspective.

82
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:42,020
It doesn't mean that they feel about the royal system the same way as everybody else does.

83
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,140
And then finally, this idea of joint action.

84
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:57,149
So when we talk about community in the class, we're also thinking about the actions of the community and the community as an actor,

85
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:12,809
not as a passive participant or a passive voice in an evaluation process that is being led by and only led by an evaluator or and quote unquote,

86
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:27,240
expert. So who are we talking about when we talk about stakeholders or investor parties?

87
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:37,810
You can see in the center, we're talking about in a straightforward manner people or organizations that are invested in the program.

88
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,950
And so, again, that program is the one that is being evaluated.

89
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:47,080
And with them and surrounding the community.

90
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,110
There are these stakeholders that we can classify.

91
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:57,510
And. One or more of these three groups.

92
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:09,870
So first, those who are involved in program operations, those are the people who are responsible for making a program go or move forward.

93
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,630
The second group is those served or affected by your program.

94
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:23,040
And those are people who are or organizations who in some way have some connection to

95
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,260
the process of the program and have some investment in the outcomes of the program.

96
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,060
And then finally,

97
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:40,410
and this is where you may have realized my if nothing but consistent typo that I make every semester primary users of the evaluation.

98
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,679
So I think somebody even asked me about this.

99
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:51,660
I don't know. I continue to, for some reason make a typo in when I previously showed this framework.

100
00:13:52,050 --> 00:14:00,450
It's the primary users of the program. So just correcting your notes, because I don't know why I do it every single time.

101
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:05,980
I promise you, this is the end. Primary users of the evaluation.

102
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:12,280
So who is invested in knowing what comes out of the evaluation process?

103
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,190
So here are some examples in this table.

104
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:32,170
So those involved in program operating operations that could include probably most immediately program managers, program staff, administrators.

105
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:42,010
So for, you know, maybe administrators in the department, in a organization, it can also include community members.

106
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:51,910
You may be evaluating a project or a program where community members participate in its implementation.

107
00:14:54,030 --> 00:15:02,490
Sponsors and funders. For those who have had the opportunity of running a program and meeting their program officer,

108
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:10,380
you might have worked closely with a program officer who is helping you develop and implement a program.

109
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,800
And it could also include in the same way collaborators or partners.

110
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,850
Then examples of those affected by the program.

111
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,470
Clients. Program participants. Beneficiaries.

112
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:35,120
So remember that language we used last Thursday. Those who benefit from the program, family members of participants.

113
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:46,610
You know, specially when those programs are meant to affect the family unit unit.

114
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:52,560
The household unit. Neighborhood organizations, academic institutions.

115
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:58,790
Elected and appointed officials. As well as advocacy groups.

116
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,950
So that, you know, that's to say that this idea of being affected by the program is broad.

117
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:16,700
Then primary users of the evaluation program developers, program managers and staff.

118
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:23,990
It can be and they could also be program. Sorry, I keep hitting this thing down here, so let me try and stay away from it.

119
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:33,169
It doesn't stay closed. A program developer might not be one who is involved with program operations.

120
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:41,780
It could be somebody who is developing a new program, a similar program, and is really interested and seeing the results of an evaluation.

121
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,850
Funders, collaborative collaborators are partners.

122
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,550
And as you might know, this again, these groups are not mutually exclusive.

123
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:58,850
You can be involved in program operations as well as being affected by the program.

124
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:04,370
And so in doing this work and think starting to think about engagement,

125
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:10,130
it's just important to remember that people may be coming from different perspectives,

126
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:21,050
even the same person may be coming from different perspectives and wearing different hats at different phases or different moments in the evaluation.

127
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:29,050
One thing that I'll probably continue to say throughout this week, especially, is that relationships are key.

128
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:37,089
And so just like when you have relationships in your personal lives and you can accommodate the complexity in those

129
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:44,830
relationships when you are doing relationship building and evaluation or any kind of applied research for that matter.

130
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:52,690
Again, it's just important to remember that we're talking about complex beings with complex perspectives.

131
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:06,340
Why do we engage people? Well, I mean, other than it makes life more interesting, which it does.

132
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:13,719
We know it does. That's who wants it. And let's just people sometimes I do like to just sit there and analyze some data,

133
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,340
but I find that engaging people makes the process more interesting and meaningful.

134
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:26,630
But why do we engage people? One To inform evaluation, planning, implementation and dissemination.

135
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:33,849
Thinking about ways to make that process more valid and more accountable to the

136
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:40,030
communities that we're serving to to make evaluation work relevant to participants,

137
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:47,200
organizations and communities. Needs for quality assurance and improvement in thinking about accountability.

138
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:52,120
How can we? Relevance is another aspect of accountability.

139
00:18:52,150 --> 00:19:02,680
How can we make this evaluation one that is holding true to the values and the interest of our stakeholder groups?

140
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,670
And then finally to promote evaluation, use one of the.

141
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:18,790
Optimal ways of making sure that the reports and dissemination materials and work that we do in this process.

142
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:27,530
The way to assure the best way to assure that that doesn't end up in a drawer or computer folder is

143
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:35,240
that we promote that to use we engage people so that they are invested in the end of the process.

144
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:43,990
Or. Or period. So that they are engaged in the results of the process.

145
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:58,220
So some areas and I pulled this from the reading and thought it was really helpful to think about.

146
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:05,210
So what what can benefit from evaluate our engagement regarding an evaluation.

147
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:17,640
One agenda. So the choices that so there's evidence that the choices that people involved in evaluation or in the research project,

148
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,270
those choices change when engagement happens.

149
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:26,050
Design and delivery. So design is improved.

150
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,940
For example, thinking about culturally relevant and culturally valid tools.

151
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:36,970
Implementation and change. We see more use of evaluation results for change.

152
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:44,290
Ethics improvement and the consent process. People know what they're doing and why.

153
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:49,990
And you know, a side note, you know, when you're doing consent,

154
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:57,460
don't assume that people because they sign that form, that they are aware of what you're doing.

155
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,680
And also thinking about ethics.

156
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:06,299
One thing I think I mentioned before on a side note is that, for example,

157
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:14,160
with IAB or Institutional Review Board as an evaluation project does not always have to be.

158
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:26,400
Have that level of overt formal oversight, but that doesn't negate our responsibility for ethics and for consent.

159
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:38,950
And so engagement helps affirm that consent process so that the true purpose of that, that people understand what they're getting into happens.

160
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,090
Public involved in the project.

161
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:57,250
And this is not just the this is not just the public, meaning anybody outside of staff, but community members, neighborhood organizations, etc.

162
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:03,610
So there's more recognition of the public's contribution to the evaluation project.

163
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,950
Academic partners. So again, that enhanced knowledge.

164
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,290
The reason why academics do research is to build a knowledge base.

165
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,230
And so academic partners are involved.

166
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:26,590
Engagement has been shown to enhance the knowledge that is made, that is added to the knowledge base and given areas.

167
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:37,240
Individual research participants. The there refers to, for example, the receiving of more compensation,

168
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:45,320
financial and otherwise community organizations who benefit from more organizational capacity.

169
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:54,580
The building of networks that allow for program activities and program outcomes to be sustained.

170
00:22:55,150 --> 00:23:00,580
And then finally, the general public who are more receptive to research.

171
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:05,320
Research is quite expensive, including evaluation research.

172
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:13,030
And so the more that we can show that there is a benefit and actually implement benefit to that work,

173
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:18,250
the more it's received, the more positively rather it's received by the general public.

174
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,860
So when we are talking about engagement.

175
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:37,370
So. When engagement became part of the conversation, I use my handy dandy pen again.

176
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:49,430
So excited about this thing. So a lot of the conceptions of what engagement meant tended to center right here as long as we were reaching out.

177
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:54,860
We were doing great. I started in public health.

178
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:02,410
I think I mentioned as a health educator in part I was doing research on that research law outreach.

179
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:14,360
To teens or I was facilitating rather teens doing street outreach to other teens on topics related to sexual health.

180
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,910
So we would go driving the van, a bunch of teenagers.

181
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,970
But as I talk to this, I'm like, wow, that's interesting ethics.

182
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:31,130
Right. With that one. But we would go in the van, drive around the city of Detroit,

183
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:39,930
and we would just stop if we saw somewhere where a bunch of teenagers were and go out and hand out condoms and cards to,

184
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:49,010
you know, signal that they were going to HIV test. You know, they have locations where they could get STD tests or HIV tests.

185
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:54,500
And that was that was often the limit of our engagement with them.

186
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,620
So the community involvement was from us.

187
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:10,260
To them. You might not be.

188
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:19,080
Oh, you might not be surprised to learn that. Well, there is a role for that type of engagement.

189
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:30,090
From a widespread perspective, what we saw in public health is that not much changes when the conversation is one directional.

190
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:40,200
So increasingly, we've moved away from this outreach and moved further down the continuum.

191
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:48,180
To think about collaboration and share leadership where communication is bi directional,

192
00:25:48,750 --> 00:26:01,050
where the emphasis is on building partnerships and sharing power, and the power regarding decision making for, you know, which was missing again.

193
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:09,390
Think about it. If I'm just going to talk to a team, some teams I'm not asking them or we did not ask them,

194
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:17,490
is this the best approach to kind of drive up on you in a van with a bunch of other teenagers and hand you some condoms and cards?

195
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:24,790
We never thought to ask that. We thought because we were getting out of our office that we were doing great.

196
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:31,050
And surprisingly, not everybody responded to that type of approach.

197
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:37,650
So what we are moving toward in public health.

198
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:45,580
So excited for one who's been talking about this and watching it unfold.

199
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:56,260
We're moving more and more toward an approach to engagement that adopts principles and approaches of community organizing.

200
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:05,490
One thing that distinguishes this approach from other approaches is that bringing

201
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:12,060
we're bringing people together to pursue a shared interest social x action.

202
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:16,920
So again, thinking about go back really fast, go back to that definition.

203
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,090
Joint Action. Social X action.

204
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:35,800
Comment, perspective and social ties. So even though we might be different, we have a particular goal in mind and that is that of social action.

205
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:42,740
And that includes thinking about when you're thinking about engagement in an evaluation context.

206
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:51,240
We are facilitating a process where there is social action happening.

207
00:27:52,650 --> 00:28:00,060
So even though we're doing evaluation and yes, we want to learn and we want to make sure that process is rigorous,

208
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:09,390
we're also accounting for the fact that some social action should happen at the end of this process or even during the process.

209
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:20,740
You saw that emerge, even with the idea of equitable evaluation, where the process should be promoting equity,

210
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:27,430
whether it's capacity building, education, translation and whatnot.

211
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:39,840
So some principles that are related to community organizing empowerment, and we're talking about not just an individual becoming empowered.

212
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:44,710
We're talking about institutional empowerment and community empowerment.

213
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:59,080
One must give credit where credit is due. You have you have a faculty member, MH Biagi, who is who has been a big part of empowerment theory.

214
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,200
Mark Zimmerman, is you still there to actually look that up?

215
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:09,420
Zimmerman still here. Okay. BLOCK And then I'm also I'm like, okay.

216
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:17,550
Is he actually still here? Don't make me a liar. And thank you for for making me feel better.

217
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,000
Sometimes that happens with high school, too. I'm like, is that teacher still here?

218
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,840
Some kid is like, no. Who is it?

219
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:39,800
Oops. So empowerment and it is not about, again, evaluators, staff coming together and saying, we're going to empower you.

220
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:46,520
It is about facilitating the conditions upon which an entity can become empowered.

221
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:53,210
So that empowerment work is not ours to do and we can't do it.

222
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,760
We can't simply facilitate conditions so that an entity can become empowered.

223
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,840
And so organizing is the same way.

224
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:06,860
What we're thinking about is when we organize people.

225
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:13,300
We're simply creating a space and with a valuation, we're doing the same.

226
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:21,130
We're facilitating a space where a community can come together, learn about these programs that are accountable to them,

227
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:28,510
and learn about the outcomes and the processes and the activities that they want to see.

228
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:39,700
Another principle community competence. And that's about learning about the community that you're working in.

229
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:44,559
It's not about knowing everything about the community that you're working.

230
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:49,720
And think about that idea of humility that we ended Thursday with.

231
00:30:50,350 --> 00:31:02,410
It's about being open to a process of learning and and with an understanding and really appreciating that a community is competent already.

232
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:08,980
They may not be competent in the way that you think they should be, but part of the process is learning.

233
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:14,850
What assets does the community already have? Active participating.

234
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:20,310
Our participation, if you're familiar with organizing, you're familiar with the idea of base building.

235
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,180
So building a base of people who are supporting an effort,

236
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:33,400
even if they're not the ones who are doing the active engagement or active, they're not necessarily coming to the meetings.

237
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:40,200
You still want to have that idea of base building as part of the evaluation process.

238
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:48,420
And that can simply mean making sure that you're communicating on a regular basis about what the evaluation is doing.

239
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:59,790
For example, when I led an evaluation of with community development organizations in Detroit,

240
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:05,220
not all of those organizations had representatives involved in the planning.

241
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:17,130
But we did make sure that they were aware of what we were doing and had opportunities to contribute through newsletters and other communications.

242
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:27,900
And that was on top of making sure that we were we were working closely with those who chose to on the planning and whatnot.

243
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,670
And then finally starting where the people are.

244
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:42,649
Which does relate in some way to being there, being physically there, but also understanding, you know,

245
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:49,310
in terms of thinking about competence, what what does the community understand about evaluation?

246
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,420
What do they understand about this program and starting from there?

247
00:32:55,100 --> 00:33:00,890
And so that means that there is a period of assessment that happens when you first start an engagement.

248
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:09,020
One thing I also wanted to point out is and this is a lesson that I've learned the hard way.

249
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:19,100
And continue to learn. Thinking about making sure you have a critical lens on representation.

250
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:27,650
So we've talked about making sure. You know, you want people of diverse perspectives and identities to be part of the planning process.

251
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:36,200
But it's also important to ask the question, are the people who are at the table, do they represent the community's interests?

252
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:42,919
And that can be a little hard to identify. An evaluation.

253
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,040
I finished up within the past year.

254
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:59,170
I worked with. One organ to one organization and did not realize until we started that there was a lot of animosity between

255
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:09,639
that organization and another organization and the tensions related to who who belonged to the community,

256
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:15,370
who was working on behalf of the community. So both of those entities actually had.

257
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:25,170
They're all perspectives on. Whether or not they were the ones who were adequately representing the community.

258
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:37,800
And so part of my assessment was naming that tension like, yes, the two of you, even though I was working on behalf of one of those organizations.

259
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,600
Yes, there's this tension.

260
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:51,000
But the two of you have organization or have resources that can help aid what you're the goal that you are you have in common.

261
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:56,100
So they have this common perspective, just totally different ideas of how they should get there.

262
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:02,159
And so one of my recommendations was there are the two of you are going to have to name the

263
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:09,450
tension and perhaps work together in order to continue to see success on this initiative.

264
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:19,590
So before I kind of jump in. Now, here's. Where I switch over to the the principles.

265
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:28,210
So before I jump into those, any questions so far? All right.

266
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:36,760
So in the reading you did today, share with you the CDC is principles of community engagement.

267
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:49,020
The document itself was super long. But I really like these principles, I think in the special because they are kind of from CBC.

268
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,890
It's helpful to know how they are thinking about community engagement.

269
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:01,580
So, yes, so the first principle of community engagement.

270
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,930
Be clear about the purposes of or goals of the engagement effort in the populations you want to engage.

271
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:15,559
So you want to have a skeleton, if you will, of the engagement.

272
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:24,050
And so that might include types of roles, even if they aren't firmly defined responsibilities.

273
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:31,580
Places where people would engage or can engage.

274
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:37,370
And the idea is to help alleviate some of the initial.

275
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:47,260
Challenges were by him or any excited about one's participation in the in this process.

276
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:57,820
So having a sense or at least being able to say this is what we envision this thing, you know, people would engage.

277
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:07,660
In this planning session, for example. I can help by people really like to know or have a sense of.

278
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,620
What it is that they're being called to do. The second principle.

279
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:22,600
Become knowledgeable about the communities, culture, economic conditions, history, demographic trends.

280
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:27,730
Learn about communities, perceptions of those initiated engagement activities.

281
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:35,050
So again, again, pointing to cultural humility, coming with a spirit of learning,

282
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:44,739
but also taking time to find out and be open to hearing that the community community members may

283
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:54,040
not appreciate or that may have had bad negative experiences with your firm if you're with a firm,

284
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:10,350
your academic institution. Your organization in the past or present, but being open to receiving that can help with engagement in the long run.

285
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,749
Go to the community. I could probably just put a period there.

286
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:24,209
Or go to the community. Be there. But also establish relationships.

287
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:28,680
Building trust. Working with formal and informal leadership.

288
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,530
And that you know that.

289
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:42,390
So that you're aware of conflicts or tensions that can have an impact on the program that is being evaluated as well as the organization,

290
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:50,100
as well as the community being aware of any tensions that can have an impact.

291
00:38:53,720 --> 00:39:00,530
For remember and accept that collective self-determination is the responsibility and right of all people in the community.

292
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:13,040
As I said earlier, you can't empower anyone. And so that self-determination may in itself create tensions there or allow them to manifest.

293
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:28,950
But the I the important thing is that we are respectful of the self-determination of a community to be able to dictate what it is they want to see.

294
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:38,820
And while this has not happened to me before, that could end up in a process where the evaluation process changes completely.

295
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:45,450
It could be eliminated. But that is part of the engagement that we're doing.

296
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:53,700
Partnering with the community is necessary to change, to create change.

297
00:39:54,930 --> 00:40:01,110
We can do a semblance of effective work, but sustained change really does come from partnership.

298
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:05,820
And so once we remove ourselves, we want those results to be used and shared, right?

299
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:14,760
So the partnership is key to making sure that once an evaluator steps out of the of the process,

300
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:20,190
that there's capacity for the results to continue to be used and shared.

301
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:31,150
The six principle. All aspects of community engagement must respect and recognize the diversity of the community.

302
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:35,290
This speaks in part to phases of engagement.

303
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:40,970
So. You know, there's going to be diversity in the community, but.

304
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:49,630
Also thinking about your team. Do you have a team that recognizes and respects the diversity of a community?

305
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,220
And so that might mean as an evaluator, especially if you're leading,

306
00:40:54,790 --> 00:41:04,360
that might mean doing capacity building within the evaluation team to ensure that there's no undermining of relationship.

307
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:17,149
Southern Principle. Community engagement can only be sustained by identifying and mobilizing community assets and

308
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:24,410
strengths and by developing the community's capacity and resources to make decisions and take action.

309
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:31,400
So no, again, existing assets, existing strengths, existing capacity.

310
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:35,450
So informally or formally,

311
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:50,060
we're doing some type of assessment to understand what exist in that can be as simple as taking notes after each meeting or during a meeting.

312
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:55,280
I'm big on taking notes. Always have either an iPad with me or some type of paper.

313
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,090
Very rarely paper now. But that always I take notes.

314
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:08,870
I draw out meeting rooms to see how people are interacting with each other and see, you know,

315
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:20,330
how how the physical space can reveal things about who sees what assets, who sees what strengths and who sees what capacity.

316
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:32,479
Sorry about that. If principal organizations that wish to engage a community as well as individuals seeking to effect change,

317
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:38,629
must be prepared to release control of actions or interventions to the community and be flexible enough.

318
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:46,460
To me, that's changing needs. This is speaking to responsiveness, being willing to change where it is needed.

319
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:59,240
Or desired. And then finally, community collaboration, which requires long term commitment by the engaging organization and its partners.

320
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:05,659
Again, thinking about that bi directional communication and that, if you will,

321
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:13,399
interdependence organizations and individuals who are part of the process, that community.

322
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:20,720
The collaboration is again key in ensuring that what comes out of an evaluation is sustained.

323
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:35,800
All right. Now, go back to wherever the old slide deck was.

324
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:45,860
So when should people be involved? As this handy dandy picture shows you all the time.

325
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:59,990
Describe. So even in some ways, it may be helpful to think of step one as not is is is a step that is encompassing the entire framework.

326
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:09,950
So people should be involved when you are logic modeling describing the program or the problem focusing the vet the plan,

327
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:15,290
gathering data, justifying conclusions, ensuring use and lessons learned.

328
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:30,100
How does one identify people involved in the program or invested in the program, rather?

329
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:44,800
There are some, you know, less formal ways brainstorming, snowballing or getting more ideas as you go.

330
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:54,400
Collect formal ways of identifying people, collecting categories and names from informants in the community.

331
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:04,280
Consulting with organizations looking for information about the program or initiative and program related documents.

332
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:11,420
Sometimes evaluators refer to that initial process of planning as discovery,

333
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:21,590
which I think that term discovery comes initially from either journalism or the criminal legal system as actually sure where it comes from.

334
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:30,320
But the idea is you're discovering things by going through secondary documents, meeting notes, past reports.

335
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:38,680
Grant proposals, etc. Keeping track of stakeholders in a systematic way.

336
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:47,710
So on Thursday, I'll show one way of going about that developing context through membership list,

337
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,470
making a note of important individual group or organization characteristics.

338
00:45:53,980 --> 00:46:03,460
Now I will say that the bigger the project, the more helpful it is to be formal about these identification processes.

339
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:14,650
For example, keeping an Excel list or a spreadsheet of all the individuals, what organization they represent,

340
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:21,370
how they've said they would like to be engaged at, what stages, what they like to be engaged.

341
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:29,230
The more people you're working with, the better it is to not keep that in your head,

342
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:34,210
but keep it more formally collected in, for example, an Excel document.

343
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:53,210
And it's not just about identifying people, but ultimately it's about relationship building.

344
00:46:54,350 --> 00:47:00,230
It is critical. I would say that I found that it is the.

345
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:05,980
The thing that has helped any project I've worked on the most.

346
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:13,510
You know, relationships can cover a multitude of sins, for example.

347
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:19,720
So for those out there who are nervous about, oh Lord, this seems overwhelming, why?

348
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,770
You know, who are actually thinking about doing this or applied research?

349
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:28,270
They're thinking to themselves, Oh Lord, this is overwhelming.

350
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,040
Let me tell you, from my perspective, relationship building is critical.

351
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:42,430
And it's not just critical because people will, like you, are more willing to work with you are that relationship building leads to candid

352
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:48,250
conversations where you will they will share holes about what you're missing.

353
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:57,310
Well, you know, or informal speak or they will become more informative the more the relationship is close.

354
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,850
So I can't. Emphasize it any more.

355
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:08,490
So what are some practice elements for building those rich relationships?

356
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:15,450
Rich. Not in terms of finances, but rich in terms of social cohesion and relationship.

357
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:22,470
Know the community and his constituents and his capabilities and acknowledge those.

358
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:33,990
I you know, from a practical standpoint, being gracious is sometimes what it looks like.

359
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:42,670
After. You know, I told I think I told you on Thursday I was facilitating a session this this Saturday or last Saturday.

360
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:49,129
I simply tell them, you know, they're like, Oh, great, you know, you're doing a great job.

361
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:52,790
I know you're doing great. Thank you. Thank you for letting me come in this space.

362
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:56,290
Thank you for letting me learn from you. I do it just like this, too.

363
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:01,850
I mean, I'm not doing it on purpose. I'm just kind of socially awkward and I and I'm honest about that.

364
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:10,100
But that so practically, you know, making sure that people understand where you what your posture is.

365
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:15,410
And so if you're coming in with a humble posture is important. It helps build that relationship.

366
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,680
It's much like working with youth for those who work with youth.

367
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:25,910
Just be real established positions and strategies that guy interactions with constituents.

368
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,660
So in part that goes back to that planning, you know,

369
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:38,120
having a basic sense of how people might engage with the project evaluation if you

370
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:43,060
hadn't realized is not something that most people spend their day thinking about,

371
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:53,630
right? So that clarity is helpful to say, okay, well, some ways that we thought you might be engaged this we're going to do a planning session.

372
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:59,630
On. You know, we're thinking we will do it in the fall.

373
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:04,490
We'll have people come together and we'll work through this logic model development process.

374
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:09,799
And we would love for you to be there because you've been working with this

375
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:16,250
program for two years or you've been participating in this program for one year.

376
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:24,220
We would love your input. And then also in terms of establishing positions and strategies,

377
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:30,850
refers to what values will guide your interactions, how often when you speak what people.

378
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:37,740
How, you know, in what forms will it be through email?

379
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,330
Will it be through in-person engagement?

380
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:49,900
The third practice element is building and sustaining formal and informal networks to maintain relationships,

381
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:53,260
community messages and leverage resources.

382
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:58,060
So thinking again about that example of the newsletter I gave,

383
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:07,690
how can we continue to build and sustain a network so that people are attentive to what's going on in the evaluation?

384
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:18,310
So it's not a surprise effort and but also so that you can leverage those relationships in other projects.

385
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:24,620
I work a lot in south eastern Michigan, in part so that I can leverage networks.

386
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:34,250
So if I have a client who is doing work in reentry, you know, from the from prison,

387
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,710
who's doing the project in my area, I might because of my networks.

388
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:46,519
Have you suggest that they speak to another organization so that the lessons that that organization

389
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:53,120
learned in their evaluation can then be disseminated and apply in this other project.

390
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:58,370
So those networks are key, not just in the moment, but in a continual basis,

391
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,460
and then finally mobilizing communities and constituencies for decision making and social action.

392
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:12,350
You know, as I've said before, you know, it's it's similar to base building.

393
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:19,830
How can we keep people aware of what we're doing and how it drives against social action and decision making?

394
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:27,930
So it's not just about saying, yes, we did this data collection and we learned it's we did this data collection.

395
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:36,240
We learned. And that was learnings can be applied in this community initiative that you're doing right now.

396
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:45,010
That's just an example. So being continually aware of what's going on and how the evaluation results fit within that.

397
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:54,240
Right. So are there challenges? Yes.

398
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:59,610
So it's important that when you're doing engagement, there will be challenges.

399
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:12,240
And this comic shows we have a tendency, especially as academics or those trained as academics.

400
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:22,880
To go into a space and say yeah well that you know analysis that we did this regression analysis on the variables you know,

401
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:30,510
joy and hope and want to see how that influenced sexual engagement.

402
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:34,880
Everybody knows what I'm talking about. If I start talking about P values.

403
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:40,370
NULL hypothesis. That means nothing to people.

404
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:52,760
So they're always going to be challenges because we are different people coming into a space and working toward collective action.

405
00:53:56,180 --> 00:54:03,080
So some challenges that I have faced, and that engagement just brings about.

406
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,130
One lack of clarity about roles and responsibilities.

407
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:09,420
Who's supposed to be doing what?

408
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:21,350
Who's who has decision, especially when it gets to that that end of the continuum, when we're talking about share leadership roles.

409
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:26,130
Who gets to make the decision about what that is collective?

410
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:34,980
Or who gets to make the decision about who gets to see the report or the findings and what findings anyway?

411
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:42,000
So lack of clarity is a challenge, unacknowledged or unmanaged power dynamics.

412
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:55,140
You know, thinking about Sad Saturday. There was there were huge power dynamics involved because of it.

413
00:54:55,380 --> 00:55:05,580
Me working with a board who has if you're familiar with what boards do, they have ultimate financial decision making power.

414
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:10,080
So be nice to your board members. We get to say how much money you make. I don't know.

415
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:20,970
That's the take away. But then they were working with a council who has community authority but doesn't have the financial authority.

416
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:25,560
And so one thing that somebody pointed out from the get go and that told her, I love you for this.

417
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:31,859
She was like, look, she was like, we don't know what the council or the board does or who has what authority,

418
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:36,810
because we can say whatever we want all day. The board can just say we don't have any money for that and that's it.

419
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:47,009
That she acknowledged the power dynamic in the room, that no matter how many strategic priorities we decided in that room she lifted up

420
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:52,770
that the board had to be willing to accept the authority of the community council.

421
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:59,710
So if those kind of dynamics aren't acknowledged, it can create a challenge.

422
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:08,170
Differences in language and framing. P values just say me, but that's just one example.

423
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:17,770
Differences and values and lenses. The example that I gave earlier about the two organizations who have the same goal,

424
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:24,190
community empowerment, but had totally different ideas about how they get there.

425
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:27,360
That was the issue of differences and values.

426
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:36,610
And so if we had worked more actively, you know, I continue to work with that organization on partnering with the second organization.

427
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:43,640
We're going to have to be honest about the values that are there. And then differences and goals and objectives.

428
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:50,450
Maybe the organization or partners don't have the same objectives in the first place.

429
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:55,910
Maybe one organization who's at the table feels that.

430
00:56:57,030 --> 00:57:01,770
The community should build a community center.

431
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:07,550
Another partner may feel that the community needs to build a community garden.

432
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:18,310
Those differences are often there. So how do we manage those challenges as an evaluator?

433
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:22,600
One thing that we can do is acknowledge the complexity of cultural identity.

434
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:32,170
You know, taking this board counsel example from the Saturday AM, I understood that in part.

435
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:38,250
These two groups live in two different communities with two different cultures.

436
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:45,629
And so lifting that up in this space and getting in what I did was trying to get

437
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:51,390
them to see ways that they had common things in common or share perspectives.

438
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:57,540
In this case, I facilitated them through thinking about home and what does a neighborhood look like?

439
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:06,900
They were able to find commonality on the idea of home and the idea of your neighborhood being home.

440
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:14,610
So sometimes you might have to take what feels like a step backwards to be able to get them to work together.

441
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:19,100
Recognizing and mitigating the dynamics of power.

442
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:27,500
So one thing you can do is make sure that you're introducing decision making techniques that are more participatory.

443
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:32,030
For example, has anybody ever heard of this? The five.

444
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:38,879
Or gradients of agreement. Awesome.

445
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,880
That means you get to read about something. I'm gonna write it down.

446
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:48,450
So these are two participatory decision making techniques.

447
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:52,780
Then I probably would not have shared on Thursday.

448
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:59,560
Which. I'll finish writing this.

449
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:10,800
Yes, there are two ways of facilitating collaborative decision making.

450
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:16,810
And it's not it's not as easy as saying, okay, this is what we're going to do.

451
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:25,450
Because when you do things like that, that's where you can end up not mitigating power dynamics,

452
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:32,830
recognizing and mitigating your bias, either in self or relationships.

453
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:42,790
What are some biases that the groups that you're working with might have about each other or individual members?

454
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:51,389
Part of the planning team. So part of managing the challenges is trying to identify and name these

455
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:58,830
potential biases and get and help to facilitate and manage and account for them.

456
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:05,160
And related maiming tensions as well as fuzzy boundaries.

457
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:14,160
You know, thinking about decision making, who has a decision making power, who's part of that decision making in this space?

458
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:27,570
Sometimes those boundaries are fuzzy. And so clarifying those lines and relationships can help with any challenges that emerge in engagement.

459
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:31,110
And then finally know when to facilitate and when to educate.

460
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:36,570
Relationship building is helpful to be able to pick up on the nuances.

461
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:40,560
Sometimes it's about facilitating around.

462
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:47,140
Tensions. But sometimes there is a there's space for education.

463
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:55,510
For example, when offensive or outdated information about a cultural group is present, it.

464
01:00:57,370 --> 01:01:06,950
When? Issues about tech or that was about to say the technical aspects of evaluation emerge.

465
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:17,750
That's another space where education is helpful. So sometimes that means I might have to take a step back and do a workshop on evaluation or data.

466
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:25,889
Not necessarily part of the original scope, but if I want the engagement to continue to succeed,

467
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:31,410
that means that in this position, I'm going to need to do some education.

468
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:41,010
And again, you know, I can't emphasize enough that sometimes that education is also about outdated or

469
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:47,430
offensive ideas about particular groups or intersections of identity groups.

470
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:55,630
Oh, okay. That's what I have.

471
01:01:55,900 --> 01:02:00,250
So before I go into the email assignment, any questions?

472
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:10,210
Well, that means I'm sufficiently just grounded.

473
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:15,680
And don't be a jerk when you go engage with people.

474
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:26,270
Awesome. So on Thursday, we'll do I'll show you some strategies for being formal about engagement.

475
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:35,520
So look forward to that. Maybe I'll even be able to fit in one of these decision making techniques.

476
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:39,340
Early Show off. All right.

477
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:43,090
So your first assignment, the email assignment.

478
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:50,390
I would love I should start by saying I would love your feedback on this.

479
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:54,460
This is the first time I'm trying out this assignment.

480
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:02,650
Because typically what I've had people do, I usually have smaller classes, so they actually practice talking to each other.

481
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:09,130
But and, you know, I spoke with Hanna, the GSI and I said, well, how can we figure this out?

482
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:14,020
And lo and behold, here, email assignment.

483
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:25,450
So the gist of the sentence, how would you communicate with your partners that that is basically what I want you to kind of play with.

484
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:29,170
And I've also found that when I've worked with students in the past.

485
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:37,890
And they're doing a mission emails with clients that can be a point of like nervousness and anxiety.

486
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:44,190
So here we go. We're going to try it out. So your response should be at least one paragraph long.

487
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:52,140
It needs to have a main thesis, basically. What is your SO in canvas?

488
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:59,610
In canvas there is a description of the assignment, but there's also a scenario that is offered.

489
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:09,810
And they're asking. The hypothetical authors of this email are asking you a question.

490
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:18,960
And so your response needs to have an idea to resolve the conflict that they are bringing up through that question.

491
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:25,300
Fam. You need to just justify a response for two reasons.

492
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:33,500
So. Whatever solution you propose needs to have two reasons why you think this is a good solution.

493
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:42,320
Now it accounts for what you know about the organization, and there's a little bit of information about the organization.

494
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:47,000
I would like you to format it as a professional email.

495
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:51,940
So no. Yo, Sarah.

496
01:04:55,200 --> 01:05:04,290
You might get to the point with a client where you say, Yo, Sarah, but this is my best time, so please for me as a professional email.

497
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:11,760
Hello, Sarah or. Good afternoon, Sarah.

498
01:05:12,330 --> 01:05:18,660
There are ways that you can start an email and you can end it professionally.

499
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:25,100
My favorite is best. I stole that from a social work faculty.

500
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:31,609
I don't remember what I felt about what somebody said, but I don't know what I used to say before.

501
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:34,700
But now it's best. Every email ends as best.

502
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:40,280
And then in between. Formal, you know, formal.

503
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:49,480
Language not too formal. So what I'm looking for is if you were speaking to a professional again that you'll.

504
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:55,550
Sarah, what's up? Maybe you need to do this.

505
01:05:56,060 --> 01:06:04,190
And then this is built like this. That and the shorthand is, yeah, don't do that.

506
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:14,390
So you all are laughing. I get emails like this from you all too, so don't do that.

507
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:21,240
Know I can't come. Tired?

508
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:28,470
No. You know, professional.

509
01:06:28,890 --> 01:06:33,180
And I will accept those, but not for the assignment.

510
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:40,100
If you're tired, you fine. I'm sorry.

511
01:06:40,110 --> 01:06:43,950
They make me laugh. I'm like, Somebody email me, husband.

512
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:47,970
I don't know what it says. It's like a shorthand. I'm old.

513
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:55,980
Yeah, I don't know. But anyway, so format is a professional email summit in Camp Canvas.

514
01:06:55,980 --> 01:07:08,790
So there's an assignment for this in canvas. Submit that by 920 and 11:59 p.m. if you think you are not going to submit it by 11:59 p.m. on the 20th.

515
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:15,219
Just send me email. You can also you can also try slack.

516
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:18,250
I will warn you that slack. I do open it, but.

517
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:25,740
I constantly check my email so I do not constantly check slack.

518
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,390
So email first, then slack if you must.

519
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:34,960
Some questions to consider. And these are just, you know,

520
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:42,180
going to get you thinking about putting you in the frame of responding to this email that you're going to get from the clients,

521
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:47,850
whether their main concerns, what could be lost from the evaluation.

522
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:54,840
If you identify a solution, what could be gain for the evaluation if you identify a particular solution?

523
01:07:55,640 --> 01:08:03,920
So those are just some things to think about. And I don't want you to get super anxiety, super anxiety around this.

524
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:08,509
I make jokes about crafting, but I'm you're all adults.

525
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:13,660
You know how to craft a professional email. And again, this is a thought exercise.

526
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:19,300
So. Don't. I promise you, I'm going to be gracious.

527
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:27,580
And just really what I really want to see is that you're kind of thinking about what might emerge in a relationship with a client.

528
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:37,910
Any questions? Make sure your margins at all.

529
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:42,650
Right. If there are no questions. I'm finishing 10 minutes early.

530
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:47,900
So go write some emails. Okay.

531
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:22,930
You know it. You know.

532
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:52,810
Oh, I. Hello.

533
01:09:53,310 --> 01:10:00,930
I want to show you something. So you said we have the youth and the like.

534
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:06,830
The things. Or yes, to be informed by something,

535
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:18,370
we have to specify what others are trying to was the things that they're trying to do here or is is right it and you're right.

536
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:22,210
I didn't get the latter. So you don't have the right thesis, is that what you're asking?

537
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:27,410
I mean, we like to try to explain why we want to respond out of all that.

538
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:31,870
Do we have to do that or. Oh, I get your question.

539
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:40,520
No, no, I felt like no, but I honestly wish I got that question before I want it because well, they've actually been really helpful because.

540
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:45,370
But no, no, no, no. Okay, so good ideas.

541
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:53,930
It's afraid if I like it's weird or if I don't explain anyone get it or something, just let me know that.

542
01:10:53,930 --> 01:11:02,190
And part of what you're doing is, is trying to communicate it in a way that we're that comes off clearly okay.

543
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:10,640
Because again you're part in you say this on the assignment is about how do you do this while maintaining the relationship and maintaining trust.

544
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:15,440
Oh yeah. You're welcome you to.

545
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:29,950
I'll do this every time. Drop it. So I'm out riding here tomorrow and.

546
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:38,760
I think. So we're talking about coalition here.

547
01:11:39,410 --> 01:11:46,880
I just want to give anybody. Sit down after at flight 12.

548
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:53,160
I still haven't gotten all. Kelly.

549
01:11:57,110 --> 01:12:01,210
Something that I came up with. I don't know. Somebody else might say something different.

550
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:04,870
My favorite one in Milton Keynes.

551
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:09,730
Oh, like with gratitude, too. Yeah. And then other people have, like, started to.

552
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:16,340
But I definitely like. I don't know that is is like us to that.

553
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:21,500
I got a little right. You know what it's like.

554
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:26,880
I stole it from somebody else. I like to think that's because with gratitude, sometimes another.

555
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:32,030
Grateful. I'm crying. I'm actually responding with gratitude for you.

556
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:35,090
Actually, listen to what I have to say. Well, sometimes this.

557
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:40,879
I do it based on being whoever, you know. So sometimes. Sincerely.

558
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:47,110
I will do my best or. I really like the person we're kind of trying to build.

559
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:53,170
For. Their partnership to bank.

560
01:12:55,610 --> 01:13:00,470
For those wearing masks, it might be to. She posted.

561
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:13,520
She was just talking. In a way.

562
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:21,830
You can see what she was just talking to the person. It's the one.

563
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:36,810
Yes. So last time we were talking about. Create frameworks and things like that.

564
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:46,720
I also think it's important for the.

565
01:13:47,810 --> 01:13:52,850
On. Transitional thinking.

566
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,890
It is a kind of script for series. About.

567
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:03,110
Moving forward into this century, how we're going to deal with energy disarmament.

568
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:13,820
Two factors. So as fossil fuels are reduced. Available energy from fossil fuels.

569
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:17,980
How that works. And then climate change.

570
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:29,890
The premise of the. Of course, this really is how to engage communities, kind of support communities in this kind of.

571
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:35,430
So one of the. Now it's behavior, environment, like an environmental.

572
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:45,750
And then the other is globalization. So how do we think about creating and strengthening resilient local communities

573
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:50,790
in all of the different ways that they're going to be needed into the future?

574
01:14:51,400 --> 01:15:00,760
So that's why when you mentioned that, I thought that was really interesting because I've tried to do some community councils and things like that,

575
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:08,500
but I wanted to hear more about how you engage. And.

576
01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:16,610
That nature of how you find this community is. To be working together or.

577
01:15:20,330 --> 01:15:26,060
So yeah, it's a lot. So I don't know where you want to start, but I was just some context for what I was thinking.

578
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:33,130
So I've worked with. So I've worked with existing councils.

579
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:40,530
And then I also work with groups that might be called the council or of advisory group.

580
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:48,130
There were four for the. But so.

581
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:55,420
I guess they'll probably. Some of the councils that I've worked with.

582
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:19,290
Part. Follow it on. They're not.

583
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:33,470
They don't have legal. Like an advisory council to.

584
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:38,200
Like or or like to a city council.

585
01:16:39,650 --> 01:16:57,620
I've never worked in. I'm not working with women so far.

586
01:16:57,770 --> 01:17:01,540
I am working on a project. The. So therein lies.

587
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:12,440
For community groups or for. So.

588
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:19,190
They used foundations to do community work.

589
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:24,490
Yeah. And, um. But I've never.

590
01:17:24,910 --> 01:17:27,910
And I've worked with foundations, corporate foundations. But.

591
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:44,140
Have that level of engagement. I mean, I tell this for my couple.

592
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:49,350
My love experience working directly with both corporate foundations.

593
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:59,000
Like it. So. But I'm sure there are some good.

594
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:14,030
Surprisingly like the Walton family. They have everything they need.

595
01:18:17,810 --> 01:18:22,700
Like there are. And like for. Not for foundation.

596
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:29,400
Actual corporate. More Rocket Motor Company Foundation.

597
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:36,650
They've got some community building. I know some have.

598
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:48,890
In terms of working with them. So. So my work with as part of the theme being evaluated.

599
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:54,220
So one of the earlier ones over. I think that was probably the one I mentioned.

600
01:18:57,710 --> 01:19:00,800
But. I did work.

601
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:07,020
With. Work on an evaluation.

602
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:11,180
Where we were evaluating an initiative.

603
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:18,690
They granted money to. It's all the councils and their activities.

604
01:19:26,290 --> 01:19:45,540
Whether or not that funding. In that case, it's.

605
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:55,850
But they're making this. As for future action versus there's always been action.

606
01:19:58,220 --> 01:19:58,870
We're working to.
