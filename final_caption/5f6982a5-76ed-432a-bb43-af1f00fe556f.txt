1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:09,200
And have they done violence interventions already? We so last week we had a couple of speakers come from Galan's perspective.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,210
So that was talking about this violence and there's no reason I was talking about scoring violence.

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,639
So we've got a little bit of exposure, then we'll do another community round.

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:30,000
But this is already our first. I've wanted to talk.

5
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,210
Oh, my gosh. I was so nervous about it.

6
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:42,900
It was, oh, you guys know what the precarious situation is?

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,770
Let's take a look at our shoulders and even know who he is.

8
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:57,570
So that's why I feel like it's if you watch, if you did anything, if you if you did anything, you wanted to see it know it's very BuzzFeed.

9
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,490
I saw like thanks for. Yeah yeah.

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:11,200
So that's the way I know it has to do with that part of the floor.

11
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,150
When I was like, Oh, I love my wife. I love this person.

12
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:27,610
That was like my favorite piece of family. And then it's come out well, he probably goes to that, not as a producer and associate producer.

13
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,420
And the he's kind of the guy, you know, the teenager. Yeah.

14
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:39,450
Yeah. And so this is a producer's like for day to day from time to time, you know, it's not.

15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,470
So that's why for now, why would you do that? Is he really that famous like that?

16
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:52,350
How many super subscribers? How can you afford to sit in a situation and really rough him?

17
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:59,270
Oh, well, it's unfortunate, but I'm pretty good at teaching the intro stat.

18
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,739
Professor, teach this your first time.

19
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:10,170
So that was across the score so far when they're is absolutely have like six have six students for the phone number

20
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:17,100
going to work so you're going to trust me as or just yeah across the table so that's like kind of big for you,

21
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,860
like actually having a small part of the show.

22
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:29,339
Like usually I teach undergrads, they're also going to ask questions that are so very nice having such a small something like this,

23
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,819
you're getting a lot more feedback about that. Yeah.

24
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,809
So is it is there one course.

25
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:44,080
That kind of is the one. Yeah, I'm doing the first semester and then my colleagues coming over and I was concerned for both of us, I think.

26
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,530
Oh, right, yeah. So you try to be more like really just to interact with a lot of them who don't come in with

27
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,340
quantitative background or so I actually I'm starting kind of with the things like that.

28
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:00,940
You just like build a couple extra and undecided group, have more journal articles that they review and you know,

29
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,850
thinking more about like how are they going to you're trying to use data there.

30
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,880
Yeah yeah guess yeah. You make that decision.

31
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:16,290
Well the one I'm kind of agnostic about the data of whatever they probably just the next and I don't really

32
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:23,100
like and for a while I was like each semester like there's like a different language depending on who is.

33
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,160
Yeah, that's hard to say because I tell you, I was like, Yeah.

34
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:39,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,740
And we've kind of we always think, oh, my God, it's like a school bus.

36
00:03:48,720 --> 00:04:00,610
I was thinking to myself, trying to be no more than 140.

37
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,190
Oh, yeah, but yeah. Now it's just cutting edge. Yeah.

38
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:12,380
So I think we don't need it was either five or six.

39
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,129
It was a distraction for the president.

40
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,060
So I do it with our studio. It makes it a little.

41
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

42
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:36,209
Well, yeah, I think for the undergrads I was debating right now and I was like, You can't do it all the time.

43
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,710
It's like in the dropdown menus, but it's, you know, because they started last night.

44
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:50,070
Yeah. They keep it together. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Well, I think it's important, you know, if we can, you know, have.

45
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,260
All right, folks, how we doing today? Well, nice.

46
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,970
Nice to see all. I hope that everyone is having a good week.

47
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:09,300
We're actually going to just jump right into it because our the speaker, Dr. Sarah Banks Murray is here to talk a little bit about intervention.

48
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:18,420
Do I have a slides? Uh, so Dr. Mary Beth, Mary is coming to us from the School of Nursing.

49
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:23,820
I won't do a super long introduction, but super relevant to some of the areas that we're going to be covering in this class.

50
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,160
I'm excited that we're going to hear about an intervention today.

51
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,560
Some of the readings are up on campus so folks can access them either during or following this lecture as well.

52
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:37,200
But I think we're going to hear a little bit about intimate partner violence intervention,

53
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,379
which just dovetails well with some of your broader areas of work.

54
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:47,850
So I will not linger here too often and just turn it over and say, thank you so much for joining us.

55
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,850
We're excited. Okay. Well, to thank everyone for having me.

56
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:56,069
I'm really excited to be here. We don't have injury prevention intervention class in the school of Nursing.

57
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:02,459
So I was really excited when Dr. Hynes invited me to come talk to you all and talk to like minded folks who are really invested in this area.

58
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,950
So thanks for having me here today. So I'm actually going to talk about sexual assault prevention intervention.

59
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:14,670
So the first half of the talk, we're going to talk about how we're working on adapting an existing in-person intervention for the online space.

60
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,129
And then the second half, I'm going to talk about how do we then adapt that intervention to work for transgender

61
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,120
students for whom we have very few sexual assault prevention interventions.

62
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,469
So. Okay. And it's okay if you haven't.

63
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:33,780
Did anybody read the either the randomized trial article or the article about self-defense interventions?

64
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:41,790
Yeah. Okay. So did any of you what did you guys take away from this debate around self-defense and feminist empowerment interventions?

65
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:50,849
What are what are they like? What are some of the controversies in the field about it just came out okay.

66
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:59,339
No worries. So I will just start from square one. So many people are surprised to hear that we actually have an intervention that was shown in a

67
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,200
large randomized trial to reduce sexual assault victimization against college women by over 50%.

68
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,440
So that is a fantastically effective intervention.

69
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:16,620
It's called the Enhanced Assess, Acknowledge Act intervention or E Triple A, and the randomized trial article is posted.

70
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,150
So you guys can take a look at that and maybe think about it for your intervention critique assignment in the future.

71
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,260
So you can see in the article women were individually randomized to either take the intervention or be in a control group.

72
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:36,389
And comparatively, the intervention group experienced half as many sexual assaults during their first two years in college.

73
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:45,330
So this is a really exciting and powerful intervention and it is a 12 hour group based intervention.

74
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:52,670
There's four units to the intervention, so they need four times for 3 hours each and the first unit is called a assess.

75
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:58,920
And so the way this intervention works is that it really unpacks a lot of what women are taught about what sexual

76
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,450
assault looks like and replaces that with like evidence based red flags of what sexual assault looks like.

77
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:09,659
So we are all taught that we should fear the stranger in the bushes in a dark parking garage and a lot of

78
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,430
women don't actually know that are statistically more likely to be assaulted by someone that you know.

79
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,959
And so it's often really hard to recognize sexual assault or coercion in the

80
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,960
moment because we're expecting one thing and being presented with another.

81
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:28,530
So the first thing it really talks about, how do you assess risk in evidence based with the second unit called knowledge?

82
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:36,160
And that's because. There are a lot of psychosocial and emotional barriers to affirming your own safety in a coercive situation, right?

83
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,430
So women are taught to be nice and not make a scene.

84
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,730
And maybe he just didn't understand what I was saying.

85
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,629
And all of these sort of gender norms and social scripts that we grow up with.

86
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:53,080
And so the second unit and knowledge really unpacks a lot of these barriers around gender socialization and

87
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,870
helps women reframe some of those things that they're actually prepared to affirm their own safety and trust,

88
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:05,610
their intuition and their gut when something's telling them the situation isn't safe and I deserve to be safe and do something about that.

89
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:12,519
So the third unit is called ACT, and so we never tell women what they should do in a coercive situation,

90
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:18,610
but we try to expand their toolbox of strategies that they can draw upon if they're in a situation where they feel unsafe.

91
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:24,250
And we focus on forceful, verbal and physical self-defense in this session.

92
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,780
And that's because, first of all, those are some of the techniques that women are least prepared to use.

93
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:35,230
They both don't have technical knowledge about how to use those. And also they're emotionally unprepared to use them against a man that they know.

94
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,959
Right. So we have spent a lot of time and have knowledge unpacking some of those barriers to affirming our own safety.

95
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:49,090
And then, in fact, we actually teach some strategies that women can choose to call upon if they so choose to in a coercive situation.

96
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,639
And the reason the other reason we focus on forceful, verbal and physical self-defense is that statistically,

97
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,180
from nationally representative data of assaults that women have experienced,

98
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:05,770
we know that forceful, verbal and physical self-defense is actually associated with lower likelihood of completion without affecting risk of injury.

99
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,649
So those are other pieces of gender socialization.

100
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:15,729
I think a lot of us were taught that if you fight back, that will make the assaulter mad and thus you'll be more injured.

101
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:21,580
I don't know how many people have heard that myth before. Yeah. So that's like a common myth that a lot of people have been told.

102
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,820
So statistically from the research, we actually know that that is not true.

103
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:31,360
So that's why we try to expand women's toolbox of strategies that they can call upon if they're in an unsafe situation.

104
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,820
And in the last unit, which I really love, is a emancipatory sex ed unit.

105
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,839
And so it's a sex positive sex ed unit that really asks young women and women are coming into this group when they're 18 years old,

106
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,370
freshman in college, and a lot of them are asked for the first time, you know, what sex do you actually want?

107
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:55,089
Thinking about your own desires? What are your boundaries? What what do you want to do in affirming that?

108
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:59,860
And so it really puts everything in a more holistic and sex positive framework.

109
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:07,330
So it's not just how do you avoid unwanted sex, but also like thinking more holistically about sex and sexual desire.

110
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:14,500
Any questions about how the intervention works? Okay.

111
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:20,169
So I really encourage you to read that the commentary piece that's about sexual assault,

112
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:25,450
self-defense interventions, because it's it's really interesting how, you know,

113
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:31,360
this has kind of been a debate in the field because rightly a lot of feminists have focused on,

114
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,110
you know, we need to have more interventions with men and potential perpetrators.

115
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:40,660
How do we reduce perpetration? It shouldn't be all on women to prevent their own assaults, quote unquote.

116
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:48,910
And so, you know, is doing these self-defense interventions, anti feminist in some way or putting the burden on women to keep themselves safe?

117
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:55,750
But what we try to do here is really a feminist approach to self-defense and sexual assault resistance.

118
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,230
So we're putting it in an empower empowerment framework.

119
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,459
So it's not what the article calls safety work.

120
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:09,270
So it's not like they home and start out or don't drink or don't do these things.

121
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,720
It's here's how we assess risk and understand risk in a evidence based way.

122
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,700
Here's how we expand your toolbox of tools that you can draw upon in a situation if you feel unsafe.

123
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:27,180
And here's how you feel empowered in your own sexuality. So it really takes a different feminist approach to sexual assault resistance and is

124
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:31,840
not similar to some more old school self-defense interventions that you may have seen.

125
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:39,159
So the article does a really nice job unpacking it and also talking about how these are some of the most effective interventions that we have.

126
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,630
But they're really underappreciated, I think, because of some of these cultural and political considerations and concerns.

127
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:57,440
Yeah. Any thoughts or comments about that? So this Internet intervention is really powerful.

128
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,810
It reduces sexual assault by over 50%. The problem is, no one uses it.

129
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,170
Like, I mean, if you went to university in Michigan, we don't have it here.

130
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,340
There's actually only seven colleges right now in the United States that implement this intervention,

131
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,550
even though it's really the most effective one we have for college women.

132
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,420
And that's because it's expensive.

133
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:28,460
So it's 12 hours of in-person group learning and it comes out to about $300 per participant for the first year and even more than the expense,

134
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,750
each college has to implement the intervention.

135
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:38,479
So if you want to bring this intervention to your college campus, you have to hire someone to hire and train a bunch of peer facilitators.

136
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,100
You have to figure out where to book all the rooms on campus and organize the whole thing yourself.

137
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,780
So it's very logistically burdensome for college campuses, and most of them are like, Well,

138
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:54,739
I can fulfill my full nerd obligations by giving you a click through online training that I have no evidence base whatsoever, but I won't get sued.

139
00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:03,230
So that's kind of how colleges think. I think that this is logistically intensive to implement and it's expensive and so very few have taken it up.

140
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,160
So what? Oh, yeah, go ahead. So this might be a bit much to ask.

141
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:20,989
Yeah, but yeah. If there's already been like a pretty well-established history of people who like the perpetrators of rape or violence,

142
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:26,260
are usually people that individuals know and like there's been a history of.

143
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:33,950
Like, you'll see a bunch of colleges have it really. People in leadership positions have taken advantage and violated boundaries,

144
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:44,190
and it's still been known to happen even with just the click through, here's your rights, here's what you should do.

145
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:50,440
You just don't call them at night or there's a big one yet. It's really not a factor right now.

146
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:58,850
Why is it is it like like is a lawsuit that we like comparatively or.

147
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,600
I have the same question. Yes.

148
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:12,379
Okay. So this is my personal opinion is that a lot of these all out of the decisions around sexual assault prevention on college campuses

149
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:20,000
are driven by taking loan offices that are primarily staffed by lawyers rather than public health professionals like all of you.

150
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,769
And so like the decisions around what programing is offered to students is really

151
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:29,899
based around am I meeting my legal obligation versus am I choosing an evidence based,

152
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,170
effective intervention that is prevention focus?

153
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,950
I think there's also really like a response focus at universities because a lot of

154
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:42,169
Title nine is focused on are you meeting your obligations to respond to survivors

155
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:48,469
in a supportive way that affirms their right to continue an education versus

156
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,500
thinking about it from a public health and prevention focus where it's like,

157
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,920
okay, how do we stop sexual assault from actually happening in the first place,

158
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,790
which is where interventions like this can come in, bystander interventions can help.

159
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,360
There's a lot of like a portfolio of interventions that can help, but this one,

160
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,460
I think, is really underutilized for it, given the effect that it has got.

161
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:13,639
Would you say that the fact that this is only targeted towards women is also a barrier for college campuses,

162
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:19,490
particularly when we're talking about like meeting your legal requirements because you're not on target.

163
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:24,850
And then also it's kind of about is it being tested on other populations at all?

164
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,140
I mean, especially considering that transgender. Yeah.

165
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:32,940
I'm converting. I have really high rates of. Yes, so great question.

166
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:36,390
So yes, actually there is one college which I will not name,

167
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:42,070
but they implemented this intervention and that's like a men's rights activist immediately sued them saying like, what about the men?

168
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:47,340
Why don't we have an intervention? They suddenly cared about trans people and that's why they don't have an intervention.

169
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,970
And so that is a challenge.

170
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:56,190
So that lawsuit was ultimately dismissed, but there was an attempt to like use Title nine, which was intended to affirm women's right,

171
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:02,489
to equal access to education, to actually get rid of a program like this which actually fulfills that purpose.

172
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,709
So there are legal issues at that. And the second half of my talk is about our work to adapt this for trans populations.

173
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,800
So I'll be part of that. Okay. Yeah, I figured that was coming. Yep.

174
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:17,140
In the back. Is this more like specifically right now, developed for like an undergraduate?

175
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,970
Yes, for graduate population, yeah. Okay. Undergrads.

176
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:29,970
So I was really tested in women age 18 to 25. Trans women are welcome to take this intervention and some have it's just not this version is not really

177
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,200
based on sort of the unique vulnerabilities that trans people of any gender have to sexual assault.

178
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,860
So it may be somewhat less useful for themselves ever hoping to have like a specific version for trans folks.

179
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,639
You know, one principle with intervention development is that you want the intervention to feel personally relevant to the people who go through it.

180
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,500
Right. And so I think some of the material would be relevant for graduate students,

181
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,800
but a lot of the scenarios that are given are like the types of parties that

182
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,059
undergrads might be more likely than graduate students and things like that.

183
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,990
And so it may just not quite feel quite as relevant for grad students,

184
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:08,309
maybe more at risk of things like faculty taking advantage of them or things like that.

185
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:13,830
Yeah, but there another question over here. Those are great questions.

186
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:19,319
Any other questions? Yeah, I really like working in this space and there's a lot of like political and social considerations that

187
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,979
come into that really shaped like what can we do with the science and how does it get implemented?

188
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:32,820
So okay, so our idea is that maybe we could do this intervention online instead of in person and that way.

189
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,780
And first of all, it would cut a lot of the cost of the intervention by about 30 to 50%.

190
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:43,470
And even more than the cost, as I mentioned, it would make it so colleges no longer have to implement their own intervention so we

191
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,830
can have a centralized pool of facilitators that are maintained by like a nonprofit,

192
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:52,020
a central nonprofit, and then colleges just have to pay money to buy facilitator time.

193
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:59,459
And so we could actually have students from multiple universities join together through Zoom and do these groups.

194
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,850
So instead of having in-person groups, we now do all the groups over Zoom.

195
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:09,930
So that makes sense. So that was our idea. So we came up with this idea before the pandemic and then the pandemic hit and then we were like,

196
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:13,950
Wow, this is really important and we really need to do this work.

197
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:22,709
So the aim of the study was to adapt Triple A for synchronous interactive online delivery to groups of students by like facilitators.

198
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:32,460
And, you know, colleges always want to have like the click through individual training module that students can just do whenever by themselves.

199
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:38,219
And we really felt like that wasn't going to be effective just knowing about injury, intervention, science,

200
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:44,670
like there's so much about the group process and the interactivity of it that really is key to the learning

201
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:50,940
objectives and being able to practice the skills that you can't do with like a click through intervention,

202
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,680
right? I don't know. Like I remember when I long time ago had to do these intervention,

203
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:03,480
these online modules from the RNC from not like for alcohol edu I think are those called for alcohol and there might have been a consent one,

204
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,329
but it's like you just kind of click through as fast as possible and people aren't really learning much from that.

205
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:13,110
So it's really important for us to maintain the integrity of the intervention.

206
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:21,360
So we're trying to do everything that we do in the in-person. Can we do it over zoom and we call it Internet delivery you away or idea.

207
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:32,280
Okay so intervention adaptation is a really interesting thing because you already have an intervention that you know is effective.

208
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,250
You're trying to move it to a new modality here online or to a new population, and you want it to remain effective.

209
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:43,680
So how do you how do you do that? So there's a lot of systematic adaptation frameworks.

210
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:50,400
We use one called Adapt it. And the focus there is you try to change as little as possible without the intervention

211
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,600
and test it out in your new modality or your new population and see how it works.

212
00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:02,750
And using that hard data from rolling it out in this new modality, you see what works,

213
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:11,040
you see what doesn't work, and then you just change the parts that don't work. And that way you're not just changing things willy nilly.

214
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,580
You're making like common sense adaptations that you need to look at online,

215
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,610
and then you see how it works online, and then you make changes from there.

216
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:22,080
So your adaptations are iterative and like really data driven where you're testing it out,

217
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,400
seeing how it works, making changes, testing it out, seeing how it works and making changes.

218
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,440
So this is a. A systematic adaptation process.

219
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:38,700
The process also really encourages you to identify like what are the core components of the intervention.

220
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,570
So like for each activity we do, like what are the learning objectives?

221
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:48,720
What do we need students to take away from this particular activity so that if you have to make a bunch of changes for online,

222
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,260
you are keeping those that in mind when you make the changes.

223
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:59,040
So you're really making the changes based on your theoretical understanding of like how the intervention works and again,

224
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,610
not making changes willy nilly. So that's all part of the systematic process.

225
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:11,250
So we did a pilot, as I said, it's an iterative process. So we had five groups of women of about 12 to 16,

226
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:18,660
and after each group we collected a bunch of qualitative and quantitative data from them about how the intervention work,

227
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,420
got their feedback, made more changes, and then rolled it out to the next group.

228
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:31,470
So we did post session surveys, so after each session they would fill out quantitative survey that also had some open ended questions for feedback.

229
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,629
And then we also had like a baseline before the first session and a post test survey at the end of the last session.

230
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:41,610
And the nice thing about doing the adaptation is that we already have a lot of data from the in-person trial,

231
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,689
that randomized trial that tells us about how the intervention works.

232
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:55,919
So based on data from that trial of 1000 plus women, we were able to identify key mediators of the intervention effect.

233
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:02,040
So we were able to see, you know, sexual assault likelihood was reduced,

234
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:08,520
particularly for women who saw increases from pretest and post-test in self-defense self-efficacy.

235
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,709
So that's being confident that you could use self-defense to defend yourself if you're being caused by a man that,

236
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:20,310
you know, we also saw other key mediators where rape myth acceptance decreases in rate myth acceptance.

237
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:28,890
So hybrid myth acceptance or false or prejudicial beliefs about sexual assault that are not true but tend to blame the victim.

238
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:35,010
So for women who had decreases in rape myth acceptance, we saw better sexual assault outcomes.

239
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,320
Similarly, this belief in female precipitation of rape, that means the belief that women caused rape.

240
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,120
So we saw decreases and that really drove improvements in sexual assault outcomes.

241
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:53,550
And then we saw a slight increase in personalization of risk of a sexual assault is what's important for intervention efficacy too.

242
00:23:53,580 --> 00:24:01,469
So that means that most women coming in whose intervention, they don't think that rape is something that happens to people like them.

243
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,280
Right. So there's like an urge to think like it only happens to certain kinds of women,

244
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:11,729
not women like me and like the men that I know would never sexually assault me kind of thing.

245
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:20,010
So the intervention for women who are able to personalize the risk of like, oh, this is something that like could happen to me.

246
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:24,930
It's not a reflection of like only certain types of women are at risk of sexual assault.

247
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,459
Women who are able to better accept that had better sexual assault outcomes after intervention.

248
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,990
So we knew all of this from a evidence based, data driven way from the in-person intervention,

249
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:40,350
which is really helpful for our online adaptation because even though we were just doing a pilot,

250
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,330
we couldn't have like an intervention group versus a control group and do a whole randomized trial.

251
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:52,229
Yet we can still look at pretest post-test changes and some of these things that we know are key mediators of intervention effect.

252
00:24:52,230 --> 00:25:00,720
So even though we couldn't have intervention and control and randomize and measure efficacy directly, we can look at these potential indicators.

253
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,880
Or do we seem to be on the right track?

254
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:08,400
Are we moving the psychological indicators that are important, that were important in the in-person intervention,

255
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,890
that were key to its efficacy, that have any questions about that?

256
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,650
Okay. So this is a screen capture from the actor unit, which is where we teach self-defense.

257
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:25,720
So the way we set up this intervention is that everybody had to zoom in with a partner.

258
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:32,290
So for all the sessions, you had one person with you and then the partnerships zoomed in together to this group.

259
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,790
So these are intervention facilitators here. They were out their faces,

260
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:42,489
but then the rest of the folks are the partnerships who are testing out some of the self-defense techniques that they're learning.

261
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:49,870
So this was really, I think, key to the pilot going well is having this kind of innovative blend of in-person and

262
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:57,130
online delivery where you had the camaraderie and support of having someone with you,

263
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,240
but you also had like the implementation advantages of being able to do this online.

264
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:11,860
Okay. So our challenge, our first challenge was having to make everything happen online.

265
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:17,280
And so it's amazing. There are some things that are very easy to do in person that are very challenging to do online.

266
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:25,869
So in the first unit, this is the this part on the right here in the first unit to personalize risk of sexual assault,

267
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:32,859
we have an activity where in person there's like a bag of colored marbles and there's like one quarter of them are a certain color and everybody

268
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:40,540
picks a marble and it's supposed to like illustrate in a concrete way that sexual assault is more common than people think on college campuses.

269
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:47,560
Right. And it you can't pass a bag of marbles with everyone is zooming in.

270
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:54,700
And we couldn't figure out how to do that online and spent so much time just to figure out how to get this virtual bag of marbles going.

271
00:26:54,910 --> 00:27:01,330
We actually ended up paying like a computer science student to make a little app thread where the

272
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:07,479
facilitator is can on the back end of the app they put in how many women are in the program this time?

273
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:14,740
And then that assigns like a probability. And then everybody goes to this app website and they click a link to draw a marble

274
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,009
and then everybody holds up their phone to show what color marble they have.

275
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:23,409
So that was actually like one of the most challenging earth adaptations like for

276
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:27,580
this specific activity was just like something's very being very easy in person.

277
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:32,889
I mean, surprisingly challenging online. Other things were very straightforward and there's some existing apps for it.

278
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,920
So on the left here, this is from the sex ed unit.

279
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:46,030
So you can see that. But to get everyone comfortable talking about sex and to develop a shared body with your own sex, we have in person,

280
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:51,939
it's like poster boards around the room and people walk around the room and write up slang terms that they know for different body parts and stuff.

281
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,250
So you can see like anus is written up here and then people are like, but all of that.

282
00:27:55,270 --> 00:28:00,040
So in person you just walk around the room and write on different whiteboards and it's

283
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,540
like a semi anonymous way to get comfortable started to use some of these words,

284
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,689
but in person we use Google Jam boards. I don't know if you guys use those for your classes.

285
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:14,169
So for some things that was very straightforward.

286
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:20,530
There's an app for that. And then occasionally we had to write our own app or figure out our own process.

287
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:29,860
Okay, so some of the results we had 72 women across the five groups and happy to say that it went pretty well.

288
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:38,320
I was really proud of this pilot on average for the we asked after each session there was an average of 8.5 out of ten.

289
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,530
For how much would you recommend today's session for that friend and women really found?

290
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:46,660
This is like a fun, interactive, empowering experience for them and they really liked it.

291
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:51,670
And then this quote here shows the most important thing for me was doing it with a partner in person.

292
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:57,339
We were talking and discussing the things that were going on and everyone was doing that and getting along with their partner.

293
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:01,600
We were all more into it and that's how the camaraderie was fostered because they're all having fun with each other.

294
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:09,850
So I think that finally some important interventions too, like no one wants to like sit there for 12 hours and be doom and gloom,

295
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:17,649
like it should be empowering and fun right here is that quantitative data that I was talking about that we wanted to look

296
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:25,000
for pretest post-test changes in some of these potential indicators of efficacy based on the data from the in-person trial.

297
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,110
We know that these are key mediators of intervention effect. So I was really happy to see this job.

298
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:36,940
So self defense self-efficacy is like the primary most important mediator in the intervention effect.

299
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,729
On a scale from 9 to 63, we saw pretest 39.62%, 51.8.

300
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:47,290
And that's a very similar jump to what we saw in the in-person trial as well.

301
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,989
So that was a really good encouraging sign for us,

302
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:56,889
even though we don't have a control group to compare to and these are on a different scale and look less impressive,

303
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:00,790
but they're actually all statistically significant differences. So we saw a little decrease in rate.

304
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:05,619
Ms. Acceptance we saw a small decrease in female I believe in female precipitation,

305
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:11,920
a very small increase on the scale that we wanted to see for perceived success, personalization of risk.

306
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,499
So all of the indicators that were moving in the right direction and significantly so,

307
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,700
which I was honestly not even hoping for because I figured this is just a pilot.

308
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:26,950
So it was really encouraging for us to see, yeah, this is working really well already in the pilot.

309
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:33,870
So any questions about that? Yeah. Where would you on this efficacy scale.

310
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,630
Yeah. Where would you put like feelings of safety,

311
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:43,040
say a little bit more about what you mean by feelings of safety like these are feelings of safety increased because of this program.

312
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:50,469
So the self-efficacy scale is really about like how confident are you that you could use self-defense

313
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:55,180
and different types of coercive situations with a focus on like situations and then that,

314
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,339
you know, because that's what the program really focuses on.

315
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:03,760
I think a lot of women like if, if like with a stranger assault, they're like, yeah, of course I would be justified in using force.

316
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:09,070
But for men that they know, they're less. So that's really what this scale was focused on.

317
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:15,940
So we didn't specifically measure like, do you feel safer now, like knowing that you have these tools at your disposal, basically?

318
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,370
Yeah, I think that would be another way to ask the question. That wasn't part of the scale.

319
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:22,540
But yeah, great question. Other questions?

320
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:33,269
Okay. And then we also had focus groups after the groups to get feedback from women

321
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:37,889
about what their experience was like and how did they use the information.

322
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:41,190
And these focus groups for about a week or two after the intervention was over.

323
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:48,360
And this was like even more exciting to me than the quantitative data, honestly, because like even within two weeks,

324
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,940
women were already using what we had taught them and worked with them on and applying it to their own life.

325
00:31:55,050 --> 00:32:03,590
So this person said when we discussed danger cues, those are those like evidence based red flags ranging from strangers to friends and even partners.

326
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,309
And that's really important because, again,

327
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:10,800
women are prepared to recognize risk from strangers and they're not emotionally prepared to recognize risk from people that they know.

328
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:16,440
I feel it's something we're aware of cuz it's easier to see them happening in real life if a friend does something weird.

329
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,120
Normally I brush it off and I ask myself, are they doing something bad?

330
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:27,560
And so that's really important in terms of like women are taught to deny their own instincts about like, I feel safe or I don't feel safe, right?

331
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,290
And so this person is saying, you know, like I used to deny my own instincts about the situation.

332
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,460
Now I'm looking at what I'm seeing, comparing it to the evidence based red flags that I was taught.

333
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,300
And, you know, being a little bit more cautious about the situation than I have been in the past.

334
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,750
Here's two more examples.

335
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:51,900
I was trying to get me to drink along with him at his apartment and was very insistent on taking my drinks and taking his car.

336
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:58,890
And so we talk in the intervention that one danger cue or one evidence, rather, evidence based red flag is persistent.

337
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:04,020
So someone is offering you a drink and that's fine. But if you say no and they're like, No, no, no, you should really drink.

338
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:08,850
And they keep persisting in that, that could be a danger cue that something might be up here.

339
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,620
So she said,

340
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:16,820
I avoided this by recognizing that this would leave me in a situation with no way to get home if I took his car that his intention may not be pure.

341
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:20,010
So people are already within a week or two of taking this intervention,

342
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:27,020
recognizing some of the red flags that we talked about more hypothetically in the context of the grief, they're already applying them to their life.

343
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,190
Right. And then this one as well.

344
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:33,930
I remove my myself and my friend from a situation where they're intoxicated people because we were both uncomfortable.

345
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,560
I insisted that it was okay to leave while she felt pressured to stay.

346
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:45,090
And so, again, this isn't necessarily an assault situation, but it's this idea that you feel empowered to listen to your instincts and your

347
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:49,890
recognition of what's going on or you're not feeling safe and you think it's okay.

348
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,270
I don't have to be worried about making a scene. I don't have to be worried about being nice or polite.

349
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:59,760
I'm going to do something for my safety and I deserve to do that. So this is also really great to see.

350
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:10,590
Any thoughts or questions? So some things we learn, there's an app for almost everything except for an immortal out of your bag.

351
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:20,250
And one thing that we learn from the pilot is that we're actually going to add a third person when we do the full trial.

352
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:26,430
So there's two peer facilitators who lead all the discussions in the activities in-person.

353
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:33,030
That's fine for the Zoom environment. They were able to do everything, but they were really stressed out about handling all the tech pieces.

354
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:37,350
So like they'd be trying to lead a discussion while also like setting up the breakout rooms and,

355
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:41,100
you know, sending out links to the app and the Google and the jam board and all these things.

356
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:47,700
And they were like, We did it, but we were so stressed out. And if you're going to try to do like a big randomized trial over five years,

357
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:51,629
like your facilitators are going to be burnt out by the sixth month or whatever.

358
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:56,580
So you need to add someone who's just there to handle all the breakout rooms and all the tech pieces.

359
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:05,280
So we're going to do that. And then another thing is just the importance of both quantity and quality to an evaluation,

360
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,940
especially because, you know, you cannot have your like ideal RC key with a randomized design and everything.

361
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:16,349
So collecting data from using different methods and from different angles I think was really

362
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:20,700
important and giving us a holistic understanding of how this pilot was working for women.

363
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:27,389
Um, in summary, intervention was very acceptable.

364
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:33,680
Women liked it. We saw that movement in pretest post-test indicators that we wanted to see.

365
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,600
Qualitative data was also positive about women actually using the information that they learned.

366
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:43,110
And we just got a $2 million grant to do the randomized trial.

367
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:49,230
So you I'm very excited about that next step that's going to start next month.

368
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:56,969
So yeah, and we're hoping this is going to be like the first evidence based intervention that can

369
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:02,459
be done online for college campuses and hope that this really opens up implementation.

370
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:10,380
And that's another thing about intervention science is that intervention is only as good as like the degree to which it can be used in the field.

371
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:15,870
Right? Like you could have the most perfect intervention. And if no one will use it, then it's completely useless.

372
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:19,679
Right. And so thinking about like we did this really well, I didn't do it.

373
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,910
But my colleague created this really groundbreaking intervention that reduced sexual assault by 50%.

374
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:28,980
And only seven colleges have access to it right now in the U.S. So how do we really think about

375
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:34,170
the implementation science piece to make it more acceptable and implementable across the field?

376
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:41,190
Yeah. Okay. Any questions about that piece? That's reactions.

377
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:50,849
Yeah, I only question a comment. Yeah. It's really great to see this type of program being implemented because I feel like the focus on women

378
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:56,850
and women's empowerment is really important and it can go into many different areas of your life.

379
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:03,120
Eventually being able to like step back and think about what you want or need out of this situation.

380
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,689
So thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.

381
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:11,069
And it's interesting, like I remember like the in-person intervention,

382
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:18,390
like the New England Journal article came out and I think I just finished my MPH and like I didn't know that Charlene at all at that point.

383
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:24,690
And I read it and I was like, This sounds really cool, but I was also really skeptical because I was like, Is it a self-defense intervention?

384
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:30,320
Like one of those, like old school ones where like a police officer in a padded suit like jumps out you that you're supposed to like taken them.

385
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:36,479
And that's like, you know, like what is this really feminist study now that I like years later,

386
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:44,370
like met her as a post-doc and got to know her and started working on this intervention and really have come to appreciate like how feminist it is.

387
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:48,239
And it's feminist also in a like a data driven way.

388
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:55,650
Like one thing that was convincing to me too is that comparing the intervention and the control group in the in person trial,

389
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:02,640
women who did unfortunately go on to experience sexual assault if they were in the intervention group were less likely to blame themselves.

390
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:10,170
And so it's not like, you know, I was worried like, oh, you know, maybe women who go through this intervention, if they are assaulted,

391
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:16,500
maybe they actually blame themselves more because they're like, Oh, I should have used my self-defense skills or something.

392
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:21,570
But the intervention has such a focus on, you know, sexual assault is not your fault.

393
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:25,500
It's the fault, of course, of an assaultive person who's doing this to you.

394
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:29,490
And here's some tools to affirm your safety, but it is never your fault.

395
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:32,700
And like, really hammering home those feminist empowerment messages,

396
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:37,649
which is so important and what is missing from like the police officer jumping out at you

397
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:43,680
and that dependency on school self defense intervention so that other thoughts are coming.

398
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,080
Oh, yeah. So you mentioned cost effectiveness and scalability.

399
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:54,330
How did you pull that out of your trial to then make your case for electricity?

400
00:38:54,930 --> 00:39:03,090
Yeah. So like not like a health economist or like someone who's an expert on cost effectiveness, but, you know, taking a look at, like, all of the.

401
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,220
All the pieces of the intervention. Like so much of the implementation costs are around.

402
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:14,880
Like each college has to hire someone to be like a program manager for the intervention implementation.

403
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:21,270
They have to go to the university when there were certain incentives based to get trained and how to train people in that intervention,

404
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:27,960
come back to their campus, hire and train a bunch of graduate students to deliver the intervention.

405
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:33,809
Then those graduate students leave after a year or two and they got half hire another batch of facilitators.

406
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:39,770
And so so much of it is like in the training and the training the trainer and like moving it

407
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:45,170
online and having a centralized facilitators will just really simplify a lot of those costs,

408
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:54,630
even if we have to add that third person to it. So we think that this should, by our calculations, reduce costs by about 30 to 50%.

409
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:59,909
So, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know.

410
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:08,430
This is a really hard question. Yeah. Yeah, I feel like it's important, because although all women should be feminists, none of them are unless.

411
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:14,340
So how do you reconcile that with the fact that,

412
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:20,190
like a lot of the women who are in these positions might they might not be attracted to something like this.

413
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,460
Yes. Yeah. And that's a great question.

414
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:30,809
And that is something that my colleagues really feel very strongly about,

415
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:35,250
like making sure all of the marketing materials and the tone and the intervention like it is

416
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:41,670
unapologetically feminist and it is in such a way that it's not like alienating to people.

417
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:48,690
Like we don't do the sex ed unit first because we don't like come out of the gate being about anuses or whatever because there's a lot of

418
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:56,780
really conservative women who may not have had some of this language or experience and not be prepared to talk about that from the get go.

419
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:00,640
Right? And so like there's really a scaffolding in the intervention, um,

420
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:05,610
where it's like really trying to make sure that this is unapologetically feminist and empowering

421
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:10,839
and doesn't like alienate people based on their differing life experiences coming into that,

422
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:15,900
that's challenging. Yes. So I think, you know, great question.

423
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:16,950
Other questions. Yeah.

424
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:25,170
I'm just wondering if this is something that you saw that they you were you were wondering that they might lend themselves more?

425
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:34,739
Yeah, I was wondering the same. Yeah. Because, uh, it must be that you give them a lot of techniques to fight that so that they don't just come back.

426
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:39,330
One, they don't think about it so that they won't feel like that's their fault.

427
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:43,380
So I wonder what the different levels of techniques to deal with them.

428
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:47,159
Yeah. So again, so there's it's a 12 hour intervention actually.

429
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,360
Only 2 hours are self-defense teaching and so yeah, yeah.

430
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:57,989
So I was wondering then because so much of it is about reducing the time for recognizing that someone is trying

431
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:03,899
to coerce you so that like earlier on in the process because like by the time you're being actively assaulted,

432
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,850
most women can kind of recognize what's happening.

433
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:13,829
But if you get recognized earlier on and be emotionally prepared to react early on, you just have more time to use whatever option you want to use.

434
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:19,410
So whether that is a forceful verbal or physical self-defense or maybe earlier on, you can just, you know,

435
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,440
make an excuse that you have to take a phone call or leave the room or what, you know,

436
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,849
or maybe it's things like, you know, I'm not going to take the A car alone with this person.

437
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:32,250
Like we saw that example. So there's so many pieces besides just like active resistance,

438
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,120
that's a lot about recognizing recognizing the red flags and being emotionally

439
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,809
prepared to affirm your own safety and not like flushing your gut feeling about it.

440
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:46,709
So that's an important piece. And then again, we we really emphasize like we never know what you should do.

441
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:50,790
Every person knows in that moment what's accessible to them and what's safest for them.

442
00:42:51,060 --> 00:43:00,719
And if something does happen, it's never your fault. So for the 2 hours of the self-defense pieces that we do do first, it starts with self-defense.

443
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,850
Yeah. Also, like, how do you yell in a scary way?

444
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:09,210
Vaguely. And how do you fighting against that like fight or flight?

445
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:14,729
Right. Flight freeze response? Because a lot of women are also scared, like, am I going to freeze up in an assault situation?

446
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:20,549
So actually, when you have adrenaline, if you have oxygen, you're more likely to be able to fight or flight.

447
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:24,050
And if you don't have oxygen, you're more likely to freeze. So getting like that,

448
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:28,440
really like deep diaphragmatic breathing and self-defense really helps you get

449
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,440
that oxygen and lowers the chances that you're going to freeze to begin with.

450
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:37,889
So that's one piece. And then we go into self-defense, self-defense techniques that are realistic.

451
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:41,390
So it's like we're not trying to make you a black belt into ours.

452
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:50,850
We're trying to teach you some practical self-defense tools that follow certain principles that can make this hurt a long time, but like we call it,

453
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:58,169
using large body parts against small body parts and things like that, that you don't have to be stronger than the person that's attacking you.

454
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:01,649
You just know how to like leverage whatever advantages that you do have.

455
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:08,459
And so we also focus on techniques that are more common for acquaintance sexual assault in college campuses.

456
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,680
So we teach if someone is pinning you down on a bed,

457
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:17,399
how do you use strength from your legs and hips to get that person off of you so that you try to use your arms to push them off,

458
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,660
that you probably not stronger or more than the person who's putting you down,

459
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:25,440
but you have a lot of strength in your hips and legs that you might be able to get them off of you.

460
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,530
So sort of practical techniques that give you enough time to hopefully get out of that situation.

461
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:36,780
It's not trying to tell you like have you become a black belt in jujitsu in 2 hours and overpower that person?

462
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,080
So have you considered using pepper spray as a tool for such events?

463
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:45,749
Yeah, so so that's an interesting question.

464
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:54,120
So that is an option for some women based on like sort of the evidence around pepper spray in the sort of situations that you're in.

465
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,300
If you're in an enclosed space with someone like if you're.

466
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:02,850
Watching a movie on the couch with your boyfriend and things start to go south or whatever.

467
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:09,780
Like using pepper spray in an enclosed space like that, you're actually often more likely to get it in your own eyes as well.

468
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:17,250
And so, like looking at the data, I'm like, which techniques are most associated with reduced likelihood of a rape completion?

469
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:21,660
We tend to like not focus on those types of techniques.

470
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:27,560
Yeah, there are also like some issues with like in an acquaintance sexual assault situation,

471
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:30,450
are you going to have pepper spray in your pocket and ready to go? Right.

472
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:37,020
So like people are really prepared to like I'm walking through a dark alley, so I'm going to like have my pepper spray ready and that's fine.

473
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:40,349
But then like statistically that's not the most likely situation.

474
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:42,360
You're going to find yourself in an assault situation.

475
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:47,700
So are you emotionally prepared to use pepper spray in your own home against your boyfriend, or are you going to have it like ready to go?

476
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:55,460
Right. But that's kind of like the litmus test about like, you know, is this going to be useful in like the majority of sexual assault situations?

477
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:59,320
Does that make sense? Yeah.

478
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:03,510
How do you choose your participants in your randomized controlled trial?

479
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:09,000
So we need to recruit about 2000 women for our sample size calculations.

480
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:13,270
So right now, the plan, we have co-investigators at four different institutions.

481
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:17,759
So here at University, Nebraska, University of Windsor and University of Guelph,

482
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,960
which is right outside Toronto, that's where we have Canadian and a Half US sample.

483
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:29,570
And so we're trying to enroll freshman women, if possible, because they're at the highest risk of sexual assault.

484
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:35,100
And so we have from the from the in-person intervention,

485
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:40,350
like a lot of they did a lot of like AB testing of fliers to see like what are the

486
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:46,140
most effective recruitment fliers that can actually send you the paper if you want,

487
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:50,219
and we can post it to the campus where they actually would like.

488
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:55,600
What are the most effective characteristics of fliers to get the most women interested?

489
00:46:55,630 --> 00:47:00,750
It kind of speaks to that issue that I forget who was asking about, like, how do you reach women who really need this,

490
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:05,070
even if they don't know that they need this and aren't like already, like committed to a feminist politic yet?

491
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:15,630
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So this might be further down the road, but for like the online modules that are usually required for all students.

492
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:23,450
So when you're approaching a college, would it be required for all women who identify, know, identify as women?

493
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:28,250
Yeah, I think I don't think you can do that because yeah,

494
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:35,180
I think it won't work if people are coming in with their like have totally not bought into this and they're like,

495
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:38,700
I'm only doing this because it's a requirement and I hate this. But that's what I was like.

496
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,980
Push Exactly. Yes. I think it would kind of like ruin the group experience as well.

497
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:47,990
So I think there's a lot of ways and focus on like how do we bring women in from kind of more the

498
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:51,710
margins who are like maybe tentatively interested in this and don't know if it's right for them,

499
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:57,500
but for like women who are maybe like actively opposed to it or something, it would be harder to do.

500
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:10,040
Yeah. Yeah. What have been the barriers so far and what barriers are you anticipating in getting this in getting full university enrollment,

501
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:15,080
getting this to a point where it could be an additional curriculum on top of what's already offered?

502
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:20,450
Yes. So we touched on a couple of these things.

503
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:24,589
Universities are really obsessed with their Title nine obligations.

504
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:30,880
So there's like concerns about like, am I going to get sued because there's no men's program or what have you?

505
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:36,049
I think universities are effectively able to make the case that, like, they can take bystander programs and other sorts of programs.

506
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:44,120
And so making sure it's like within a program of like a portfolio of interventions that different people may take,

507
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:49,430
making sure we can make the case in terms of like what's the costs going to be?

508
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:55,760
What's the implementation burden going to be? And yes, this does meet your Title nine obligations as well, I think is important.

509
00:48:56,150 --> 00:49:03,590
And then I think like just getting the word out and I like I really feel like undergraduate women have to come together and demand these programs,

510
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:12,379
right? Like it's like there is a science backed program that will reduce your risk of sexual assault by 50% and your college is not giving it to you.

511
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,060
And how do you feel about that? Right.

512
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:18,830
Like they're giving you a click through intervention that hasn't been shown to do anything for anyone, you know?

513
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:24,770
And so, like, I think that at the end of the day, like as these programs become more implementable,

514
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:28,770
I think there's also going to have to be like from the grassroots up like demand for these programs.

515
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:36,230
Yeah, I just noticed that a lot of things in this program opened up with the I believe it makes good sense.

516
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:42,380
Oh, okay. Yeah. Stuff like the stands and what to do when you're in a situation like if someone

517
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:47,450
comes and they're very nervous to call up the name of like what you're feeling.

518
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:52,399
So that's a kind of like more the part of your brain that's feeling sort of where that's thinking a lot of this.

519
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:57,410
So I'm wondering if you actually ever thought about like implementing these anti-bullying

520
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:03,080
techniques into schools so that everyone and especially women would be more ready to face?

521
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:08,590
Yeah, very similar. That's how usually. So I have not, I'm like not familiar with anti-bullying interventions.

522
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:13,280
That's really cool. And I'm going to like look them all up. Thank you for that idea.

523
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:20,030
I think so. One other way that this program is being adapted is that they're they're doing a trial right now for high schoolers.

524
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:25,459
So they made an adaptation. And Charlene had always wanted this to be rolled out among high schoolers.

525
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:28,100
But, you know, to be with children is very difficult.

526
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:34,459
So she started with college women because that's sort of like an easier population to work with, and now they're adapting it for high schoolers.

527
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:41,180
And so they had to make some changes to the language, all the scenarios that are presented and things like that, but they are rolling it out.

528
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:45,049
I would imagine that the key difference is going to be around the gender focus of this intervention.

529
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:51,070
Right. And so I don't know what the bullying interventions look like, but I imagine they're sort of like gender neutrally brilliant.

530
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,860
They make them more appropriate. Yeah, I think so.

531
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,830
You know, this one has a very gendered focus that can be uncomfortable for some people at first.

532
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:07,160
But does anyone know, like, what percentage of sexual assaults against college women are perpetrated by cisgender men?

533
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,320
They don't have a guess. A good 100%.

534
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:20,570
Yeah, it's like it's 99%. So, like, that's why the intervention because, like, the data is focused on course of men.

535
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:25,490
Yeah. Um, how are you going to know about with the partner?

536
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:32,480
Like when women are driving. Yeah.

537
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:36,300
Or like, we don't have that here. Yeah.

538
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:41,490
So for the president to work on this and so basically if you didn't have a partner coming in,

539
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:45,749
you could request to be placed with a partner because you're only two people at any

540
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:50,160
campus to do the interactions that usually are hard to find a partner to do it with.

541
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:55,679
And women kind of like to go to meet someone, especially when they're freshmen, and they're like, right now might not that many people.

542
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:01,080
It's kind of fun for them to, like, get to know a friend. So this feels very sexist.

543
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:09,270
Um, I. What can be done for men on sustrans?

544
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:15,020
What have you? Because not all like it.

545
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:22,980
I know it's complicated in politics. Well, not every man is going to be 100%.

546
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,490
That's not. That's not like. That's that is a thing.

547
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:33,180
And so I wonder, like, it is definitely good to give people tools in this situation.

548
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:41,730
Yeah. So what can be done so that men, maybe like some men don't feel like that this is a thing they could or should do?

549
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:47,160
Because, like, I've heard, like some guys I've met, like girlfriends, none of them have been like,

550
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:54,540
I've thought about this, but they have like I feel very like ostracized from women because like with,

551
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:59,510
since I wear a mask, like one of my old roommates was like, Yeah, no, it's great being a guy because,

552
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:04,710
you know, patriarchal stuff, but it sucks because you could get on a bus or you can do what?

553
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:10,140
Like walking home in a dark your car and you see somebody else react scared because they know

554
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:15,030
you're a man and they're and it just it feels bad because it's like you don't want to be like,

555
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:18,520
no, I swear I'm not. I'm not following. You are just. Yeah, that's true.

556
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:22,709
Yeah. But it's like they're not. Is there like, is there any work being done?

557
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:29,830
So, like, to help like men feel more involved and like expression feelings, I imagine, is, like, helpful towards like not.

558
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:36,720
Yeah. So, um, I have a lot of thoughts about like how that experience compares with like the systematic oppression of women,

559
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:41,310
but like maybe not equal equally.

560
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:53,340
Yeah, severe. But the issue is like, you know, we would love for there to be a pro for men that was as effective and there's not.

561
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:58,349
Right. And so like we don't have like the science, like injury prevention science right now,

562
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:03,479
that's like an effective reduction of perpetration for men or like these pieces around,

563
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:10,020
like, uh, mobilizing men's feminist sensibilities and being part of the solution.

564
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:15,059
And like all, all this stuff, like, we don't have bystander interventions are good at a lot of things they're good at,

565
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:19,110
like increasing your intention to intervene if you see something, that sort of thing,

566
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:21,660
which I think is like maybe being part of the solution and all that stuff.

567
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:28,020
But they haven't been shown in a randomized trial to actually reduce perpetration victimization in like a meaningful way.

568
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:33,569
So we don't have the science to do those programs yet.

569
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,520
And I like can't wait until we have that.

570
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:41,310
In the meantime, you know, so many women are sexually assaulted each day and this program can really plug the gap.

571
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:44,280
It was never intended to be the only program on a college campus.

572
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,330
And we really need to strengthen like our whole portfolio of prevention programing, I think.

573
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:52,290
But yeah, there's so much more to be done.

574
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,390
And yeah,

575
00:54:54,420 --> 00:55:02,309
also a lot of debate in a feminist field that we can have like a whole discussion about if there's limited funding for gender based violence programs,

576
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:05,910
how much should go toward working with men and how much should go toward working with women?

577
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:08,670
And you know, like when we have limited resources,

578
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:13,770
do we have to have some of those complicated conversations about like where we investing our our time and resources?

579
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:18,270
So there aren't easy answers and basically we need more of that and even more of everything.

580
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,139
Yeah, I was just like thinking the outcomes are variable.

581
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:27,840
Like me, I'm trying to answer like, oh, I feel just much less like wanting to commit a sexual assault.

582
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:31,850
So yeah, I like, but yeah, yeah or yeah.

583
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:37,350
My parents are just like the perfect, perfect size. 2050.

584
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:46,200
First of all, the rest of the semester. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

585
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:55,540
I just said that I really because in conference there's actually some pretty cool violence prevention programs in, in like low income settings.

586
00:55:55,540 --> 00:56:00,150
So like in sub-Saharan Africa, I've been really effective at reducing men's perpetration of IPV.

587
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:05,200
I just saw a group presenting one that like six years out from this intervention, they fail lasting reduction IPV,

588
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:09,990
which is like so incredible and amazing and I guess this is that really I feel like

589
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:13,350
as a field we're getting to that place where we have effective interventions for men.

590
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:21,360
But there have been a couple of promising pilots for men in the college like U.S. college setting, but nothing like with this level of evidence.

591
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,870
Ah, this level of reduction. So yeah, great question.

592
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:33,300
Yeah. Um, I understand why this is set up in a heterosexual like.

593
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:41,130
Yeah, and you're right, I think that, but when you think about like the fact that this is open to all women on a college.

594
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:44,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. In heterosexual version.

595
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:54,990
Is that being marketed to is is the program being marketed to say that we are going to focus on heterosexual relationships and I'm sorry,

596
00:56:54,990 --> 00:57:02,480
because I didn't have a chance. Yeah, yeah. Think but. Also then if it's not or even if it is.

597
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:05,610
But people want to participate in anything like an allied.

598
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:11,879
Allied, right. Or just to know whatever. How are you addressing that?

599
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:16,860
Like this is the norm and this is why we're doing this.

600
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:20,490
We also want you to feel like you can implement these situations.

601
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:25,439
Yeah. And then also. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

602
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:30,090
He has rations, but with the the sex ed portion of it too.

603
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:33,700
A lot of sex ed. It's not. Yeah, it was looser.

604
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:40,830
Yeah. And so is that also then being trying to be inclusive while still, right.

605
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:45,209
Yeah, I think that. Yeah, absolutely. So, yeah, this is very important.

606
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:51,300
And, uh, Charlene is herself a lesbian, so, like, that's a big focus of, like, how do we make sure this is queer, inclusive?

607
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:55,260
We had someone who was like, went through it to look at it with,

608
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:58,860
like an asexual lens to make sure that this is still really relevant to people who maybe

609
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:01,860
aren't interested in romantic or sexual relationships with people that didn't gender.

610
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:10,110
And so we explain in the program that, like even for lesbian and bisexual men and people of other sexual orientations like you as a woman,

611
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:13,320
you're still statistically most likely to be sexually assaulted by a cisgender man.

612
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:19,640
And so that's why the language and the focus is this way. For the sex ed pieces, we have things like, you know,

613
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:25,320
we talk a little bit about condoms and dental dams and actually the FDA just approved like latex underwear.

614
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:28,440
That is like much sexier dental than that.

615
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:35,130
I'm like, you haven't heard about this. Oh, so anyway, so we actually for the online version, we,

616
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:41,009
we mail people care packages in advance that have like a lot of cool swag and stuff and snacks too,

617
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:45,329
that everybody learns better when they're not hungry. I'm like, in person we just provide food.

618
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:46,739
But yeah.

619
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:54,750
So anyway, we're going to like, um, I think in the, in the trial we're going to like mail people these new like FDA approved underwear to like anyway.

620
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:59,430
So we talked about like this is a kind of negotiation activity where we practice kind of negotiation,

621
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:03,389
but you can also do it for dental dams or you can also do it for blah, blah, blah.

622
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:08,970
And yeah, so we try to make it really relevant because that personal relevance piece, as I said, is really important for effective interventions.

623
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:14,630
Yeah. Their question is this question of.

624
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:21,410
Okay, well. Okay. Oh, my God, we only have 5 minutes.

625
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:23,460
I didn't know if the questions or not,

626
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:30,350
like a whole nother part of this presentation about like how are we adapting this for transparency where you think about what to share in 5 minutes,

627
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:35,110
I have to go teach another class around here, but otherwise I would just, like, sit here and that.

628
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,989
Okay. Um. Okay.

629
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:49,040
So I'll just say very briefly, right, we have this intervention that and we want to adapt it for trans students because we know that

630
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:54,649
trans students are at equal or greater risk of sexual assault compared to cisgender women,

631
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:57,950
and we don't have any interventions for them.

632
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:03,620
When you're adapting to a new population, I think some people have instinct to be like, okay,

633
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:09,820
let's go through the intervention manual and change the pronouns to be gender neutral and then like roll it out and see how it happens.

634
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:20,059
And that is not enough. We need to make sure that we are thinking out each of these stages and of the intervention and make sure

635
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:25,670
they're based on data that is specific to the trans experiences of sexual assault on college campuses.

636
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:30,140
So, you know, are the red flags that are teaching people the same?

637
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:32,419
Are the barriers to resisting the same? Right.

638
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:39,229
Those barriers to like psychosocial barriers to recognizing and resisting coercion are really based on like, I want to be nice.

639
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:42,290
I don't want to make a scene that's all really about female gender socialization.

640
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:45,320
And depending on the trans person, they may not have been brought up with that.

641
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:50,410
And so maybe some of those gender barriers are different for trans populations.

642
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:55,969
We need to explore those. And then there was a lot of concern when we did some formative focus groups about like is forceful,

643
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:58,820
verbal and physical self-defense still going to work for me?

644
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:06,860
Because trans students were like, if I use self-defense, people will assume I'm the aggressor because of stereotypes about like trans predators.

645
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:14,839
And see. Yeah, and there's a lot of concerns that like the context of the assault are different.

646
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:18,709
So is that a lot of hate crimes where people are intentionally trying to inflict injury

647
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:23,180
on trans students versus acquaintance sexual assault at parties and things like that?

648
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:30,320
And so like the types of resistance that you may be able to do without increasing your risk of injury might look really different.

649
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:36,650
So we decided we really need to do both focus groups and services and get this mixed methods data

650
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:40,610
to understand a lot more about what does sexual assault actually look like for transgenders.

651
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:47,540
We knew so little about, you know, what was the gender of the perpetrators, like where these assaults happening on campus or off campus?

652
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:50,749
Like what was the typical relationship with the perpetrator?

653
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:53,620
Is this happening with alcohol involvement or not?

654
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:58,160
Like what is like if we don't know what sexual assault looks like, we can't target the intervention.

655
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:00,740
And we also don't know about this piece.

656
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:07,820
Like, is forceful resistance still the tool that we want to be expanding the toolbox to include less homework for trans students?

657
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:14,860
So these are some of our recruitment fliers really well sought to share with you.

658
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:23,299
And we were able to get about 400 trans and non-binary undergrads who were campus sexual assault survivors to tell us about

659
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:29,690
their assaults in the survey so that we had for the first time really specific data on what these assaults looked like.

660
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:35,839
And I just want to like also grumble again about colleges because like so many campus climate

661
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,400
surveys have been done where like each of each college is willing to share their data,

662
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:45,170
you can like combine all these data sets and have a large sample size of trans students to learn something.

663
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:49,729
But when I would contact colleges and be like, Can you share your campus climate data about trans students?

664
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:53,920
They like their lawyers were like, absolutely not. And so, you know,

665
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:57,799
then we had to put this burden on the community to fill out our survey separately

666
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,010
and give us all this information about their sexual assault experiences.

667
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:04,459
So that is my continuing gripe about lawyers on college campuses.

668
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:08,810
So I don't have time to talk about any of this.

669
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:18,080
Yeah. So some key differences. We found that being made to penetrate someone else, especially for trans women,

670
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:22,610
was a unique type of sexual assault that like cisgender women usually aren't subjected to.

671
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:25,700
And so we need to think about in the adaptive intervention,

672
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:31,460
like how do we talk about these types of assaults and offer some resistance strategies relevant to those types of assaults?

673
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:37,370
We saw that 70% of assaults were perpetrated by cisgender men.

674
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:40,910
So it's still the majority of perpetrators.

675
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:47,120
Cisgender men are still the majority of perpetrators, but it's not 99% like it is versus gender women.

676
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:52,069
And so, you know, we need to think about our framing right now. We're thinking that, you know, maybe think something like coercive,

677
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:57,320
meaning coercive people of other genders, which still sounds like primarily a risk of coming from men.

678
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:00,170
But also you need to be aware of risk from other people.

679
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:08,450
Given the data that we now have about what sexual assault actually looks like, this is important.

680
01:04:09,290 --> 01:04:14,359
Less than a third of assaults have a bystander present. So when you think about bystander interventions,

681
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:19,849
which is sort of like if colleges have some kind of prevention programing that isn't a click through intervention,

682
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:23,389
it's usually a bystander intervention program. In my opinion.

683
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:26,270
This is because they're sort of politically neutral and not explicitly feminist,

684
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:30,710
and they're like gender neutral, and so they're like more politically palatable for a lot of campuses.

685
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:36,319
But you can see that most 70% of assaults against trans people do not have a bystander presence.

686
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:40,260
So we need to be thinking about other types of interventions like resistance interventions.

687
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:46,440
I might be able to fill the gap for those types of efforts. Yeah.

688
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:54,510
Okay. I don't have time to pack. I'm sorry. But I would love to come back another time if you have time to listen to us and chat with you.

689
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:00,120
But basically what we found, there's a lot of specificities to trans sexual assault experiences.

690
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:03,270
We have our work cut out for us in how we adapt to intervention.

691
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:08,489
We'd love to chat with you guys about that another time, but what we've found is that with some adaptation,

692
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:14,430
we think that sexual assault resistance interventions are going to be helpful in addressing the burden of sexual assault for trans.

693
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:21,670
So thank you. Thank you so much.

694
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:26,450
I won't do it in Your Honor, but I think we should make sure the slides will be protected.

695
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:28,720
Like the PDA. Yeah, absolutely. Okay.

696
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:35,139
And then, yeah, if if you are available or open, we can figure out a way to zoom in to a future to come back to you.

697
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:43,450
Let's talk about this. Great. Very interesting. All right. So you and I are going to have a good class.

698
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:47,980
All right, folks, why don't we take a little break?

699
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:54,040
Um, we want to come back at quarter to. Right.

700
01:05:55,880 --> 01:06:19,940
Oh, much. I know the surgeon.

701
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:30,100
Is everything okay?

702
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:40,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I do a lot of very good things like crazy.

703
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:44,020
Do you know what I mean?

704
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:47,850
When I see that she did it? I don't know.

705
01:06:49,160 --> 01:07:11,120
Oh, my gosh. I just think I was hoping that she could take more of the application of intervention when I was a child and I was like,

706
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:21,740
oh, oh, oh, I did have an injury.

707
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:26,900
But I was like, I'm sure it's like.

708
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:34,330
It was all very well.

709
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:42,820
I was crazy. I was really surprised, was like, seems very much what she had done to me.

710
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:49,620
But without saying anything, how do you think it somehow seems smaller now?

711
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:58,620
Everybody, the future. I don't know who would be willing to send me this little.

712
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:09,140
My recent revelation that she is the one who was the director of the drama.

713
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:15,260
Angel isn't like the movie or the somebody expecting her thing.

714
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:21,430
And you go, Oh, you know what it's like.

715
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:28,380
But I don't come to. Doesn't.

716
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:43,680
I think, listening to the podcast. But also like, oh, they actually look very good as it is.

717
01:08:44,110 --> 01:08:48,040
But I'm also wonder why. I don't know.

718
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:59,070
I mean, is it an idea or. He's been doing it for some reason.

719
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:05,090
Is there any proof or.

720
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:24,190
I hope I'm not such a good.

721
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:12,050
Sorry this was done before. But is there such a thing?

722
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:28,450
There's no way. I've been to like 639 of us like I've had just like my whole life is like watching what?

723
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:44,330
I just watch states. It's like a two hour days after I really got into the Washington Post Articles about America.

724
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:50,620
I love that for some of them and for somebody like me.

725
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:59,250
It's just that I watch it. I just watch, like, the majority of their conversations.

726
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:07,010
And you think that's.

727
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:18,630
I'm surprised he gave it out as we knew news.

728
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:25,160
So this is the start of the year, but you got something in July.

729
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:33,360
I also think like Alexander. And what if a mother's grandmother?

730
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:39,310
Yeah, I think. I just don't like him anymore because he doesn't really have a chance.

731
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:44,040
So this will add something to something that would make us.

732
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:51,060
I want to some direction.

733
01:11:52,210 --> 01:11:57,970
You know, I definitely have something on my team that I don't really follow that closely.

734
01:11:57,970 --> 01:12:06,080
But I think that I feel I mean, I really look back as well as I know that it happened.

735
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:20,740
Well, I think what you're saying so far so great about.

736
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:42,050
I don't know what you're just. Oh, crap.

737
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:48,780
I'm usually doing Playboy.

738
01:12:50,300 --> 01:13:06,430
I really like that. Look, you know, if you look at these women in Brazil, you know, really right in front of you for watching those files.

739
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:12,140
Oh, I really don't like that. It's interesting.

740
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:16,360
Yeah. Do.

741
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:30,630
She's going back to the question that I can't make up because she's like a little [INAUDIBLE] in good life.

742
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:41,090
So we know that like 11 years, everyone working right under their genius.

743
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:52,500
Is that like assigning you to discuss the matter?

744
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:56,190
Is just one of those really?

745
01:13:56,950 --> 01:14:01,750
That is the problem. Yeah.

746
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:05,380
Okay. So. So that was like. Yeah.

747
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:12,210
Mm hmm. Oh. Okay.

748
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:19,700
I think I like this pilot. Okay. But I went to the firm on a different level.

749
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:27,000
She was like, I'm going to have to do this. Well, yeah, we don't know anything, but it's encouraged.

750
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:31,720
Yeah. Do you want to take another? Yeah. All right. Yeah. Honestly, the only reason why I talk about, like,

751
01:14:31,730 --> 01:14:37,370
the next week is so that it's fresh enough in my mind that if you were to tell me all of this in November, it would be harder for me.

752
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:41,120
But there's no reason why you could. So if you want to through and stuff and connect with this fabulous.

753
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:45,140
Or do you want both of those different approaches? That was brilliant.

754
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:50,390
Okay. Sounds good. But yeah, I graduated the firm, so it was very interesting.

755
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:59,740
So if I had.

756
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:17,090
If I had an interest here, I like. I decided that, you know.

757
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:36,650
I was hoping that we could get to that part where she talked about the adaptation.

758
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:45,680
Yeah. I was hoping to get to that part. Yeah, that's I guess that's great questions of the wonderful director.

759
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:53,660
But I will say I'll I'll ask her if there's a way that she can come back in for 20 minutes or so to talk through the intervention.

760
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:58,660
Or is some interested in knowing how she could adapt to another company?

761
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:04,849
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And maybe some people can share the slides, too.

762
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:09,780
I mean, it sounds like you started she kind of gave you the framework in terms of starting with adapted musicals.

763
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:13,100
Yeah, they did. But when you and any.

764
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:19,100
Yeah, that's I mean, it's designed to be kind of an implementation framework that you can then apply to a lot of different scenarios.

765
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:25,580
Oh, that's good. Yeah, I was wondering about that. You know, the rest of the next semester.

766
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:29,749
With a year assessment, yes, I'm certain. Oh, I don't know.

767
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:36,320
Actually, Jackie might know that, but I think you just I was reading Rosanna after.

768
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:49,970
Okay so I usually it is offering I think everybody agrees with three application, you know, adapting to write in as short as whatever.

769
01:16:49,970 --> 01:16:52,340
A couple of weeks ago she was speaking out a bit about some of the different.

770
01:16:53,640 --> 01:17:01,390
And so I think I think those can be used as well as the one take away is when you have the patient framework adaptation,

771
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:15,080
then I think, you know, I think I wonder if you can get where I can I can tell you what you're going to learn.

772
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:21,350
I'm like, I just could do is by back.

773
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:35,230
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Well, thank you. But I'm interested to know how you can adapt what you're primarily about writing to

774
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:44,230
get that from adapted and what should come to mind when I write it's a it's adapt.

775
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:50,480
I yeah, I definitely like and I don't know what it all means and I think I'm good enough.

776
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:53,569
It's another implementation framework, right?

777
01:17:53,570 --> 01:18:02,510
You know, like it's a framework where you want to adapt like an intervention into another setting, you framework to plug in healthy, you know.

778
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:10,650
Oh, so you are, you know, she was in the Depression, was very successful in Brisbane, but she wasn't so much online.

779
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:15,710
That's a different setting. So we have to.

780
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:35,960
Yeah. Yeah. What has. These are things.

781
01:18:36,460 --> 01:19:03,210
Structures are situated. I'm think she had a lot of housing issues.

782
01:19:06,930 --> 01:19:10,880
You've got to go. And if you work at home.

783
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:18,670
Oh, John, I don't know. That's crazy.

784
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:25,790
All right? I don't know. No, I can't.

785
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:36,230
You spend money? Yeah.

786
01:19:40,270 --> 01:19:44,090
Yeah. I can't go missing that. There's nothing to.

787
01:19:49,720 --> 01:20:02,440
That's all. In four years I've been friends.

788
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,800
You? I'd be powerful.

789
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:12,490
I want to stop. All right, folks.

790
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:25,210
We're coming back together. So, reactions from Chris Myers presentation.

791
01:20:26,350 --> 01:20:36,399
Yeah, I had something like that. That's so cool. Yeah, I think there was something where I feel like you could go your whole adult life without,

792
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:41,200
like, building those skills of just, like, knowing what you want.

793
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:57,660
It's pretty much it. I'm kind of jealous, even director of the program, a researcher, AI researcher regards to just like how it's implemented.

794
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:07,440
Yeah, well, I guess I've. So what about, I guess not understanding what you, what you, what you admire about the I mean,

795
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:14,880
just like the positive framing around like, you know, like ownership of herself in her own right.

796
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,810
Like, oh, assault is not your fault.

797
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:24,240
Right. I feel like most individuals don't lack that part, but more so just like.

798
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:33,780
Taking ownership over. I mean, not like you can always avoid assault that way, but.

799
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:38,310
Yeah. Just making people maybe feel a little bit more like.

800
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:50,810
I don't know. I don't know. I don't. I really know how it.

801
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:54,640
If you think about the, um,

802
01:21:55,270 --> 01:22:02,249
the life of a program in that kind of a stage of its development mean you're almost talking about the idea, the motivation or the,

803
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:12,540
the framing, the program, development of the program, which then kind of leads into how it's actually devised, implemented, tested, adapted.

804
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:21,270
Right. So I mean, and we can think about how we're engaging or we're evaluating or assessing the appropriateness of a program at any certain point.

805
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:24,900
So she talked about the philosophy with which the intervention was developed.

806
01:22:25,230 --> 01:22:28,290
Thinking about the messaging that's contained within and is that appropriate?

807
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:32,880
So you can think about, as you're looking to say, is this program going to be right for my population, for me?

808
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:39,479
Where do you begin to start asking those questions? And I like that they were reflective when they did start to make some of these applications.

809
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:40,410
And if folks are interested,

810
01:22:40,410 --> 01:22:46,950
I will absolutely ask her if she would be willing to to pop back in or somehow give us a little bit more information about the adaptation process,

811
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:52,500
because I think in many ways that's what our field could end up being. There are certainly some spaces where not a lot of work has been done,

812
01:22:52,830 --> 01:22:55,830
but then there are also a lot of places where there are some good programs out

813
01:22:55,830 --> 01:23:00,750
there that have demonstrated effects and now it's more of how do we scale them,

814
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:02,430
how do we implement them within populations?

815
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:10,500
And we're not seeing programs designed to be like every barrier that sort of like presents itself in these type of interventions.

816
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:17,520
She addressed like thoroughly and like especially with the way that the programs adapted to being online as well.

817
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:23,969
And even though it's online, it still has an in-person component and there is a facilitator, even though it's online module.

818
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:27,060
So people are engaged in getting the most out of it.

819
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:32,129
So yeah, I mean he was talking about her asking me about like a needs assessment cause I feel like there's

820
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:37,080
a public health idea to really go in and try to understand first what are some of those very,

821
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:39,270
very different opportunities and implementation science to,

822
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:43,590
if you want to think about that way before just saying, here is our one size fits all program.

823
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:47,130
We would go it right, right. Just click through as fast as you can.

824
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:50,830
Type of idea. So trying to have some customizability.

825
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:56,760
I just also thought it was exciting like how many areas they were considering adapting it to.

826
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:09,809
I mean, non college individuals are so underrepresented in the intervention like schemes or gender based violence

827
01:24:09,810 --> 01:24:14,760
in particular because there's been like so much focus in recent years on everything on college campuses.

828
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:18,309
Early on, like for your university campuses,

829
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:26,350
I was excited to see how they were thinking about how this intervention could be applied there and how an online component could help in that regard,

830
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:33,580
but also what to do when people don't have a partner or yeah, something like that.

831
01:24:33,830 --> 01:24:43,060
It's just so accessible there. And then also I think extending it into K-12 and then starting to think about all,

832
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:55,070
all the ways that we can either address this issue earlier or more expansively than is currently happening right now was exciting to me about.

833
01:24:55,090 --> 01:25:00,340
In addition to that I think expanding this particular intervention for.

834
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:05,540
To be more gender and sexuality specific.

835
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:10,160
I think just there's not I at least in my experience,

836
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:17,660
I haven't seen a lot of focus on like how you can adopt a college focused intervention to non-college populations.

837
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:21,860
But that's such an underrepresented population in this area.

838
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:28,399
Yeah, well, I appreciate the questions from the class and the the pushing back a little bit on the inclusivity.

839
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:35,240
I feel like the. Their design and I keep pointing to this but I think their design is that she was able to respond to those critiques.

840
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:39,049
I think that's really important. And now you're also bringing in a broader kind of developmental spectrum.

841
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:44,810
How would this messaging change if we're talking to 14 to 18 year olds versus 18 to 20, however many girls?

842
01:25:45,170 --> 01:25:52,700
And so I'm thinking through a lot of different facets of our populations that might, in one way or another,

843
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:58,940
affect how the intervention is delivered, how it's received, whether it has sustainability, other effects.

844
01:26:03,390 --> 01:26:07,970
I know. What I know is your name is not. It's not Rachel.

845
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:14,080
Omar helped me. Carolyn? Yeah. So, yeah.

846
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:23,510
Just that I thought it was. It's very simple. Where what she's doing in that, you can tell she has, you know, just an expertize in this.

847
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:28,310
And I think some of the best interventions come out of that because, you know,

848
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:33,560
some of the studies and the research you read, they have to a lot of limitations.

849
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:37,680
And it's not always the sometimes stuff that you could use about it.

850
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:41,690
Like didn't you think about think this through before you conducted the study?

851
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:50,950
And I feel like by gathering your questions so early, you can kind of tell me that she really should prepared for this.

852
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:58,349
And she's probably for the first time. And I think they're going to be successful because even though they have no one,

853
01:26:58,350 --> 01:27:07,429
you know, I do think a point that I wonder is that I'll build off of because of my role.

854
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:15,740
And I think a lot of times our role as scientists is kind of as an evaluator or assessment independent of the program itself,

855
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:20,200
kind of trusting in the expertize of those who are working to deliver the program,

856
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:28,730
understanding how their own knowledge and experiences are, informing the program so that we don't kind of disregard that it confuses.

857
01:27:28,730 --> 01:27:32,420
We try to bring in what often is our expertize, the science side of things, and again,

858
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:37,280
speaking mostly as an evaluator, which is the way I engage with these programs. If you are part of the program development team.

859
01:27:37,610 --> 01:27:40,850
Yes, absolutely. Having this expertize makes sense, but it's knowledge.

860
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:44,360
One of the things that we kind of have to struggle with as we engage with many

861
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:48,709
different engineers is I might know not know a lot about gender based violence.

862
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:52,310
I might not know a whole lot about gun violence or head trauma or whatever it might be,

863
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:58,670
trying to learn at least enough of that to be conversant, but then also rely on those people who do have the expertize to do it.

864
01:27:58,670 --> 01:28:02,989
And with the experience and in many different ways to help to shape the program will help you identify

865
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:07,820
why it could or could not work or what to do when you run into situations where it's not much.

866
01:28:08,150 --> 01:28:11,900
Yeah. At that point was.

867
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:20,310
Yeah. Right. I mean, it's just it's really very similar to that.

868
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:28,670
Yeah. Yeah. I like the though. And how much is similar is something that you didn't realize before, thankfully.

869
01:28:29,190 --> 01:28:32,240
Do they come? Maybe they kind of like benefit from each other.

870
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:40,739
And also, I wonder how much focusing on implementing this anti-bullying in schools would help prevent us having to.

871
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:43,860
Of course, we still have to deal with this stuff. You know,

872
01:28:44,130 --> 01:28:54,700
I just hope that the vehemence that the unions were putting together to fight for like the American rising flags and knowing what they're doing.

873
01:28:54,700 --> 01:29:00,170
So. And I wrote a note about that point.

874
01:29:00,190 --> 01:29:04,200
I think one of the things that you probably think I agree with you that there are a lot

875
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:09,120
of there is a fair amount over what you might see within certain bullying programs.

876
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:17,250
Also pretty well known also in many cases evidence based and trying to be effective in preventing both in-person and online bullying.

877
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:23,190
I know a fair amount about that space. You know very much less about gender based violence.

878
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:26,910
So, I mean, it is it again, it is difficult to be an expert in everything,

879
01:29:26,910 --> 01:29:33,809
but you can also start to think about what are some of the kind of cross-cutting either strategies or factors,

880
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:39,780
risk factors, protective factors that might be implemented more across multiple areas of injury.

881
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:44,430
Now, where you have to be careful is that kind of said the same thing to Daniel Webster last week,

882
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:50,459
talking about gun violence interventions and how we can draw in different areas of injury to learn from what

883
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:56,850
we've done here in head trauma or motor vehicle crashes to gun violence prevention interventions and policies,

884
01:29:56,850 --> 01:30:04,050
he said, Well, yes and no because there are some things that are about gun violence that are just unique to injury.

885
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:11,070
And chances are there are some things about many of our injury areas that are somewhat unique to our injury areas of focus.

886
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:15,780
So whereas something could be affected in the context of school based boy,

887
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:23,260
whether it translates directly to, for example, a gender based violence situation or across populations.

888
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:30,569
That's an open question. And that's where some of our work and we believe that there is a need or have to be filled where we can do it better.

889
01:30:30,570 --> 01:30:33,810
If we can scale it, we can make it more cost effective, bring it.

890
01:30:34,290 --> 01:30:37,019
Think about how we can leverage different things that we've learned from other

891
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:42,800
spaces and how it could be implemented in a new way or be that kind of little,

892
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:47,070
you know, whatever you call it, kind of buzz in the back of your head thinking,

893
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:55,080
Well, wait a minute, but when I'm talking about relationships that don't fit kind of cis gender stereotypes or norms,

894
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:59,940
how could some of these things that work in other spaces fail, fail or be insufficient?

895
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:05,069
And then what do I need to adapt? That's all good stuff. And that's why the scope is 11i find.

896
01:31:05,070 --> 01:31:09,840
I mean, it's really it's difficult to see and to learn, but I do think it's super, super important.

897
01:31:10,170 --> 01:31:14,459
And I like that you guys are good. You ask questions, you ask tough questions.

898
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:17,820
And I like when the speaker is going to have to. Yeah, that's a good point.

899
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:24,630
And know here's my explanation and it's great to be critical about how people are defending what they want to do and why it might change.

900
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:28,050
I want to say one more point before I forget, because I'm tired of looking at the slide.

901
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:32,910
There are a few different adaptive adaptation frameworks that are out there.

902
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:38,020
I'll be very curious if we can bring Sarah back in to talk a little bit about how the trends there.

903
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:43,500
They're adapting their their intervention in our Finds Prevention Center Youth

904
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:47,760
Empowerment Solutions is an after school based program that's now been adapted.

905
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:53,639
It began looking specifically at violence, but it's been adapted for different populations.

906
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:57,960
It's been adapted for sexual violence versus community violence versus gun violence.

907
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:03,360
So there are different ways that different teams take their programs.

908
01:32:03,570 --> 01:32:05,370
And as they're establishing an evidence base,

909
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:13,110
they use some of these adaptation or implementation frameworks to guide what they need to do to focus on new populations or new spaces.

910
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:16,739
So I was going to try to download and show you you have to register and stuff

911
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:20,729
like that what kind of an adaptation framework looks like and how you can say,

912
01:32:20,730 --> 01:32:25,200
All right, we have this evidence based curriculum. We don't want to vary too far away from it, right?

913
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:26,430
We need to keep the course.

914
01:32:26,940 --> 01:32:34,710
But what are some of the things that we need to kind of massage and change in order to work with the new population to focus on a new outcome?

915
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:39,270
You know, how do we do this? So and then adapt.

916
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:44,400
It was the other one that that Sarah said that I think is good to know about and shown us.

917
01:32:44,610 --> 01:32:48,030
Smith mentioned a couple of different implementation frameworks that you can use as well.

918
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:52,440
Any other thoughts about Sarah Sarah's presentation?

919
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:01,510
Yeah, I think.

920
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:11,680
Yeah. When considering how to expand the programs, especially your comments, I think it's it's interesting thinking about this.

921
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:16,660
Obviously not everything can be connected on one timeline,

922
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:29,650
but thinking about evidence based interventions like this being expanded kind of as a pipeline to injury prevention.

923
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:34,330
So the things that we're teaching in elementary school, middle school, high school,

924
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:43,090
and then how that connects to these freshman year college modules or workshops or

925
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:51,340
her intervention and then how that can be expanded to non college populations.

926
01:33:51,940 --> 01:34:01,120
It's just interesting thinking about how this could be expanded to sort of affect the whole cycle of violence.

927
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:09,230
Yeah. I can't read how these changes need to be revisited.

928
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:16,819
Congressional guideline for sustainability.

929
01:34:16,820 --> 01:34:21,020
That would be a great question for zero and whether or not they kind of tested it after the Chinese have.

930
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:24,250
And do they have any sort of reinforcement or booster trainings?

931
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:33,560
At what point is that going to be most effective? That's also kind of within the implementation science effective effectiveness type of design.

932
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:38,390
You know, you might try to have a design like I'm I didn't see what their practice is going to be,

933
01:34:38,390 --> 01:34:43,010
but if it's like a pre post measurement, do three months post test,

934
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:44,129
you do a year post test,

935
01:34:44,130 --> 01:34:58,550
can you actually measure up that one in return has been real quick on an article by the the general development and how even like the delivery.

936
01:34:58,550 --> 01:35:08,390
So I saw from our data working with online instruction, remote instruction, college kids, you folks are good students, undergrads, fine.

937
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:12,440
You can do this stuff online. High school kids, by and large, they get by with it.

938
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:17,970
They're getting younger, they're getting younger, they're getting younger in the online instruction piece completely about right.

939
01:35:17,990 --> 01:35:21,559
Completely. But it's not facilitating really, really well.

940
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:24,620
And so then thinking about how an intervention is going to be received,

941
01:35:24,950 --> 01:35:29,090
that's a part of what it sounds like they're able to do with their able to do that.

942
01:35:29,210 --> 01:35:34,060
Sarah Shoot. I'm trying to understand how acceptability seems like an interesting one.

943
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:40,460
It seems pretty straightforward. Yeah, I thought this was a good experience, but understand a little bit more the nuance of that piece too.

944
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:46,549
Like, I was able to retain the knowledge. I was able to go through all the different modules or was I clicked everything that I needed to.

945
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:54,060
I did my 3 hours and I was done here. So like I kind of like I understand what I'm about,

946
01:35:54,290 --> 01:36:03,840
how like it's kind of like relevant to like what children are taught was like anti-bullying campaigns and like, how do I think like with,

947
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:16,460
like the rest of the sexual assault is supposed to be more accurate is like I appreciate how in this intervention what you talked about is like

948
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:25,130
there is a part where we talk about what the language is on it because like when kids are taught the language and they're not like just like,

949
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:30,680
oh, I don't, don't like if people are like, just like hinting at it and not being direct,

950
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:35,950
it could be harder for a kid to understand what you're saying because it is an uncomfortable topic and

951
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:42,890
it's just as uncomfortable topic to talk to adults about things that could and are likely to happen.

952
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:51,200
And so I think it's interesting that like for looking at it like very different ages, but it's all very relevant to one another.

953
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:56,420
And so I appreciate that they're working on it, but I also always wonder, like, high school is great.

954
01:36:57,530 --> 01:37:04,940
My personal experiences are like in middle school, so I would be like impressed if they're good and yeah, like if that can ever be like,

955
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:12,120
like a discussion like around like actual, like sexual assault can happen at any point or message massive assault can happen at any point.

956
01:37:12,890 --> 01:37:18,170
It schools are something that I've at least within the state of Michigan for a long time.

957
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:20,600
And there's a lot of things that are around them,

958
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:27,350
like reaching out to broader populations for people who aren't in college or for kids who can not attend school or homeschool.

959
01:37:28,370 --> 01:37:32,760
I'd be interested to really see like how those very different dynamics all play.

960
01:37:33,230 --> 01:37:38,030
Like, I think grassroots are absolutely necessary to it, but it's also like what?

961
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:44,030
How many different things have we need for other things to just like be improved.

962
01:37:46,780 --> 01:37:52,450
So just as a quick kind of test here, if I were to say I'm going to take this intervention,

963
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:56,020
I'm going to go implement it into the Ann Arbor Middle Schools.

964
01:37:56,410 --> 01:38:03,630
What are some of the barriers that you can anticipate of taking a program like this and implementing as is in the middle school population?

965
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:09,490
First of all, the languages that are appropriate, you know what you don't know about, you know, the language of the body.

966
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:17,170
Mm hmm. So that would be, you know, they know, I guess there they need to be an adaptation of the language.

967
01:38:17,650 --> 01:38:23,860
So the very first thing we're thinking about maybe is the language and whether or not what we can talk to about college students or the way

968
01:38:23,860 --> 01:38:30,190
that we might talk about it could be different from those schools would have experiences like they don't drink and they don't go to parties.

969
01:38:30,910 --> 01:38:35,210
Right. So that's interesting. That's an area she even mentioned it here, undergrad versus graduate student.

970
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:43,030
If they felt there was enough of a distinction between those two populations going and the school was not in favor of sex education

971
01:38:43,030 --> 01:38:54,400
programs in the state of Michigan has to be approved for loans and those things in sex education and would not probably pass.

972
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:02,570
They shook hands. How many people in his room went to a school board meeting in a lifetime?

973
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:08,450
Yeah. So, yeah, there it is. These decisions have to be made somewhere.

974
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:11,090
I mean, is this going to be implemented formally in a program of curriculum,

975
01:39:11,090 --> 01:39:14,540
which is not going to happen, but doesn't mean that school can potentially implement it.

976
01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:17,719
But thinking through the school program. Yeah, exactly.

977
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:24,140
How are we going to move at how are we going to introduce this program and see it was difficult to do in a mandatory aspect here on campus.

978
01:39:24,830 --> 01:39:28,250
What would that look like in our school? Okay. Well, okay.

979
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:31,970
Parents with parents with children. Yes, their parents are.

980
01:39:32,150 --> 01:39:35,960
You're talking to my kids about what now? Okay. So parents are an obstacle.

981
01:39:35,990 --> 01:39:41,430
What else? Yeah. You also in middle school have to address that?

982
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:49,129
Well, I mean, I guess kind of still applies in college, too, but I think it has to be factored in.

983
01:39:49,130 --> 01:39:58,610
And so, like you're referring to a lot of programs that I would encourage parents or adults, but the parent has to develop.

984
01:39:58,610 --> 01:40:04,340
It's the perpetrator. And that's a little bit different on a college campus where you're not.

985
01:40:06,030 --> 01:40:12,150
I love these. And so, like, the perpetrators are more peer to peer perpetrator.

986
01:40:13,870 --> 01:40:21,969
All right. So Sarah was very upfront about that and using some of the data that they understood, 99% of the aggressors were sustained males.

987
01:40:21,970 --> 01:40:26,650
And how that kind of drove some of the conversation and the framing of the messaging and even the audience.

988
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:30,790
How might that change if we're talking about, again, younger population? Do we have mandatory reporting?

989
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:32,379
Yeah,

990
01:40:32,380 --> 01:40:40,240
I think that you might have some resistance from like teacher in the fall is that you felt like some of the church immaturity give their own way.

991
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:46,360
Mm hmm. So you have some of those, like administrative and teaching challenges as well.

992
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:52,030
Right. Yeah. Part of the intervention has to write things on the board. You get a bunch of middle schoolers writing the sexual terms on the board.

993
01:40:52,030 --> 01:40:55,480
Is that going to detract away from the conversation with things? Seriously?

994
01:40:55,990 --> 01:41:01,360
Yeah. So I think like I think like if you were to implement the style program for middle schoolers,

995
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:08,380
I think like they're like obviously in politics and in school boards and all that stuff.

996
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:17,680
But sometimes I think it's right and wrong, but I think consent is required, as we talked about when teaching sex ed.

997
01:41:18,190 --> 01:41:30,760
And I think if there was an emphasis on, oh, if they if if the person you are with does not say yes,

998
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:35,710
then that does not be that or whatever is off the table.

999
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:41,890
And I think like middle schoolers understand, like if you're like, oh, I want to go to the roller skating rink.

1000
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:45,340
Well, I don't want you you don't have to push it.

1001
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:52,420
You don't have to say, well, you should really like something way more fun if you go and you really just like you need to get over yourself.

1002
01:41:52,750 --> 01:41:58,460
And because no to respect the boundaries because if kids are able to push those boundaries in places like this is where I come from,

1003
01:41:58,510 --> 01:41:59,880
I'm not number one in writing.

1004
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:07,599
I am comfortable going to the park by my parents house, like teaching kids that those boundaries are probably closer to what you could get done.

1005
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:11,530
Not like, I don't think so far as that.

1006
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:17,980
We're going to get to the point where kids could openly discuss, like human anatomy, like middle school ages,

1007
01:42:18,910 --> 01:42:24,370
would be discussing slime, even though kids are aware by that point, a lot of it is in public schools.

1008
01:42:25,010 --> 01:42:35,440
Um, but I do think like that the setting of like this and I think like Jim Parsons could potentially teach like different defense styles.

1009
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:39,460
But that's where I feel like that's like almost hot water.

1010
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:47,169
What like people I think you go to different places and be taught like this is only for this.

1011
01:42:47,170 --> 01:42:52,750
And like, I think kids get it. Like, Yeah, sure. They're like definitely immature kids because we don't respect it.

1012
01:42:53,050 --> 01:42:57,850
But I think the majority of kids do. They they get it.

1013
01:42:57,930 --> 01:43:05,100
I understand. They understand, though. And so it's pushing that or then maybe all of the differences within adult.

1014
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:14,350
So I did least in the last 2 minutes, I hope you see some of the challenge of our world to make our work that you can't take a good idea and I

1015
01:43:14,350 --> 01:43:19,930
agree with you think the idea of talking to people about how to use language and as part of an intervention,

1016
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:23,590
what a great thing that I would love to be able to adapt to some of the work that I do.

1017
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:26,860
Can I just take what they've used and say, All right, this is how I'm going to do it?

1018
01:43:26,860 --> 01:43:33,490
Makes some smile that they saw some of that even in the 2 minutes that we got to see of the translation of this to an in population

1019
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:40,450
and you're going to find this that there are lots of great ideas or even a lot of effective programs that are out there that maybe,

1020
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:44,200
maybe we could take and implement it with a middle school population.

1021
01:43:44,530 --> 01:43:49,130
But starting to identify those barriers right off the bat, that's going to be a lot of work is going to be a heavy lift thing.

1022
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:57,549
But the resources that you have available and therein lies what the the challenge and opportunity of this kind of injury work and not just any reward,

1023
01:43:57,550 --> 01:44:04,600
but you can see how they're going to be a lot of different ways where you'll you'll say these are great idea, effective programs.

1024
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:08,140
I think it can be used. I think it can be translated to X, Y or Z.

1025
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:13,480
But then moving through this small, short exercise, I hope you see that it's something similar.

1026
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:16,900
And then when you have to start to put into practice all of these potential changes,

1027
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:26,290
how far away will we move from what Sarah already showed us works and reduces violence for women, or those expand sexual assault by 50% to 50%?

1028
01:44:26,290 --> 01:44:29,710
That is a bit of an effect size. That is huge.

1029
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:33,910
I would die, not die, but die for that kind of effect.

1030
01:44:33,940 --> 01:44:37,510
Like in my work. It would be fabulous. My goodness.

1031
01:44:38,260 --> 01:44:41,590
And it is equally disappointing that it's not being whether that the final.

1032
01:44:43,450 --> 01:44:51,490
So we're just looking at it from a good data standpoint. But can you take all the data that you've collected, all that were generated from it?

1033
01:44:52,030 --> 01:45:00,610
Like if you're comparing it with one population of the population, who are those interventions generalizable to all those population groups?

1034
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:03,490
Because ultimately, when it comes down to it,

1035
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:11,470
like if you're looking at intervention programs with doses like is it worth investing in certain interventions over others and why?

1036
01:45:13,220 --> 01:45:14,530
Maybe the good questions.

1037
01:45:14,530 --> 01:45:20,409
I mean, can we do more of a meta analytic approach where people have been using this across a few different campuses and the effect sizes,

1038
01:45:20,410 --> 01:45:24,670
the change changes. These are huge decisions, right?

1039
01:45:24,670 --> 01:45:28,450
This is not cheap and didn't build a cost benefit piece.

1040
01:45:28,790 --> 01:45:31,440
It didn't jump off the screen to me in terms of like I said,

1041
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:35,530
it's now instead of $350 per student, it's going to be, what, about a third of that, she said.

1042
01:45:35,830 --> 01:45:41,020
So hundred $5 per student relative to other things that we could be choosing to prevent sexual assault on campuses.

1043
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:45,790
Is that the right method? Are we going to be asking those types of questions? Who's going to make some of these decisions?

1044
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:54,430
Right. Yeah. What I was going to say is that what I find the difficult part of this is the topic of the general population.

1045
01:45:54,520 --> 01:46:01,970
Mm hmm. For example, if we go into a high school, middle schoolers separating boys and girls, they're not even being.

1046
01:46:03,010 --> 01:46:07,360
So it's this middle. I felt like I was in the hot seat every day.

1047
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:12,040
Yeah. So it's like if I was in middle school, I would probably be like, I don't.

1048
01:46:13,870 --> 01:46:22,389
Just think what they would say in like a 13 year old and dislike the ground surface.

1049
01:46:22,390 --> 01:46:30,250
The little things that you have the public don't think about but is worth considering and the program development is worth a conversation.

1050
01:46:31,540 --> 01:46:39,099
Well, I hope that kind of that kind of aloofness, this idea that we don't have to jump to the two and a half million dollar asked every time we think

1051
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:43,120
we have something is going to work that the pilot of the pilot work and his assessment work.

1052
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:47,170
Speaking and having conversations with folks that are actually going to experience that intervention.

1053
01:46:47,620 --> 01:46:55,390
Those are really valuable and maybe even more so than the statistical analysis that we could do at the end of the large clinical trial.

1054
01:46:55,660 --> 01:46:58,420
Because if you can put a whole bunch of cis males into a room,

1055
01:46:58,630 --> 01:47:02,170
present this information and it's just a bunch of eyeroll and are not retaining the information,

1056
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:08,200
not having it in a sense for some of the initial behavioral changes that we think we might see before we actually get to the behavior,

1057
01:47:09,190 --> 01:47:11,170
then this is not the right intervention for that.

1058
01:47:13,370 --> 01:47:22,500
But I just want to say, I wonder what will happen if they take it one step further and totally outsource this, do you know?

1059
01:47:23,020 --> 01:47:32,620
I don't think so. If it's not like every university has to do the effort over and over again, if they just there's like this company that does this,

1060
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:39,010
you know, and they have this different trainers, then this is their job, you know, and and you're just like, hire them.

1061
01:47:39,250 --> 01:47:44,590
You like your voice or you don't have your own, like, video conference.

1062
01:47:44,590 --> 01:47:49,800
And you're going to have to do everything, you know, like, why don't you just you just need them for, like, two weeks, you know?

1063
01:47:49,820 --> 01:47:57,610
Yeah. So you're just, like, hire them for two weeks, and then they'll be experts at their jobs and they'd be better capability that cost less.

1064
01:47:58,870 --> 01:48:07,120
I just wonder. Yeah, can I speak to a weakness in my our field in that, you know,

1065
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:11,110
think about that evaluation factor in going all the way from a theoretical evaluation or

1066
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:16,149
needs assessment to implementation trials to like the trials that cost benefit piece,

1067
01:48:16,150 --> 01:48:18,890
that scalability piece. It's hard to get the funding to do.

1068
01:48:19,330 --> 01:48:29,260
And are there efficiencies by having one company that can do all the training, have the technology piece, bring their technology to standard,

1069
01:48:29,260 --> 01:48:35,830
underresourced institutions, or those who might be experienced like that probably is two or three studies away.

1070
01:48:36,700 --> 01:48:40,810
And I would venture to say it would be very, very difficult to find a willing funder.

1071
01:48:41,680 --> 01:48:45,850
And that's speaking very academic language. I mean, but it's a reality, too.

1072
01:48:45,850 --> 01:48:50,050
If you want some of this evidence base, you're going to need to find people who are going to say,

1073
01:48:50,470 --> 01:48:54,280
okay, yeah, I'll see if, you know, what is what does this cost?

1074
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:59,380
And do we find that when we have an online delivery, we're getting vast improvements or even just the same?

1075
01:48:59,740 --> 01:49:06,500
Just to say we did a trial like this in Boston with some of our school based interventions, does it online delivery, does it look any different?

1076
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:11,410
And then we have somebody in the room because all things being equal, the more money is cheaper, right?

1077
01:49:11,590 --> 01:49:16,959
Presumably. And so perhaps you could do something like that. You could try to test some of those questions and whether you could do it within a little

1078
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:21,460
bit of a microcosm first and then extrapolate out might be a way to save some money.

1079
01:49:21,730 --> 01:49:32,379
But it is it is frustrating yet for us to try to overcome in the sense that and step up on that you're not interested in the cost benefit stuff.

1080
01:49:32,380 --> 01:49:37,300
You're not interested in scalability things, at least a large trial because it is so expensive to do.

1081
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:43,270
Let's find a company paid $50 million to give this to the 700 campuses across the country.

1082
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:47,769
I don't know a mechanism to fund that. But you can find foundations.

1083
01:49:47,770 --> 01:49:52,620
You can find states. If we want to try to do something. Yes, sir.

1084
01:49:56,680 --> 01:50:06,909
And the other guys. Yeah, I have a lot of you know, there's a lot on that point.

1085
01:50:06,910 --> 01:50:10,540
I see the cost effectiveness and the scale value.

1086
01:50:10,540 --> 01:50:15,330
But I'm wondering in your experience also, just like across the board and intervention,

1087
01:50:15,730 --> 01:50:20,350
how much is that point you talked about in conversation with the benefits of

1088
01:50:20,350 --> 01:50:24,100
having community based individuals to talk about these difficult conversations?

1089
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:28,660
I mean, like this is not a topic that a lot of people want to talk about with a stranger.

1090
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:38,200
Right? Um, particularly when you get into personal experiences or applying it to situations that are traumatic for folks.

1091
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:44,079
And I think the same is true for things like firearm violence and suicide prevention,

1092
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:51,760
like those are conversations that are often matters, like more people are more receptive if it's coming.

1093
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:55,140
They exist and have experience.

1094
01:50:55,370 --> 01:51:02,990
And so I know that's not true for every situation, but you notice that being considered when we're talking about scalability.

1095
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:07,580
I do. And I'm actually curious. And then the example I can give you is around opioid use.

1096
01:51:07,580 --> 01:51:11,540
But I wonder if anybody else has worked on a project where we where you are,

1097
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:26,300
even if it's a train and a trainer or it's looking at community based training or dissemination strategies, we'll go with it and not let them do it.

1098
01:51:26,310 --> 01:51:34,670
What's the what's the what's the example? The example you were training teachers to train other teachers in refugee camps.

1099
01:51:35,390 --> 01:51:40,610
And how do you integrate that language based and science?

1100
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:46,590
Because basically only the students know Arabic and the exams are in English.

1101
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:50,280
Okay. We were threatening the vision, the teacher, and returning the other two.

1102
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:58,350
So why did you train and teachers instead of just going right to all the teachers? Because it's cheaper and it's faster.

1103
01:51:59,220 --> 01:52:04,200
We make sure that they understand everything, you know, like we're just 15 versus.

1104
01:52:05,650 --> 01:52:09,880
Look, I know, I know there are about 3000.

1105
01:52:11,140 --> 01:52:14,770
I would like gender violence.

1106
01:52:15,070 --> 01:52:17,410
I work in peer facilitation programs.

1107
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:27,250
That comes in the training period to facilitate, to diminish the barriers between like students and a professional.

1108
01:52:27,250 --> 01:52:31,250
And then also in suicide prevention at a.

1109
01:52:33,990 --> 01:52:39,650
Community members purchased. It's not just outsiders.

1110
01:52:39,950 --> 01:52:47,690
Why is this important? Because people don't want to tell you about their mental health and their risk for suicide or their families.

1111
01:52:47,780 --> 01:52:53,410
Risk for suicide. I guess I turn to the establishment for trust.

1112
01:52:53,420 --> 01:53:03,969
And I think one of the challenges was incitement of violence and sexual violence that I see specifically in a university degree in higher education.

1113
01:53:03,970 --> 01:53:09,160
And let me talk about this is like a lot of schools have a different model and it's cheaper for them to adopt

1114
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:16,389
the defense model than it is for them to adopt like a proactive model that's trying to reduce these events,

1115
01:53:16,390 --> 01:53:22,900
like a failure for them to feel like they are there to pay their lawyers and security in their eyes.

1116
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:30,010
And it has been done to actually roll out this full scale program, which I think is really unfortunate and harmful to our populations.

1117
01:53:30,010 --> 01:53:40,330
But it does make the bottom dollar, unfortunately, like we see that across the board, especially parents, especially like in higher education.

1118
01:53:45,690 --> 01:53:52,559
So one of the things that struck me about Sarah's comments around Title nine is,

1119
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:57,000
again, from our field, so often we fall back, well, we just need policies.

1120
01:53:57,480 --> 01:54:01,470
We just need laws. And if we have the laws and policies, everything's going to be okay.

1121
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:09,750
Well, we do have laws and they don't necessarily kind of manifest on the ground in the ways that we might expect the delivery

1122
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:14,579
of some of these intervention programs and the fact that you do have lawyers trying to read through and saying,

1123
01:54:14,580 --> 01:54:18,030
are we checking the boxes that we are consistent with the policy versus choosing the best

1124
01:54:18,030 --> 01:54:22,590
evidence based program has real implications for what we start to see within practice,

1125
01:54:23,460 --> 01:54:25,680
and it's something that we run into fairly frequently,

1126
01:54:26,110 --> 01:54:35,910
and that's aligning your practices with what's written versus whether or not we think we can do a better job is is something to consider.

1127
01:54:36,330 --> 01:54:42,420
And so then when we do think, well, all we need is any policy or all we need is a law, you know,

1128
01:54:42,660 --> 01:54:47,520
how is that going to get enacted in practice, what me maybe needs to supplement or again,

1129
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:54,720
what are some of the barriers that we might have to consider to seeing this law kind of come to fruition in the way that it was intended,

1130
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:58,889
the way it was written, because interpretive versus intended can often be directed pretty substantially.

1131
01:54:58,890 --> 01:55:10,200
Actually have an example that. You know, I feel like once you start saying that we need a policy or laws to make it.

1132
01:55:10,470 --> 01:55:16,380
Yeah. So then if that's like continue roadwork that you guys do,

1133
01:55:17,670 --> 01:55:27,300
how do you get like that is a really hit and I'm trying to think like how do you work around that?

1134
01:55:27,690 --> 01:55:32,580
Or like what language must we come up with to get them to see that?

1135
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:44,670
In response, I'm trying to give one interview more entrepreneurial approaches.

1136
01:55:44,950 --> 01:55:49,030
Okay. I mean, you don't really see a program right now in school, public health.

1137
01:55:49,980 --> 01:55:53,120
You know. That's correct.

1138
01:55:53,310 --> 01:55:57,000
So maybe in the future. Why is that?

1139
01:55:57,030 --> 01:56:01,740
Why is that principle of your partnership going to be over there? Just because you need to sell this?

1140
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:05,739
Yeah. It's you know, it's a huge undertaking.

1141
01:56:05,740 --> 01:56:09,910
It's a huge problem that does have solutions.

1142
01:56:10,390 --> 01:56:21,660
And when it comes down to it, it is about money. A lot of the time know the differences and that sort of nature.

1143
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:32,750
I was just going to say kind of like. You most looking for?

1144
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:38,540
It's kind of like. What we actually.

1145
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:47,330
Mm hmm. And like I. I know in other countries, like, um, the Netherlands.

1146
01:56:49,110 --> 01:56:52,410
Sexual assault prevention and education as well.

1147
01:56:54,030 --> 01:57:00,030
It's not really an issue because they started talking about these things when they're going through school.

1148
01:57:00,030 --> 01:57:08,639
And it's a process of educational process where it's like we don't learn about it until fifth grade and then systematically two years later.

1149
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:14,610
And then it's very filtered and even just like our discussion here about.

1150
01:57:17,210 --> 01:57:22,460
Body parts and the anatomy. We're very used to that.

1151
01:57:22,910 --> 01:57:29,060
And everyone's just become sensitized and have been.

1152
01:57:32,830 --> 01:57:38,409
So I'm going to connect a little bit at Carolyn's point about kind of laws and legislation we actually are doing working with in

1153
01:57:38,410 --> 01:57:47,380
the UK just to monitor of all violence legislation that's going through our states houses as well as opioid related legislation.

1154
01:57:47,620 --> 01:57:51,189
It's fascinating. It's all of this you can look at to see what it's worth.

1155
01:57:51,190 --> 01:57:53,950
It's throwing up to the floor, which stays in committee, what actually gets passed.

1156
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:58,480
One of the things that we find consistently, whether we're talking about violence programing or talking about opioids,

1157
01:57:58,780 --> 01:58:05,260
is this language that we love to use in public health, like CDC, shared risk and protective factors.

1158
01:58:05,860 --> 01:58:11,500
So many folks have heard shared risk and protective factors or frankly, just risk and protective factors.

1159
01:58:11,710 --> 01:58:17,950
That's not showing up in our legislation, our state legislation that's going to govern all these policies around firearms,

1160
01:58:17,950 --> 01:58:20,620
around intimate partner violence, around school safety. Right.

1161
01:58:20,830 --> 01:58:25,720
You're not seeing the folks in the legislature talking in the same way that we do in these classrooms.

1162
01:58:25,870 --> 01:58:27,939
And that's a big problem. Right.

1163
01:58:27,940 --> 01:58:35,200
So what then, again, is our role to begin to have some of these conversations, to create enough awareness so that a policy does start to get written,

1164
01:58:35,200 --> 01:58:39,730
does get in place soon enough that we're not being as reactive and a little bit more proactive.

1165
01:58:40,060 --> 01:58:44,710
It's using data. I think it's trying to explain why we believe that the positions that we take,

1166
01:58:45,010 --> 01:58:51,430
understanding the perspectives that we both share with and are in contrast to those that are going to be affected by the things that we're doing.

1167
01:58:51,940 --> 01:58:54,930
All of those pieces kind of come into play.

1168
01:58:54,940 --> 01:59:01,270
You can see why it might take more than just, you know, a hot second to have a new law passed that's going to do everything that we might want to see.

1169
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:06,969
So that's yeah, I mean, it's kind of fun, but it's kind of sad to see,

1170
01:59:06,970 --> 01:59:10,060
I think the number of things that die in committee or I never really had a

1171
01:59:10,060 --> 01:59:14,230
chance to get debated and in particular around some of the wraparound services,

1172
01:59:14,230 --> 01:59:17,050
related opioids and substance use.

1173
01:59:17,410 --> 01:59:27,730
And those are the ones that we tend to see lost in favor of more kind of enforcement related activities or things that you might consider less,

1174
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:34,050
less proactive and more just trying to preempt.

1175
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:42,160
Maybe that might be anyway. Wow, that's a game.

1176
01:59:42,890 --> 01:59:47,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right. I thought it was really interesting stuff.

1177
01:59:47,110 --> 01:59:54,400
So I feel like anything that I might have to share on this is just going to be either redundant or in a lot better name.

1178
01:59:55,390 --> 02:00:02,049
So something that I think is a particular challenge for this field is some of their language I'm glad that they're touching on.

1179
02:00:02,050 --> 02:00:05,620
I'm glad you folks picked up on it. But, you know, kind of depending on who we talk to,

1180
02:00:06,250 --> 02:00:12,010
the definitions of these different terms and how we're using them are people in certain people using the same things?

1181
02:00:12,430 --> 02:00:19,330
Are we saying the same thing and understanding each other and terms of how we might we might talk about whether it's misconduct,

1182
02:00:19,420 --> 02:00:23,469
whether it's sexual violence, whether it's sexual assault. Are they the same constructs?

1183
02:00:23,470 --> 02:00:29,920
And if not, what are we doing to facilitate either the synthesis of these ideas or distinction of these ideas?

1184
02:00:30,220 --> 02:00:33,510
So that when we do look at data and we do say things like, you know,

1185
02:00:33,550 --> 02:00:40,100
99% of the perpetration comprises males, but then what what do we mean by perpetration?

1186
02:00:40,100 --> 02:00:43,930
And what events constitute sexual misconduct, violence or assault?

1187
02:00:44,350 --> 02:00:48,159
Right. So that we're helping potential victims understand and recognize.

1188
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:54,010
So I think you're going to see some of these things show up in most kind of IPV related interventions.

1189
02:00:54,760 --> 02:01:01,600
But are there is there kind of consistency across? One of the things that we've seen is that the measurement can vary widely from study team to study.

1190
02:01:02,170 --> 02:01:04,990
And so of the data that we're collecting, the data we can compare.

1191
02:01:05,260 --> 02:01:09,190
But how do you imagine kind of more of another analytic approach that only works when

1192
02:01:09,190 --> 02:01:16,569
people are asking similar types of things with inference or what else do we have?

1193
02:01:16,570 --> 02:01:20,350
There are these are going to be kind of more definitional.

1194
02:01:20,350 --> 02:01:29,139
This is all up on your on the slides for today. Just I think nothing going to be super surprising other than this is one of the

1195
02:01:29,140 --> 02:01:34,360
things that might motivate how we begin to talk about the scope of this problem.

1196
02:01:35,050 --> 02:01:42,370
When you think about how many people could potentially be victims and think about the number of students that are changing

1197
02:01:42,370 --> 02:01:48,699
the way that we deliver programs or a policy that we might try to implement could be impacting more affected communities.

1198
02:01:48,700 --> 02:01:56,889
There was almost just disbelief that schools might not consider, you know,

1199
02:01:56,890 --> 02:02:03,370
if X percent of your student populations are affected by sexual violence, why in the world would you not consider a program like this?

1200
02:02:03,640 --> 02:02:09,820
How can you make some of those decisions about weighing the expense of this program, the inconvenience of this program,

1201
02:02:09,820 --> 02:02:16,420
the juxtaposition of another program versus the one that we think is a better it's going to be better for your student populations.

1202
02:02:16,750 --> 02:02:22,490
The relevance, the cultural relevance of your program, all of this was created in a combination of Canadian and U.S. schools.

1203
02:02:22,510 --> 02:02:24,970
It was nothing like my own. So why would I consider that program?

1204
02:02:25,630 --> 02:02:31,810
But trying to use data once again, I know I sound like a broken record to try to to make the case for what we're.

1205
02:02:31,950 --> 02:02:35,150
We are focusing the resources, as Sarah mentioned,

1206
02:02:35,570 --> 02:02:39,570
when there are other things that you can choose to focus on or other ways that you might try to prevent.

1207
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:47,269
Also kind of downstream, right?

1208
02:02:47,270 --> 02:02:49,790
So when we think about kind of the social determinants of health,

1209
02:02:50,420 --> 02:02:55,700
I feel like with intimate partner violence against somebody coming from like a data driven perspective,

1210
02:02:55,700 --> 02:03:01,160
how often this kind of goes unreported and how often we could be missing some of these cases.

1211
02:03:01,430 --> 02:03:04,820
But then they have just across study after study after study,

1212
02:03:05,210 --> 02:03:11,390
the number of things that are correlated with experiencing intimate partner violence, those kind of continues and goes on and on.

1213
02:03:11,690 --> 02:03:15,920
So thinking about other spaces where you might be operating or working,

1214
02:03:16,250 --> 02:03:23,330
but then still considering what connections can we make and whether or not there are some different roads that lead back to,

1215
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:30,230
for example, intimate partner violence. So again, thinking about a more holistic picture of of of intervention.

1216
02:03:30,470 --> 02:03:33,470
So even though we might be talking to someone, the air about their substance use,

1217
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:40,130
there might be other reasons to try to ascertain as much of this information as we can in a way that's private, in a way that's respectful.

1218
02:03:40,460 --> 02:03:49,060
And I understand that piece to but to to to see if there are some correlating risk factors that you might be looking for the tricky.

1219
02:03:49,610 --> 02:03:55,700
We only have so much time to focus on the interactions with with an individual and

1220
02:03:55,700 --> 02:03:59,570
there are so many different ways that people can be affected by violence by a.

1221
02:04:04,790 --> 02:04:05,840
Was this from state of Michigan?

1222
02:04:07,400 --> 02:04:18,230
Um, this is a, I did this because of the kind of speaking to the, the lack of acknowledgment of different sorts of gender identities and orientations.

1223
02:04:18,580 --> 02:04:21,700
Right. This is an idea that I can pull. And we're not careful.

1224
02:04:21,710 --> 02:04:28,070
We're not as inclusive as we can be in terms of understanding the different patterns of dating violence that might be occurring.

1225
02:04:28,570 --> 02:04:36,170
Um, what areas are missing? What are well represented, which are likely to be undercounts, which are likely to be a little bit more accurate?

1226
02:04:36,620 --> 02:04:38,260
You can take these data with a grain of salt.

1227
02:04:38,270 --> 02:04:46,130
You can either make it a pace for moving forward or something you can take them as a case for are missing a key aspect of our measurement.

1228
02:04:46,470 --> 02:04:51,830
What does that mean for different populations who might be at more or less risk or for violence exposure?

1229
02:05:09,120 --> 02:05:16,530
But my Stephanie. Yeah. I don't like it. I always feel bad, like I don't want her doing it.

1230
02:05:16,830 --> 02:05:19,770
Allow me to show you my my great body work now.

1231
02:05:20,340 --> 02:05:31,049
But I did want to show you some examples of the work that I'm doing or say I'll tell her to just defer just to my fantastic,

1232
02:05:31,050 --> 02:05:34,920
excellent colleagues as possible. Extreme risk protection works.

1233
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:40,320
Very interesting. So April zero up at HP, she was at Michigan State.

1234
02:05:40,470 --> 02:05:47,010
Now she's a new that she is very interested in understanding how this privacy protection

1235
02:05:47,010 --> 02:05:51,560
order or both are utilized in particular cases of intimate partner violence.

1236
02:05:51,570 --> 02:05:54,960
So she has her voice, heard about them, seen them.

1237
02:05:56,040 --> 02:06:00,030
They're starting to find their way into the lexicon, starting to find their way across.

1238
02:06:00,070 --> 02:06:03,690
I forget how many states it's well under half have or bylaws,

1239
02:06:04,050 --> 02:06:13,470
but essentially this is a way to to remove firearms in many cases from situations

1240
02:06:13,470 --> 02:06:15,690
where someone might feel like they're a danger to themselves or others.

1241
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:24,750
So in the case of intimate partner violence, with so many of the fatal interactions involving a firearm,

1242
02:06:24,990 --> 02:06:32,760
it would be I'm worried that my spouse, my partner, my wife, whomever is is going to be aggressive or is going to hurt me.

1243
02:06:33,060 --> 02:06:40,170
They have access to a firearm. Can we use a court ordered mandate to remove that firearm for a period, for a period of 30 days,

1244
02:06:40,170 --> 02:06:45,180
60 days, whatever else it might be, so that the individual can get help,

1245
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:52,379
remove themselves from the situation or there's not really access because so many of these these firearm related injuries are instantaneous decisions.

1246
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:56,700
They happen within seconds or minutes of a firearm fatality of firearms.

1247
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,670
But it's really important here because when we think about IPV,

1248
02:06:59,970 --> 02:07:05,940
and particularly in terms of fatalities or severe, severe injuries, it's because there's a weapon involved.

1249
02:07:06,390 --> 02:07:11,970
I always I'm not trying to discount when there's not a weapon involvement with the with fatalities in particular,

1250
02:07:12,150 --> 02:07:22,050
but then also coercion and the way that people are using weapons, if not physically, but as a as a mental or emotional and abusive way.

1251
02:07:22,590 --> 02:07:27,540
So April is taking these orders and trying to just understand the epidemiology.

1252
02:07:27,870 --> 02:07:33,990
It's a law. This one is one of a case where it predates whether or not we think it could be a really good idea.

1253
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:43,050
But we have kind of a theoretical rationale for why it could be working. We don't really know what the laws say or the purpose of the orders say.

1254
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:46,710
People say that they're concerned. They send it to a judge.

1255
02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:52,770
Sometimes it's the partner, sometimes very rarely. It's it can be an outside observer other than a police officer.

1256
02:07:53,160 --> 02:07:54,750
What does that intersection look like?

1257
02:07:54,750 --> 02:08:02,520
If we have to go to a police officer first to assess the situation and then have a judge make a determination about whether or not my partner,

1258
02:08:02,790 --> 02:08:06,230
my roommate, my whoever has a gun, I'm worried about them.

1259
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:12,300
I'm worried about me. And can we take this firearm away? Think about the constitutionality of Second Amendment rights and all that kind of stuff.

1260
02:08:12,720 --> 02:08:17,129
How does that all play? And then you'd be surprised. Okay, Connecticut has one.

1261
02:08:17,130 --> 02:08:20,670
I think New York has one. Oregon has one not as is presently.

1262
02:08:20,910 --> 02:08:29,190
Florida is one of those states that uses them the most for trying to understand how these orders are processed, how the judges make the determination.

1263
02:08:29,550 --> 02:08:32,790
Do we see them actually implemented in practice with the firearm removed?

1264
02:08:33,150 --> 02:08:39,240
Who is mentioned in these orders? I'm very interested to know whether or not kids are included as part of these conversations,

1265
02:08:39,570 --> 02:08:44,610
or is it just the adults or partners that are that are kind of the focus of the conversation?

1266
02:08:44,970 --> 02:08:50,940
So I am excited to work with April about this because we also see them in cases with mass shootings.

1267
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:57,930
So if someone's worried about their their son or daughter or whatever that has access to a firearm or made statements about,

1268
02:08:58,230 --> 02:09:06,570
you know, bringing a weapon to school. But I think they were originally intended for intimate partner violence as kind of a key focus.

1269
02:09:07,350 --> 02:09:11,070
So do we think they're a good idea? Can they be effective?

1270
02:09:12,240 --> 02:09:19,799
How do we begin to answer some of those questions and look at them systematically so we know, okay, state of Michigan, do we have one?

1271
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:24,040
No. Should we have one? Yeah, yeah.

1272
02:09:24,660 --> 02:09:30,130
Yeah. Based on what they had, based on what evidence you can you give me a date?

1273
02:09:30,660 --> 02:09:34,170
Yeah. Yeah, I know, folks. I would look. I would look.

1274
02:09:34,170 --> 02:09:38,100
I hope you can provide some systematic evidence to suggest that Michigan should have books.

1275
02:09:38,490 --> 02:09:43,410
I think it's a great thing to think about. And you might be able to find you might not you might be able to make a case for it.

1276
02:09:43,410 --> 02:09:49,379
You might not. But even just to to recognize it again, having it in our consciousness, having it in our language,

1277
02:09:49,380 --> 02:09:54,790
to start thinking this is an option and this is an option that could be effective in other states to be effective first in.

1278
02:09:54,880 --> 02:10:06,570
And yet at the mention of this, how do we think about the around the debate around universal background checks that comes to purchase a firearm and.

1279
02:10:07,950 --> 02:10:11,009
Positive predictors of one's behavior. We don't know.

1280
02:10:11,010 --> 02:10:15,370
But how there's something like that.

1281
02:10:15,370 --> 02:10:22,620
It seems like they could go in hand-in-hand with each other. But yeah, I feel like if this there's an existing law,

1282
02:10:22,650 --> 02:10:27,760
that's a reason for the opposing party to see as the reason for not having universal background checks.

1283
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:33,000
That that makes sense because it's like, well, this is an interesting point.

1284
02:10:33,030 --> 02:10:41,429
Unintended consequences of a policy. I promise you I promise you that somebody writing in her bill was not thinking

1285
02:10:41,430 --> 02:10:44,820
this is going to take place to take the place of a universal background check,

1286
02:10:45,060 --> 02:10:51,060
I can guarantee you. I mean, I haven't actually read it, but I can guarantee you that that wasn't the thing.

1287
02:10:51,570 --> 02:11:01,510
Maybe, maybe, maybe. But I don't think that the the gun rights advocates fight tooth and nail against any form of restrictions to firearms.

1288
02:11:02,100 --> 02:11:11,100
I think it's I mean, it's it becomes a constitutional issue in these parts, largely because there is an imminent threat.

1289
02:11:11,250 --> 02:11:15,630
That's why this is something that's widely adopted or at least widely accepted.

1290
02:11:15,900 --> 02:11:19,709
And just because we think it's a good idea doesn't mean everybody in the room is going to say, yes, I think we should do this.

1291
02:11:19,710 --> 02:11:26,120
Some people are going to say, no, I don't care. This is you know, you cannot take away a constitutional right for any reason.

1292
02:11:26,130 --> 02:11:27,960
Whatever the point is,

1293
02:11:29,430 --> 02:11:39,479
you might find that people use what's existing a policy to make a case for or against something that maybe doesn't have the same rationale background

1294
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:47,520
checks yet you can sure that states that have background checks are going to have lower firearm ownership rates or illegal guns or fatalities,

1295
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:51,280
injuries, that sort of thing. Should they be adopted universally?

1296
02:11:51,570 --> 02:11:57,450
I can give you my opinion. I can show you some data. But do I think they're necessarily explicitly connected with this?

1297
02:11:57,720 --> 02:12:02,940
I think there are different. Right. You can use legal firearms in a lot of illegal ways.

1298
02:12:06,190 --> 02:12:12,850
But I'm just wondering, how long does it take between asking for this and getting it?

1299
02:12:13,690 --> 02:12:16,840
The great question. So sometimes it can be fairly fast.

1300
02:12:17,350 --> 02:12:20,740
Sometimes it takes a few more days. And if it would be a better one to ask.

1301
02:12:20,770 --> 02:12:26,470
I can give you April's information. She's got a couple of papers on exactly how long it could take.

1302
02:12:26,710 --> 02:12:31,150
And honestly, some of the ones that don't get accepted, that's a scary thing, too.

1303
02:12:31,480 --> 02:12:32,740
I'm just also wondering because.

1304
02:12:35,370 --> 02:12:42,660
The other person who wants to use the firearm actually knows about it, would push them to use it faster before it's gone.

1305
02:12:43,010 --> 02:12:48,300
Right. Or. Yeah. Are people afraid to speak up because they don't want to have that sort of reprisal?

1306
02:12:48,510 --> 02:12:53,130
What can we do to prevent some of that retaliation? So yeah, these are kind of open questions.

1307
02:12:53,970 --> 02:12:58,260
I think if I'm remembering some of April's writing on this this topic,

1308
02:12:59,220 --> 02:13:07,680
I can't I don't know of any specific instances where an Oprah was filed and in response there was specific violence because of that filing.

1309
02:13:08,370 --> 02:13:11,610
But that doesn't say that it couldn't happen. But I do think it's supposed to be fairly quick.

1310
02:13:12,270 --> 02:13:17,220
But when you start to read the text of the actual complaints or the filings, they vary quite widely.

1311
02:13:17,580 --> 02:13:20,550
Some of them have a lot of information. Some of them are very scant.

1312
02:13:21,270 --> 02:13:26,400
You do wonder how judges can make consistent decision, and there seems to be a little bit of a subjective component,

1313
02:13:26,820 --> 02:13:33,480
which makes me think, does it matter who is making just the request versus the partner versus the member?

1314
02:13:33,810 --> 02:13:37,830
Does it matter the circumstances? Does the previous criminal history matter?

1315
02:13:37,830 --> 02:13:42,330
You know, all those different pieces could play into how a judge stands and says, okay, I think we should do this.

1316
02:13:45,080 --> 02:13:48,969
That's cool stuff, especially because it's kind of on the cusp.

1317
02:13:48,970 --> 02:13:54,040
We're seeing it more and more. As mass shootings become unfortunately more prominent,

1318
02:13:54,370 --> 02:13:58,810
people think about whether or not an intervention at a policy level like this could be an effective way.

1319
02:13:59,170 --> 02:14:06,040
Works in some cases with intimate partner violence can also work with violence that might be happening when someone is suicidal,

1320
02:14:06,220 --> 02:14:10,690
someone is providing the threat of potentially an attack on a building or school.

1321
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:18,510
I think an important stipulation within this is who's enforcing it.

1322
02:14:19,080 --> 02:14:32,460
There are so many examples of law enforcement abuse in getting a warrant for a firearm and just.

1323
02:14:34,090 --> 02:14:40,570
Extreme negligence. And so you're just looking at what Michigan has.

1324
02:14:40,810 --> 02:14:52,330
There's no sort of there's not any clear language on exactly how how the law is applied or to what

1325
02:14:52,330 --> 02:15:01,090
extent or kind of how to secure a situation so that people aren't being harmed in getting the firearm.

1326
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:13,690
And I mean, I don't have any specific point to make, only that it's a really large stipulation that people don't get harmed while trying to prevent.

1327
02:15:15,580 --> 02:15:23,950
I also have no idea that there was there's a petition after Parkland.

1328
02:15:24,370 --> 02:15:29,740
There's a petition where you can sign up so that you're not allowed to own a firearm.

1329
02:15:30,310 --> 02:15:38,550
Like if you have a certain diagnosis, if you feel like you are prone to violence, that you can sign something that says like,

1330
02:15:38,770 --> 02:15:51,010
I'm not legally allowed to fire, which I think is really interesting and and definitely a novel approach to firearm violence.

1331
02:15:55,250 --> 02:15:58,840
Back to intimate partner violence. But relating to law enforcement,

1332
02:15:58,840 --> 02:16:07,810
it reminded me a few years ago I was working with these people to evaluate a program to reduce intimate partner violence homicide.

1333
02:16:08,200 --> 02:16:12,399
And so I was helping code interviews. And I mean, I think it's still going on.

1334
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:19,780
So I don't know what the results ended up being. But in I was quoting interviews, a lot of mine were from law enforcement.

1335
02:16:20,050 --> 02:16:23,050
And they're supposed to go through these steps to call.

1336
02:16:23,050 --> 02:16:29,800
And if they're called to the scene and reduce homicide, like from the person being killed.

1337
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:37,300
And a lot of times the victims in the interviews would say, no, they never asked me any of these questions.

1338
02:16:37,300 --> 02:16:40,750
And the law enforcement would say, I didn't ask those questions.

1339
02:16:40,750 --> 02:16:43,780
I didn't think they were necessary or things like that.

1340
02:16:43,780 --> 02:16:46,959
And yeah, so they never got caught.

1341
02:16:46,960 --> 02:16:53,020
They never followed the proper protocol in regard to intimate partner violence.

1342
02:16:53,180 --> 02:16:55,110
Yeah. Talking about, you know,

1343
02:16:55,770 --> 02:17:02,260
the actual implementation of stuff that happened within perhaps the response and in both cases it's something similar and how,

1344
02:17:02,710 --> 02:17:07,090
how that piece of that component of that, I can tell you simply some data we collected on healthy minds last year.

1345
02:17:07,660 --> 02:17:11,470
Students on this campus do not want armed police officers responding to them.

1346
02:17:11,740 --> 02:17:16,809
When there is a when there's a concern that someone has suicidal ideation,

1347
02:17:16,810 --> 02:17:22,870
that someone has had a response to an altercation with their student or their partner.

1348
02:17:23,230 --> 02:17:26,719
So it's three different potential violence or actual violence cases.

1349
02:17:26,720 --> 02:17:31,870
This 31 hour officers respond. That's one example of how law enforcement can be responding to a situation.

1350
02:17:32,170 --> 02:17:36,940
And people are recruits concerns. But imagine they're a minimum of 202.

1351
02:17:38,680 --> 02:17:48,980
So let's say a situation like that or go past someone like they had legal firearms that they, like, removed or they're all over my legal firm.

1352
02:17:49,300 --> 02:17:58,810
Mm hmm. And how do we address the issue of, like, black market accessibility when, you know, how do you address that?

1353
02:17:59,170 --> 02:18:06,190
Yeah, that's a great question. So, again, how many firms of somebody's own party do you have access to them can remove them safely?

1354
02:18:07,240 --> 02:18:13,700
Are there still access to other firearms? Are you going to be able to find another family member or somebody on the street?

1355
02:18:13,700 --> 02:18:20,719
That's kind of. Very much open questions as to what happens when these things get filed and how long is 60 days?

1356
02:18:20,720 --> 02:18:24,260
Enough. If I lose my firearm for 60 days, what happened under 61?

1357
02:18:24,380 --> 02:18:31,040
I'm not sure. I was just thinking about who knows about who's informed about this policy.

1358
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:36,620
To me, what I'm thinking is if anyone purchases a gun and then a partner in a partner should

1359
02:18:36,620 --> 02:18:42,410
be notified or aware of this particular policy as long as they don't tell us the gun.

1360
02:18:42,860 --> 02:18:52,610
You know, tell, you know. You know, you haven't been to vote for a period of time because they don't know.

1361
02:18:52,610 --> 02:18:57,620
That is why they're so like that, like the constitutional right in their constitutional rights.

1362
02:19:00,230 --> 02:19:06,890
I mean, so understanding how these what these laws say, for whom they apply, I mean, these are all things because they're so new.

1363
02:19:07,400 --> 02:19:12,620
And so for many states and these they're they're either under consideration right now or they've been enacted in the last couple of years.

1364
02:19:12,860 --> 02:19:19,100
And so what does that have? What does that mean? I can tell you first that a recreational cannabis law, because I just made the final report,

1365
02:19:19,220 --> 02:19:25,790
it took a long time for people in the state of Michigan to start to understand key aspects of our recreational cannabis law,

1366
02:19:26,330 --> 02:19:29,990
including things like how much can I be walking around with or How much can I buy at a given time?

1367
02:19:30,390 --> 02:19:40,280
Right. So now translate that to another law that might be intersecting with one higher number of or a higher percentage of ownership,

1368
02:19:40,760 --> 02:19:47,030
low understanding of what you're allowed to do and when who can file and when can you file all those things.

1369
02:19:47,030 --> 02:19:48,590
So that's kind of the education piece.

1370
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:55,480
Are you pairing the passage of a law with community members that could be out there and be advocates for how you can use these laws and when?

1371
02:19:55,760 --> 02:20:02,299
What does it mean? Can you assuage any concern that if I filed this law, my partner might end up going to jail or for some reason get in trouble?

1372
02:20:02,300 --> 02:20:10,530
Because, you know, I'm concerned, but I also don't want my partner to be identified as a by the police or something like that.

1373
02:20:10,550 --> 02:20:15,890
Right. So there are a lot of different things that we can think about through the actual implementation of the policy,

1374
02:20:16,340 --> 02:20:22,730
but one just the same that's designed to prevent intimate partner violence and contrast that with what the state of Michigan did.

1375
02:20:23,180 --> 02:20:27,170
So how much intervention is enough high value in this to the best that we could?

1376
02:20:27,860 --> 02:20:31,700
This was a state of Michigan intervention and like 400,000 of these little cards.

1377
02:20:31,700 --> 02:20:35,300
I wish I brought some down from my office. They're in English, they're in Arabic, they're in Spanish.

1378
02:20:35,780 --> 02:20:39,710
This was their way, their core injury and violence prevention program,

1379
02:20:39,980 --> 02:20:49,610
to begin to make some strides towards how we can prevent intimate partner violence policy related intervention.

1380
02:20:50,330 --> 02:20:55,520
Handing out cards to individuals, trying to be responsive, trying to include think about inclusive,

1381
02:20:55,520 --> 02:20:58,730
thinking about who's going to be receiving this information.

1382
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:02,940
And is this enough? Is this enough?

1383
02:21:04,450 --> 02:21:10,689
Do we need Sarah's 12 hours of training? Do we need a policy that's in effect?

1384
02:21:10,690 --> 02:21:14,610
Everyone. Where again are you going to put your resources?

1385
02:21:14,620 --> 02:21:18,950
I can tell you this did not take two and a half million dollars to do right.

1386
02:21:22,750 --> 02:21:34,860
Were you today? It probably could have gotten better graphic design, she said.

1387
02:21:35,190 --> 02:21:41,340
I don't know, because they made it terms of a valentine.

1388
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:48,180
What does it look like? That's what it looks like.

1389
02:21:48,300 --> 02:21:52,790
Yeah. Mean, I know it's a public service. It is message, right?

1390
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:56,520
They're trying to get resources out to people. All right. I did like that.

1391
02:21:56,520 --> 02:21:59,760
They thought that there's more than just English speakers in the state of Michigan.

1392
02:22:00,120 --> 02:22:05,520
Right. I think that's a nice stuff. You have resources that you can apply to.

1393
02:22:05,820 --> 02:22:07,410
For me, I work in schools.

1394
02:22:07,410 --> 02:22:13,560
I spend a lot of time trying to teach kids what they need to be looking out for in terms of somebody might be a danger to themselves or others.

1395
02:22:14,010 --> 02:22:23,790
What do those signs look like? Do you do you know all these signs and this highly educated, substantive, relevant audience?

1396
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:28,440
You might have all these things down. Can we assume that this is true of everybody in the state of Michigan?

1397
02:22:29,250 --> 02:22:37,650
Is this appropriate to give to our middle schoolers at in Washington or does this or can I give it to college students?

1398
02:22:38,250 --> 02:22:42,840
They just kind of standing out there, right there, trying to get them in as many hands as possible so that maybe,

1399
02:22:43,110 --> 02:22:46,979
just maybe somebody thinks about somebody or reads it and it makes a difference.

1400
02:22:46,980 --> 02:22:52,470
And is that enough? I mean, if it's you know, then they aren't an intern, which I'm sure they hired an intern.

1401
02:22:52,920 --> 02:22:57,900
I think this is true. But they, you know, they made a little sucker thing and now these are out there.

1402
02:22:58,230 --> 02:23:03,480
And if it if that costs $35,000 and six people use this hotline,

1403
02:23:03,480 --> 02:23:10,830
or six people are able to recognize that maybe I am in a compromised position and I need to do something about or I need to find some help.

1404
02:23:11,100 --> 02:23:15,180
Is that is that enough for us at the end of the day as injury prevention provision?

1405
02:23:15,570 --> 02:23:18,730
No. No. Oh, sure.

1406
02:23:19,470 --> 02:23:26,310
I'm getting her, too. From a cost benefit analysis, it seems an all or nothing.

1407
02:23:28,140 --> 02:23:37,280
Better to think that $35,000 to go somewhere else. To hear something that you're doing just because of our personal experiences.

1408
02:23:37,290 --> 02:23:41,520
Although not known, her personal experiences are still the ones that are included.

1409
02:23:41,610 --> 02:23:46,769
Mm hmm. Um, I noticed, like, my parents, like, started talking about, like, relationship.

1410
02:23:46,770 --> 02:23:50,160
Like, are you in a healthy relationship? Like, oh, we should have known this.

1411
02:23:50,190 --> 02:23:55,470
Yeah, because they went to the doctor's office and they saw a little, like, sign, and they're like, Oh, that's weird.

1412
02:23:55,710 --> 02:23:58,970
Yeah. One of my kids, like, ex-boyfriends used to do that. All that.

1413
02:23:59,460 --> 02:24:05,100
Oh, okay. No, I. Yeah, I think, like, those fliers at, like, clinics and doctor's office.

1414
02:24:05,610 --> 02:24:10,319
Like, I think those, like, do pay because, like, I also like like I have like trying to buy, like, yeah.

1415
02:24:10,320 --> 02:24:11,790
Did you go this? Isn't that even like, yeah,

1416
02:24:11,790 --> 02:24:22,229
you see it at the doctor's office every time you go right and you go in an area like there's more like if there's a whole lot of things going on.

1417
02:24:22,230 --> 02:24:26,370
But I mean, it's kind of an. Okay. Yeah. I mean, well, it's an open question.

1418
02:24:26,370 --> 02:24:32,759
So here I have an unhealthy relationship. I'm not going to ask you, but could you name six of the nine on there or off the top of your head?

1419
02:24:32,760 --> 02:24:35,970
Can you tell me six signs that you might be in an unhealthy relationship?

1420
02:24:36,360 --> 02:24:39,810
Okay, I ask you to do it when you start to write some of those things down.

1421
02:24:40,350 --> 02:24:43,920
I mean, is there some utility that's on this card that maybe we wouldn't think of?

1422
02:24:44,160 --> 02:24:50,220
Yes, it seems obvious when we look at it. Oh, yeah. Wants to change who you are as people ask you to go activities that you enjoy.

1423
02:24:50,610 --> 02:24:55,230
What does that really look like? Does this need more context than just trying to read some of those things like.

1424
02:24:55,770 --> 02:24:59,410
So then do we think, all right, do we just drop this altogether?

1425
02:24:59,430 --> 02:25:08,610
Is it so bad? So what's the word like, so basic or, you know, infantile that it doesn't have any utility?

1426
02:25:08,610 --> 02:25:12,000
Or do we say, what if we paired this with a kind of small conversation?

1427
02:25:12,330 --> 02:25:16,200
We talk to people who are coming into our doctor's offices or something like that.

1428
02:25:16,440 --> 02:25:19,380
We say, By the way, I know you're waiting for the doctor the next 20 minutes.

1429
02:25:20,010 --> 02:25:25,139
Have you thought about, you know, she's saying this or have you thought about relationships and what it means?

1430
02:25:25,140 --> 02:25:31,050
And there are serious mistakes. Is there are there community stakeholders that we can engage so that these messages can get disseminated?

1431
02:25:31,560 --> 02:25:34,950
Maybe we're not giving them to everybody. Maybe we are trying to give them to as many people as possible.

1432
02:25:35,580 --> 02:25:39,930
Again, it would be a great thing to to to try to assess can we really assess it?

1433
02:25:39,930 --> 02:25:44,340
Is it worth even the cost that it would take to try to ask people about their experiences with us?

1434
02:25:44,850 --> 02:25:48,690
Open questions in my work we did was kind of done. It was all implementation.

1435
02:25:48,870 --> 02:25:51,920
Did you get four dozen cards and I'm still the Internet?

1436
02:25:51,930 --> 02:25:58,340
No, because there are about 200 of them in office as opposed to passing because I don't know what to do with it.

1437
02:25:58,350 --> 02:26:05,490
There was not a protocol or guidelines that are going to give you all, you know, a good answer here.

1438
02:26:06,090 --> 02:26:10,920
But I'm in the bathroom. Like, what am I doing around campus? You know, you might be walking around in a skirt.

1439
02:26:12,390 --> 02:26:18,300
Somebody's an intern? Yes, that's me. Or it's a white font on a bright colored.

1440
02:26:18,570 --> 02:26:22,020
Well, I'm gonna bring it down next week, and you got to see what you have.

1441
02:26:22,020 --> 02:26:25,190
What's a tangible things in your hand, you know, putting you on notice.

1442
02:26:25,950 --> 02:26:29,020
All right, well, we're not. Yeah, yeah, but right now.

1443
02:26:29,630 --> 02:26:35,150
At home. So some kind of intimate partner violence stuff.

1444
02:26:35,450 --> 02:26:41,420
We just actually kind of wrapped up this project with some folks from Wayne State University and now Joanne's at Michigan State University.

1445
02:26:41,780 --> 02:26:46,879
Well, that's kind of cool because, you know, two or three or four years ago, this idea of electronic dating,

1446
02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:52,910
of dating violence was starting to gain some recognition as an out of a pretty widespread problem.

1447
02:26:53,180 --> 02:26:55,460
So we find out that young people,

1448
02:26:56,090 --> 02:27:04,700
emerging adults as well as I don't wanna spend a lot of time engaging in electronic relationships that might not have been true in the past.

1449
02:27:05,570 --> 02:27:14,540
And are we are people using those online modalities to perpetrate some of the same sort of violence that we might see in person?

1450
02:27:14,840 --> 02:27:16,340
I'm going to be physical.

1451
02:27:16,820 --> 02:27:22,640
I mean, not in the same way that we think about it, but we think about psychological, emotional violence that can very easily happen online.

1452
02:27:22,760 --> 02:27:25,760
Right. You can use coercive or controlling behaviors online.

1453
02:27:26,180 --> 02:27:27,770
Where are you? Let me look at your phone.

1454
02:27:28,400 --> 02:27:32,660
Do you find my friend so that I can understand where you're you know, that you're coming through your home, whatever else it might be.

1455
02:27:33,020 --> 02:27:36,860
So we were surprised at the number of people who experienced it.

1456
02:27:36,950 --> 02:27:41,809
And a number of, you know, this is mostly adolescents, but then also the number of people who endorse.

1457
02:27:41,810 --> 02:27:43,610
Yes, I do some of these things sometimes.

1458
02:27:44,030 --> 02:27:51,530
And again, if I just asked, you know, and I said, what are, you know, a few different examples of online dating perpetration or violence,

1459
02:27:51,830 --> 02:27:56,330
you might be able to list them off or you might start to think, okay, I have some basic ideas.

1460
02:27:56,570 --> 02:28:05,330
And how does that map on to the way the questions that we might ask within the survey, how we're kind of defining the conflict?

1461
02:28:05,660 --> 02:28:12,170
Is that consistent with what Sarah might say is examples of abusive or violent relationships?

1462
02:28:14,420 --> 02:28:23,659
So from a serving, as was happened right here in southeast Michigan, 33% have reported electronic harassment and 17% reported stalking.

1463
02:28:23,660 --> 02:28:27,410
So stalking is one that we that we have seen kind of increase.

1464
02:28:27,970 --> 02:28:34,250
Of course, if sexting with texting, asking for pictures, sending pictures, all these things that folks might see within media.

1465
02:28:34,460 --> 02:28:39,530
Another one are some terms that I'm too old to know about but are starting to make their big return.

1466
02:28:39,950 --> 02:28:48,020
Was the ghosting gaslighting? And they weren't around when I was an adolescent, I'm sure, and maybe they were around, but I understand what they were.

1467
02:28:48,740 --> 02:28:55,490
I'm starting to understand them now. But are they forms of victimization or psychological abuse that we need to understand,

1468
02:28:55,490 --> 02:29:02,930
particularly in the context of electrical relationships when you go, Wow.

1469
02:29:03,530 --> 02:29:07,700
So adolescence don't define identity in our own kind of needs assessment.

1470
02:29:07,700 --> 02:29:12,770
They talk about it as a way that they can be they can be injurious to their partners.

1471
02:29:14,510 --> 02:29:19,370
They can hurt their feelings. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's right.

1472
02:29:19,550 --> 02:29:25,740
That makes sense. I'm sorry. My question I can ask you,

1473
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:33,680
had you help me write out how the questions were worded so that there is I can terminology

1474
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:38,760
that they're using so that a lot of people are not necessarily right or simply sexting.

1475
02:29:38,890 --> 02:29:47,030
Right. Right. Yeah. Or even like stalking, you know, that that can be defined as we live in a lifetime.

1476
02:29:47,240 --> 02:29:49,399
Yeah. And it's a tricky one.

1477
02:29:49,400 --> 02:29:55,940
So we try to do to a point where we might kind of call the academic language in the stand, but then also provide an example.

1478
02:29:56,570 --> 02:30:01,720
So it might say, you know, share an email and repeatedly check up on your partner,

1479
02:30:02,210 --> 02:30:07,700
ask for their location, ask who they're with, you know, some of those type of things.

1480
02:30:09,140 --> 02:30:12,260
Text, you know, all the time or something like that.

1481
02:30:12,260 --> 02:30:19,130
And the thing is, in some cases, what some adolescents are useful say is more normative.

1482
02:30:19,490 --> 02:30:26,420
Others will say, this is not my experience. And so therefore I don't think of it as, you know, kind of a dating back to stay at home orders.

1483
02:30:27,020 --> 02:30:32,270
The texting is a big one. Like, what's the range of text that you might expect to receive from your partner in a day?

1484
02:30:32,810 --> 02:30:36,740
Anything from almost nothing to some people are just texting a lot.

1485
02:30:37,640 --> 02:30:41,620
And so you do that first in the survey, like you say, let's say narrative,

1486
02:30:42,020 --> 02:30:45,580
that was more of a needs assessment before we feel that the survey to try to understand

1487
02:30:45,600 --> 02:30:49,130
what kind of arrangements quote unquote you want and that's a limitation already.

1488
02:30:49,400 --> 02:30:52,850
Hopefully that's why you were nominated for this. Absolutely.

1489
02:30:52,850 --> 02:31:01,610
Fair question. I could this. So this one was largely kind of a secondary data analysis.

1490
02:31:01,910 --> 02:31:04,670
I'm sorry for just plastering my names onto this study,

1491
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:09,080
but the idea was to try to understand whether or not we could find different patterns of dating violence.

1492
02:31:09,360 --> 02:31:13,670
Like, what does this look like in practice for folks? Can we put people into in the big.

1493
02:31:13,880 --> 02:31:18,230
The big question is a lot of a lot of adolescent relationships.

1494
02:31:18,860 --> 02:31:23,450
There is both perpetration and victimization perpetration from.

1495
02:31:25,370 --> 02:31:28,370
And as we get kind of older kind of developmental age,

1496
02:31:29,090 --> 02:31:36,920
those those those results start to change or the types of perpetration of the types of victimization start to look a little bit different.

1497
02:31:37,700 --> 02:31:44,660
But there's still fairly large numbers, even as early as kind of sixth grade, seventh grade, at least in the sample.

1498
02:31:45,020 --> 02:31:48,320
So we were trying to understand what those patterns looked like and how they changed over time.

1499
02:31:48,620 --> 02:31:54,740
So we're using some different analytic techniques to try to identify some subpopulations and how they might change.

1500
02:31:55,040 --> 02:32:00,409
Are you consistently a victim and are you or consistently a perpetrator?

1501
02:32:00,410 --> 02:32:03,620
Are you involved in a relationship where both are happening?

1502
02:32:03,870 --> 02:32:07,670
We're also interested to know whether or not this kind of leads into the physical space.

1503
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:16,250
So what comes first? Because oftentimes people would tell us that if they were victimized in person, they're often victimized online and vice versa.

1504
02:32:16,670 --> 02:32:20,629
So trying to understand a little bit more about does it begin with and all the small

1505
02:32:20,630 --> 02:32:24,680
things online and then ultimately lead to what can be kind of physical perpetration?

1506
02:32:26,990 --> 02:32:34,130
And then always good to think about. Are there some things that we can do that might lead to sort of interventions?

1507
02:32:42,470 --> 02:32:46,310
See here for the text. I'm trying to think. We'll see what I can tell you about this.

1508
02:32:48,170 --> 02:32:59,210
I mean, you're going to result in hurdles. So we were so we were able to identify some of the patterns of victimization that we saw.

1509
02:33:01,070 --> 02:33:05,850
I think if you're interested, I took a look at the paper.

1510
02:33:08,390 --> 02:33:17,780
But what I want folks to realize is that, you know, there still can be kind of an epidemiological component to what we do.

1511
02:33:18,140 --> 02:33:22,640
And so trying to understand what this might look like from a sample data from southeast Michigan.

1512
02:33:23,720 --> 02:33:27,050
But, you know, does that extrapolate to other populations?

1513
02:33:27,320 --> 02:33:32,240
How might this group of six through 12th graders look the same or different from other

1514
02:33:32,240 --> 02:33:36,920
adolescents who could experience dating violence as either happening online or in person?

1515
02:33:37,970 --> 02:33:43,400
I will say that one of the things that we heard that did surprise us was that in most of these versus general relationships.

1516
02:33:44,030 --> 02:33:52,250
But the the the dual direction in terms of victimization perpetration and the severity of victimization perpetration was what was quite different.

1517
02:33:52,610 --> 02:33:57,200
So looking at the control tactic scales, the more severe forms were perpetrated by males.

1518
02:33:58,190 --> 02:34:05,370
But the rates of less severe kind of perpetration were about 50% relationships.

1519
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:13,700
It's kind of like behavioral psychology. I don't know how much of you.

1520
02:34:14,620 --> 02:34:17,890
Domestic violence. That's what this is about. Yeah.

1521
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:22,300
So let's say here is development leagues.

1522
02:34:23,170 --> 02:34:26,200
Like they don't know how to deal with their feelings.

1523
02:34:26,980 --> 02:34:35,500
Like, I know a lot of it's verbal, too. Mm hmm. Oh, you know, one of your first love or whatever is super intense and like.

1524
02:34:36,800 --> 02:34:40,880
Is that is that violence or is it like the road?

1525
02:34:42,530 --> 02:34:45,710
Yeah. Yeah, it's a fair description.

1526
02:34:45,950 --> 02:34:49,980
I don't want to make sure anyone else has a chance if anybody wants to respond to Ron.

1527
02:34:50,660 --> 02:34:56,770
Yeah. Carolyn's question. Yeah. Yeah. And you have to consider how you socialize.

1528
02:34:58,880 --> 02:35:07,400
So I wouldn't necessarily say you don't need to tell your parents that they're going to have violent actions or behaviors.

1529
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:16,280
But if they're socialized to cope with their feelings and not knowing how to address their feelings in ways that are nonviolent,

1530
02:35:16,280 --> 02:35:22,990
then then it is going to happen. That is happening.

1531
02:35:23,860 --> 02:35:29,090
Think what you're seeing from other people and they haven't had time to parse out what socialization.

1532
02:35:29,900 --> 02:35:33,910
Their dream and what they want to actually. Right.

1533
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:40,329
So I agree with that, Victor. So there is out there's a true or a pretty extensively documented kind of intergenerational

1534
02:35:40,330 --> 02:35:46,630
transport component that if some violent behaviors involved in parent or caregiver relationships,

1535
02:35:47,300 --> 02:35:56,900
then there's an internalization of conflict resolution tactics that can manifest in your parents exact date.

1536
02:35:56,950 --> 02:36:00,070
If you see that your parents, you know, show the screen.

1537
02:36:00,730 --> 02:36:05,970
And that's the way that you can resolve an issue. And it's more likely that you're going to do the same thing in some of your relationships.

1538
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:09,430
Not always. Okay. And that's one of the questions that we've tried to answer, too.

1539
02:36:09,460 --> 02:36:14,650
Like if you saw, for example, you know, parental or caregiver relationships where there's physical abuse,

1540
02:36:14,860 --> 02:36:20,979
would you be less likely to engage in the same thing or be victimized in the same way?

1541
02:36:20,980 --> 02:36:23,860
It's just going to be a bit more logical 30 years down the road,

1542
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:30,070
a pretty high correlation between experience in their house and what they experience in their own relationship.

1543
02:36:30,490 --> 02:36:33,250
So it does seem to be something that kind of reinforces itself.

1544
02:36:34,540 --> 02:36:41,679
And then we try to think through about why that's the case without we want to move away from any form of victim blaming.

1545
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:47,050
But why is it that people who come from a household as their structural determinants or the other sort of contextual factors,

1546
02:36:47,530 --> 02:36:53,799
you know, it's not because, you know, they abuse alcohol or they're select on furniture that's trying to move away from those things,

1547
02:36:53,800 --> 02:36:57,670
even though that's what's often measured and considered as a potential explanation.

1548
02:36:58,030 --> 02:37:03,490
But what are some of the other mechanisms that might reinforce those those in those relationships?

1549
02:37:04,660 --> 02:37:13,020
I'm sorry. My impression. Right. Is usually consider how reactionary abuse.

1550
02:37:15,330 --> 02:37:20,950
It's like life threatening to post pictures and stuff or other members, which is their reaction.

1551
02:37:21,900 --> 02:37:30,629
How like a partner who's experienced some type of abuse for long periods of time sort of

1552
02:37:30,630 --> 02:37:36,300
wears that to their back to their partner or potentially to other people or their wives.

1553
02:37:37,800 --> 02:37:46,200
Yeah. So we we did look for kind of congruence between the behaviors across across periods because this was a longitudinal study.

1554
02:37:46,200 --> 02:37:50,099
So we got eye for different times. So if I'm understanding your question,

1555
02:37:50,100 --> 02:37:55,950
like would somebody who experienced whatever a name calling or whatever at a time

1556
02:37:55,950 --> 02:37:59,669
one be more likely going to say that they perpetrated name calling a time to?

1557
02:37:59,670 --> 02:38:06,420
Is that kind of what you're saying or experience it again? Yeah. I mean, just like if you considered it in the study to account for that.

1558
02:38:07,680 --> 02:38:14,069
Yeah. So yeah. And that's, you know, and its own kind of fancy way and it wasn't especially effective,

1559
02:38:14,070 --> 02:38:22,590
but to try to tease out what some of those patterns look like, do you see that relationships kind of one.

1560
02:38:22,590 --> 02:38:25,440
Does the severity of violence start to escalate over time?

1561
02:38:26,310 --> 02:38:34,320
Does do we start to see again both partners engaging in the behavior and then even what are some of the little subsets of behavior?

1562
02:38:34,320 --> 02:38:40,170
And we found that was one of the bigger findings is that there were these different kinds of electronic dating violence clusters,

1563
02:38:40,500 --> 02:38:47,520
and they were around coercion, they were around monitoring, less so around like the explicit images and stuff like that.

1564
02:38:48,010 --> 02:38:53,580
Those weren't but those often those explicit, sexually explicit images and texting and stuff like that,

1565
02:38:53,910 --> 02:38:56,610
those kind of do cluster pretty highly with physical perpetration.

1566
02:38:57,150 --> 02:39:02,550
So trying to work through some of the different ways that violence can manifest within these relationships.

1567
02:39:02,910 --> 02:39:11,610
And can you use fancy person centered statistical techniques to look into the data in ways that you couldn't just on?

1568
02:39:12,270 --> 02:39:14,520
So I don't know if it's quite answer, and of course,

1569
02:39:14,520 --> 02:39:21,179
I don't know if we really saw the the strong kind of controller behavior correlation across the times.

1570
02:39:21,180 --> 02:39:25,590
But it would be an interesting thing that's being hard to measure.

1571
02:39:28,890 --> 02:39:32,370
But there again, you have, you know, a list of behaviors.

1572
02:39:32,550 --> 02:39:38,130
You have relationships, you have people going in and out of behavior relationships, which makes for an analytical challenge.

1573
02:39:38,400 --> 02:39:41,729
We have four ways of data. It was an accelerated longitudinal design.

1574
02:39:41,730 --> 02:39:46,290
So you actually had to cause one sixth graders, one ninth graders for years.

1575
02:39:46,290 --> 02:39:49,020
So you can cover the whole sixth through 12th grade spectrum.

1576
02:39:49,680 --> 02:39:56,700
So you can use different methodological procedures to allow you to answer, for example, a developmental question.

1577
02:39:57,510 --> 02:40:03,060
And if you don't have a designer's pulse, so it's a statistician, so you're not going to blame me.

1578
02:40:03,570 --> 02:40:06,220
But interesting way to, again, kind of think about, you know,

1579
02:40:06,240 --> 02:40:09,780
what might be happening in the last one I'm going to talk about long because unfortunately,

1580
02:40:09,780 --> 02:40:15,180
I think this is the most interesting damn thing that we didn't get to, didn't get to evaluate.

1581
02:40:16,050 --> 02:40:18,810
But part of the injury center in Oregon,

1582
02:40:19,470 --> 02:40:27,300
they were they had a lot of policy that that schools had to implement some form of teen dating violence program.

1583
02:40:27,750 --> 02:40:31,170
And Oregon wanted us to and we might still have to do this.

1584
02:40:31,170 --> 02:40:37,590
Kobe happened, so we didn't get a real chance to look at it to see how widely things schools implemented these these policies.

1585
02:40:37,590 --> 02:40:41,840
And what stinks is that the law says you got to do it, but that's kind of the end of it.

1586
02:40:42,330 --> 02:40:48,450
Right. So think about what Sara said around the are we just checking a box here or are we making an intentional effort to

1587
02:40:48,450 --> 02:40:53,279
make sure that there's some teen dating violence programs that are happening in our schools and how can we assess it?

1588
02:40:53,280 --> 02:40:59,760
And I think if we had more time, I would give you just a minute or two to think through your my position.

1589
02:40:59,970 --> 02:41:04,050
What would you do? What do you call maybe this is a good reflection question for you.

1590
02:41:04,950 --> 02:41:05,940
How would you change?

1591
02:41:06,060 --> 02:41:12,750
How would you tell me whether or not a policy that was implemented in 2018 and a state, Oregon, that's somewhere over on the West Coast.

1592
02:41:12,750 --> 02:41:17,730
Right. Whether or not it's working zero venting defense, what metrics might you look at?

1593
02:41:18,120 --> 02:41:23,400
What school do you think would be most important to try to assess? What kind of analysis would you run?

1594
02:41:23,970 --> 02:41:27,840
Those are the kind of blank slate slate questions that are fun in our world.

1595
02:41:27,840 --> 02:41:34,110
When we have a partner say, this is happening, what can we do to know if it's working right?

1596
02:41:34,410 --> 02:41:38,910
So you get to be creative in terms of how you would say, all right, well, this is what the law says.

1597
02:41:39,090 --> 02:41:42,989
This is what the policy needs to be. How am I going to tell you whether or not this was a good idea?

1598
02:41:42,990 --> 02:41:49,040
And in fact, the state of Montana and the state in Michigan, it's given zero all the states and other policies very similar to this.

1599
02:41:56,680 --> 02:42:00,600
I got 30 minutes and we had a guy here.

1600
02:42:00,610 --> 02:42:05,709
Can we talk to you about an assignment? But the only reason is because it's not everyone else.

1601
02:42:05,710 --> 02:42:11,200
Like, I want to go home. So, folks, there's this last weekend for me for a loop.

1602
02:42:11,830 --> 02:42:18,580
We're farther into the semester, which is great because I'm so good with your questions and the discussion.

1603
02:42:18,580 --> 02:42:22,690
I. This was originally supposed to be doing like two weeks.

1604
02:42:23,230 --> 02:42:27,010
I think you could do it in two weeks, but I don't want to make this, like, a super stressful thing.

1605
02:42:27,490 --> 02:42:33,460
Now, I know folks also don't like it when faculty change assignment due dates in the middle of semester.

1606
02:42:34,240 --> 02:42:41,020
But that said, I would rather you be able to take a little extra time if you want to do this assignment as well as you want,

1607
02:42:41,350 --> 02:42:47,410
versus let's try to rush through this. But again, I do think you are absolutely capable of completing an assignment in a couple of weeks.

1608
02:42:47,620 --> 02:42:53,230
But I have moved that assignment critique date back to October 20th, three weeks instead of the 13th.

1609
02:42:53,740 --> 02:43:01,060
The reason being is, again, just to give you a little bit more time to if you want to use one of the articles that I provide,

1610
02:43:01,330 --> 02:43:04,180
or if you would like to identify an article of your own.

1611
02:43:04,240 --> 02:43:10,060
So for example, Sara, I asked her if we could use her intervention article as a potential option.

1612
02:43:10,330 --> 02:43:14,530
She said yes, and she also said she'd be willing to talk to folks if they had some follow up questions about it.

1613
02:43:14,920 --> 02:43:18,160
And the whole point of this assignment you've done a thousand times is to critique an article.

1614
02:43:19,240 --> 02:43:23,950
I just want you to start bringing those brains to this question of, okay, here's an intervention.

1615
02:43:24,310 --> 02:43:29,440
What do I think of what I'm going to push you to do, though? Do not talk so much about the substantive intervention.

1616
02:43:29,860 --> 02:43:34,270
Because oftentimes that's not where I get to have my my influence.

1617
02:43:34,840 --> 02:43:45,069
My job is to evaluate, to assess, to to think through to the validity of the data and to try to make a case for or against what the authors decided,

1618
02:43:45,070 --> 02:43:47,140
where their own kind of recommendations are conclusions.

1619
02:43:47,680 --> 02:43:55,270
So I'm not going to ask you to talk as much about the design of an intervention, although I'm happy to have folks comment on that, too.

1620
02:43:55,660 --> 02:43:57,940
But it's a little harder to break it down to critique an article.

1621
02:43:57,940 --> 02:44:02,470
If you say, well, if I had if I was going to design this intervention, I would do this instead.

1622
02:44:03,070 --> 02:44:06,330
That's not what I want you to think about, given the design that they provide,

1623
02:44:06,340 --> 02:44:09,820
given the program that they're implementing, as problematic as it might be.

1624
02:44:10,300 --> 02:44:15,580
What do you think about the way it was assessed? What do you think about the results where you think you might do differently?

1625
02:44:15,910 --> 02:44:20,050
How would you take this evidence? Does it make a case that it not make a case?

1626
02:44:20,410 --> 02:44:23,620
Those are the types of things that I want folks to do bring to this assignment.

1627
02:44:24,490 --> 02:44:29,800
This is from just our class. In terms of what I'm asking you to do.

1628
02:44:30,100 --> 02:44:32,920
This is just the word to motivate the assignment. I'm not going to reinforce it.

1629
02:44:33,700 --> 02:44:39,700
But the basic idea is I want you to be interventionist, that every developing intervention, testing intervention,

1630
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:47,800
that you're trying to scale the intervention or a policy, your own intervention, to be able to critique an article, to critique some science.

1631
02:44:48,250 --> 02:44:51,520
That's where what we got here.

1632
02:44:52,630 --> 02:44:57,730
She's an article about canvas. There are three articles of varying quality in my own opinion,

1633
02:44:58,420 --> 02:45:01,800
but usually if I post an article up on campuses because I think there's something wrong,

1634
02:45:02,740 --> 02:45:06,190
there's a flaw that I think you can pull it right if it's a perfect article.

1635
02:45:07,780 --> 02:45:16,180
And I said, You're perfect. I am super, super happy and excited to invite you to find an alternative to the three that I've tried to create already.

1636
02:45:16,960 --> 02:45:24,520
We'd love to see some all of some some other options on interventions that have been written up and as you might have some thoughts about that.

1637
02:45:24,520 --> 02:45:27,909
So you do not have to use one of the three that are up on canvas.

1638
02:45:27,910 --> 02:45:35,350
But if you want, you are welcome to use any of those. I'm looking for just five, six pages.

1639
02:45:35,920 --> 02:45:42,489
I'm thinking that's an eight for most of you. I do more, but it's double, double spaced.

1640
02:45:42,490 --> 02:45:50,080
Yeah. So let's see. I mean, I know we're talking like 4 hours or I said for 40 minutes, take your time, but you need to.

1641
02:45:50,260 --> 02:45:56,770
And even if these dates that I've thrown out there are too much for a difficult semester, I'm happy to think about it because.

1642
02:45:56,770 --> 02:46:03,879
Because I'm changing this date and I know people get mad when February change dates because it's now due to 20th instead of the 13th,

1643
02:46:03,880 --> 02:46:06,710
like it says on the syllabus. I'll tell you what. I'll read it for you.

1644
02:46:06,970 --> 02:46:10,660
I'll give you some initial feedback if you send it to me before the proposed due date.

1645
02:46:10,900 --> 02:46:13,990
And then you can make some revisions based on anything that I to do.

1646
02:46:14,020 --> 02:46:19,000
I'm not going to tell you every single thing I think might be changed, but I'll just give you some ideas to make sure that you're on the right track.

1647
02:46:19,900 --> 02:46:25,690
I might throw some questions out there that you can either expand upon or not, but really, I want this more to be, again, conversational.

1648
02:46:26,140 --> 02:46:30,610
And you're all at the University of Michigan. You're all graduate undergraduate.

1649
02:46:30,820 --> 02:46:32,050
You've done these things before.

1650
02:46:32,500 --> 02:46:38,110
I'm just more interested in what you want to bring to the table in terms of thinking about how these people are moving experience for me.

1651
02:46:38,260 --> 02:46:42,460
Okay, so let's make it more of an interaction rather than a this is what you've done wrong.

1652
02:46:43,240 --> 02:46:44,470
But that's my goal here.

1653
02:46:47,950 --> 02:46:54,130
I do try to give you a nice little guideline and the actual assignment itself in terms of these are the sections that I want to see.

1654
02:46:54,580 --> 02:46:57,940
So can you just give me a brief set? Summary of what the article is in its main findings.

1655
02:46:59,950 --> 02:47:04,780
These pieces, I think, are super relevant to what we talked about these first five weeks of the semester.

1656
02:47:05,260 --> 02:47:11,710
Who who are we talking about here? And why does that make a difference, especially when we get to those applications and discussions?

1657
02:47:11,950 --> 02:47:16,000
Does the who of the intervention have any sort of implications?

1658
02:47:16,810 --> 02:47:22,210
Data collected in measurement. Again, I'm hearing these things when folks are asking questions, which is fabulous.

1659
02:47:22,630 --> 02:47:27,800
What did they pull out? When you think about my own assessment of electronic dating violence.

1660
02:47:28,060 --> 02:47:32,860
Does that map on to your understanding of what a dating violence is and what it would look like in an online space?

1661
02:47:33,130 --> 02:47:36,070
We make a goof here. Would you suggest something a little bit different?

1662
02:47:36,670 --> 02:47:41,170
Was there any form of design that might have influenced how this measurement has happened?

1663
02:47:41,230 --> 02:47:42,850
Do we have repeated measurements that we have?

1664
02:47:43,480 --> 02:47:50,350
And I'm not saying that everybody or I'm not expecting everyone to have taken really be programing valid or research methods,

1665
02:47:50,740 --> 02:47:54,520
but I'm hoping folks at least have a general sense of the research process.

1666
02:47:55,300 --> 02:48:00,420
If you don't shoot me a note and I'm happy to talk through or if you want, we can spend some class time going through,

1667
02:48:00,730 --> 02:48:04,930
what does it mean to have a study with higher external our internal validity?

1668
02:48:05,500 --> 02:48:08,560
What does it mean to have different sampling strategies?

1669
02:48:08,860 --> 02:48:12,220
Random sample versus convenience sample versus cluster sample.

1670
02:48:13,700 --> 02:48:19,150
Are these things that we know? I'm like, Okay, now that's okay.

1671
02:48:19,180 --> 02:48:24,130
That's absolutely okay. So I will. I will how I think about this.

1672
02:48:24,730 --> 02:48:27,310
Maybe we can spend a little bit of time in the next week or two.

1673
02:48:27,670 --> 02:48:33,970
We can dedicate a little bit of our time to what are some of the key aspects of our research design that you wanted to attend to.

1674
02:48:34,780 --> 02:48:39,320
It might be a little bit of a just like a glossary.

1675
02:48:39,620 --> 02:48:46,030
Oh, yeah, it actually is on a of concern. I have. I got my own internal point of view and other people can use as a covered externality.

1676
02:48:46,270 --> 02:48:48,309
Now what we can do is we can even make it at the end of a session.

1677
02:48:48,310 --> 02:48:52,680
So like the last half an hour, over one of our days, and then folks are already comfortable with material that is gone.

1678
02:48:53,410 --> 02:48:56,660
Everybody else gets to hang out here all day class.

1679
02:48:56,680 --> 02:49:02,580
All right. So study design again, just talked about this, but really, this is where I want you to go.

1680
02:49:02,590 --> 02:49:06,580
I mean, this is where you should be spending most of your time based on all of the evidence presented.

1681
02:49:08,020 --> 02:49:13,239
What are you going to do? Do you feel like this is a strength?

1682
02:49:13,240 --> 02:49:16,240
Do you feel like there are limitations? Do you feel like you can move forward?

1683
02:49:16,480 --> 02:49:22,120
What are some of the gaps that you would try to fill if you were just have to continue this work because this is where we're going to be coming from.

1684
02:49:22,450 --> 02:49:27,310
Hey, I just read an exciting your article about intimate partner violence.

1685
02:49:27,520 --> 02:49:31,360
I think in my organization we can build off this by doing what?

1686
02:49:31,900 --> 02:49:36,459
And if we do what, how are we going to make sure that piece of it is moving?

1687
02:49:36,460 --> 02:49:41,890
There are those for coming forward or are we just going to replicate or are we going to try to expand?

1688
02:49:42,370 --> 02:49:46,510
What are some of the things that we can take from your articles to inform that conversation?

1689
02:49:49,390 --> 02:49:53,000
Okay. Awesome. All right.

1690
02:49:53,020 --> 02:49:56,860
I do apologize for the timing. I should have introduced this last week.

1691
02:49:56,860 --> 02:50:02,919
So you would have had a little bit more time. Let me know. I do understand that people kind of map out their semester of assignments and stuff.

1692
02:50:02,920 --> 02:50:06,100
And I don't want you to feel like you're getting the short shrift because of the assignment page.

1693
02:50:06,460 --> 02:50:12,370
So, you know, if you are concerned about this person at any point, if you have some questions, let me know, too.

1694
02:50:12,640 --> 02:50:17,560
I'm happy to have some conversation about it. If you have an article that you're thinking about, including instead of one of the three that I have.

1695
02:50:17,830 --> 02:50:22,060
Send it to me. I'll look at it when you are looking at a client and tell you I think this works or not.

1696
02:50:22,390 --> 02:50:25,780
Okay. All right, folks. Have a great weekend.

1697
02:50:28,360 --> 02:50:57,660
Yeah. Well.
