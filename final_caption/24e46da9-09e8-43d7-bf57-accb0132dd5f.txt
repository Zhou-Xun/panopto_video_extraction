1
00:00:00,253 --> 00:00:06,253
All right, so welcome to this online quizzing with canvas session.

2
00:00:06,253 --> 00:00:13,253
Again, we're recording so we can share it with anyone who joins us late or has to leave early.

3
00:00:13,253 --> 00:00:19,253
And we'll be going over a lot of the features within the canvas quiz tool.

4
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:27,253
But how you put those together for your specific needs is going to be different for everyone and every course.

5
00:00:27,253 --> 00:00:36,253
So feel free at any time. I put our email address on here, sph dot instruction at umich dot edu.

6
00:00:36,253 --> 00:00:47,253
In case you'd like one on one consultation to figure out what's the best combination of all of these settings and features for your use case.

7
00:00:47,253 --> 00:00:55,253
As we get started, I do have my chat window open on a second screen, so feel free to post questions there.

8
00:00:55,253 --> 00:01:03,253
And we're a small group, so feel free to unseat your microphone and interrupt me with a question if you want me to stop.

9
00:01:03,253 --> 00:01:10,253
I've also enabled the live transcript for this session.

10
00:01:10,253 --> 00:01:23,253
Or I will enable the live transcript. So you should have the ability to.

11
00:01:23,253 --> 00:01:37,253
You should now see a live transcript button in your resume toolbar in case you would like to follow along with a subtitle during the session.

12
00:01:37,253 --> 00:01:50,253
All right, I'm just going to take a quick peek at our pull over here. All right.

13
00:01:50,253 --> 00:01:59,253
So the topics we're going to cover and not necessarily in this order are going to be quiz types,

14
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:07,253
the settings available moderation, which is how you give accommodations to students.

15
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:17,253
The question types grading your quizzes, and we're gonna talk a little bit about academic integrity and proctoring.

16
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:29,253
In fact, I'll go ahead and start there just briefly, some sort of strategies for promoting academic integrity would be on on the instructor end,

17
00:02:29,253 --> 00:02:34,253
perhaps reposting the academic integrity information that's in your syllabus,

18
00:02:34,253 --> 00:02:40,253
offering study materials and review sessions to reduce that test anxiety so that students

19
00:02:40,253 --> 00:02:49,253
won't feel tempted or anxious and nervous about the tests to seek out help elsewhere.

20
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:56,253
You might consider restructuring the impact of your grade. And this is particularly if your quizzes are sort of multiple choice questions,

21
00:02:56,253 --> 00:03:06,253
which are potentially more vulnerable to students cheating and getting assistance from classmates, perhaps waiting, you know,

22
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:15,253
the final grade for the course, perhaps waiting things like papers or group projects or presentations a little heavier,

23
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:21,253
where those are activities where students are demonstrating their knowledge.

24
00:03:21,253 --> 00:03:28,253
Maybe change your questions up so that they're asking students to apply and demonstrate knowledge.

25
00:03:28,253 --> 00:03:33,253
And then with the features of canvas, some things you could utilize our time restrictions.

26
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:43,253
We'll talk about those some randomization options so that there's some unique uniqueness to each students.

27
00:03:43,253 --> 00:03:50,253
Individual quiz. And then there's there's a couple of ways that you might accidentally give away the answers.

28
00:03:50,253 --> 00:03:54,253
We'll try to flag those as they come up.

29
00:03:54,253 --> 00:04:05,253
We do have access to some puckering options or strategies, starting with the most flexible would be to have your class that's meeting remotely.

30
00:04:05,253 --> 00:04:13,253
I'll take the quiz together over Zoom. Keep in mind, you may have students that are in different time zones.

31
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:19,253
And so this may not be the easiest thing to coordinate. Or maybe you're giving in on a couple of different times.

32
00:04:19,253 --> 00:04:26,253
But that's something where there's a lot of flexibility for students to be able to use notes.

33
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:34,253
Or maybe you give them more time or things like that. You can deal with issues as they come up and questions as they come up.

34
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:38,253
Secondly, there's a tool called Responder's Lockdown Browser, the School of Public Health.

35
00:04:38,253 --> 00:04:45,253
We don't have our own license for this, but we've been working with the School of Nursing.

36
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:50,253
And this would be students actually install a browser.

37
00:04:50,253 --> 00:04:58,253
This browser on their own computer, which kind of locks their computer down from being able to open up other applications,

38
00:04:58,253 --> 00:05:02,253
go to other Web sites, take screenshots, things like that.

39
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:06,253
But keep in mind, that only really manages the machine they're using.

40
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:12,253
There's nothing to prevent them from picking up a phone and searching or picking a screenshot.

41
00:05:12,253 --> 00:05:19,253
So we don't necessarily have a magic bullet for this. But these are some options.

42
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:26,253
And then sort of the least flexible, most structured proctoring option is through a company called Proctor You.

43
00:05:26,253 --> 00:05:29,253
This is we do have a license for this.

44
00:05:29,253 --> 00:05:41,253
This is used in our online Masters program where students set an appointment to take their exam and actually connect with a live proctor.

45
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:46,253
And that Proctor does a series of steps like verifying their identity.

46
00:05:46,253 --> 00:05:54,253
They have to show ID. They have to turn their webcam to show their test space in the room.

47
00:05:54,253 --> 00:06:03,253
And then the proctor actually remotes into the student's computer to unlock the exam with a password.

48
00:06:03,253 --> 00:06:12,253
And so while we use this in the online programs, some feedback we've gotten in the residential courses is that this feels very invasive.

49
00:06:12,253 --> 00:06:21,253
But these are options for things if you're thinking about offering proctoring.

50
00:06:21,253 --> 00:06:33,253
All right. Let's get into the canvas stuff. So the quiz types are going to be that you can choose from our graded quiz, which is the standard.

51
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:43,253
You take the quiz, you get a grade. There's also a graded survey. And this would be an example of there's no right answer to a question.

52
00:06:43,253 --> 00:06:47,253
Maybe you're soliciting feedback, but students do get a grade.

53
00:06:47,253 --> 00:06:52,253
So there will be a grade book column associated with the survey with graded surveys.

54
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:56,253
Students get the full amount of points just for completing the survey.

55
00:06:56,253 --> 00:07:02,253
Whereas in a quiz, points are deducted for questions that get incorrect.

56
00:07:02,253 --> 00:07:07,253
The practice quiz would be they take a quiz where there are correct and incorrect answers.

57
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:14,253
But there's not a grade book column associated with this. This is just for practice. And they're not penalized.

58
00:07:14,253 --> 00:07:20,253
And then the ungraded survey would be, again, they give feedback.

59
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:26,253
This can be set to be a a mindset. And then there's no great book column associated with this.

60
00:07:26,253 --> 00:07:38,253
There's a different way you access those results. So setting your quiz type is basically the first question you get to when you create a new quiz.

61
00:07:38,253 --> 00:07:45,253
The settings is where you're going to go through and create your experience for your students.

62
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:51,253
What's the availability? What's the first date and time they can begin taking the quiz?

63
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:57,253
And then what's the if there's an if you want to set an end date where this quiz locks, you can't take it after that.

64
00:07:57,253 --> 00:08:04,253
And in fact, if you're in the quiz, actively taking it when that until date hits intellectually.

65
00:08:04,253 --> 00:08:11,253
Submit the quiz for you because you hit the deadline.

66
00:08:11,253 --> 00:08:19,253
Additionally, you can set a time limit, so perhaps your availability is it's open for three days,

67
00:08:19,253 --> 00:08:25,253
but once you begin taking it, you have 90 minutes or one hour.

68
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:32,253
With the availability, you might also, again, consider the time zone your students are in.

69
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:39,253
If you're providing a very narrow time of the availability, maybe an hour and a half, two hours.

70
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:45,253
Make sure you know that this is a reasonable time frame for all of your remote students.

71
00:08:45,253 --> 00:08:52,253
We wouldn't want somebody who's overseas that that timeframe is in the middle of the night.

72
00:08:52,253 --> 00:09:02,253
And you do have the ability to create different availability time slots for individuals if you need everyone who is in

73
00:09:02,253 --> 00:09:08,253
Michigan takes it during this timeframe and then maybe you've got a handful of students who are out of the country.

74
00:09:08,253 --> 00:09:19,253
But there's a overlapping timeframe that works for them. And so that opens up for them at a different time.

75
00:09:19,253 --> 00:09:24,253
You can allow students to take the quiz multiple times or just once.

76
00:09:24,253 --> 00:09:34,253
And so depending on the type of quiz, if this is just a pop quiz, a weekly quiz where the point is to get mastery, maybe the students take the quiz.

77
00:09:34,253 --> 00:09:40,253
They see the answers. What they got wrong and then they have an opportunity to take it again.

78
00:09:40,253 --> 00:09:47,253
But maybe for a midterm, it's one attempt. One of the checkbox settings is to shuffle answers.

79
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:56,253
So this would come into play in multiple choice and multiple answer questions where, you know, maybe.

80
00:09:56,253 --> 00:10:02,253
Answer a on question one. Isn't the same on everyone's quiz?

81
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:09,253
Maybe question or answer A is selection number C on somebody else's quiz.

82
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:19,253
So this is one option for creating that randomization. You can have the option to create a one question at a time.

83
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:24,253
So by default, the quiz is going to be on one page and student scroll up and down.

84
00:10:24,253 --> 00:10:30,253
They can even bookmark certain questions if they want to go back to them.

85
00:10:30,253 --> 00:10:35,253
But you can change it to one question at a time where students see one question and hit next.

86
00:10:35,253 --> 00:10:39,253
They answer a question and hit next along with that.

87
00:10:39,253 --> 00:10:44,253
You can restrict and not allow students to backtrack.

88
00:10:44,253 --> 00:10:54,253
So depending on what kind of experience you're trying to create for students and how structured you want to make that.

89
00:10:54,253 --> 00:11:02,253
Show responses are our students allowed to sort of review how they answered the questions after they complete the quiz?

90
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:04,253
Can they sort of review their answers?

91
00:11:04,253 --> 00:11:12,253
And then along with that, again, after they've completed the quiz, will they be allowed to see what the correct answer is?

92
00:11:12,253 --> 00:11:20,253
So, again, maybe in the scenario of a midterm or a final, they can't review what they answered and they can't see the correct answers.

93
00:11:20,253 --> 00:11:29,253
Maybe we'll go over that in class or set up office hours to go over that individually.

94
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:38,253
Any questions about these so far? I have a question.

95
00:11:38,253 --> 00:11:46,253
Sure. So as far as requiring, do you have to have a midterm or final?

96
00:11:46,253 --> 00:11:54,253
Or can we actually roll those into more of the papers and the pop quizzes and things like that?

97
00:11:54,253 --> 00:12:00,253
Yeah, I believe it's completely at the instructors discretion. OK.

98
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:05,253
Yep. I have midterms in mind just because that's that's slowly creeping up on us.

99
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:22,253
Yeah. Anything else before we move forward?

100
00:12:22,253 --> 00:12:31,253
All right. And there's a term with canvas quizzes called Moderate that's associated with the quizzes to moderate a quiz.

101
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:40,253
And what this means is to allow extra time to individual students or allow additional attempts.

102
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:45,253
So if you have students that, you know, need accommodations like extra time on a quiz,

103
00:12:45,253 --> 00:12:56,253
this is how you can give that to them on an individual level or a handful of students who need some flexibility around test taking.

104
00:12:56,253 --> 00:13:03,253
You can give them these accommodations.

105
00:13:03,253 --> 00:13:13,253
There is also a sort of forced submission option in moderate in the Cui's moderation, and that primarily comes into play.

106
00:13:13,253 --> 00:13:19,253
If there's an issue and you know, a student. Close the browser without submitting the quiz.

107
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:22,253
And it's kind of just hanging out there.

108
00:13:22,253 --> 00:13:30,253
You as the instructor would be able to see that in the moderate option and sort of go ahead and force submit it.

109
00:13:30,253 --> 00:13:33,253
That will allow you to see their score. You'll get a sense of how far they got.

110
00:13:33,253 --> 00:13:43,253
And then you can decide from there whether to work with them to have them take that again.

111
00:13:43,253 --> 00:13:48,253
So let's actually jump in to a canvas site and find where these are located.

112
00:13:48,253 --> 00:13:56,253
So. Let's switch over. To canvas.

113
00:13:56,253 --> 00:14:01,253
And I'm just. Any of our resilient teaching canvas site.

114
00:14:01,253 --> 00:14:05,253
And when I'm working with quizzes, I'm going to be in the quizzes menu of the course.

115
00:14:05,253 --> 00:14:13,253
And let me just bump that up a little bit. OK.

116
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:24,253
And in the upper right corner, I have a plus quiz. Buttons. So to create a new quiz, I'm going to click that.

117
00:14:24,253 --> 00:14:27,253
And here's where I'm going to make get to make some of those decisions that we talked about.

118
00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:34,253
I mean, a name may quiz. Let's say.

119
00:14:34,253 --> 00:14:39,253
One, I'm going to get to give some information about this quiz.

120
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:45,253
So things I would suggest are remind students how long they have to take it.

121
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:52,253
Be explicit about what resources they can use and cannot use to take this quiz.

122
00:14:52,253 --> 00:14:57,253
You know, if this was a practice quiz, it would be open book, open note, maybe.

123
00:14:57,253 --> 00:15:01,253
Again, this is a midterm, a final something a little more serious.

124
00:15:01,253 --> 00:15:08,253
It would be, you know, perhaps you want to give them more restrictions.

125
00:15:08,253 --> 00:15:15,253
Selm and a copy and paste. Just some example, quick instructions I have over here.

126
00:15:15,253 --> 00:15:23,253
So here I've just indicated. Here's what this quiz will cover.

127
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:28,253
It's closed book, closed note. I expect you to take this without assistance.

128
00:15:28,253 --> 00:15:33,253
You'll have one hour once you begin and then notify me.

129
00:15:33,253 --> 00:15:38,253
And I put my e-mail address if you run into any technical difficulties.

130
00:15:38,253 --> 00:15:48,253
So here just being sort of explicit about what I expect and how this is going to run, and they will be able to read this before they click the like.

131
00:15:48,253 --> 00:15:56,253
All right. Start test or start. Begin quiz. And you can put anything in here, you can link to documents in your course.

132
00:15:56,253 --> 00:16:06,253
So I have the full text editor tools. I can put an image, I could record a video that kind of gives us an overview of these things.

133
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:19,253
So anything you can put into a text editor, you could include here in these instructions that they can view before they begin.

134
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:26,253
So right here, this first question, this is where I get to choose my quiz type, my graded quizzes when it defaults to you.

135
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:32,253
But my practice quiz survey or the ungraded survey,

136
00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:41,253
I'm going to stick with the graded quiz because the features that appear down here change depending on whether it's graded or ungraded.

137
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:50,253
And then the survey versus quiz. Here's that shuffle answers which will affect really only the sort of multiple choice,

138
00:16:50,253 --> 00:16:56,253
multiple answer questions where I'm giving them a list of choices.

139
00:16:56,253 --> 00:17:02,253
And here's where I would set my time limit to checkbox. What did I say up here one hour?

140
00:17:02,253 --> 00:17:11,253
So 60 Minutes is the way Canvas wants to see it.

141
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:17,253
And then here's where I said multiple attempts, if I want to offer that fact, check this box.

142
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:24,253
I get to see Kim is wants to know. Out of all the attempts, which score should they keep?

143
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:30,253
Should they keep the highest? The latest? Or an average?

144
00:17:30,253 --> 00:17:37,253
And then I can set maybe to get three attempts and keep the highest.

145
00:17:37,253 --> 00:17:44,253
So there's just flexibility, you know, canvasses trying to address a wide range of needs and use cases.

146
00:17:44,253 --> 00:17:51,253
So it's more about looking through the options and figure out figuring out what works best for your class.

147
00:17:51,253 --> 00:18:00,253
I'm going to take multiple temps off. And here's where after the quiz.

148
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:09,253
What is student see? Are they able to see their quiz responses, which is going to show them all of the quiz questions again?

149
00:18:09,253 --> 00:18:17,253
All of the answers they had to choose from. And then it's going to show them which one they selected.

150
00:18:17,253 --> 00:18:24,253
So if I'm trying to maybe keep this quiz on lockdown because it's a midterm or something,

151
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:30,253
I may not want students to have that kind of access to the quiz again.

152
00:18:30,253 --> 00:18:39,253
I may want to just uncheck that and not let students sort of review it.

153
00:18:39,253 --> 00:18:46,253
And then letting students see the correct answers. So I have an instructor right now that does let students see the correct answers.

154
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:55,253
But after the quizzes closed so it would reveal the answers after when no one is able to take it afterwards.

155
00:18:55,253 --> 00:19:06,253
So that's also an option. I can set a date and time. And in his case, that that day and time corresponds with that.

156
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:17,253
Until and until is when it becomes a locked.

157
00:19:17,253 --> 00:19:22,253
Here's the show, one question at a time. And lot questions after answering.

158
00:19:22,253 --> 00:19:33,253
I, I would discourage that. I think in our remote environment where people are using different devices and Internet connections, if you like,

159
00:19:33,253 --> 00:19:45,253
locking questions creates an extra burden that could potentially end with you getting more emails after the fact.

160
00:19:45,253 --> 00:19:50,253
So require an access code. You know, when we talked about proctoring,

161
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:59,253
this is one way where you could restrict the quiz where they have to wait for you to give them the password.

162
00:19:59,253 --> 00:20:10,253
You know, maybe if we're meeting in a zoom session, they may have to be present for you to give them the password so that they can begin.

163
00:20:10,253 --> 00:20:16,253
So it's just another restriction option filter by IP address.

164
00:20:16,253 --> 00:20:25,253
This makes more sense when we're on campus and maybe we meet in a computer lab and we're all taking that quiz together in the computer lab.

165
00:20:25,253 --> 00:20:30,253
That computer lab has a range of IP addresses that we know what they are.

166
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:39,253
Because I.T. manages them, we would not want to use this in our remote environment.

167
00:20:39,253 --> 00:20:45,253
And all that means is the students need to physically be at a computer in that lab in order to take the quiz.

168
00:20:45,253 --> 00:20:50,253
So just another restriction of I can't be off campus at home.

169
00:20:50,253 --> 00:20:57,253
Maybe I didn't show up for class. I won't be able to take the exam even though it's online.

170
00:20:57,253 --> 00:21:03,253
And then assigned to everyone. When is the when is the exam due?

171
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:11,253
And then this availability range. When does it open for students to begin taking?

172
00:21:11,253 --> 00:21:17,253
And then if you choose to lock it where no one can take it after a specific date.

173
00:21:17,253 --> 00:21:26,253
What's that day in times. If you can leave, you can leave.

174
00:21:26,253 --> 00:21:37,253
Available the availability dates blank. If you don't feel like you need restrictions on that and maybe you just have a due date.

175
00:21:37,253 --> 00:21:44,253
And then anything that comes in after that due date canvas in the grade book is automatically going to flag that is late.

176
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:55,253
So that if you have a late policy where you deduct points, you'll know which students submitted late.

177
00:21:55,253 --> 00:22:00,253
Right. And then when we talked about maybe you have a set of students who need to take this at a different time.

178
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:10,253
So if I'm locking down my test where it runs from, you know, 11:00 a.m. until one p.m., a very strict timeframe.

179
00:22:10,253 --> 00:22:15,253
But I have some students in a different time zone, one or two students.

180
00:22:15,253 --> 00:22:23,253
I can actually click this add button. And select those students by name.

181
00:22:23,253 --> 00:22:28,253
And give them a completely different set of parameters here.

182
00:22:28,253 --> 00:22:37,253
And so I would pick those names and then this would change from everyone to everyone else.

183
00:22:37,253 --> 00:22:52,253
And so you can add as many of these sort of differentiated timeframes as you need.

184
00:22:52,253 --> 00:23:00,253
In the lower right corner, I have my cancel. My fave and publish and my save options.

185
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:12,253
So right now, I'm just working in draft format and I'm going to click save.

186
00:23:12,253 --> 00:23:18,253
All right. And I'm actually going to change that. I'm going to go ahead and publish it because I.

187
00:23:18,253 --> 00:23:27,253
I forgot that I have to publish the exam. If I want to be able to see the moderate options.

188
00:23:27,253 --> 00:23:33,253
So up here at the top on my quiz information page, I can publish it.

189
00:23:33,253 --> 00:23:37,253
If it's unpublished, I can preview it,

190
00:23:37,253 --> 00:23:48,253
which is going to allow me as the instructor to go in and sort of take the quiz and see if there's anything that needs to be fixed.

191
00:23:48,253 --> 00:23:59,253
I have an edit button so I can continue editing it and I have this of three dots and canvas hides a lot of.

192
00:23:59,253 --> 00:24:06,253
Teachers under these three dots. So I encourage you to explore and just click on it and see what's under these.

193
00:24:06,253 --> 00:24:10,253
Anytime you see it.

194
00:24:10,253 --> 00:24:19,253
When we get to grading, we'll talk about you can actually attach a rubric to a quiz so maybe students are earning points for answering correctly.

195
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:27,253
But maybe you're also evaluating them on other things related to their quiz answers.

196
00:24:27,253 --> 00:24:33,253
I can lock this quiz from here. I can delete it.

197
00:24:33,253 --> 00:24:41,253
I can send I could send this to somebody else. Basically send a copy of my exam to a colleague.

198
00:24:41,253 --> 00:24:46,253
Or I could copy this quiz. This exam over into another course site.

199
00:24:46,253 --> 00:25:00,253
And shared a common commons is a repository that's open to all canvas users across the country, across the world, K-12, higher ed, everyone.

200
00:25:00,253 --> 00:25:06,253
So if you've built a really great exam and you want to share it with anyone who uses canvas,

201
00:25:06,253 --> 00:25:14,253
you can post it there and make it available for other people to import into their course.

202
00:25:14,253 --> 00:25:21,253
So when I publish a quiz and this is understanding, we've only looked at the settings,

203
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:29,253
we haven't actually added any questions yet, but I'm going to go ahead and publish it.

204
00:25:29,253 --> 00:25:34,253
To see my other options over here on the side, full speed Grieder is what I'll use.

205
00:25:34,253 --> 00:25:43,253
We'll make it degrading but moderate. This quiz is how I go ahead and set students up to have additional time and additional attempts.

206
00:25:43,253 --> 00:25:51,253
So if I click on that. This is gonna give me a list of all of my students.

207
00:25:51,253 --> 00:25:57,253
And I can check their names here. Or I can search for them.

208
00:25:57,253 --> 00:26:07,253
This is a really long list because it's a shared site with Fact Tenent.

209
00:26:07,253 --> 00:26:13,253
So I can select multiple students or I can come over to the far right.

210
00:26:13,253 --> 00:26:22,253
And I have a pencil icon next to everyone's name. If I click this pencil icon.

211
00:26:22,253 --> 00:26:29,253
Here's where I get to add those accommodations. Extra attempts.

212
00:26:29,253 --> 00:26:39,253
Everyone already gets one. How many additional does the student get?

213
00:26:39,253 --> 00:26:49,253
And then extra time, everyone already gets 60 Minutes. How much extra time does the student get?

214
00:26:49,253 --> 00:26:58,253
And I can enter that in here so I can do that one by one, or I could select multiple.

215
00:26:58,253 --> 00:27:02,253
But there's such a long list that when I check these, I have to go all the way.

216
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:13,253
I'm pretty sure that's going to be hidden at the bottom. Yeah, the very bottom of that list is change extensions for three selected students.

217
00:27:13,253 --> 00:27:22,253
So I could give if if I'm giving the same accommodation to multiple people, I could use the checkboxes.

218
00:27:22,253 --> 00:27:29,253
Politics scrolling and as students come in and take this quiz.

219
00:27:29,253 --> 00:27:36,253
I'll be able to get a sense of how long it took them, how many temps left.

220
00:27:36,253 --> 00:27:45,253
I only have gave one attempt and then what scored? I'll also have a flag at the top of this page letting me know there are some outstanding quizzes.

221
00:27:45,253 --> 00:27:53,253
If something went wrong and somebody navigated away and I need to force submit.

222
00:27:53,253 --> 00:28:02,253
A lot of interesting information under this moderate option. When a back out of here.

223
00:28:02,253 --> 00:28:35,253
Any questions about those items? Next, we're going to move onto the questions.

224
00:28:35,253 --> 00:28:42,253
So the next part is adding questions to our quiz, and we can do that in multiple ways.

225
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:51,253
If you have a textbook publisher who has quiz banks and quizzes that you can use, we can import those into canvas.

226
00:28:51,253 --> 00:29:02,253
The file type to do that is called a cutey file. That's all we're going to look for on the import things.

227
00:29:02,253 --> 00:29:06,253
We can bring in questions from previous quizzes.

228
00:29:06,253 --> 00:29:18,253
So if you use quizzes weekly to maybe as a knowledge check for content, you can reuse some of those questions when it comes to midterm or final time.

229
00:29:18,253 --> 00:29:24,253
And you will have to reenter them, we can just sort of bring them had them in.

230
00:29:24,253 --> 00:29:39,253
Create question banks. Question banks are an important if we want to create sort of a more randomization in our quiz.

231
00:29:39,253 --> 00:29:53,253
The question banks are going to allow us to have a repository of questions that canvas can pull from and put questions in different orders.

232
00:29:53,253 --> 00:30:00,253
So I'll show you how we can look and create those.

233
00:30:00,253 --> 00:30:05,253
And then we can just manually create questions on the fly as we go.

234
00:30:05,253 --> 00:30:12,253
And sometimes if particularly if you have a quiz that's already written now on a word or document,

235
00:30:12,253 --> 00:30:19,253
you know, you can copy and paste and add those manually in.

236
00:30:19,253 --> 00:30:25,253
My my one piece of advice would be to start early and test thoroughly.

237
00:30:25,253 --> 00:30:36,253
Now, our team can also help you build your quizzes. And if you reach out to P.H., that instruction that you Misch to you, we can assist in this.

238
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:41,253
But if you recall, we had that preview button. You'll want to take that.

239
00:30:41,253 --> 00:30:51,253
And if you have to have them take it just to make sure that what you have set in the quiz is the correct answer, is the actual correct answer.

240
00:30:51,253 --> 00:30:58,253
Publish your content in particular, is notorious for not always having the right answer set as the right answer.

241
00:30:58,253 --> 00:31:11,253
So just checking those, it's gonna save you some of that work and in getting e-mails from students after the fact.

242
00:31:11,253 --> 00:31:20,253
Question type. There's a lot to choose from. So just talk briefly about some of these that are unique.

243
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:27,253
Multiple choice, true. False are what you would expect.

244
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:34,253
There's fill in the blank and fill in multiple blanks where students manually type text in.

245
00:31:34,253 --> 00:31:40,253
To sort of complete the sentence. Multiple answers, like multiple choice.

246
00:31:40,253 --> 00:31:46,253
You can select all, you know, choose. Check all that apply.

247
00:31:46,253 --> 00:31:50,253
Multiple drop downs is similar to fill in the blank.

248
00:31:50,253 --> 00:31:58,253
But you're providing them a word bank of options to choose from, whereas fill in the blank is free form.

249
00:31:58,253 --> 00:32:04,253
They have to know. Matching.

250
00:32:04,253 --> 00:32:09,253
We'll give you two columns, you create sort of a.

251
00:32:09,253 --> 00:32:15,253
A framework. And then on the side, they choose the corresponding from a list.

252
00:32:15,253 --> 00:32:27,253
The corresponding answer or matching pair, a numerical answer means students are going to type in a number.

253
00:32:27,253 --> 00:32:38,253
But for canvas to grade it, you can create sort of a range of answers that are correct or.

254
00:32:38,253 --> 00:32:44,253
You know, to certain decimal places, it's kind of interesting how it allows you.

255
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:51,253
There's and there's different options, whether it's an exact number or range or I think there's one other option.

256
00:32:51,253 --> 00:32:56,253
We can look at it. Formula question is really interesting.

257
00:32:56,253 --> 00:33:02,253
And it also brings in an aspect of randomization into it.

258
00:33:02,253 --> 00:33:08,253
I'll admit I had I was running into an error when I added a formula question,

259
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:18,253
but basically it allows you to ask a question where students maybe have to do a calculation to get the answer,

260
00:33:18,253 --> 00:33:30,253
but it sets you up to provide different variable numbers, variable assignments for each student.

261
00:33:30,253 --> 00:33:36,253
For one example I saw was, you know, if I have a small glass of water.

262
00:33:36,253 --> 00:33:45,253
That hold X ounces. And I have two tall glasses of water that hold Y ounces.

263
00:33:45,253 --> 00:33:51,253
How much water do I have? And I can say, all right.

264
00:33:51,253 --> 00:33:57,253
For variable X 2s, anything from two and two ounces to 10 ounces.

265
00:33:57,253 --> 00:34:00,253
Four, why put input?

266
00:34:00,253 --> 00:34:11,253
Any range from five ounces to 40 ounces and a canvas is gonna use those ranges to basically give each student a different combination?

267
00:34:11,253 --> 00:34:17,253
Is interesting. Little a little advanced, but very interesting in terms of canvas.

268
00:34:17,253 --> 00:34:22,253
Will autography that question for you?

269
00:34:22,253 --> 00:34:34,253
Essay questions are just that short answer response since type in a response and you will manually grade that and then file upload.

270
00:34:34,253 --> 00:34:38,253
Perhaps students had a take home part of the quiz.

271
00:34:38,253 --> 00:34:43,253
They have to maybe type of paper and then they upload it as part of the quiz. Something like that.

272
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:46,253
And then there's also a text option. That's no question.

273
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:55,253
Perhaps this is a a case study that students need a reference to answer the following questions.

274
00:34:55,253 --> 00:35:07,253
Or, yes, a reading prompt. So, as I mentioned, the essay question and file upload are not automatically graded when you go into grade these,

275
00:35:07,253 --> 00:35:12,253
it's going to flag it as, hey, these questions need your attention.

276
00:35:12,253 --> 00:35:18,253
Canvas will leave those scores of blank for you to go in and manually add them.

277
00:35:18,253 --> 00:35:26,253
But I've also pulled out the fill in the blank and fill in the multiple blanks as canvas is going to automatically grade these.

278
00:35:26,253 --> 00:35:34,253
But it's worth your attention to revisit them because if a student spells the word wrong.

279
00:35:34,253 --> 00:35:38,253
Came as soon as I know. That doesn't match what the instructor told us.

280
00:35:38,253 --> 00:35:50,253
Are the acceptable answers. So, you know, you have to create a list for canvas, acceptable answers, and sometimes that's even as basic as.

281
00:35:50,253 --> 00:35:59,253
All right. If a student types it in with a capital letter instead of a lowercase or maybe they pluralized it.

282
00:35:59,253 --> 00:36:07,253
And so I'll I'll give them those combinations. But you can't anticipate every potential misspelling.

283
00:36:07,253 --> 00:36:15,253
So it's worth a Squirtle look. All right.

284
00:36:15,253 --> 00:36:19,253
We are going to jump back over to our demo site.

285
00:36:19,253 --> 00:36:26,253
Feel free to post in the chat or flag me down if you have questions up if.

286
00:36:26,253 --> 00:36:33,253
I'm going to back out to my home page because I want to talk about if I were importing publisher content.

287
00:36:33,253 --> 00:36:39,253
So from my home page over on the far right, I have a list of buttons.

288
00:36:39,253 --> 00:36:43,253
And the first one is import existing content.

289
00:36:43,253 --> 00:36:57,253
Now, before I do this step, I would first need to download the files from the publisher Web site or off the disk or however they come.

290
00:36:57,253 --> 00:37:05,253
And it's going to ask me what content type two I want to import. And for there's a lot of options.

291
00:37:05,253 --> 00:37:14,253
But for a quiz, I'm looking for this cute t'ai zip file.

292
00:37:14,253 --> 00:37:22,253
Click that. And it's gonna make me search for it on my computer, which is why you want to have it downloaded locally first.

293
00:37:22,253 --> 00:37:32,253
So I would browse my computer. And then it's going to ask me, like, where do I want to put the quiz questions?

294
00:37:32,253 --> 00:37:39,253
Do I want to create a new question bank to put all of these in?

295
00:37:39,253 --> 00:37:44,253
So I would do that and name it. You know, maybe what the textbook name.

296
00:37:44,253 --> 00:37:52,253
And if there's a range, maybe these are a unit one questions, I could go ahead and just name it like that.

297
00:37:52,253 --> 00:37:57,253
And then when I'm ready, I would click import.

298
00:37:57,253 --> 00:38:05,253
And down below, you can see some other items have been imported and it should give you a completed if it ran into any problems.

299
00:38:05,253 --> 00:38:12,253
It would say, oh, I had one error. And you can see what that is.

300
00:38:12,253 --> 00:38:18,253
Once these are uploaded, where they go.

301
00:38:18,253 --> 00:38:30,253
Is I would come to my quizes area. And for now, I'm on sort of the quiz list page where I can see all of the quizzes for the course.

302
00:38:30,253 --> 00:38:34,253
And remember how I told you? They hide items under these three DOT menus.

303
00:38:34,253 --> 00:38:47,253
One of them is the question banks. So I would come over here and what I would see is.

304
00:38:47,253 --> 00:38:55,253
The question bank that I just uploaded. And it would be titled The Way I titled it when I click on it.

305
00:38:55,253 --> 00:39:07,253
It would have all the quiz questions that were part of that package. So now how do I get that an acquittal?

306
00:39:07,253 --> 00:39:18,253
So in my left hand menu, when I click on quizes. I mean, to go into my exam once.

307
00:39:18,253 --> 00:39:29,253
I mean, I open it back up to edit it. So I have his details tab where we set up all those settings initially.

308
00:39:29,253 --> 00:39:38,253
But I have a questions tab right next to it. And so I don't have any questions yet.

309
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:47,253
If I just imported questions from a publisher, I'm going to be able to say find questions.

310
00:39:47,253 --> 00:39:58,253
This is going to search my question banks for questions that already exist.

311
00:39:58,253 --> 00:40:06,253
So these are all question banks that I've created or been a part of somehow.

312
00:40:06,253 --> 00:40:21,253
I mean, he used the ones I set up for this session. And now I can see I can a list of all of my questions.

313
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:28,253
And I can check them one by one. Or select all of them.

314
00:40:28,253 --> 00:40:36,253
Depending on whom. What I want to add.

315
00:40:36,253 --> 00:40:43,253
If I scroll down to the bottom, there's going to be an ad questions option.

316
00:40:43,253 --> 00:40:53,253
To sort of insert them. OK, so those were questions that were already existing.

317
00:40:53,253 --> 00:41:09,253
I can manually add a new question. Which is gonna give me a blank canvas to sort of create whatever question type I want.

318
00:41:09,253 --> 00:41:16,253
I can name my question in this question, name is only for me as the instructor.

319
00:41:16,253 --> 00:41:26,253
Students won't see the name of my question. So if I scroll up, you can see I named leave for my demo purposes.

320
00:41:26,253 --> 00:41:30,253
I say, example, file, upload, question, example.

321
00:41:30,253 --> 00:41:38,253
This could be a topic this could refer back to a document source that you're using for your quiz questions.

322
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:45,253
Why we rename them is so that if we if we reuse them, we can find them again.

323
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:51,253
I don't know if you saw, but some of those questions when I used find question, it was just question.

324
00:41:51,253 --> 00:42:03,253
Just question. And so that doesn't really help me locate a topic or a question type later on down the line.

325
00:42:03,253 --> 00:42:11,253
And again, only if I'm reusing questions. If you're creating a fresh quiz every time, you may not need to worry about this.

326
00:42:11,253 --> 00:42:19,253
But we'll say unit one, chapter two.

327
00:42:19,253 --> 00:42:27,253
This dropdown, here's where you can select from all those different question types.

328
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:36,253
Thanks for coming, Abby. So we'll look at just a basic multiple choice question.

329
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:41,253
One nice thing is Canvas tries to help you out, even though it's in really tiny text.

330
00:42:41,253 --> 00:42:47,253
They try to give you some instruction of how to create a question type you've selected.

331
00:42:47,253 --> 00:42:52,253
This one says, enter your question and multiple answers.

332
00:42:52,253 --> 00:43:11,253
Then select the one correct answer. If I think, oh, I meant for this to be a multiple answer, because I'm going to give several, I can change it.

333
00:43:11,253 --> 00:43:17,253
So this text editor is where I would type my question.

334
00:43:17,253 --> 00:43:31,253
What do you want to ask? Note that I can insert images in to a quiz question.

335
00:43:31,253 --> 00:43:42,253
I would caution you that you want to make sure your quiz is web accessible for a student with disabilities.

336
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:57,253
So let me just see if I have any images that I can add here.

337
00:43:57,253 --> 00:44:08,253
OK. So if I have a diagram or a graph, I really need, you know, when someone is not able to read this graph,

338
00:44:08,253 --> 00:44:13,253
I really need to take into consideration adding what's called the ALTE text.

339
00:44:13,253 --> 00:44:27,253
And all text is what a screen reader reads. To someone who can't see what's on the screen so I can resize this image.

340
00:44:27,253 --> 00:44:38,253
But when I click select an image, no, if I have this blue selection around it, I have this image options.

341
00:44:38,253 --> 00:44:43,253
Which is going to let me type in my alter text.

342
00:44:43,253 --> 00:44:53,253
The alternative text and there's a question mark that confirms this is used by screen readers to describe the content of an image.

343
00:44:53,253 --> 00:44:58,253
So here's one place where you want to describe.

344
00:44:58,253 --> 00:45:06,253
What everyone can see when they look at this image without giving away the answer to the question you're going to ask.

345
00:45:06,253 --> 00:45:11,253
So there's a balance there.

346
00:45:11,253 --> 00:45:20,253
Also, this file name, if you forget to add all text, a screen reader is going to read this file name, which isn't going to be helpful.

347
00:45:20,253 --> 00:45:25,253
It might be helpful if someone knows Bloom Taxonomy, they can refer.

348
00:45:25,253 --> 00:45:30,253
Oh, I do know what those levels are.

349
00:45:30,253 --> 00:45:39,253
But if my question is, what's the name of this diagram, I just gave them the answer in the file, name of the image.

350
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:52,253
So those are just some cautions. So depending on your question, what's the information that can be viewed without giving away the answer?

351
00:45:52,253 --> 00:45:56,253
So I would type a description here. This is a pyramid.

352
00:45:56,253 --> 00:46:02,253
One, two, three, four, five, with six levels. The lower levels of.

353
00:46:02,253 --> 00:46:12,253
Are considered lower order thinking skills, the top of the pyramid is higher order thinking skills and starting at the bottom.

354
00:46:12,253 --> 00:46:26,253
They are knowledge, comprehension, application analysis and so on.

355
00:46:26,253 --> 00:46:30,253
So images can be great, but we need to make sure we're making them accessible for everyone.

356
00:46:30,253 --> 00:46:38,253
So scrolling down. This is where I get to enter in my answers.

357
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:49,253
So. Cancer one, cancer two.

358
00:46:49,253 --> 00:46:56,253
And I'm going to need more than two options here for me to click the add another answer.

359
00:46:56,253 --> 00:47:04,253
So maybe I want to ABC and D. For.

360
00:47:04,253 --> 00:47:08,253
OK, and it defaults to making the first one the correct answer.

361
00:47:08,253 --> 00:47:13,253
But that doesn't mean I have to put the correct answer in the first box.

362
00:47:13,253 --> 00:47:18,253
In fact, you don't want to do that because then that would make the answer to every question, eh?

363
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:27,253
So I've put the correct answer in number three. So I'm going to click this Green Arrow.

364
00:47:27,253 --> 00:47:34,253
Oh, this is a multiple answer, so now I have two options selected. I can uncheck that.

365
00:47:34,253 --> 00:47:43,253
And now you can see these have changed to possible answer, incorrect answer.

366
00:47:43,253 --> 00:47:53,253
I can add more options. I can edit or even with this trash can delete some of these options.

367
00:47:53,253 --> 00:48:00,253
There's these little message bubbles here also. And this is one way I could give feedback.

368
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:07,253
This could be pretty intensive, possibly some publisher tools come with this feedback built in.

369
00:48:07,253 --> 00:48:13,253
And in that case, if you were using publisher content, you would see what they've typed in.

370
00:48:13,253 --> 00:48:18,253
This first bubble is green, outlined in green.

371
00:48:18,253 --> 00:48:25,253
But if I hover over it, it says click to enter comments for a correct answer, I could give feedback.

372
00:48:25,253 --> 00:48:32,253
For two students who made the correct selection, this next one is outlined in pink.

373
00:48:32,253 --> 00:48:36,253
And if I hover over it, the tooltip says click to enter comments for a wrong answer.

374
00:48:36,253 --> 00:48:44,253
If I wanted to give feedback to students who didn't choose the right answer, I could type in a message for them.

375
00:48:44,253 --> 00:48:52,253
But again, if students I want to decide, is this a case where I want to give students the correct answer,

376
00:48:52,253 --> 00:49:02,253
or is this a case where I want to be careful and give them direction without giving them the answer?

377
00:49:02,253 --> 00:49:08,253
This next one is a kind of a blue box, but if I hover over it, it says give general comments.

378
00:49:08,253 --> 00:49:17,253
So depending on whether they answered correctly or incorrectly, this is just feedback.

379
00:49:17,253 --> 00:49:25,253
All right. And you would hit update question. To save this.

380
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:29,253
I have a pencil tool and an X tool. Over on the far right.

381
00:49:29,253 --> 00:49:34,253
A pencil tool is going to let me go back and make edits to that. Quick question.

382
00:49:34,253 --> 00:49:45,253
And the X is going to remove the question from the quiz. I also have these rows, two rows of dots, and these are drag handles.

383
00:49:45,253 --> 00:50:04,253
Meaning I can sort of rearrange these. And what I'm creating here so far is a quiz that's gonna look the same for every student.

384
00:50:04,253 --> 00:50:09,253
This is going to be question one for every student. This is gonna be question two for every student.

385
00:50:09,253 --> 00:50:17,253
This is gonna be question three. One of the ways we can incorporate a little bit of randomization.

386
00:50:17,253 --> 00:50:24,253
He's using this middle option. New Question Group.

387
00:50:24,253 --> 00:50:31,253
This is where I'm going to say. All right. The next five questions, maybe the next 10 questions.

388
00:50:31,253 --> 00:50:37,253
Maybe just the next three questions. I'm going to have you grin.

389
00:50:37,253 --> 00:50:47,253
I mean, I've canvased randomly select from a question bank.

390
00:50:47,253 --> 00:51:08,253
So when I hadn't clicked, new question group. And we'll say this is the chapter one, my ptosis questions.

391
00:51:08,253 --> 00:51:19,253
I'm going to link this to a question bank. So, again, Question Bank is sort of a prerequisite for using this feature.

392
00:51:19,253 --> 00:51:25,253
So it does take a little bit of extra work in advance for the instructor to build that question bank.

393
00:51:25,253 --> 00:51:36,253
But maybe your linking to a publisher. Question Bank. Again, it's going to show me.

394
00:51:36,253 --> 00:51:50,253
Question banks I have. I'm going to pick the one I want to work in.

395
00:51:50,253 --> 00:52:01,253
And I'm going to say pick five questions and two points per question.

396
00:52:01,253 --> 00:52:09,253
And it's reiterating. All right, this set of next five questions will be pulled from this question bank.

397
00:52:09,253 --> 00:52:13,253
And if that looks good, I'm going to hit create group.

398
00:52:13,253 --> 00:52:21,253
So now what I've created is a quiz where questions one, two, three are going to be the same for everybody.

399
00:52:21,253 --> 00:52:28,253
But the next five questions are going to be random.

400
00:52:28,253 --> 00:52:40,253
And they may not be the same questions for each student. So that's one way to add a little randomization into quizes, so.

401
00:52:40,253 --> 00:52:49,253
All right, any questions about that? No, that's pretty good.

402
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:59,253
Doing lots of ideas. Excellent. Yeah. And I felt about kind of figuring out what all the options are and then zeroing in on the ones that work best.

403
00:52:59,253 --> 00:53:14,253
So I'm gonna go ahead and save this. And what I'm going to have you do is I'm going to have you take a quiz.

404
00:53:14,253 --> 00:53:23,253
That's all right. And it is OK if you don't know the answers, because I did not either.

405
00:53:23,253 --> 00:53:28,253
I have put the link in the chat. Let me know if you have trouble getting to that quiz.

406
00:53:28,253 --> 00:53:36,715
But this is gonna give you a sense of the student experience and taking a quiz.

407
00:53:37,493 --> 00:53:44,493
So, yeah. Just in the last few minutes, we'll we'll look at Cui's statistics, how to make corrections.

408
00:53:44,493 --> 00:53:49,493
And then we'll look at it in speed, greater look at the manual grading.

409
00:53:49,493 --> 00:53:55,493
There's a function called grade one question at a time, and then quizzes have something called fudge points.

410
00:53:55,493 --> 00:54:02,493
So let's look at those. So in the sample quiz.

411
00:54:02,493 --> 00:54:14,493
Let me go back to moderate quiz. Just so we can compare. So you've taken this quiz.

412
00:54:14,493 --> 00:54:19,493
You have you've taken one attempt. You've finished in three minutes. You have no more temp's left.

413
00:54:19,493 --> 00:54:31,493
And that's your score. When you were actively taking the quiz, it had a timer here that was showing me how much time you had left.

414
00:54:31,493 --> 00:54:45,493
And I had a little icon where I could go and grant you additional time as you were in there taking the test.

415
00:54:45,493 --> 00:54:53,493
If you had hit so that was Step Cui's was set to be 30 minutes, if you had hit that limit.

416
00:54:53,493 --> 00:55:02,493
It would tell me here time up that you that you ran up against the deadline and it auto submitted for you.

417
00:55:02,493 --> 00:55:10,493
Oh. And there was one question, I got an advance, I wanted to make sure I touch on that.

418
00:55:10,493 --> 00:55:15,493
Let me back out to the quiz information and look at the quiz statistics.

419
00:55:15,493 --> 00:55:19,493
Now, this isn't gonna be great because I think only two people took it.

420
00:55:19,493 --> 00:55:23,493
I took it one to the test student and then you took it.

421
00:55:23,493 --> 00:55:36,493
This is gonna give us a question break down to see how students did in a summary view on each question.

422
00:55:36,493 --> 00:55:43,493
So a hundred percent of respondents picked the wrong face on this question.

423
00:55:43,493 --> 00:55:47,493
So what's wrong with this question? Did I word it in a confusing way?

424
00:55:47,493 --> 00:55:53,493
Did I put the wrong answer is the correct answer.

425
00:55:53,493 --> 00:56:03,493
So things like this are just ways you can sort of analyze what went wrong or went where I'm right with this quiz.

426
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:10,493
He keeps going down again. One hundred percent of students went for this.

427
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:14,493
Did I forget to mark that as a correct answer or did everyone just get it wrong?

428
00:56:14,493 --> 00:56:20,493
You can sort of look at the quiz at a high level view like that.

429
00:56:20,493 --> 00:56:29,493
And then when we get into the student by students, I'm going to back out again using the breadcrumbs, the top.

430
00:56:29,493 --> 00:56:42,493
When I'm rated great, I can jump into speed, greater veel. So it jumped right to your quiz, but I won't put you on the spot.

431
00:56:42,493 --> 00:56:51,493
I'll jump down to, let's see, my test student.

432
00:56:51,493 --> 00:56:57,493
All right, so because I have questions manually, great question types, essay and file,

433
00:56:57,493 --> 00:57:02,493
upload canvas is flagging those for me and saying you need to look at question

434
00:57:02,493 --> 00:57:10,493
nine and question pen because we didn't we didn't give students a grade for that.

435
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:15,493
And as I scroll through, I'm going to be looking at the quiz, the way the student took it.

436
00:57:15,493 --> 00:57:21,493
So if I have that question, group of random, I have questions.

437
00:57:21,493 --> 00:57:29,493
Each quiz as I go through it. It's gonna be a little bit different.

438
00:57:29,493 --> 00:57:35,493
Now, one thing that's different in quizzes than it is when students upload a paper or something similar.

439
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:44,493
Is this a grade box is great out. I can't manually change the overall grade over here.

440
00:57:44,493 --> 00:57:49,493
All of the grade modification has to be done in the center panel.

441
00:57:49,493 --> 00:57:56,493
So. Let me go down to see if hey.

442
00:57:56,493 --> 00:58:06,493
So in this one. The student chose to correct answers, but there was a third that they didn't get.

443
00:58:06,493 --> 00:58:11,493
So maybe for this quiz they don't get any points.

444
00:58:11,493 --> 00:58:17,493
I'm going to be really harsh and say, if you didn't get all three, then you don't get any.

445
00:58:17,493 --> 00:58:25,493
I can manually change the score and each individual text boxes and I will need to do that.

446
00:58:25,493 --> 00:58:36,493
OK. So here's my my fill in the blank question. Chromosomes, these were the combinations that I thought of that canvas.

447
00:58:36,493 --> 00:58:39,493
If they if Canvas sees these options, go ahead, Margaret.

448
00:58:39,493 --> 00:58:47,493
Correct. But I put a period at the end of chromosomes, which I did not anticipate.

449
00:58:47,493 --> 00:58:52,493
So but I can go in and say, all right, yeah, that counts.

450
00:58:52,493 --> 00:58:58,493
They spelled it right. But I didn't anticipate that period in their. This is through grade book.

451
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:04,493
This is to speed greater, greater. OK. Because that's what I try to do on my way.

452
00:59:04,493 --> 00:59:08,493
Things I went back, I thought, well, I can see their answers. I could not get there.

453
00:59:08,493 --> 00:59:14,493
So that's what it was. Yeah. And I can show you how to get to speed greater from the grade book as well.

454
00:59:14,493 --> 00:59:21,493
You can get to it from that quiz information page or from the grade book.

455
00:59:21,493 --> 00:59:30,493
And as I scroll down to that question, nine and 10. OK, so again, these are manually great question type, so canvased.

456
00:59:30,493 --> 00:59:38,493
Didn't even attempt to put anything in there, but we'll say, OK, we'll give the student full points.

457
00:59:38,493 --> 00:59:48,493
Here is the question that I asked. Under here, under your answer is what the student typed in.

458
00:59:48,493 --> 00:59:54,493
I, I find visually these are difficult to differentiate.

459
00:59:54,493 --> 01:00:10,493
And then the file download, I can download this and review it and see how the student did and give them points based on this.

460
01:00:10,493 --> 01:00:25,493
Now, I can at the very bottom, I have an update scores, buttons, which is going to push any changes I made to these individual questions over to.

461
01:00:25,493 --> 01:00:31,493
The the final grade that actually goes into the grade book. So a second ago, that was a 20.

462
01:00:31,493 --> 01:00:39,493
And it just upped it to twenty five. Based on the points I entered over here.

463
01:00:39,493 --> 01:00:49,493
There may be cases where you need to give students extra points for something that's maybe not related to a question.

464
01:00:49,493 --> 01:00:54,493
I don't have a great use case for this, but canvas just to give instructors some flexibility.

465
01:00:54,493 --> 01:01:04,493
Canvas created this fudge points where maybe for whatever reason.

466
01:01:04,493 --> 01:01:11,493
I give students five points extra. This could also be negative points.

467
01:01:11,493 --> 01:01:21,493
Maybe this attempt was submitted late, so I'm taking points off for the student for the late attempt.

468
01:01:21,493 --> 01:01:27,493
So I can enter in any point value in the fudge points and update my score again.

469
01:01:27,493 --> 01:01:43,493
And then that's the score that will be pushed to the grade book. Minutes from back up to the top, just to.

470
01:01:43,493 --> 01:01:51,493
I believe it might be under the settings gear at the top, in speed, greater view, I have these icons in the upper left corner.

471
01:01:51,493 --> 01:01:59,493
This is supposed to take me back to my grade book. This is the post or hide grades.

472
01:01:59,493 --> 01:02:10,493
So maybe I want to go through and grade everybody's essay questions and file uploads before students start getting their quiz grades.

473
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:18,493
And that's a toggle. I could say higher grades. This settings gear.

474
01:02:18,493 --> 01:02:21,493
Should be where I can view questions. One question at a time.

475
01:02:21,493 --> 01:02:34,493
So options. I could sort list by some filtering options, hide student's name and speed greater.

476
01:02:34,493 --> 01:02:42,493
So if I want to kind of do an unbiased grading and then grade by question.

477
01:02:42,493 --> 01:03:02,493
Saves setting. What's different about this?

478
01:03:02,493 --> 01:03:09,493
It is in beta, so I'm not quite sure what I'm looking at. Great question.

479
01:03:09,493 --> 01:03:26,493
Safe settings. OK, so here I have a questions at the top.

480
01:03:26,493 --> 01:03:46,493
And my guess is if I scroll. Yes, I have not used that in practice.

481
01:03:46,493 --> 01:03:51,493
Well, look, we're nine and 10 or great out. Is that right?

482
01:03:51,493 --> 01:04:01,493
Soane nine and 10. We're not great out. And what I was doing was flagging those as I still needed to manually score those on your quiz.

483
01:04:01,493 --> 01:04:06,493
So it was saying before everything else has been graded.

484
01:04:06,493 --> 01:04:16,493
But those. I will take that off.

485
01:04:16,493 --> 01:04:23,493
Otherwise, I don't have that. So it did say it's in a beta.

486
01:04:23,493 --> 01:04:29,493
I'm definitely seeing some refresh. Issues there.

487
01:04:29,493 --> 01:04:43,493
But let me back up and go to. Quiz, there's one thing I did want to cover in, that is if, say, I went my CUI'S statistics I'm seeing.

488
01:04:43,493 --> 01:04:50,493
Oh, I did actually highlight the wrong answer as the correct answer.

489
01:04:50,493 --> 01:04:57,493
Let's see if we can. So when I go in and out of the quiz, when students have already taken a canvas,

490
01:04:57,493 --> 01:05:02,493
lets me know you're messing with a quiz where students have already taken it.

491
01:05:02,493 --> 01:05:07,493
And this is gonna. You just need to be careful of what you do.

492
01:05:07,493 --> 01:05:24,493
I can come over to the questions tab. And I can use the edit button, which is the pencil tool on an individual question.

493
01:05:24,493 --> 01:05:31,493
And let's just say. That that was supposed to be the right answer.

494
01:05:31,493 --> 01:05:35,493
And I'm physically switching, which is the correct answer.

495
01:05:35,493 --> 01:05:47,493
Canvas gives me some regrading options and there's only some questions that this is available for.

496
01:05:47,493 --> 01:05:53,493
It doesn't work for all of like it will not work for fill in the blank.

497
01:05:53,493 --> 01:06:03,493
Very sorry. So it's mostly a multiple choice and true false question types of cases.

498
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:09,493
And so it's going to give you a set of options. Do you want to award points for both correct and previously?

499
01:06:09,493 --> 01:06:19,493
Correct. And so this is this campus. We're going to go back and do whatever you say here to this for the students who've already taken this exam.

500
01:06:19,493 --> 01:06:27,493
So should they get points if they answered correctly?

501
01:06:27,493 --> 01:06:38,493
And if they had the correct answer before, meaning we're not going to penalize you if you technically answer wrong.

502
01:06:38,493 --> 01:06:42,493
But we'll give you points if you chose the wrong.

503
01:06:42,493 --> 01:06:47,493
The correct answer when I had the wrong answer selected.

504
01:06:47,493 --> 01:06:54,493
And then there's only award points for the correct answer. Meaning some student scores may be reduced.

505
01:06:54,493 --> 01:07:01,493
Say no. If you answered wrong, answered wrong. Give everyone full credit for the question across the board.

506
01:07:01,493 --> 01:07:12,493
And update the question without regrading. So I'm going to say in this case, this would be the most fair thing.

507
01:07:12,493 --> 01:07:22,493
And update. OK, and then I'm I need to click the update question button so it saves my changes.

508
01:07:22,493 --> 01:07:35,493
So everyone who takes this quiz from now on out will have the correct things selected and some points may having creese.

509
01:07:35,493 --> 01:07:40,493
Some scores may have increased after I corrected that.

510
01:07:40,493 --> 01:07:48,493
I'm going to jump over to the grade book because I did want to touch on how to launch to be greater from the great book.

511
01:07:48,493 --> 01:07:58,493
All right. So in the great book, I have my sort of Excel sheet and across the top I'm going to look for the name of my quiz, which is Sample Quiz.

512
01:07:58,493 --> 01:08:09,493
And, you know, I can't see much from here, but if I hover my mouse over the column header to get those three dots.

513
01:08:09,493 --> 01:08:17,493
My second option is to now open this quiz with the speed greater tool.

514
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:31,493
Which then allows me to go in and make those modifications. That was great s grades and then the spreadsheet and then the three dots.

515
01:08:31,493 --> 01:08:36,493
The grades. Yep. On the header. The three dots on the header of the exam.

516
01:08:36,493 --> 01:08:42,493
And actually, this is for nearly any assignment.

517
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:59,493
If they submit papers, you can grade papers in speed greater. All right.

518
01:08:59,493 --> 01:09:15,493
And I will just close out by inviting any questions or if you want to consult or have us help, help you review and anticipate issues with a quiz.

519
01:09:15,493 --> 01:09:20,493
Feel free to reach out at any time at a speech to instruction that you stadium.

520
01:09:20,493 --> 01:09:21,826
Right, right. Right. I'm going to have more questions that are part of what's more as I should try to do this.
