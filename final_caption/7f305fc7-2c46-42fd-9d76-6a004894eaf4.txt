1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,535
I mean we choose letter A that white women as well as African American men and

2
00:00:06,535 --> 00:00:12,464
women okay so half the class and B white and African American women.

3
00:00:12,464 --> 00:00:17,453
See African American women okay and

4
00:00:17,453 --> 00:00:23,273
deactivated okay the deeds haven't so,

5
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,108
this was the study.

6
00:00:26,108 --> 00:00:30,977
So basically they took 20 actors posing as patients and, enrolled positions I

7
00:00:30,977 --> 00:00:35,845
thought this was just the study of general decision making about heart disease,

8
00:00:35,845 --> 00:00:40,298
not, specifically how race or gender influence their decision making.

9
00:00:40,298 --> 00:00:44,961
And they have these standardised patients which were meant to represent 55 year old

10
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,368
men and women or 70 year old men and women.

11
00:00:47,368 --> 00:00:50,825
They've shown here, they all have the same basic storey that was,

12
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:53,797
it was very likely to be chest pain related to their part.

13
00:00:53,797 --> 00:00:57,293
And what they found was that on the top half of the site,

14
00:00:57,293 --> 00:00:59,422
it shows the rates of referral for

15
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:04,312
capitalisation amongst men of either age 50 five or 70 and black or White.

16
00:01:04,312 --> 00:01:09,967
Essentially 90% about were referred to this typical next step to diagnose

17
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:15,274
someone [COUGH] And in fact, if you look towards the lower right corner for

18
00:01:15,274 --> 00:01:20,327
White women as well as either age 55 or 70, about 90% as well.

19
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:24,650
But when you start to see a drop Office for African American women where 84%

20
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,860
referred the middle aged African American Women women.

21
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,173
And 73% of positions which was significantly bravo brother

22
00:01:32,173 --> 00:01:36,494
the groups referred the 70 year old African American woman.

23
00:01:36,494 --> 00:01:40,632
So, and this was really an important study though it goes back to 1999 and

24
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:42,861
really sort of jump started this field and

25
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:46,634
took it out of the realm of just the medical literature and started to.

26
00:01:46,634 --> 00:01:52,270
Because I think it was this sort of vivid study of standardised patients and

27
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:57,281
where the storeys were very consistent with what, it became a real

28
00:01:57,281 --> 00:02:02,578
headline grabber news, television news and many major newspapers.

29
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:07,023
And it led to political cartoons like this it started to engage the public and

30
00:02:07,023 --> 00:02:11,685
in thinking about the health disparities as an important issue in health care.

31
00:02:11,685 --> 00:02:16,813
And, and that led to some further work that I'll present through the Institute of

32
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:21,882
Medicine, the congressional Black caucus, through Congress calling on the.

33
00:02:21,882 --> 00:02:25,842
Institute of Medicine to study this problem and try and help the federal

34
00:02:25,842 --> 00:02:30,002
government address it more effectively than they had up until that point.

35
00:02:30,002 --> 00:02:33,262
So just before we move on,

36
00:02:33,262 --> 00:02:38,454
did anyone get all four questions right,

37
00:02:38,454 --> 00:02:41,878
and he has a special prise.

38
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:45,477
So what I'd like to do in the rest of today's session is to provide a conceptual

39
00:02:45,477 --> 00:02:49,294
framework that I use from thinking about health care disparities very much relates

40
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,165
to the concepts of healthcare quality.

41
00:02:51,165 --> 00:02:55,357
And I think we're learning about in this class and then secondly, to highlight some

42
00:02:55,357 --> 00:02:58,737
of the key research and reports on disparities and quality of care.

43
00:02:58,737 --> 00:03:03,201
And then most of the presentation will be to talk about some policy approaches that

44
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:06,509
are important for achieving equity in healthcare quality?

45
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:09,776
So what's the role of broader insurance coverage?

46
00:03:09,776 --> 00:03:13,090
What's the importance of improving coordination of care and

47
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,085
then how do we think about performance measurements and

48
00:03:16,085 --> 00:03:19,930
when we think about the processes of care out for patient experiences?

49
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,505
Patient reported outcomes?

50
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:26,913
How can that be used to address racial methane very for the context here building

51
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:32,015
on the handful of studies that we've already discussed is that minority.

52
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:35,303
Americans are less likely to get many effective medical and

53
00:03:35,303 --> 00:03:38,075
surgical services relative to white Americans.

54
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:39,749
And over the past 10 to 15 years,

55
00:03:39,749 --> 00:03:43,098
there's been a lot of attention to what the reasons for these differences

56
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:47,056
are could it be patient preferences which we didn't see around getting transplants?

57
00:03:47,056 --> 00:03:52,026
Could be quite wonderful fact, which was another part of that study that also small

58
00:03:52,026 --> 00:03:56,574
party to what extent of socioeconomic factors driving these differences?

59
00:03:56,574 --> 00:04:01,554
People's income and education, insurance coverage what role does communication and

60
00:04:01,554 --> 00:04:02,299
trust play?

61
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:06,300
Their deep seated biases and healthcare system and, particularly for

62
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,769
African Americans and native Americans with longstanding discrimination and

63
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:11,644
segregation.

64
00:04:11,644 --> 00:04:15,929
Okay, and that may influence people's level of communication and

65
00:04:15,929 --> 00:04:21,357
trust in their providers and, an important fact that it's very difficult to study.

66
00:04:21,357 --> 00:04:25,201
But there's always a concern as histories that bias amongst positions or

67
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:27,827
other clinical care providers such as nurses and

68
00:04:27,827 --> 00:04:30,532
others that might be driving these differences.

69
00:04:30,532 --> 00:04:32,621
And then what I think is very important,

70
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:36,006
factories fragmented systems are clear that we have so quickly.

71
00:04:36,006 --> 00:04:40,974
The United States, we've got lots of very complex services that we can provide to

72
00:04:40,974 --> 00:04:46,166
people that involved multiple providers of care sites of care and lots of referrals.

73
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:50,880
The need for coordination and when those systems break down, when you're not well

74
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,741
coordinated, we often see that's what some of the racial disparities our largest.

75
00:04:55,741 --> 00:04:59,370
And it's all point to throughout the talk I think research in this field is

76
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,653
important for understanding the clinical and

77
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:03,834
policy solutions that we can bring to bear.

78
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:08,700
And while I won't go into depth, we can certainly talk to the discussion about

79
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,421
what the role of social determinants of health are and health disparities,

80
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:18,309
how they're driven by social as well as what happened the health care system.

81
00:05:18,309 --> 00:05:22,258
So we care about health disparities because we have important differences

82
00:05:22,258 --> 00:05:24,208
in health outcomes in this country.

83
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:29,287
So this is just one example of looking at trends in life expectancy for

84
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,187
black and white black and white women.

85
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:36,376
Life expectancy has been proving for all groups since 1975 and

86
00:05:36,376 --> 00:05:41,160
has been on the right hand side of the slide that shows the life expectancy gap

87
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,982
between whites and blacks.

88
00:05:42,982 --> 00:05:47,654
And that started out at a fairly substantial level about 6-7 and

89
00:05:47,654 --> 00:05:52,993
a half years forward and, did the gap actually bumped up in the 1990s and

90
00:05:52,993 --> 00:05:55,262
has been improving since then.

91
00:05:55,262 --> 00:05:59,370
We now have data through about 2000 and 10, it shows some continued

92
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,626
gradual improvement, but what was about a 7.5 year difference in life.

93
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:08,409
Expectancy 40 years ago is now about 3.5 difference year difference in life

94
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:11,023
expectancy was still fairly substantial.

95
00:06:11,023 --> 00:06:12,339
And important for

96
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:17,697
us to think about what's the health care system in addressing that gap.

97
00:06:17,697 --> 00:06:22,395
And I just want to say feel free to ask questions as we go along and

98
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:24,975
what question were perspective.

99
00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:31,325
So the slides I'm showing, you just speak up as we go and

100
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:36,472
we also have time for questions yeah anyone.

101
00:06:36,472 --> 00:06:41,471
So to the sentence been studied, I think it's a combination

102
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:46,469
of probably the biggest driver was inner city violence and,

103
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:50,307
there violence and particularly unrelated.

104
00:06:50,307 --> 00:06:55,551
Summit was also related to HIV in the early 90s, the HIV epidemic of the US

105
00:06:55,551 --> 00:07:00,463
was really taking off and it was in 1976 where we first appropriate

106
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:05,977
inhibitors market which were the first highly effective treatments for HIV.

107
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:11,123
All right as well as in the late 90s, a lot of major

108
00:07:11,123 --> 00:07:17,239
cities started to pay more attention to yes the main as well.

109
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:21,052
And what's interesting is in the last 5-7 years or so

110
00:07:21,052 --> 00:07:25,852
for the first time we've actually seen a worsening life expectancy.

111
00:07:25,852 --> 00:07:29,354
Particularly amongst lower income white and

112
00:07:29,354 --> 00:07:35,294
that seems to be driven largely by the opioid epidemic of opioid misuse.

113
00:07:35,294 --> 00:07:39,875
Yeah and other, drug related deaths they're referring to

114
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:45,111
the following countries, particularly in rural areas one lower.

115
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:48,853
So that's something I'm going health care system and

116
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:53,830
I'm thinking not just about racing in this city, but what's the role?

117
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:58,561
Right ST okay sorry, all right so,

118
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,976
we put this in context of sort of,

119
00:08:02,976 --> 00:08:08,672
what's the historical work in this area?

120
00:08:08,672 --> 00:08:13,207
I I Started this timeline in 1985 because it was the first time the federal

121
00:08:13,207 --> 00:08:17,185
government issued a major reported by the Secretary of Health and

122
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:20,559
Human Services on Minority health in the United States.

123
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:25,249
Really outlined everything that was known through that during the mid 1980s,

124
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:29,336
upgrading this president and said that this was an issue that the federal

125
00:08:29,336 --> 00:08:32,284
government started starting to be to be addressed.

126
00:08:32,284 --> 00:08:36,128
In part this was 20 years after the Medicare and

127
00:08:36,128 --> 00:08:39,608
Medicaid programmes have been founder yeah.

128
00:08:39,608 --> 00:08:43,693
Those programmes alone has certainly improved access to care for

129
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:46,091
minority Americans to the African.

130
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:51,700
Yeah, but it has not eliminated the disparities and helped out why that led to

131
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:57,408
about 20 years of work really describing the problem and this was right now.

132
00:08:57,408 --> 00:09:01,361
And you mentioned to my interest in large healthcare databases and a lot of those

133
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:05,196
databases started to become available to researchers in the late eighties.

134
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:10,109
And the 19 nineties and allows us to get a much broader sense of how health care is

135
00:09:10,109 --> 00:09:14,387
being delivered in United States and pretty much everywhere we look.

136
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:19,071
Although it might vary by location and by age when we look at whether minority

137
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:23,699
Americans receiving equivalent quality care or equivalent health care.

138
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:26,198
And we almost always saw despair and

139
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:30,949
that leads to what I would call the second phase of work in this area.

140
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:35,418
Which is understanding what are the mediators underlying causes these

141
00:09:35,418 --> 00:09:39,527
differences and what effect the differences in health care out?

142
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:43,620
That's an area where there is continuing to be attention sort of look

143
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,445
across the board and look at how things are hi and

144
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:49,211
what we've really been over the last decade.

145
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:52,671
I think we'll be sort of firmly focused over the next decade.

146
00:09:52,671 --> 00:09:56,736
Now that we know so much about healthcare disparities, what are the effective

147
00:09:56,736 --> 00:10:00,690
interventions either within the healthcare system or in society at large?

148
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,650
They could reduce and eliminate disparity right this is

149
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:09,660
the conceptual model it's fairly simple but

150
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,786
still want to some of the essential elements.

151
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:16,330
When we think about health care disparities organised,

152
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:19,404
we're talking about patient factors for patient characteristic,

153
00:10:19,404 --> 00:10:21,207
the race and ethnicity of our patients.

154
00:10:21,207 --> 00:10:26,611
Their age, their language, their insurance coverage, and their education and,

155
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:30,950
patients are not just individual characteristics, every one of us

156
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:36,066
the combination of all the different parts of our backs bring your healthcare.

157
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:40,754
Those individual factors are very much influenced by the communities

158
00:10:40,754 --> 00:10:41,866
where we live and

159
00:10:41,866 --> 00:10:47,359
oftentimes people tend to live with folks like themselves in the neighbourhoods.

160
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:52,197
And those communities can influence both the the health habits of those

161
00:10:52,197 --> 00:10:56,318
around you as well as the health system sources have access.

162
00:10:56,318 --> 00:11:00,792
To what position helps impossible for located in your area,

163
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:04,135
how committed are they to serving your area?

164
00:11:04,135 --> 00:11:06,149
What we see is that the quality of care,

165
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:10,242
which is what you're studying in this course is influenced both by who you are,

166
00:11:10,242 --> 00:11:13,624
your patient characteristics as well as where you receive care.

167
00:11:13,624 --> 00:11:19,068
Which scaring you and ideally we hope that the better your quality of care is,

168
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:23,174
the better your health I think that's always striving for

169
00:11:23,174 --> 00:11:27,558
the healthcare system, but we don't know obtain that goal.

170
00:11:27,558 --> 00:11:32,442
And then finally, there's an arrow across the top of this diagram going

171
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:37,420
directly from to get home naturally to capture the social determinants.

172
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:42,956
No matter how good the healthcare is that we deliver people if they live in poor

173
00:11:42,956 --> 00:11:48,764
neighbourhoods with inadequate resources before air quality, water quality.

174
00:11:48,764 --> 00:11:53,328
When at the present time yet to get there or, not good housing or

175
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:58,843
economic opportunity for good schools and all those factors will influence

176
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:04,032
people's health independently of the health care that they receive.

177
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:09,092
We hope that good healthcare, can alleviate some of those things,

178
00:12:09,092 --> 00:12:11,679
health consequences of poverty.

179
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:17,331
We also have to address, wow, while we're thinking about that therapy,

180
00:12:17,331 --> 00:12:22,894
have you seen any impact of gentrification on the okay C equals the first or

181
00:12:22,894 --> 00:12:28,478
have you seen the impact of gentrification recently, gentrification.

182
00:12:28,478 --> 00:12:31,604
I think that it can be a mixed bag if, for example,

183
00:12:31,604 --> 00:12:36,447
if it would gentrification being generally when higher income people moving

184
00:12:36,447 --> 00:12:39,963
into the lower income, they were typically in cities.

185
00:12:39,963 --> 00:12:45,140
Is that I, it could have, for people who are able to stay in

186
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:50,109
that neighbourhood I think it has consequences that have

187
00:12:50,109 --> 00:12:55,519
improved the quality in the park, health care facilities.

188
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,189
I think we're that that pushes lower out of the neighbourhood maybe

189
00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:04,710
where they had a lot of social support organisation and then have.

190
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:09,729
To move into even more progress if they can't stay

191
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:15,233
where they are as property values are rising, right?

192
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:20,730
To kind of, so, it's a little bit of a break that you have to look for

193
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,396
in each case thank you specifically saying,

194
00:13:24,396 --> 00:13:27,787
what's happening really work, right?

195
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:32,467
Yeah so this is the history of medicine report that for

196
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:37,771
those of you who are particularly interested in this topic,

197
00:13:37,771 --> 00:13:41,310
the report now is 12 or 13 years old.

198
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:46,225
But it really felt a landmark report in terms of summarising what's driving

199
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,388
these healthcare disparities.

200
00:13:48,388 --> 00:13:53,316
And this was actually the report, the Congressional Black caucus called on into

201
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:57,025
medicine affair and they worked on it over a couple of years.

202
00:13:57,025 --> 00:14:01,682
And it really come to two main conclusions although there's much more content and

203
00:14:01,682 --> 00:14:05,866
evidence supporting this first the racial ethnic disparities in care for

204
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:07,972
associated with forcing outcomes.

205
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:13,300
So we just saw differences in care, but no difference in outcomes, we wouldn't be so

206
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,110
concerned because there's a clear lengths between lower quality of care and

207
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,553
those differences are unacceptable.

208
00:14:20,553 --> 00:14:24,249
And secondly, the disparities we see within healthcare

209
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:27,562
reflect broader inequality in american society.

210
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:32,916
So it's not just that health care is a problem, but other aspects society or

211
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:38,020
not in many ways, healthcare has an opportunity to lead the way in trying

212
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,976
to address issues like this in education and housing, the justices.

213
00:14:42,976 --> 00:14:47,980
And that was a strong position of the committee and one of the contributions

214
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,519
of this report was to try and bring some clarity and understanding.

215
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:57,048
To the different terminology that this was the use of in this building,

216
00:14:57,048 --> 00:15:00,153
a lot of studies that found differences in care.

217
00:15:00,153 --> 00:15:04,089
So we compare two groups if they differ on any characteristic,

218
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:06,777
you might pick gender, race, language.

219
00:15:06,777 --> 00:15:11,070
And we find that one group shown in blue gets more services than another group

220
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,574
showing and the outset, all we know is that's a difference.

221
00:15:14,574 --> 00:15:18,624
It's not necessarily a disparity because as I mentioned earlier,

222
00:15:18,624 --> 00:15:22,105
some of that difference could be explained by James okay,

223
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:27,375
in the appropriateness of individuals for certain services and in their preferences.

224
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,701
And if those were the main factors driving the difference,

225
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:34,958
we would generally consider that acceptable and not part of the disparity,

226
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,699
which are the lower tubes on the right hand side.

227
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:41,170
So if our healthcare system is designed in a way that creates,

228
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:45,604
creates structural barriers to good quality of care if people are uninsured.

229
00:15:45,604 --> 00:15:49,541
Or they don't have good quality providers in their communities,

230
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,732
that becomes part of the disparity.

231
00:15:51,732 --> 00:15:54,875
And then the third box is interpersonal, but

232
00:15:54,875 --> 00:16:00,253
the committee labelled discrimination and that's when bias or stereotyping

233
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:05,978
influences how patients are treated by their providers benefit a personal look.

234
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:10,886
And so it's a combination of interpersonal factors and

235
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:16,639
systemic, which contributed to the disparity when it's nice.

236
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,531
Around that same time, another instrument crossing the quality chasm and and

237
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:28,968
and what would it take to bring us forward to have a consistently high, high quality.

238
00:16:28,968 --> 00:16:33,549
And what this committee said was that equitable care is one of six core aims for

239
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:35,961
achieving this height, high quality.

240
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,958
And it was a crosscutting game approximately the other things we look for

241
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,985
our healthcare system to be, which is effective, efficient,

242
00:16:43,985 --> 00:16:45,790
timely, safe and efficient centre.

243
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:51,233
So if we have disparities, any of those other five components of care,

244
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:57,060
then we don't have an equitable system high quality parents are persistent
