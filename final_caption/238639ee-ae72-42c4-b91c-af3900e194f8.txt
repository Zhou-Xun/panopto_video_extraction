1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:06,739
Okay. I accidentally stopped recording the lecture.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,000
So this is in two parts for the people who aren't here today wondering what happened.

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:18,710
Let's start with group one, Sarah Page, Chloe, Swati, who's reporting for us.

4
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:29,240
I can. Okay. And I chose to do like a blue collar Hispanic immigrant worker.

5
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:39,440
And we're talking about some of the inside activities that are like their socioeconomic status,

6
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,450
facing barriers to education and accessible health care,

7
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:55,879
and also having incompetent providers in health care and poor living conditions and just isolation from their family or

8
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:03,410
who support system between like cultural and social isolation and language barriers that can affect multiple things.

9
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:12,800
And then I would say activities which just feel like policies about infectious diseases that can create these disparities,

10
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:19,550
their geographic location and just xenophobia from community members and workers.

11
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:27,500
Thank you. Does anybody have any thoughts or contributions to this ecosystem that.

12
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,770
This one is that you picked a challenging one, but a good one because, I mean,

13
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,249
I think definitely accessibility to health care resources is a challenge,

14
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:44,670
especially because they might be doing some kind of work that doesn't necessarily come with like health insurance.

15
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:51,090
And then you have to be able to find like pay cash only or money order or something

16
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,479
to a provider who's willing to just accept that we don't talk about it in this class,

17
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:06,810
but, you know, just say this. The worker is they're like, we have permits that allow people to do seasonal work here in the United States.

18
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:17,489
And then when they seasonally go back, if you go if you're from Mexico, for example, antibiotics are in pharmaceuticals are highly not regulated.

19
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,750
They're like the way they are here.

20
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,419
So you can just cross the border and get like penicillin without prescription, all these drugs without a prescription.

21
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:35,819
Right. And then come back. So oftentimes, like they'll delay their care until they're back into their home country and then can do whatever they can.

22
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,470
But this is definitely a major issue.

23
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,550
Xenophobia from the communities, probably huge depending on where they live.

24
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:51,270
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Group two on malaria.

25
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,460
Yeah. So I think we can all share a little bit, but but yeah.

26
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:01,920
So we, we talked about malaria and our individual is someone living in rural subsaharan Africa.

27
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:07,770
So the inner circle is kind of focused on the individual risk factors.

28
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:16,170
So we talked about this is to care. So if you're living in a rural area, you may not be able to access health care and health care facility as easily.

29
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,889
And then there's also the exposure to mosquitoes.

30
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,160
We divided that into two parts.

31
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:33,180
So like there's the exposure to mosquitoes and standing water, but there's also how accessible or how available is mosquito prevention or protection.

32
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:39,989
So things like mosquito nets or, you know, anti-malarial medications, for example.

33
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:46,770
So those those are the two different parts to like mosquito contact in particular.

34
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:57,770
And then we provided some distill factors like we talked about distance to carry being an individual more like perhaps more risk factor.

35
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,120
But then you've got this whole kind of like overarching factor, which is accessibility to care.

36
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:08,489
Um, and then we also discussed, so like funding for malaria comes from a variety of sources,

37
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:17,540
but you don't really have an individual control over that that's kind of outside of your, um, what kind of encompasses your capacities.

38
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:21,000
And then we've got a population structure and like the dependency ratio.

39
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,430
Cause, um,

40
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:32,160
would you mind explaining what the dependency ratio is if somebody else like the dependency ratio is like in terms of your population structure.

41
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,970
So if you have a high dependency ratio, that means you have a lot of people who are really young.

42
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,490
So below working age as a 0 to 15, I think that's how it's defined.

43
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:46,119
And then also really old people. So I don't know, 65 and about for example.

44
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:53,309
So if you have a high dependency ratio, more of your population is susceptible to malaria because you have a lot of

45
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,410
immunocompromised older people and also a lot of immunocompromised younger people.

46
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,570
And the biggest risk factor to getting malaria is children under five,

47
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:11,550
so that if you have a high dependency ratio to have a lot of people susceptible to, so different countries have different population structure.

48
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:19,020
So if you have a lot of really young people like a lot of sub-Saharan African countries do, then there's going to be more malaria.

49
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,520
Yeah. Of thank you. Very clear explanation.

50
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:31,760
If you go and see a world book, it's always quite an interesting to look at like how the age distribution of different countries are.

51
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,710
As you look at a country like Japan, for example, versus like Malawi, always very interesting.

52
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,150
Okay. And then last but not least, group three.

53
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,180
Yeah, it kind of feels like a cluster. That's okay. That's okay.

54
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,730
But ecosystem mapping is what you make of it. So you have an elderly person.

55
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,350
Okay. Yes.

56
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,620
So we chose an elderly person. We actually didn't know if we should do elderly population, elderly person, the person's name person.

57
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:13,510
Okay, great. Yeah. So we're our bigger circles with the bolded text or kind of our broad topics that we want to cover.

58
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:19,870
And then the little, little tiny circles within it are just components of the broader topic, but they kind of all intersect.

59
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:30,459
So for instance, an elderly person during the week and we put it in the context of COVID, so they had limited health care access.

60
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:37,060
Since you were dissuaded from going to the hospital, since they were focusing on so much other stuff.

61
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,830
And so the we people transitioned to telehealth.

62
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:48,550
But like if you had a lack of Internet access that could influence if you could do the telehealth appointments,

63
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,260
they also were totally equivalent to in-person appointments.

64
00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:00,250
And then we talked about how there's there is a delay of even appointment times because so many people were transitioning to this.

65
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,140
And we talked about pharmacies closing earlier,

66
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:10,060
having restricted time so you can pick up your medication or maybe you can get your prescription renewed.

67
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,339
And then, of course, like as just an aging population,

68
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:22,540
you have all these other health concerns that that could be exacerbated because nobody you don't get to your appointment.

69
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:34,059
Um yeah know there's been talk about 00i guess the cultural expectations out there

70
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:43,000
just because how people view caregiving especially for older individuals in a family,

71
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:54,870
differ between cultures. Um, like don't know for um, my family personally like my parents would rather be dead than put into retirement.

72
00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:02,350
Oh yeah. Yeah. You just don't come in I guess I think communities sentiment and so there is that

73
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:08,910
as I said the vaccine hesitancy that varies between different countries and,

74
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:22,510
and the associated mistrust of medical professionals, um, as well as informal caregivers with people in your, you know, taking care of you oftentimes.

75
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:35,710
And, um, and also that type of environment, whether you're living in a multi-generational household or if you're living in a nursing home.

76
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:41,140
And then in that with the quality of nursing applications.

77
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,219
Thank you. Yeah, thank you.

78
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:50,140
You brought up a lot of good points, I think, at the beginning of the pandemic when before what was like a global pandemic,

79
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,310
Italy in particular was hit super hard and they were like, what's going on in Italy?

80
00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:04,360
And it's because they live in multigenerational households from like grandkids, great grandkids all the way to great grandparents.

81
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,739
And those people going in and now were subsequently infecting the elderly.

82
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:16,330
But interestingly, I just did I had a study that I worked with and I talked with a couple of colleagues where we looked at data from

83
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:24,070
the National Retirement Survey looking at nonworking versus working elders during the COVID 19 pandemic early on,

84
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,460
and like social support versus spending.

85
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:39,909
And those who were not working actually ended up spending more than those who were working and those who were working had less social support,

86
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,830
interestingly, which I guess kind of makes sense because when you're like not working out more

87
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:49,540
free time to do like online shopping or like fix your house or do whatever,

88
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:57,879
but then those who are not working relied more on like the community their work provides rather than seeking out social support.

89
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,750
So yeah, just want to share that. Okay.

90
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,860
Thank you, everybody. I will see you on Thursday.
