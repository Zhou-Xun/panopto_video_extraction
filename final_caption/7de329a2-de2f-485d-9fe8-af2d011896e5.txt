1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,290
Reminder, you have a perusal assignment due this Sunday. It's the second one.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,820
Just one article. So make sure to do that. And then I don't think.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,690
And then we won't be meeting on Tuesday because of fall break.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,730
Okay. So I actually didn't queue up videos.

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:28,660
I'll do that later. Okay. So I'm going to pick up where we left off last last time.

6
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:39,070
I realize in hindsight now that Dr. Ford's lecture would have fit a lot better after immediately after we discussed survey methodology,

7
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:46,570
but he was not free until now. So next year, I'm going to see if we can get him closer to that gap.

8
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:53,379
The person who used to do the guest lecture for me used to work as the state epidemiologist

9
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:59,740
for Nebraska and focused more on life occupational therapy in workplace health promotion.

10
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,159
So that's why it would kind of fit within this like weeks being.

11
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:09,070
But his lectures seem like very rude to me.

12
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,630
Yeah, I met every class last semester, but also a.

13
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,600
Uh, Dr. Robbins class, I think six of three.

14
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,530
He does talk a lot about occupational poverty. Oh, in an hour.

15
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,170
It's okay. Okay. Okay. So was it like a useful review?

16
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,460
It was like, oh, okay.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,290
Okay. Because it's been it's been a much longer time for me and I feel like a little better explaining the concepts on other people.

18
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:53,210
But no. Did you, um, so in terms of a conceptual framework used for looking at the relationship between work and health.

19
00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:01,399
Originally they had developed this comprehensive model of stress and health back in the 1962,

20
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:07,130
and then it was updated again in 1978, and it was developed here at the University of Michigan.

21
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:16,280
So they look at this interplay between environmental, social and organization, individual factors, as they influence employee health.

22
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:26,840
So here is the conceptual framework that was developed and it's called it's just called the conceptual framework for work, stress and health.

23
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:38,030
So for individual resources, they pick they choose to underscore interesting aspects like energy and vitality, personality factors, coping skills.

24
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:45,950
And then for physical, social and organizational conditions, they list potential stressors that you might have at work,

25
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:56,780
and then adverse consequences for employee health appraisal and then coping responses and then social and organizational responses.

26
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,889
Again, this is a much older model.

27
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:06,590
So if they were to update it, like, what do you think might be different now?

28
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:30,600
I think there would be probably less major acute events generally because more I feel like more people are transitioning to white collar positions.

29
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:37,190
Yeah. Yeah. Among other thought thoughts.

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,190
Okay. We'll keep going. So how do we actually change things?

31
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:58,450
So in terms of targets for change with different levels, you can start all the way at the individual level and go to the policy level.

32
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,320
So this is kind of using the social ecological model to implement change.

33
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:09,309
So if we are trying to implement change in the workplace, if we wanted to target individual health in terms of wellbeing,

34
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,350
you might think of things like disease management programs or employee assistance programs.

35
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,780
And then you can kind of target short term responses to stress, which we'll get into.

36
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:29,379
And then how they appraise work in particular in terms of perceived social support, stress, job control, organizational fairness.

37
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:36,430
And then if you're moving up to the interpersonal level, you might want to target coworker behaviors like team building,

38
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:42,370
supervisory practices, and then job tasks moving up to the organizational level.

39
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:48,969
You might think about employee reward systems, organizational communication strategies and H.R.

40
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:57,100
Policies. And then if you're looking at public policy and legislation in particular promulgating rules about work hours,

41
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,679
minimum wage laws and environmental standards,

42
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,240
which again, this varies from state to state depending if they have a federal OSHA plan or a state OSHA plan.

43
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:14,319
So in California in particular, if we're thinking about like minimum wage laws and then work hours in California,

44
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,899
employees get two paid 15 minute breaks and a paid half an hour lunch.

45
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:28,030
I don't think they get that here. Okay. You know, the lunches and lunches, unpaid breaks are loosely enforced unless you're a minor.

46
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:37,960
Oh, okay. That sounds about right. Have you ever worked at a place that had a good employee rewards?

47
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,620
So. You specify?

48
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,950
Like what? Not. I'm not like a Pete.

49
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,210
Not like pizza or a T-shirt. I guess we're like bonuses.

50
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,860
Like, if you work in industry, even bonuses would be considered an employee reward system,

51
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,669
like your tops, legacy style real estate, and you're a top seller.

52
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,250
So like get a Christmas bonus or something like that.

53
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:06,930
My last job at the grocery store at H-E-B, they did an amazing job that really like during the pandemic they raised across the board,

54
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:12,719
everybody's paid like $3 per hour and then they're just like, Oh, we're gonna keep this.

55
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,710
Actually, it's like, you guys were working a lot better, so I paid more.

56
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:24,239
Who would add that? Yeah. So they did a really, really good job about, you know, we did a good quarter.

57
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,170
So here's the quarter. Like the money we made back. Oh yeah.

58
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:40,110
For Kroger, in contrast. So Kroger, you know, during the height of the pandemic, gave hazard pay and increased pay for their workers.

59
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:50,910
And then immediately when the case numbers started to go down, they reverted and the CEO gave himself a giant bonus at Starbucks.

60
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:59,910
We had hazard pay for like a month, I think, because they shut down most of the stores and you gotta if you're still working there.

61
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:06,030
That time I was a and then when we reopened he still got it for like a month, but they like took that away.

62
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,409
I don't know if it counts within a pandemic, but then they were like, you get a free meal every day,

63
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:19,100
even if you're not working and like a drink, like a like a protein box, there was like whatever food item you wanted.

64
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,740
Oh, I thought they had, but yeah.

65
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,190
But then I was like working six days a week, so it wasn't that nice.

66
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,090
Was the hazard pay significant enough to make a difference in your life?

67
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,260
No. Okay. Was your pay increase enough?

68
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:39,530
Okay. Yeah, I ran as many hours as I could with that.

69
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,880
Okay. Did you get free meals or anything?

70
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,850
Most of the time there was just meals there. Oh, we had a really good boss.

71
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:52,500
He cared about employees, so. Okay. Is it different from store to store?

72
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,389
I would say some, yeah. From like the lunch always being provided for employees.

73
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:03,360
That's not found anywhere, I would say for them. But no it was, it was company wide come.

74
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,410
Oh wow. Yeah. Well the H-E-B family, they really.

75
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,220
They're good I've heard. Yeah. I need to know. Yeah.

76
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,330
Amazing. It's a great grocery store here.

77
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:24,719
Yeah. Like as a professor, every university has different models of funding, you know?

78
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:34,200
So, like, depending on who you are, the professors, more of their salary comes from, like, tuition dollars and things like that.

79
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,250
Almost none of my salary comes from tuition dollars because I get grants.

80
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,700
But like the more grants that you have,

81
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:50,729
the more if you meet a certain threshold where you've covered your summer salary and you've paid back, you know,

82
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,360
a cut to the school because the school takes a cut and then your department takes a cut,

83
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,019
and then some money goes back to what we call our discretionary funds.

84
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:05,070
Like if you've if you done all that and then you've exceeded a certain threshold, then you might get extra money.

85
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:16,170
But you have to be like really thinking kill in the game like a multi-million dollar are ones, which doesn't happen very often.

86
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,480
So the rich just get as into society.

87
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,290
Okay, so key questions when you're having an occupational health and safety intervention,

88
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:33,810
what adverse health conditions are actually being experienced by the employees unless you have an ONS?

89
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:41,940
Well, you must you have an onsite safety manager or like industrial hygiene professional or an onsite health clinic,

90
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,900
which only certain types of places have those kinds of resources.

91
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,399
There's really no way for you to know unless you survey the workers directly.

92
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,620
Right? Because it's not like you can talk to someone and pull like OSHA records for things like mental health.

93
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,140
They don't you don't record any mental health issues on an OSHA injury and illness logs.

94
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:06,630
What are the physical, social and organizational conditions that might be potential stressors?

95
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:11,460
Who's experiencing this? Is it subgroups or is it specific individuals?

96
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,700
And then how widespread is the perception?

97
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:21,510
So I'm sure, you know, we've all we've been at workplaces or even had like classes or classmates where it's like,

98
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:30,180
you know, there just might be one person who's like very negative and dislikes everything regardless.

99
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,130
But there's also some, okay, there's, you know, that might just be a personality thing,

100
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,560
but sometimes there might be one person who's willing to speak out and then.

101
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,069
Everybody's like, I also feel this way. And then you mobilize.

102
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:52,060
And that frequently happens, you know, when you try to do unionization, for example, or get better, like working conditions.

103
00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:01,240
So this could be another thing that's to. And then to what extent are these perceptions linked to short term or long term adverse outcomes?

104
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:06,940
Can we actually modify the stressor? And then if the stressor cannot be reduced,

105
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:14,770
what are the individual and social resources that are effective buffers against the adverse effects of the stressors?

106
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:21,910
So a modifiable stressor, for example, may be something like bad leadership, right?

107
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:27,730
Bad leadership is causing everybody's job to be crappier and much more difficult.

108
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,270
The easy thing would to be get rid of the bad leader, which they frequently don't do.

109
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:39,550
I just say, but like a non modifiable stressor would be you're a firefighter.

110
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,800
And when you respond to fire calls that is stressful for you.

111
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:51,160
There's no way for us to really modify that stressor because it is literally your entire job.

112
00:11:51,940 --> 00:12:00,940
But we might work on things, for example, that are buffers, like, for example, cardiovascular fitness with firefighters in particular.

113
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:08,050
Once they move up in the ranks, they don't get called to the front line as often, so they become more sedentary.

114
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,229
And so I do some work with firefighters.

115
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:21,459
They become more sedentary and prone to injury because they mostly do like desk work after they move into like a captain range or a lieutenant rank,

116
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:28,510
for example. So most of the injuries experienced by firefighters aren't in responding to actual fires.

117
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:37,780
It's either off duty or when they're just like working out at the gym because every fire station has its own like gym room.

118
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,629
So you could work on cardiovascular fitness, you could work on mental resiliency,

119
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:50,940
you could get them connected to therapy because they probably see a lot of firsthand trauma, but also a lot of secondary trauma as well.

120
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,110
So these are all buffers, right?

121
00:12:53,410 --> 00:13:03,160
But this criteria of the five questions in terms of developing an organ intervention is rarely systematically applied.

122
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,300
Right. So generally, you would kind of go step by step to think through the questions.

123
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,659
But most people just kind of like jump to one,

124
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:17,760
or they choose to address something without like an evidence base because it's like the easiest thing to address, right?

125
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:27,759
So, you know, in the health and the occupational health field, we use something called the hierarchy of controls.

126
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,880
I'm sure you've seen it. You've all seen this. They put it up.

127
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,180
Okay, I did. Sorry, but this is good.

128
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,500
But it is not integrated all any social ecological model perspective.

129
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:48,700
So if we're trying to go for individual level change, right, usually this is trying to change employee beliefs or attitudes or behaviors.

130
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:56,290
So you might use a theory of social influence like the social cognitive theory or the theory of reason action,

131
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:03,280
reasoned action approach, theory of plan behavior, trans theoretical model of change or protection motivation theory.

132
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:09,069
Now, you might do this for something like employees who smoke, right?

133
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:14,200
Because employees who smoke inherently are going to be less healthy and probably

134
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,030
have other co-morbidities that require them to use their health insurance more,

135
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:26,620
which then costs more for the employer. So it does benefit the employer for employees not to smoke.

136
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:34,230
Smoking isn't as prevalent here, but when I worked at Indiana University every year when we, you know,

137
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:41,440
decided it was open enrollment and we had to elect our benefits again, we got to sign a smoking affidavit,

138
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,830
which was if you attest that you don't smoke and it's literally just like a PDF form,

139
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:57,010
if you attest you don't smoke, your monthly health insurance premium rate goes from like $53 to like $25.

140
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,480
So it's cut in half basically by the fact that you don't smoke.

141
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:12,969
But, you know, if we're thinking about wanting to change something else that is like like individual level change theories are fine,

142
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,290
but they're not the most effective in terms of getting widespread change.

143
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:25,960
Organizational level change. There's sometimes several factors that inhibit the application of these theories.

144
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:34,530
So a lot of times the outcomes are for the interest of the organization rather than the health of the employee.

145
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:40,030
So it's targeted at making the the the workplace itself more profitable or better.

146
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:46,620
And it or over emphasizes the organizational context on the change process.

147
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:53,759
So a lot of adapting rather than adaptation where they try to apply the same model in a grocery store.

148
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,760
Right. That they would in a manufacturing facility.

149
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:03,930
So generally, most occupational places will use what they call Leone's three stages of change,

150
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:13,110
where you unfreeze an old behavior, try to move towards a new behavior, and then refreeze and stabilize the new behavior.

151
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,010
And this is what they call a force field analysis.

152
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:24,480
This is a metaphorical force field that identifies major forces, that facilitates in hinders change.

153
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:34,350
Before you implement Leone's three stages of change, I try to think of an example.

154
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,799
You know, I would say Michigan Medicine is a good example.

155
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,410
So take like COVID 19, for example.

156
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:53,340
Like the pandemic has changed the way processes are implemented, right to protect not only like patient health, but worker health.

157
00:16:53,730 --> 00:17:00,660
So unfreezing an old behavior might be something like the way patients check in and then moving to

158
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:06,420
a new behavior might be something like more like e check in and the use of plexiglass barriers.

159
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:15,240
And now even though like technically we are are in the late stages of a pandemic, but people consider it to be over.

160
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:24,870
You'll notice a lot of workplaces or like places where people go to in public, still have plexiglass and a lot of these COVID precautions.

161
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:28,440
But I've also noticed some places that have just straight up like taken them down.

162
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,959
So they were not successful at refreezing or stabilizing a new behavior and they might not have wanted to you.

163
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:42,420
Honestly, yeah, but nothing is successful without proper participation.

164
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:50,940
So in terms of choice points for employee participation, you have to kind of look at the scope of the initiative.

165
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:56,420
What's the range of issues? Is there a participatory battery process anticipated?

166
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,820
Is it indefinitely or is it over a discrete period of time?

167
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,170
And then will participation be mandatory or voluntary?

168
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:19,230
What kind of training will you provide? And then the extent organizational structures and processes will be modified to encourage participation.

169
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:28,840
That's great. Okay.

170
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,680
That's all I had for that one. Any questions or come emails?

171
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,340
Any questions or comments before I move on to the next part?

172
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,910
Yeah. Okay. Now, let me just cue up some videos.

173
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:59,240
Cat videos. Okay. It didn't get to at all because we got into that spicy debate about what is a health behavior on Tuesday.

174
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,410
How can you bring that up? You need to bring it back up again.

175
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,570
Okay. I was not smart enough to include the URL for myself.

176
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:30,250
Okay. They're just okay.

177
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:42,690
All right. Economic loss of working conditions.

178
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:54,720
So here in the United States in particular, eight out of ten Americans say they sometimes or frequently encounter stress in the workplace.

179
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,790
I'm wondering who those two out of ten Americans are and what they do.

180
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:05,940
What what kind of job would you have where you would don't regularly encounter stress?

181
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:11,100
Usually it's so much and I don't know anybody like that.

182
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:17,549
Well, I know someone like that, like my supervisor for like my food service jobs in college.

183
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:22,630
And she still got stressed. Yeah. She loved her job so much, but she's still that stressed about it.

184
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,620
But people also, they just don't care at all. That's true.

185
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:35,110
There are some people whose mental mentality is like nothing really bugs them or like, I'm just here for a paycheck kind of situation.

186
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:41,860
Yeah, that's that's potential. I'm trying to think like if you work independently, maybe, but there's still stress.

187
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:47,080
But yes, no deadlines to have books to balance all that kind of stuff.

188
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,650
I do think some people's personalities are just like that.

189
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:56,799
Yeah, it's this can be me. A stress related illness, though.

190
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:02,650
An injury is estimated to cost the United States $300 billion per year.

191
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:09,850
And this is direct and indirect costs. So we do have things like stress related illnesses, injuries from accidents,

192
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:15,910
but then you have something called absenteeism, employee turnover, and then lower productivity.

193
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:25,420
We also have something called presenteeism. So presenteeism is when you are physically present at work, but like mentally you're not you're not there.

194
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,899
So that is considered an indirect cost as well because you're less likely to be productive.

195
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,590
Right. Um, and additionally,

196
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:44,170
they estimate that 40% of job turnover is due to stress 50% greater health expenditures

197
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,629
due to workers who report self-report high levels of stress and replacing it.

198
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:57,310
An average employee costs 120 to 200% of the salary of the position affected.

199
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:03,010
I think we've seen this frequently during COVID or like high stress jobs in particular,

200
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:10,630
where like somebody who's working a lot and is super stressful, quit and rather than like a 1 to 1 replacement,

201
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:15,849
now there's like three jobs to replace that one job because that person was

202
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:22,810
essentially like doing the job of three people or the cost also comes from like the,

203
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:29,770
the, the lag period that you have in like retraining an employee again and getting them acquainted with the organization.

204
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:36,940
It costs money to put job posts out there. It costs person time to conduct interviews and go through this process.

205
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:43,600
So generally, people try to retain employees if they can,

206
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:50,889
although sometimes you see people just don't cut losses like in the federal government, it's very difficult to fire people.

207
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,550
So you'll see employees with all different levels of work ethics.

208
00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:01,030
Their absenteeism is estimated to cost $3.6 million per year,

209
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:08,710
and depression is the single largest predictor of absenteeism and work related performance.

210
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:16,100
Yeah. Um. Can anybody relate?

211
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:28,900
I remember we're going to say something. Oh, I remember pre-pandemic when I used to come to the office five days a week.

212
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:35,190
Can you believe I? I probably worked from home once.

213
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:43,390
One day out of every three months. This was at a university I didn't have, and I wasn't on the tenure track.

214
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,520
But I felt like super guilty every time I did.

215
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:53,800
But, you know, you also have people who frequently, like pre-pandemic, would call out sick.

216
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:58,090
Right. Because they didn't feel like going to work that day because they, like, hate their job.

217
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:06,170
Were like they hate their coworkers. What else do you think about depression?

218
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:12,950
I lost the train of thought. But for every $0.47 spent on treating depression.

219
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,770
In in, in in comparison, it actually costs $0.53 per dollar.

220
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:23,630
In terms of absenteeism presented theism and disability.

221
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:32,810
So obviously here there is this return on investment argument to treat depression, but people just don't want to address it in the workplace.

222
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,580
We'll talk more about that in future weeks.

223
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,989
The cost of doing nothing. So this came from the business case for a healthy workplace.

224
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,350
So this was from the Industrial Accident and Prevention Association.

225
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:50,630
They are European, so that's why things are spelt a little bit differently.

226
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:59,750
So unhealthy workplaces lead to work related stress and in turn it can encourage unhealthy lifestyle practices.

227
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:03,320
So turnover increases as people do nothing.

228
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,520
Litigation increases employee citizen satisfaction decreases.

229
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:15,110
Employee commitment decreases. Absenteeism increases, health insurance claims increase short and long term disability increase.

230
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,650
Depression increases. Productivity is down, costs are up.

231
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:25,760
So all around it costs a lot to just continue doing nothing and leaving things at the status quo.

232
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,420
And now we're kind of hearing about this phenomena of why quitting.

233
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:36,710
Have you all heard about that? Yeah. Have you would one of you care to explain it?

234
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:46,790
Quiet. Quitting. But now, now I really know enough to explain it.

235
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:54,860
I think it's just like slowly backing off more and more. And then until you just like you take longer on your your deadlines, you know,

236
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:59,150
you just kind of slowly slow down your work and tell you just don't show up anymore.

237
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,700
You still. Well, yeah. Or you still show up.

238
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:08,530
Yeah. You're just kind of waiting for them to, like, tell you leave or whatnot.

239
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:17,479
I don't know why. Quitting is basically like mentally deciding you're no longer going to put in more effort than is required of your job.

240
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,080
You're no longer going to go like, above and beyond.

241
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:25,729
You're just you're you're just here for the paycheck, right?

242
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:31,010
And that's it. Um, have I told you the story about my dad?

243
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:44,940
I told many stories. Okay. So my dad is now retired, but for 35 years, 36 years, almost 40 years, some somewhere in that range, 35 to 40 years.

244
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:50,550
He worked for the state of California as a research analyst for the Department of Insurance and Fraud.

245
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:57,930
Okay. What does that mean? Basically, he works with law enforcement to look at businesses who are not paying their taxes

246
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:03,200
or trying to defraud the government of California and then like busting them.

247
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:07,560
Basically, that was his favorite part was like when you go in and bust them.

248
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:13,469
And his favorite part was to target Asian businesses because frequently were cash only.

249
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,790
And I was like, Dad, what are you doing? You're hurting the community.

250
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:24,809
But he got so good at his job and there were a bunch of people who didn't do anything.

251
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:29,610
So the fact that he was like producing any deliverables was remarkable.

252
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:37,830
So close to the end of his retirement, right? Hypothetically, a state job is 40 hours a week, so that's 160 hours a month.

253
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:42,150
He was work. He was getting all of his work done in 10 hours, in a month.

254
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:48,389
But he would just go to the office to hide from my stepmom and like read the newspaper

255
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:52,830
and stock my friend's tax returns and tell me what my professors were making.

256
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:57,990
So, you know, he had kind of quiet quit it in that way.

257
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:03,620
But you have to work a certain amount of time and age to receive your pension for the state of California.

258
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:11,940
I think that's more of a common mentality now, too, with like Gen Z and millennials, because we did it.

259
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:17,010
We grew up with like in an environment where so many terrible things were happening,

260
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:21,209
economic recessions, we weren't told, like we were promised anything.

261
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:26,870
So it's like, why am I going to like bust my, you know, my hump essentially for capitalism?

262
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,970
So that's kind of what we got going here.

263
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:38,070
This was a systematic review where they looked at the cost of work related stress in mostly Western Europe,

264
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:47,160
and work related stress is considered a risk for industrialized countries and the cost estimates are

265
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,720
important for those of us who work in the field because we're trying to convey the magnitude of the problem.

266
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,420
So they looked at four items, which is human capital,

267
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:05,310
loss of productivity of a worker in a period of time when the worker exits the workforce due to illness or premature death or retirement,

268
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:11,099
friction costs, loss of potential output and then costs of years life loss.

269
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,820
So that's how they quantify the productivity loss.

270
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:24,600
And what they found is in the U.S., this was back in 2018, again, systematic review, 187 to 221 billion.

271
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:31,620
So that essentially breaks down to anywhere between 20 bucks to 1200 bucks per working person.

272
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:38,400
And productivity loss was associated with 70 to 90% of work related stress.

273
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:42,000
Health care and medical costs were 10 to 30%.

274
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:49,140
But again, these studies mostly focused on European countries, but they did put it in terms of U.S. dollars.

275
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:56,670
So thinking about other countries, like how do you think work related stress would look like in a place?

276
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:00,959
I don't know. I just put like Japan and India. But we can talk about other countries too.

277
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,730
Like like what? What do we think? Do you think you would look the same in other countries?

278
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:16,640
I think it would be different, especially the pandemic which Western European countries were talking about,

279
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:25,280
because like there are like the ones that have like I guess I don't know if any of them have like a four day workweek or like more.

280
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:29,530
I thought Sweden did okay. Or Finland.

281
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:33,260
The Scandinavian ones are always on the cutting edge. They know it's a.

282
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,040
That's right.

283
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:43,460
But even I have family members who live in Germany, for example, and their life work life balance is very different than here in the United States.

284
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:47,210
In Germany on Sunday, most things are closed.

285
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:50,990
Like even the grocery store. Yeah, yeah.

286
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:57,200
I hate that. You hate that. Oh, why would I remember to go to the grocery store?

287
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:06,349
Oh, most businesses I'm out of food. I now most businesses are closed on Sundays now and then.

288
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:11,690
Also, they take their summers very seriously, like summer.

289
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,299
They take it off, they go on vacation. Canada has like a week off or like a week,

290
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:24,080
and it's something that they all all employees of companies have to be closed for like one day for the summer.

291
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:28,220
One day. I don't know what a holiday day.

292
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:35,110
It could be a holiday. It's just like an extended weekend. I was talking, my boss was like, Oh, yeah, I am on the Canadian vacation, darling.

293
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:41,390
Okay. Um, I mean, here in the United States, even our holidays stuff is still open.

294
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,810
That's generally a time for stores to sell do sales.

295
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,110
Yeah. Right. Or even in Spain.

296
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,849
I have not been to Spain, but I heard that they take their afternoon siesta very seriously.

297
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:56,630
So businesses are generally closed during that window of time.

298
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:02,870
Mhm. Well I don't, I can't speak to what it's like in other countries.

299
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:07,910
What about China? Um, I think it's the same as U.S.

300
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:13,450
Oh, yeah. Even. It's in health care capitalism.

301
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:23,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Another study looking at modeling the economic burden of diseases immutable to stress at work.

302
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,420
This was in France.

303
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:35,049
So they looked at cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and they and its relationship with job strain and low control, depression,

304
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:42,850
morbidity and mortality with in terms of high job demands and then musculoskeletal disorders and back pain in terms of job satisfaction.

305
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:47,380
And their first hypothesis was based on the human capital theory.

306
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:55,630
Indirect costs are defined as the loss of production due to sick leave and premature deaths attributed to occupational stress.

307
00:32:55,990 --> 00:33:03,790
And then their second hypothesis was that indirect costs are restricted to pensions and compensation that would be paid by patients to their family,

308
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:11,440
blah, blah, blah, if if the origin of the reason they died was acknowledged as being caused by the workplace.

309
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:22,120
So if we're looking here and I've converted this from Euros, but also to adjust for inflation.

310
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:31,209
So if you're looking at hypothesis one, which is based on the human capital theory, the total costs of work related stress in France,

311
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:44,770
if you look at medical costs, total cost of sick leave and then cost of premature death and then total cost, it's about 1.26 billion, which is a lot.

312
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:52,870
And then if you look at their second hypothesis, which is being able to attribute it directly towards the workplace,

313
00:33:53,170 --> 00:34:00,430
you can see the medical costs and then cost of life years loss and the total cost there is about 1.5 billion.

314
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:04,510
So very hefty, but still something people don't want to address.

315
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,510
Thoughts or comments before I move on to the next section. Okay.

316
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:19,350
What about mental health? What? Okay, so now we're going to go into environmental costs of stressful working conditions.

317
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:26,140
What about mental health effects and climate change? I think in general.

318
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:34,910
Yeah. Think of a global scale with a lot of like hopelessness for some countries and people

319
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:39,320
just like what the science is showing that those countries will be underwater.

320
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:43,100
So, yeah, I can't get the pulse on it too.

321
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:54,640
Other people realize that. I don't know if people realize that and wondering, you know, I don't think the international policies,

322
00:34:55,010 --> 00:35:00,830
decisions that are in those countries are going to be effective is their main priority.

323
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:09,410
But other countries are just like, oh, it'll be okay. I don't know that people here realize that.

324
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:20,299
Well, I got a project on, like, different local climate change policies and like the one in Ann Arbor was mostly it was just like,

325
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:26,150
we want 100% renewable energy by 2030 and we have to plant trees like we just have to plant different trees.

326
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,310
And those are like their main problems.

327
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:35,560
And then I looked at New Orleans and they were like, We got to figure out some way because we're going to get flooded all the time.

328
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,750
We're like, we're going to lose like some of the land cover.

329
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,180
So she's like, here,

330
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:48,870
it makes sense that people wouldn't be thinking about that because like the threats in Michigan are relatively small compared to like coastal areas.

331
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:53,960
Michigan supposed to be like a climate haven. Yeah. So it's not that much.

332
00:35:55,370 --> 00:36:00,799
Yeah. Yeah, it's. It's it seems to be like spurts, right?

333
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:08,360
Because obviously people we as humans think about the immediacy of problems and something like climate change, for example.

334
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:16,189
Number one might be scientifically difficult to understand, but number two is not tangible enough for them conceptually.

335
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:24,469
Like, yeah, they know they have more hurricanes now, but the link is somehow missing between that and climate change.

336
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:33,470
So occasionally on like my YouTube, I'll get recommendations for various Business Insider videos where you'll see like there is a guy in like

337
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:41,450
Nigeria who's turning like stuff they throw away into like bricks or like something like that where it's like,

338
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:47,509
you know, a cool entrepreneur trying to do something sustainable and eco friendly,

339
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:52,990
but it's like not to be pessimistic, but like literally like a drop in the bucket, right?

340
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:58,219
Um, so in terms of the mental health effects of climate change,

341
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:03,890
physical injuries and illnesses for people obviously who are affected by hurricanes, tornadoes,

342
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,139
the increasing amount of heat stress that there is going on in the United States,

343
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,830
we don't even have a heat standard in the workplace, as we've talked about.

344
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,620
Mood disturbances, irritability, anxiety and then also sleep disturbances.

345
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:28,190
Think about, for example, like if you've been affected by a hurricane and you've had to relocate or like shelter somewhere else for a period of time,

346
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:36,830
or you can't even return back to your original home because of climate and global warming, it has led to population migration.

347
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:44,720
And when you migrate any population, no matter what it is, there is some kind of acculturation stress.

348
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:50,420
So like I think with the exception of Brigitte, all of us moved here to Michigan.

349
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:56,090
Right? We experienced some level of stress trying to get used to our life here.

350
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:00,050
Yeah. The winters. The winters. Yeah.

351
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:04,130
Yeah. What about moving to the United States?

352
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,310
How was that for you? Stressful. Uh, no, no.

353
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:20,480
Oh, but, uh. Yeah, it feels like, uh, at first, to be honest, it feels like an illusion situation.

354
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:29,659
Oh, and I believe that, uh, the, uh, there's speaking English is very interesting.

355
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:37,500
I first got here. Yeah. I mean, I'm prone to just being anxious all the time.

356
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:43,200
So I was obviously very stressed when I moved here, but it was at the height of the pandemic, and I literally didn't know anybody.

357
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:50,910
But I can't even imagine, like, moving to another country and trying to do an advanced degree in like a totally different language.

358
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:56,400
Yeah, it's yeah. I mean, for courses,

359
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:05,340
I can't figure some stress because I can not content with what instructors and in the

360
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:13,670
lecture and then I need to review all the recordings after class so that I can get.

361
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:20,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you for sharing.

362
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:29,190
Or even just like in a very basic, like, immigrant situation, like so many of us who have parents who are immigrants,

363
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:33,960
for example, like my parents definitely have had acculturation stress.

364
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:44,549
So my mom, for example, in Vietnam was a midwife and like also taught home economics courses and she had like a degree in literature.

365
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:52,770
But then when the communists took over that they burnt out all the literature because as she was in South Vietnam,

366
00:39:53,340 --> 00:40:01,530
so that degree essentially became unit useless. And then she was here in the United States and was a housewife for a really long time.

367
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:07,679
So by the time she entered the job market again, like her first job was Walmart as like a stocker, right?

368
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,190
Where you have people whose parents were like doctors in their native country,

369
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:15,690
but now they work some like physical manual labor job or like own a restaurant,

370
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:23,160
something very different from their area and kind of readjusting to the life that they had that was due to war.

371
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:26,870
But in terms of like climate and global warming, right?

372
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,780
People who live closer to the hemispheres are definitely experiencing significant change in Haiti,

373
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:40,830
for example, with the frequency of earthquakes and then Puerto Rico with the with the hurricanes.

374
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:51,150
And then it's increased frequency of disasters can lead to things like PTSD, adjustment disorder, depression, and then also generational trauma.

375
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:59,909
Um, but the mental health effects of climate change are very difficult to quantify in terms of

376
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:05,880
dollar amounts like we can in the workplace because there's so many items that feed into it.

377
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:15,480
Okay. Moving on now, we're going to talk about physiological mechanisms of stress leading to adverse health outcomes.

378
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:20,700
So in the put on this TED ad video stress and the brain.

379
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:34,750
Aren't you forgetting little things?

380
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,250
Will isolated. Don't worry. We've all been there.

381
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:43,660
You're just stressed out. Strategizing isn't always a bad thing.

382
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:47,320
It needs to be extra energy and focus.

383
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,070
Like. Like when you're playing a competitive sport, you have to speak in public.

384
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:56,170
But with the continuous come on, most of us facing day in and day out.

385
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,200
Actually, you get shot during rain.

386
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:08,280
Chronic stress, like being overworked or having missing, can often affect things inside its structure and how it functions.

387
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:11,559
Right, right down to the level of stress.

388
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:21,830
Release begins with something called the two axis series of contractions between 200 degrees in brain and up,

389
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:31,720
which which controls your body's reactions to stress. When when you have a stressful situation, your axis is instantly activated.

390
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:37,090
And so Hong Kong called because the sun which which is your body for instruction.

391
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:44,040
But over a period of time, I have great proof.

392
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:56,729
For example, chronic stress increases the activity level and the number of infections in your brain's center and the of electrical signals.

393
00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:08,280
And yes, the part of the brain associated with learning and memory and stress control deteriorate the hippocampus also activity that axis.

394
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:18,500
So so when it weakens ability to control stress alcohol although cortisol can cause your brain to shrink the size.

395
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:26,450
Too much of this result was snapped in negotiations between morons and the shrinking of free prefrontal cortex,

396
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:33,830
the brain that regulates behavior and function, decision making and judgment and social interaction.

397
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:39,280
It also to the brain cells being made of millions.

398
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:45,379
This means stress might make it unhealthy for you to remember things and also set

399
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:51,190
the stage for more serious mental problems like depression and eventually disease.

400
00:43:52,010 --> 00:44:02,100
The effects of addressing this filter right down to your DNA and experience show that the genetics and psycho social factor lecture coming up.

401
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:06,590
Links or determining how that baby responds to stress later, later in life.

402
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:13,710
The pops of Jorge Ramos, as it turns out, says it is true stress because the brain's development process,

403
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:24,740
which is intended for stress response, negligible since time had come and so became more sensitive to stress and real life.

404
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:32,990
These are considered epigenetic changes, meaning they affected which genes are expressed without any changes in the genetic code.

405
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,900
If these changes can be reversed, if the moms are smart, there's a surprising result.

406
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:50,490
I think genetic changes caused by seeing one another grab generations after, you know, in other words, the result could be these actions were earlier.

407
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:57,350
It's not all bad news, though. There are there are many ways to reverse what happens to your stressed brain.

408
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:08,330
Among the most powerful weapons are exercise and meditation, which which involves breathing freely and being aware of their surroundings, activities,

409
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,620
decreased stress,

410
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:19,900
increase the size of the cases by improving your memory so you feel defeat in various measures in daily life and control over stress.

411
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:31,300
How many of you have heard any of that information before?

412
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:41,290
No feeling altogether. But I think parts of it I know I always have to check because I'm unsure.

413
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,520
Like I feel like I know it because I was a cognitive science major in undergrad.

414
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:54,969
But in regards to your brain, so when you're younger, your brain is much more plastic.

415
00:45:54,970 --> 00:46:00,280
And I'm not talking about like plastic material, but as in like more the more in a sense, right?

416
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,969
So like ideally if you want to learn like a second language or teach a child a second language, you got to do it before.

417
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:10,600
And ideally six years old, but nine years old is starting to get too weak because the brain isn't plastic anymore.

418
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:20,500
And then in regards to neurons, it's not to say that you have a finite amount of neurons in your brain, but once they're gone, they're gone.

419
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:24,399
They got, okay, it's like you're hearing in your sight.

420
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,580
Once you lose it, it's gone. And it's very difficult.

421
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:33,520
Very difficult. Even though they say, like in the video, you can generate new brain cells and new neural neurons.

422
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,420
It's very takes a long time.

423
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:43,570
So like even when I bought my head, I was just like, God, how many? How many, how many did I lose?

424
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:53,380
But in terms of synaptic connections between neurons, those are very easy to change in terms of like a response to something.

425
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,540
So like just say for example, like you had some trauma, right?

426
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:03,189
Where, uh, like you're scared of clouds, right?

427
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:06,460
So like you had some kind of trauma with a cloud.

428
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:10,570
Maybe it was hiding in a sewer grate with the balloon or something. I don't know.

429
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:19,180
And then now, like, your brain has wired that connection between your amygdala, which is what controls your fear response to cloud.

430
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:28,140
So every time you see clowns, you immediately become like in that flight or fight mode, there is a way, there are ways to undo it, right?

431
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:37,120
Traditionally, they think of something like sensitization therapy or they might try to flood you by like putting you in a room full of clowns.

432
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:41,920
Maybe I'm dating myself, but do you remember, like, the Maury Povich Show?

433
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:48,370
Okay. He used to be a talk show host in the daytime, most notorious for, like,

434
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:54,040
doing paternity tests where it's like you are the father and then people would like argue and stuff like that.

435
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,890
But people would have weird phobias, like there was a woman where a member who is is afraid of pickles.

436
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:05,290
So they would just chase her around the studio with a giant jar of pickles.

437
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:16,239
Yes, this is like flooding therapy. But now what they use is called EMDR, eye movement, rapid desensitization,

438
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:25,299
where essentially they use eye movements to try to like physically and mentally detach that emotional

439
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:34,660
connection to make it less salient in terms of like a trauma response or a fear response as another example,

440
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:45,760
not to get too political, but they actually did MRI brain scans of Republicans versus Democrats and showed them different messaging.

441
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:58,090
And when they looked at the MRI's, they found that those who self-identified as Republicans, when they made decisions, the amygdala was mostly firing.

442
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:01,930
So their decisions were mostly made off of fear based responses.

443
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:09,939
Whereas when you see Democrats making decisions, it's generally from the prefrontal cortex and then the the hippocampus.

444
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:20,050
So memory and decision making, so the brains have become literally wired differently, which is so interesting.

445
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:26,680
Yeah. So I just sometimes I'm like, I don't bother to have these conversations anymore.

446
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:35,530
I'm like, Your brain is white. So for depression in particular, in a systematic review of over 63,000 employees,

447
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,600
it supports findings that the perception of adverse psychosocial factors in the

448
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:45,940
workplace is elevated to depressive symptoms or major depressive episodes.

449
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:57,520
So like, you know, often in like things like DUI, we talk about it's not necessarily like the intent of what you said,

450
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:02,709
it was like the outcome of what you said or how you made the other person feel the same thing.

451
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:10,720
With psychosocial factors, you can't tell someone that their perceptions aren't real if that is actually what that they are perceiving.

452
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:13,510
So in this systematic review,

453
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:22,209
they used multi item scales to measure perceived psychosocial factors in 16 studies and included the job demands resources, models.

454
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:26,230
So they looked at mental load, psychological job demands, social support.

455
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:33,179
Job overload, job strain, work stress, decision latitude, all this kind of stuff in particular.

456
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:43,530
Those are just the constructs they looked at. Anxiety is generally found to be more common in people who identify as female,

457
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:51,569
those who experience social discrimination in which job disappointment or job dissatisfaction, job stress.

458
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:58,440
But also there are non-work-related like genetic factors or environmental factors that can exacerbate

459
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:08,700
anxiety or negative other things affecting psychological distress of work workers negative.

460
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:13,200
Emotional states burnout. Job satisfaction, perceived support.

461
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,479
What are the others we've talked about? We don't have to do that.

462
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,490
But the common thread in all of this is stress and more stress and and more stress.

463
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:29,220
So what about stress in the body now? Because we just did stress in the brain.

464
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:47,620
Let's take a look at this one. Cram briefing for a test I'm trying to get done and have time to do stretch.

465
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:52,530
Is it really unions when we are challenged or overwhelmed?

466
00:51:52,810 --> 00:52:00,810
But but just just a stretch dress is all required physical response to wrap around your body.

467
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:11,220
In the short term, stress can be advantageous, but when activated, you are often working to your primitive white preference response.

468
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:22,350
Not. Not often. Changes are great, but just make it in cells throughout your body, your injury and land stress hormone,

469
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:30,540
cortisol, epinephrine, also known as normal as feasible to travel in one's bloodstream.

470
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:38,820
The ease of use your muscles and or heart causes your heart to be faster and increases blood pressure,

471
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:48,540
causing hyper inflation for cortisol, also causing online vessels to function normally.

472
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:58,470
Scientists know this is an extremely process, frozen process for blood cholesterol, your heart arteries.

473
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:03,750
Together, these changes increase your chances of heart attack or stroke.

474
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:11,639
When when recent sense of dread stress activates your alarming nervous system through this network of connections,

475
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:15,750
your brain communicates repressed to your internal organs.

476
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:22,540
Systems. This system. That's causing butterflies in my stomach.

477
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:25,809
This connection is disturbed,

478
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:32,400
natural rhythmic satisfactions that move over your gut leading to your bowel syndrome and

479
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:40,030
can increase your sensitivity to acid making more more likely to be the gut nervous system.

480
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:48,940
Stress. Stress can change the composition of the gut bacteria, which which may affect sensitive and oral health.

481
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:53,410
Speech making or digestion. Does stress a family waistline.

482
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:54,640
Well. Well. Yes.

483
00:53:55,030 --> 00:54:05,980
Cortisol increases your appetite to help the body to better energy stores with energy dense foods and carbs causing you to crave home comfort foods,

484
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:13,150
high levels of stress and all sorts of things put on these extra calories as it's visceral belly fat.

485
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:17,260
This type of fat just making it hard to pass it.

486
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:24,030
It is an activity releases bones and immune system chemicals called cytokines that increase

487
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:29,500
your risk of developing chronic diseases such as heart disease and also persistence.

488
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:34,480
Meanwhile, stress hormones affect new cells in a variety of ways.

489
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:38,860
Initially, they help from here fighting for years after surgery,

490
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:45,310
but stress dampened function of someone's cells make you more susceptible to infections.

491
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:52,140
You'll want to live a modern life. You may have heard of stress.

492
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,290
That's because it is associated with shortened telomeres.

493
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:02,079
These demands on chromosomes that measure of cells, age, telomeres,

494
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:07,030
count chromosomes to allow you to get copy every time the cell divides without

495
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:12,070
without damaging the cells genetic code and shorten weeks of cell division.

496
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:21,910
When telomeres become so short and eyes as isn't enough, chronic stress has it even more ways.

497
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:28,149
It's less outside your health, including acne, your hair loss, sexual dysfunction and headaches,

498
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:33,250
muscle association, difficulty concentrating, fatigue and irritability.

499
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:46,030
So what does all this mean for you? Your life always be in a stressful situations, but what matters to you is how you respond to that stress.

500
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:53,770
If you can use situations as challenges of control, struggle and disaster, rather than threats that are insurmountable,

501
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:58,540
you will perform better in your short run and stay healthy in the long, long run.

502
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:16,520
Was any of that new or shocking to you? Now we're all just slowly killing ourselves.

503
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:23,870
Have any of you come up with a good way to manage stress and for runs you do?

504
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:27,380
Good for you. Do you feel like it works? Oh, yeah.

505
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:31,880
No, no, no. The endorphins are. Yeah, that's a real running high.

506
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:38,480
Oh, okay. I just get tired. Meditation sometimes.

507
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:45,080
Yeah. Any of you. What do you do to manage stress? Going to therapy a couple of times.

508
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:50,510
Like my mind is full. Like, what if scenarios?

509
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:57,830
Yeah. Things are stressing me out. Like just thinking through those one scenarios and not leaving out, like, an incomplete thought.

510
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:04,990
Mm hmm. Has helped. Also, just like knowing what you can control, what you can't control, and just like focusing on that.

511
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,920
Yeah. Yeah. How about you? I was doing exercise.

512
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:12,940
Exercise? And I saw you guys playing basketball. Tennis?

513
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,860
Yeah. The nightclub is very sporty, right?

514
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:22,630
Yeah, it's been, um. Yeah.

515
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:27,850
To each. To each. Their own right. If everybody manages stress in a different way.

516
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:34,899
Um, I used to make the class to a guided meditation, but I don't think people really like that.

517
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:41,379
So I took it out. But obviously we'll talk next week about, um, unhealthier ways to cope with stress,

518
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:48,790
like drinking at work and doing drugs at work, although some of it is, uh, medically legal here.

519
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:53,530
Now, um, I don't think you're supposed to be smoking at work, though.

520
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:59,080
Uh, people still do it. I know I did go on the elevator one day, and I was like, Oh, okay.

521
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:02,980
This elevator was the one right by the cafe. Yeah.

522
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:08,470
Oh, wow. I was like and walked in right after it or something, but.

523
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,970
Oh, that's so nice.

524
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:18,640
I was just in the these elevators when America Stole Your stuff, wears a very heavy cologne.

525
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:23,620
And so in the morning, I was like, Oh, you know, he's here.

526
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:34,719
Yeah. In particular, I think there's also like like these cognitive resilience that you can develop, right?

527
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:41,380
Because I would say when I was much younger, I used to catastrophize things a lot more thinking about the worst case scenarios.

528
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:47,980
I tend to do it less now. I don't know if it's a matter of fact of getting older and realizing like,

529
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:54,100
I've made it this far and everything's more or less worked out okay, or I just stopped caring.

530
00:58:54,130 --> 00:59:03,640
I get maybe a little bit of both, but like even things, if you look, sometimes I know it feels like you haven't really grown,

531
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:10,740
but if you look back to how you would have reacted to things even a year ago, you'll notice how different it was, right?

532
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:16,540
Like this isn't related to stress, but just as an example, I remember when I was a teenager,

533
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:22,720
I would get so self-conscious about eating in public because,

534
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:29,140
you know, Asian families just like give you tons of body dysmorphia by telling the girls how fat they are all the time.

535
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:35,980
But but now that I'm an adult, I literally don't care.

536
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:39,430
I will eat alone. And I love it, I think.

537
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:43,030
Yes, yeah, yeah. Good for me.

538
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:48,370
I'm trying to live that like single rich with no kids lives.

539
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:56,860
That is aspirational. So in terms of stress in that individual, so stress is definitely heterogeneous.

540
00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:00,129
Like stress affects me differently than it would the fact of Bridget, right?

541
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:05,410
So it's a product of genetics, developmental influences, experience and other determinism.

542
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:15,219
And then stress historically has always been perceived as hope to homeostasis.

543
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:18,940
And that's ironic because homeostasis means staying the same.

544
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:25,240
But it's really ironic because our body is our static, meaning dynamically responding to changes.

545
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:33,550
So on the behavioral side, how people interpret and react to a challenge not only creates physical and psychological stimuli,

546
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:37,209
but that stimuli affects the central nervous system and how they process

547
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:41,410
information and whether something is perceived as a threat or like not a threat.

548
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:49,510
So when they're talking about our static load, Dr. Rosenberg will get into this more when she does her guest lecture,

549
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:52,600
talking specifically about the cardiovascular system.

550
01:00:52,870 --> 01:01:03,550
But there's evidence for stress on asthma, GI disorders, myocardial infarction, diabetes, cancer, viral infections, and then autoimmunity as well.

551
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:09,070
I am unfortunately one of those people that has fuzed together my mind gut connection.

552
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:19,299
So whenever I am stressed, tummy is also stressed, which is interestingly, as I found out from my gastroenterologist,

553
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:25,870
more common in women and diagnosed generally between the teens and thirties because

554
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:31,990
we tend to internalize stress and then cope with it differently than than men do.

555
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:43,570
Yeah. So this year is just like a picture, a very simplified picture showing the processes between the endocrine system,

556
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:48,400
injury, inflammation and toxins and the immune system itself.

557
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:56,499
How many of you have I was like this when I was a college student where it was like, go, go, go for it because I was on the quarter system.

558
01:01:56,500 --> 01:02:00,520
So go, go, go, go. And once the quarter would stop and I was done with.

559
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:04,260
Finals. Like two days after I'd be sick, I would get sick.

560
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:14,069
Anybody else? That was literally my body collapsing from stress because I had used up enough adrenaline to keep me going.

561
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:17,610
But the immune response was already crashing. So the minute I stopped.

562
01:02:18,810 --> 01:02:25,080
Yeah, okay. And that's all I had for today.

563
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:31,830
Any, like, reactions, questions, thoughts, responses?

564
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:41,549
Yeah. My questions like, okay, what can we do about it now? It's just like trying to figure out an individual level how to deal with our stress,

565
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:47,730
but then also trying to tie it to like a community of public health aspect of stress.

566
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:59,880
I think there's a real reckoning right now in the workplace and mostly prompted by the COVID pandemic,

567
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:03,000
actually, which I think is a positive thing that's come out of it.

568
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:07,470
I also do a lot of research in terms of union membership.

569
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:13,320
So I think I talked about this before. Like in the last hundred years, union membership has decreased significantly,

570
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:18,550
and since the pandemic started going up, we're thinking about like there was the great resignation.

571
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:21,920
Now we're going through quiet quitting, four day workweeks.

572
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:29,339
People are starting to like realize I don't need to be commuting an hour every day in traffic to do this job.

573
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:34,140
I can do this job in my pajamas and, like, spend more time with my kids or spend more time with my pets or like,

574
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:37,770
have a better quality of life and earn the same salary.

575
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:43,140
Or so many people, for example, who used to live in New York City and the bigger cities.

576
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:52,330
My sister up until the age of 30. Six had roommates because she lived in Brooklyn.

577
01:03:52,630 --> 01:04:00,520
And once people left New York City, she was finally able to get her own apartment because the rent rates also went down.

578
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:06,190
But people were realizing, like, to have this job or this like dream life that I want,

579
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:13,710
I can do that while like living in Colorado and like being able to own property, right?

580
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:23,950
Or like I could actually have a backyard. I don't need to, like, live in New York City to work for like Google or something like that.

581
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:30,970
So I think there's a real reckoning, but there's also still really significant pushback from employers.

582
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:36,040
So I don't I don't know where this push and pull like where the breaking point is.

583
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:44,410
The School of Public Health in particular, is kind of unique on campus because we still allow for flexible telecommuting schedules,

584
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:49,990
because we recognize that you will lose good people if you force them to come back in the office again.

585
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:56,440
College of Medicine, Pharmacy, Dental are all requiring all their staff to be back in person.

586
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:07,780
Yeah. Yeah. So now we have like in our department, we have a grants person who lives in San Diego will probably never meet her in real life.

587
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:11,799
And we have, you know, colleagues from all over the place.

588
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:16,270
Like I mentioned, I have a friend who's an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska Med Center.

589
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:20,380
She lives in Switzerland with her husband. She doesn't have to teach.

590
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:26,200
She's just to research. Yeah, but she's on the tenure track, which is interesting.

591
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,769
But I think there's a real reckoning right now.

592
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:39,429
But it can only go as far as workers have. The momentum to keep pushing back is corporations and organizations will do what they can to,

593
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:43,270
like, keep the status quo or to keep their profits at maximum.

594
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:52,570
So I'll be curious to see what happens in the next few years as more baby boomers also retire from the workforce.

595
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:58,900
Huge, huge, huge thing. Anyway, I hope you all enjoy your.
