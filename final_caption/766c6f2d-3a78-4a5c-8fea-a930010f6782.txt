1
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:10,850
This letter from the head of
the American Public Health Association to

2
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:15,368
the head of the Environmental
Production Agency is one of the best

3
00:00:15,368 --> 00:00:20,054
examples of this hybrid inverted
triangle plus ABT structures that

4
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:24,170
I think I've ever seen from
an advocacy standpoint.

5
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,920
So I wanna walk you through this letter so
that you can see the structure.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,030
So this first paragraph here is
just an introduction, right?

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,140
I'm appreciating the opportunity to
comment on the agency's proposed

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,260
replacement of the Clean Power Plan.

9
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:44,780
But then you have here,
this is the central message.

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,170
This proposal has the potential to put
the health of many Americans at risk,

11
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,000
and hence, we don't like it.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,950
That is the core of what they're
trying to get across here.

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,600
So it's put right up front,
that's the core of the message,

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,050
we are opposing this approach.

15
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,350
Then, when you get to the meat
of the letter, what does it do?

16
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,890
It goes through an ABT structure
to give you the argument.

17
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,320
So this first paragraph up here,
this is the and paragraph, right?

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,845
This is the background.

19
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:17,410
So, What do we know?

20
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,181
Well, the Americans depend upon the EPA.

21
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:24,771
And all of these previous Supreme Court
decisions have established the legal

22
00:01:24,771 --> 00:01:28,520
foundation for the EPA's role
in limiting greenhouse gases.

23
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,261
So this is background stuff.

24
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:36,391
It's establishing the EPA's responsibility
to regulate carbon pollution.

25
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:38,550
And then, what do you hit?

26
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,240
The, but.

27
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,420
And it's not stated, but it's there.

28
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,550
But, the EPA's proposal to replace
the clean power plan would step

29
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,098
away from the available best practices.

30
00:01:51,098 --> 00:01:55,560
And the whole rest of the paragraph
becomes but arguments.

31
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,676
Problems that would
result from this action.

32
00:02:00,676 --> 00:02:03,820
So what do we have when we follow that?

33
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,229
We have, therefore.

34
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:15,100
So, therefore, This replacement proposal
disregards the scientific evidence.

35
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,610
It's gonna cause problems.

36
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,480
Health experts agree that this
would cause death and illness.

37
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,940
You can see this argument building.

38
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:29,751
Then you get to the end point,
and you have the final therefore.

39
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:34,557
Therefore, as a result,
the original proposal would have prevented

40
00:02:34,557 --> 00:02:37,990
all of these deaths and
asthma attacks, etc.

41
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:43,710
And it goes into the, therefore,
the implications of this proposed change.

42
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,890
And then what do you end up?

43
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,031
Right back where you started.

44
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:48,342
Here's our central message
being repeated again.

45
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:53,002
For all these reasons, we take this
opportunity to urge the EPA to focus on

46
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:55,199
implementing the existing plan.

47
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,766
So, you see the structure here.

48
00:02:56,766 --> 00:03:00,602
You start, you lay out the central
message, the thing that you're asking for,

49
00:03:00,602 --> 00:03:02,531
the thing that you're advocating for.

50
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:05,998
Then walk through,
in a few paragraphs, the and, but,

51
00:03:05,998 --> 00:03:10,320
therefore structure of the narrative arc,
and then you end.

52
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,000
What do you do?

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,361
You state the point again.

54
00:03:12,361 --> 00:03:14,053
So there's no ambiguity.

55
00:03:14,053 --> 00:03:18,420
We want to oppose this
implementation of a new proposal.

56
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:24,300
We want to urge the EPA to focus
on implementing the existing plan.
