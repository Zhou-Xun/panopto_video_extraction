1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,010
I was like, Yeah, it's in order. Okay.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,650
There's going to be multiple recordings.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:16,889
Any time I press like I can't pause it on the the Panopto source that I use so like stops and then I'm in session.

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,270
So I'll do a different way next time. Or I can just pause so we don't have the break in here.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:30,150
All right. So I want us to think about what we learned last semester and what we just talked about.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,360
We're going to have the scenario and then we'll we'll ask the questions.

7
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,600
These are we have the question first.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:45,000
But what we're going to determine that I want you to determine is a patient with head neck cancer, a candidate to receive an actual feeding device.

9
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:51,090
So first answer that provide rationale behind your answer and we'll talk about the scenario.

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,270
If so, what type of rental feeding tube should be used and then provide rationale behind that answer.

11
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:04,710
So here's the scenario. We have a 72 year old man who is diagnosed with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue.

12
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:14,640
He is scheduled to receive a six week course of a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, followed by reassessment of his tumor response.

13
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,519
So your physical or physical exam reveals a thin man who is 80 kilograms.

14
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,960
He's lost approximately 11 kilograms in the past three months, which represents a weight loss of 14% of his previous body weight.

15
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:35,460
His electrolytes, complete blood count, liver function tests, albumin are all within normal limits.

16
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,360
So here's the scenario. So is this patient a candidate to receive an enteral feeding device?

17
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:51,809
First answer that yes or no. Why? And then, if so, what type of central feeding tube would you think would be most appropriate?

18
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,780
If you answered yes, he would be a candidate for differential nutrition.

19
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,209
What type of tube do you think would be most appropriate and provide some rationale there?

20
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:09,480
And then we'll we'll discuss together. So let's take ten, 15 minutes to think about this and then we'll discuss as a group.

21
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:18,910
Okay. I think we can discuss it.

22
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:28,780
Oh, yeah. You can discuss amongst each other and think about pulling things in from last semester that we discussed as well.

23
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:37,460
$3,000 or $3 million?

24
00:02:41,050 --> 00:03:06,000
Yes. I don't see any opportunity to draw any conclusions that look like a lot and raise 11 cases and anything like that,

25
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:35,390
because to me, it's very specific, like normally with radiation and sexual intimacy, I have yet to do that.

26
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,540
Okay. But which one?

27
00:03:42,780 --> 00:04:07,570
So much energy to her term for two six weeks or Latin graders like good things going on here.

28
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:17,040
Yeah, exactly. Like it's not like it just love or something like that.

29
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:46,550
That that was really important for my mother is not doing it because I'm crazy and is looking

30
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:56,290
to them and there's no way I would say anything more to her knowledge is who does what works.

31
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:24,010
And definitely I think that's something that goes to her eyes and makes me wonder, what's your message on that?

32
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:37,910
Because I didn't want to you want to go into this and that is insane.

33
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:53,860
So even at the long term, I mean, we don't have to, but I always felt that it was.

34
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:17,280
I was reading from I was saying that in trying to create these little concerns for my kids my age.

35
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,150
Yeah, it's just the location of where it answers.

36
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:31,239
And I can shoot up here. If it was like cancer somewhere else, then it would be like, this isn't cheap and she didn't have to live in Massachusetts.

37
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:42,280
And the price point which was high, was one through strict parental rights known as the peg or the first.

38
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:49,420
Yeah, yeah. But it's all the other ones you start to make the effort to do.

39
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,280
But I don't know if that's the same.

40
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:59,850
We don't know. But you have to see all the data day.

41
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:06,110
Yeah. I think that, I think it is that part of.

42
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,540
Deep dive. We're really here.

43
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:35,110
I love it. I don't know what happened in the last month because I have to say anything to you.

44
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:44,520
Tell me more about nutrition. Maybe I'm going to get the criteria for severe, but like, you know, two, four years.

45
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:55,060
There's just like different thresholds. I think you realize this specific information obviously because of your the design

46
00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:10,330
or maybe I'd like to see why it allows you to see like through your anything.

47
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:32,820
So I was like country that like a walk around the country and look forward to we have now a permanent one of.

48
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:43,970
Language right here. Yes. And I can tell you right now, we're actually going to have the actual proof.

49
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:50,370
Yes. It was not my idea for an exam.

50
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,630
I have always wanted to make a difference. That might be an impediment to you.

51
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:03,540
I don't know. I just. I don't know. Well, you know what?

52
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:11,400
I do not know. My understanding is that it is just very complicated also.

53
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:22,620
So you can do this and it is like, okay, and you would like this one.

54
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:33,440
I have seen. You can make it. What would you like to make your nasal down the esophagus or something?

55
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:44,640
Like for you to where to begin. Whereas, like, certain, if you can do anything, you can do it.

56
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:53,790
Why would you live? That's right. You will be under anesthesia for the surgery procedure that they might not be.

57
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,870
So usually they could be awake for that. It's less invasive.

58
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,500
When do you want to do this? Yes.

59
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,130
So you do that whenever possible. There's sort of skill comes out.

60
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,800
Yeah. Isn't that so? Surgery. Know, it's just to try to be open.

61
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:16,230
Percutaneous meaning, like they'll do like a small needle.

62
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:21,270
Like the patient could sober as, like, surgical. The patient's under the seizure.

63
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,929
They essentially open them up, you know, minimally.

64
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:36,740
But it's it's a more significant procedure and they've got to have one before you can do that.

65
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:42,890
And the scope there's this happening because you can make an AC series similar.

66
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:52,010
So like you had to be patient, you might have to surgically or attached in places like that.

67
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,380
I would just know like it is, you can almost feel that you feel.

68
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:17,970
And I mean, I stopped for as long as, you know, that that sort of sense that I need to actually that you to send me out.

69
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,410
Okay. Did you guys get a chance to work through this a little bit? All right.

70
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,980
Let's talk about it. So this is enteral nutrition indicated for this patient.

71
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,470
Yes. Yes, yes, I agree. Why do we think the conversation was?

72
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:51,080
Because well, those were the 14% of his body weight over the three months.

73
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:56,120
Yes, we have existing malnutrition. Right. That's one reason.

74
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,140
Why else. Yeah.

75
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:06,970
Cancer. A cancer treatment. So, like, if he's receiving radiation, he might deal with a lot of the, like, dry mouth and.

76
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:11,260
Yeah, you guys remember your wonderful presentations last semester.

77
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:16,270
What happens usually after chemotherapy, radiation, especially to the head neck area.

78
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:23,890
It's a six week course plan. But do you think after that stops for good to go?

79
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:30,700
No, no. Remember, especially with the radiation to that area can be really damaging with all those side effects mucositis,

80
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:38,530
nausea, vomiting for radiation or chemotherapy, lots of potential side effects there.

81
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:49,300
So. And as the. So I do think enteral nutrition would be indicated for just we know what's upcoming for this patient

82
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,700
in terms of the nature of the surgery and the treatment side effects and the underlying malnutrition.

83
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,420
So we think, yes, this patient would be a good candidate for nutrition.

84
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,890
What type of feeding tube do you think is most appropriate?

85
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,130
And there may be some variation in our answers here.

86
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,540
Yeah, a circle there. Okay.

87
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,220
I'm going to have to say so when that comes into the hand that we talked about, why would you think that?

88
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:33,229
Because we talked about if it is treatment is only for six weeks, but if you start still experiencing symptoms, it is not going to improve.

89
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:39,790
Or then we might go through a more long term option measurement.

90
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:45,260
I yes, I would say that would be not often used.

91
00:13:46,670 --> 00:14:02,090
Sometimes if there has been like extensive surgery and maybe the patient has had like it's just escaping the Q when they have like the tracheotomy.

92
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:09,530
So sometimes that will place a tube in that access and get to the GI tract, but that would be less common.

93
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:16,310
So then if their treatment is only six weeks and then there's room for a recovery post that treatment,

94
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,910
would you just then do it like a regular energy to see?

95
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:30,710
So that's what I want to ask you guys. So we have this like surgery plan, expected duration of therapy, six weeks.

96
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,560
I think when you look at the scenario.

97
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:43,290
Scheduled to receive a six week course of radiation therapy, possibly could go longer based on the risks, reassessment, tumor response.

98
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:50,600
So we're kind of at this weird place. What do you think? A temporary feeding tube or a permanent feeding tube?

99
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:55,130
Temporary or permanent? Oh, we got a mixed bag, so.

100
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,090
Raise your hand for temporary. Okay.

101
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:05,579
Raise your hand for permanent. Okay. So we have some different opinions.

102
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:10,800
So I think that's really reflective of what the discussion that might be happening.

103
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:23,340
I think that we do have we do have some rationale to do a permanent fee to given that

104
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:28,649
we know it's like at least a six week course after of this radiation and chemotherapy.

105
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:35,490
We know the side effects of radiation to the head and neck really can preclude patients from the ability to eat.

106
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,570
So he may need until nutrition longer than six weeks.

107
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:50,280
So I think a permanent feeding tube could be more convenient for the patient just because it's they're healing up here.

108
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:59,130
Sometimes that tube can interfere with all that and the length of leave might be within that time frame.

109
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,960
So I think a long term feeding tube would be most appropriate.

110
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:10,730
However, I'd say a lot of these head, neck cancer patients get a short term feeding tube.

111
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:18,740
That's all that's covered. The anticipated therapy is is considered short term and they go home with a nasal enteric feeding tube.

112
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:23,090
And it can be messy because they're healing from all this surgery.

113
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:28,700
They're having all these side effects up here. But that's a lot of times what happens.

114
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:35,389
Yeah. Are there any side effects to having an amazing care and feeding tube for an argument six weeks?

115
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:39,170
Or is it just pain? It's it can be uncomfortable.

116
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:47,270
They're more prone to, like, clogging and dislodging because, you know, so they're really not intended to be in place for that long.

117
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:55,520
But they can be. But that would be like just because they're they can clog, they can get dislodged and they might have to have them replaced.

118
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:02,390
Yes. Yes. But you're saying that before we decide to do permanent.

119
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,770
What she saw was so temporary they could sometimes middle.

120
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,429
They'll just drop a feeding tube, get them started on it, make sure they tolerate it.

121
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:17,249
Then maybe even during their surgery, they'll they'll place the permanent feeding tube so they have it.

122
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,530
And then after postoperatively, we can get them started up again too.

123
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:26,250
I have clients like this and they were eating just like a liquid diet for a while.

124
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:31,620
The sink doesn't really hit you right away, but once they hit it, they cannot swallow or dry meals.

125
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,640
It was later your last six months to a year and then it was.

126
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,720
But, but doing that during the six weeks they were still eating.

127
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:45,299
Yeah, these are really hot. This would be like a really high risk patient because just be ready for it.

128
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,290
Doesn't mean know we have to jump on it right away. Right.

129
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,730
There's there's thought of like being proactive, like, let's get that permanent feeding tube in place.

130
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:59,370
We know this is going to be a long road. These are nutritionally pretty delicate patients.

131
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:04,079
Just because it's really hard. They lose a lot of weight after that surgery, that type of therapy.

132
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,290
But high times they get just a temporary tube.

133
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:12,959
So there's probably a case for both. I think our best case is for a permanent feeding tube.

134
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,220
Given that, I think we would have. But now, though, it could be longer than six weeks that this patient would need it.

135
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:24,080
Now, what do you think? Do we want to do gastric access or small bile access?

136
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:29,690
Gastric? Do we have any reason why we can't feed into the stomach that we know of?

137
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:34,070
No. So we're going to go for for gastric access.

138
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,540
Yes. We have two questions, actually, so that you did it.

139
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:43,580
Most times we're putting in again, we put in like both like a p j.

140
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:53,299
If they're putting in if the patient needs a g tube for feeding, then they will often they'll do a GJ.

141
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,780
So at least we have that gastric access. But they're not.

142
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,589
They would have to have a reason that it would be digital access.

143
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,770
Otherwise they're just going to do it. Okay. Good.

144
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:12,650
And then second question, is there any concern like having that to go through the nose if you're getting radiation to the head that.

145
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,630
Yes. So it can get irritate like just this.

146
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:23,060
The the skin around the nasal cavity could be irritated depending on where they're getting the radiation.

147
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:29,630
It can be uncomfortable if it's in like the oral pharynx area.

148
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:35,479
The tube is passing through there. But, you know, that's just another thing that might just be irritating.

149
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,430
And I don't think it's necessarily a risk, but it could be uncomfortable for the patient.

150
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:44,120
Yes. So you mentioned like tolerating prevent.

151
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:56,299
Is that how often is it not tolerated? Oh, we will do a whole class tolerance because you will get paged that the patient is having diarrhea.

152
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:03,920
You need to change their tweeting. So it gets blamed for lots of lots of things.

153
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:10,069
And it's usually not the feeding that's not the actual feeling. But they'll you'll get that put on you to make some changes.

154
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:15,340
So but sometimes. It isn't tolerated in the meeting.

155
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:23,919
They're having diarrhea, upset, stomach cramping, and we might have to adjust how fast we deliver it.

156
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,000
It's a formula.

157
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:34,030
So when I say tolerance, it's like there's a lot of times people don't tolerate certain feelings, but there's a lot of other things going on, too.

158
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:43,660
Yes. I mean, the experience of people that have had allergies to, you know, so that would not be common.

159
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:50,799
We usually we would know if they had like let's one of our formulas use cow's milk proteins as the protein source.

160
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:59,350
So if they have a dairy allergy, hopefully we would know that ahead of time we would choose a hypoallergenic formula,

161
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
but they wouldn't develop an allergy.

162
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:12,430
Usually that would it would be either preexisting or maybe we didn't know about it, but we would know most often adults we know ahead of time.

163
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:20,370
Yes. You talk about throwing up, especially with.

164
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:28,060
Yeah, we'll talk about situations where there's vomiting and then what do we do?

165
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:37,560
Because it's such an absolute contraindication to feeding internally and it's not even necessarily an absolute contraindication defeating gastric lea,

166
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,149
which may be. But there can be scenarios where we can still feed into the stomach.

167
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:49,940
If they have vomiting, it's a patient's vomiting, has a nasal inter tube that can come up.

168
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:53,680
That's a situation where it comes out. It's yeah, it's not pleasant.

169
00:21:53,980 --> 00:22:00,280
Did you see during the six weeks that they tend to draw more on them because of the therapy,

170
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:09,730
the consistency well is after usually the radiation chemotherapy can cause nausea and vomiting.

171
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:14,170
The chemo is like in between radiation.

172
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:19,840
Yeah. Usually they they do the visit, maybe they do the route of chemo around the chemo first, then radiation.

173
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:27,220
Radiation is usually very targeted. They try to only radiate to the tumor area but chemo of is more.

174
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:38,360
Yeah, but the chemotherapy does do this. I they throw up regularly a few times a day or just some mix role.

175
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:44,290
I'm sorry. It depends. It depends on their regimen, what medication or what chemotherapy they're receiving.

176
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:50,590
Some patients like it's like, okay, day three after my chemo is when I get really sick.

177
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:57,339
Some don't have vomiting, most have some nausea, but there's some really good medication, self control that.

178
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:06,040
So it's it's really dependent on the the situation that she had for just kind of going up and especially about allergies.

179
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,850
Have you ever seen someone who's allergic to the actual tubing area?

180
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:22,549
So. Well in parenteral nutrition we'll talk about like some patients need a latex free PM because some of the bagging and we use has latex.

181
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:29,390
So if they have a latex allergy, you have to it's a different delivery system to the tubing.

182
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:35,120
I don't think I've seen that. There's there there can be like an adverse.

183
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,920
Reaction to it potentially? I don't know.

184
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:51,110
It's some type of plastic, so potentially that there be an irritating just an irritant to patients or even a full blown allergy.

185
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:58,070
I have not seen yet. But it is possible that these things are across the things going in to the body.

186
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,240
People have all types of reactions to them. Yeah.

187
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,870
I mean, just to make sure.

188
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:12,649
So for not tolerating, it's like typically just like the formula that they're not tolerating, not just like insulin nutrition as a whole.

189
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:16,190
So you would just change the formula or the speed or something like that usually.

190
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,689
Yeah, usually we'll try and troubleshoot like, okay.

191
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,820
Do they need a more hypertonic formula?

192
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,010
We'll get into formulas probably next week.

193
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,380
Do they need to any to slow down the flow rate,

194
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:42,170
how fast it's being infused or is it just they are not tolerating anything into the GI tract right now then they would switch to potentially.

195
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:46,280
Yeah. If it if it's kind of failed if our initial trial has failed.

196
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:55,750
Okay. So for this patient, some of the rationale we talked about during radiation and chemotherapy treatment for head,

197
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:01,610
neck cancer patients almost always experience dysphagia mucositis.

198
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:08,659
In fact, these problems are pretty prevalent that some clinicians advocate placing prophylactic g tubes before treatment starts.

199
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:15,440
So being more proactive, getting a g tube in place before we even start chemotherapy and radiation so it's in place,

200
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:21,410
we can ensure and maintain what nutritional status they have and prevent a big decline.

201
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:28,550
This type of therapy can help the patient maintain hydration, the energy and protein needs.

202
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:38,010
Of course we could do that to within his own care to. Once you show the patients who had a prophylactic g to place before treatment.

203
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:45,120
This is for head and neck cancer patients. They lost 5% less weight than the control group that didn't receive the preemptive feeding tube.

204
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,440
In addition, the timing of a gastrostomy placement.

205
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:56,400
There is some controversy that surrounds that type of feeding tube to place in patients with head neck cancers.

206
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:03,870
So some centers will contend that keeping a nasogastric tube in place over a tube will

207
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:11,520
preserve the muscles of swallowing and help the patient transition to feeding orally again.

208
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:17,700
So like just having that in place. So that's like an argument for potentially for a nasal enteric tube.

209
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:27,630
But the general consensus is that patients have less dysplasia and shorter duration therapy with a nasal enteric tube.

210
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:31,170
But they but they lose less weight with the tube.

211
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,790
So it is it is a mixed bag. You'll see different centers do different things.

212
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:44,340
And I don't know where we're at right now with this kind of borne out of the the cancer game for a while.

213
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:54,580
But I remember doing we covered otolaryngology services on my service and a lot of times they were temporary feeding tube.

214
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,320
I mean, people have have these extensive head neck surgeries and then you can see their yellow feeding tube.

215
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:02,430
It's like, oh my gosh, these poor people.

216
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,849
But there is maybe some benefit to that.

217
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:09,270
But we do see less weight loss with a tube.

218
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,300
Okay. But for this patient,

219
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:21,100
I think a G tube could be chosen because of the preexisting malnutrition and the expected development of further nutrition impairment with the chemo,

220
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,780
radiation therapy and the estimated length of time.

221
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:30,430
I just think that the time would be on our side that this patient's going to need nutrition for for longer than six weeks.

222
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:37,030
But there's there's not really a right or wrong answer. Okay.

223
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,690
So I'll choose the code. No, we can contribute to that conversation.

224
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:51,890
But ultimately it's the position that is the surgeon that we the insurance will insure us.

225
00:27:53,140 --> 00:28:00,640
Okay. So we're not getting as far as I thought, but that's what we have planned to be allocated plenty of time for for these discussions.

226
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:07,520
So let's talk briefly about gastric versus mobile fees and then we'll we'll finish up today.

227
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:12,200
So there are certain indications that might prompt a clinician to initiate gastric

228
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,450
versus small bile fee to also hear me referred to this as postpaid work feeds.

229
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:23,270
So that language will be used a lot. So meaning we're feeding past the pie works right where the stomach meets the duodenum.

230
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:29,780
So both types have advantages and disadvantages and we'll discuss that in these next few slides.

231
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:41,570
Okay. So let's take a quick poll. Everything below is true regarding gastric feedings except so read each of these before we kind of dive into it.

232
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:50,210
So everything is true regarding feeding into the stomach except so one more closely mimics how the GI tract physiologically functions.

233
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:57,140
It allows for more variation in the type of feedings that can be administered that we'll probably get to next week

234
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:04,310
is preferred in cases where there is significant aspiration risk and offers metabolic and lifestyle benefits.

235
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,370
Which one of these do you think is not true?

236
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:20,629
So on this one you do it right because so of you to do the well, let's go through it so much more closely.

237
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:24,150
Mimics how the GI tract physiologically functions. Yeah, true.

238
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:31,670
If we think about if we're eating a goat who goes into the stomach first and all that,

239
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:36,470
so feeding it's the stomach would be more mimicking like eating horribly,

240
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,700
potentially allows for more variation, a type of feedings that can be administered.

241
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,499
What do you think? We haven't gotten to this yet. Yeah, this is true.

242
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,860
So in this so this is a benefit of feeding in the stomach. We'll get into this.

243
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:57,080
We can feed faster. We can feed more concentrated formulas, whereas the small bowel,

244
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,489
we're a little bit limited on how fast we can infuse enteral feedings and the

245
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:06,440
types of formulas is preferred in cases where they're significant aspiration risk.

246
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:16,270
And think about physiology. If somebody is at risk for aspiration and this is controversial, we'll talk about this.

247
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:20,090
Would it be helpful to feed higher?

248
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:24,720
Or lower in the GI tract, lower and lower.

249
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:31,970
So this would be the one that's not correct. And this we'll talk about if somebody is at significant aspiration risk,

250
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:38,360
sometimes we will then advance the tube past the stomach so that we feed into the small bowel.

251
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:44,990
There's less likely they're less likely to aspirate gastric contents because we're not feeding the stomach.

252
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,560
This is controversial, though, across metabolic and lifestyle benefits.

253
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:55,360
We'll talk about this. Yes, potentially because of the way that we can feed we can mimic normal meal times.

254
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:05,010
I'm still a little conservative, so I'm reading it is like gastric feedings or preferred in cases where there significant respiration.

255
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:13,630
So everything is true regarding gastric feedings except it is not preferred where there is significant aspiration.

256
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,000
So what we're doing is doing maybe just this, but I was in some situations,

257
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,350
small bowel things would be indicated if there is a significant aspiration risk.

258
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:27,430
We'll talk about that because it's that's not like fully agreed upon.

259
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:36,430
Okay. Let's talk about gastric feed. So the stomach must be structurally and functionally able to be a reservoir.

260
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,680
Okay. So like in situations where there's been significant amount of the stomach removed,

261
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:47,890
like in a ruin, my gastric bypass or a large gastric tumor has been removed.

262
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:52,420
We probably wouldn't feed into the stomach. We would just go into the small mouth.

263
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:57,880
So that lower esophageal sphincter right where the stomach and the esophagus meet,

264
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:02,079
should have adequate tone and function to prevent significant reflux.

265
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,420
And this can also play a role in risk for aspiration of the integrity of that.

266
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:13,329
Lower esophageal sphincter is not intact. Gastric motility must be intact.

267
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:17,590
So we'll talk about Gastroparesis. Remember, we start pain patients really bad gastroparesis.

268
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:23,950
We may not be able to feed them into the stomach. We may have to advance that to pass the stomach.

269
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:31,480
So decision to begin gastric feedings is typically made based on the patient history and their clinical evaluation.

270
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:40,540
So let's talk about benefits. It does gastric feeding does more closely mimic how the gastrointestinal tract physiologically functions.

271
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:46,419
So getting delivering nutrition first to the stomach, it allows for intermittent and bolus feeds,

272
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,719
which we'll talk about, which offers a more metabolic and lifestyle benefit.

273
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:56,140
So this is where we kind of feed almost to like three meals a day.

274
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:03,040
So like we bolus formula into the stomach that kind of mimics how we would watch, we plan and pace our meals.

275
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:12,550
There's benefits of the acidic gastric environment potentially for some nutrient absorption medications, things like that.

276
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:21,459
Also, the types of tubes that we can place into the gastric reservoir are bigger, so they're larger.

277
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:29,980
So the diameter is larger in gastric tubes that has less clogging than what we call small bore tubes, which are used in small bowel feedings.

278
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,400
They're easier to place in small bowel feeding tubes, too.

279
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:41,379
It's usually more cost effective, especially because patients can can do what we call a gravity feeding.

280
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:51,250
They can just let the formula drip into their their g tube or to the they so in tier two or they can just flush it with a syringe.

281
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:56,680
Whereas and we'll get into this more if they have a post pyloric feeding tube,

282
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:03,400
we have to use a feeding pump to control the rate of infusion so it is more cost effective.

283
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:09,629
So disadvantages. Sometimes there's poor tolerance and those that have delayed gastric emptying.

284
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:14,220
So if they have significant gastroparesis, that's not an absolute contraindication.

285
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:18,270
But their tolerance might not be great. And we might have to change our plan.

286
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:25,800
Aspiration risk. So this is like it's a little bit controversial.

287
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:31,600
So commonly cited risk is absolute aspiration or that's the movement of liquid into the patient's lungs.

288
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:44,829
Sometimes patients that are on high rate gastric feedings that have a preexisting risk of aspiration, that might be not the best situation for them,

289
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:49,629
that they would be more likely to aspirate their gastric contents and formula

290
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:54,010
if they are someone that already has a previous history of risk of aspiration.

291
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,049
And maybe we're delivering formula too fast.

292
00:34:56,050 --> 00:35:02,830
So there's potential that in some patients that gastric bleeding could put them at higher risk for aspiration.

293
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:11,170
All right. Let's talk briefly about this delayed, gastric emptying. There are things we can do so we can still feed into the stomach.

294
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:18,760
If there's delay gastric emptying, sometimes we'll do a continuous feed, meaning we're going to feed a slow rate around the clock.

295
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:25,839
So it's just of it's going in over 24 hours. Usually that's a slow enough infusion that it does delay.

296
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:33,010
Gastric emptying is okay. Remember when we talk about gastroparesis, liquids are usually better tolerated than solids.

297
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,650
So we're we're infusing liquid nutrition here.

298
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:45,250
So symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, heartburn, early satiety, they have a lot of gas in epic gastric fullness.

299
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:53,230
Those may all be signs and symptoms that precede actual vomiting, and that could be due to delayed gastric emptying.

300
00:35:53,230 --> 00:36:01,750
So Patient might show some signs that they would be at risk to have vomiting or might have delayed gastric emptying if it hasn't been diagnosed.

301
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:06,580
So we would be assessing those things, too, and taking that into consideration.

302
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,909
And often we can treat them with a pro kinetic agent.

303
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:18,590
So something that could help stimulate movement out of the the gastric body and those that's a medication

304
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:27,020
known as Raglan or the medical bromide that's often used if a patient has a late gastric emptying.

305
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:32,810
So there's lots of things we can do to self feed into the stomach if a patient has gastric emptying.

306
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:39,200
So this disadvantages. We talked a little bit about aspiration risk.

307
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,680
So if the patient has a poorly functioning, lower esophageal sphincter,

308
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:50,180
that may become even less competent with the passage of a nasogastric tube and the onset of gastric feeding.

309
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:58,430
So that may stimulate further relaxation of that lower esophageal sphincter that can then potentially

310
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:05,030
encourage more reflux and of the gastric contents into the esophagus and can increase aspiration risk.

311
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,990
But usually there's.

312
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:14,490
These are patients that have some precursors or risk factors in place that may make them more at risk for aspiration with gastric feedings.

313
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:24,360
There are some things we can do. So for all patients on two feedings, we will, you'll see, elevate the head of the bed at least 30 degrees.

314
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:29,190
So you'll see that. And in the chart below, they're going to be elevated at least 30 degrees.

315
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,870
The rate and the volume of feeds will be potentially reduced.

316
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,830
So we might slow down how fast we infuse enteral nutrition.

317
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:44,910
We're going to practice all this like you guys are going to come up with regimens, with formula, selection, rate of infusion, all that.

318
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,260
So we'll get to that.

319
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:59,220
Their composition may be modified, so we might use a more broken down formula that's a little bit easier absorbed or one that's not as concentrated.

320
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:06,080
And sometimes the addition of different medications like a pill or problematic agent might be necessary.

321
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:10,480
Okay, so we're we're at time, so let's stop there.

322
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:20,210
We'll pick up next week on small bowel fees. I had posted an assignment that I thought we'd get to more content.

323
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,090
You did not have anything due next week. We'll get to that assignment next week.

324
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:30,830
So we'll push that. I'll I'll I'll make note of that on campus. Does anybody have any questions before we stop?

325
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:37,460
Okay. So no assignment. I'm going to change the due date on there. You don't have anything to turn in next week.

326
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:45,760
Thank you. Any more than I have to do it up there.
