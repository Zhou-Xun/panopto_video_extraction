1
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:08,610
Oh. How are you guys?

2
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:15,480
Yeah. I'm very busy this morning.

3
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,570
You just came in? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,310
See how it goes in the winter? I'm not that.

5
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,820
I'm not planning on taking classes now. I might try and see if there's a location closer to.

6
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,060
Okay. I'm tired.

7
00:02:48,870 --> 00:03:00,689
I'm okay. I'm doing this huge. Cody So we're doing a big cleaning of the some of the Mando data and the That's data, which is the business data.

8
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,810
So we're doing the big cleaning and the corners are hackable.

9
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,350
I don't know, ten of us in a room together combing through businesses and checking them and checking addresses and.

10
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:19,660
Contents. I'm a wild Katrina warrior for a leader.

11
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,210
Yeah, we can. Do you wanna talk about this? Yeah. Yeah.

12
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:47,780
I mean. This is people from overseas and it should be this.

13
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,330
So I was checking the meetings, like all in the street.

14
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,560
Some of them are negative, and I'm not sure what that means.

15
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,410
Negative. Yeah. So, like, this is a sun.

16
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,730
But when I looked at the raw variables, some of, like, some of the more negative ones.

17
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,840
There's something negative to that number of grocery stores and warehouses per.

18
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,890
The sales. So why never is.

19
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:30,010
Unless it's. I took the code bug and it is now.

20
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:40,200
And that he has. Do the means make sense apart from the minimums?

21
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,480
No. No. So, like, some of them have really high maximums like this one.

22
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,740
This is the number of grocery stores and warehouses. And I checked that.

23
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:56,070
It's just one observation with 20,000. And it's in New York City or New York, I should say.

24
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,450
You know, like New York or somewhere in New York. I'm guessing New York City.

25
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:07,660
And that's when I checked. And this.

26
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:19,340
Just a scatter of it. So you have the ashes one all the way up here and everyone is down here.

27
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:29,630
Okay. But even when I, like, reduce it to just people with 100, there's still a few outliers up here.

28
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:35,400
Just like three. So I wasn't sure if we wanted to exclude them or.

29
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:40,570
And this is when it's already elected to the Medicare. Yes. So we have people that are living in these neighborhoods.

30
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:49,440
Yeah. Yeah. So if we if we made, like, a real inventory, like we did, for example, of that 2001.

31
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,980
Yeah. 20. 20,000. Yeah. Which seems wrong.

32
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:59,340
That would would we. Like, what is that going to do to the person who lives in that neighborhood?

33
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:08,130
It would they would just be excluded from the model because they would be the same one.

34
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:16,740
Yeah, grocery stores. Just from grocery stores, though, the other variables should be they should be included.

35
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,210
Okay. Because the other ones look okay. Other than these negatives.

36
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:27,120
There's this one. There's 20,000 gym and fitness centers.

37
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,180
That's also in New York. And I.

38
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,960
This one is like 119,000 ambulatory health care specialists.

39
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,960
I didn't check the scanner on that. This one's 10,000.

40
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:53,429
But, yeah, there are a few like that are really huge. Okay.

41
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,800
So let's, let's do something like cleaning and we want to say that.

42
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,620
So if something is a negative, let's make it a zero.

43
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:08,350
Design. Oh, just make it a zero. Yeah. All right. Okay.

44
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,370
All right. I'll do that. And then my skin, if it's really high, if it's these crazy values.

45
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:25,920
Yeah. Should we just send it to the mean? The mean for that in that category is that.

46
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:32,160
Just maybe an artist. I'm worried about, like, losing, because if you even have a model,

47
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:35,500
multiple variables in grocery stores as a listing in, that person's going to drop out.

48
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:42,280
You know the variables. I know that mean amputation is not accurate.

49
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:48,610
Yeah. So if we just travel, maybe the mean of that city.

50
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:55,690
Because the mean of the whole country. And these are the countries.

51
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:00,240
Yeah. Or. I mean, these are the.

52
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:09,920
Yeah. I guess the whole country. And we did it like one observation.

53
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,700
This one. Yeah. And, and this one. I don't.

54
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:48,960
This gets really weird, especially. So what we're claiming right now is that Alamo.

55
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:53,270
Okay. We're doing all right. Yeah. This is just one person.

56
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:59,480
Yeah, I'm assuming it's all the same person. Okay, but that may not be true.

57
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:08,100
So you can do. Was that?

58
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:20,390
10,000. Might be too small.

59
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,490
It. It was a 24 hour. No.

60
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:33,270
Hundred 90. Hundred thousand.

61
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:41,830
Student went on to. Oh.

62
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:51,580
Still job? Yeah, well, I think it's the same because it's so the max is up here, maybe around 500, which makes more sense.

63
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,360
Yeah. Okay, so let's just, you know, there's a ton of people in this.

64
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,140
Dennis said, let's just take out let's just set it to missing.

65
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:05,740
Okay. When it's. Ridiculously high or the negative or negative.

66
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:11,890
Okay. Unless you think we should do the negative, we get zero.

67
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,670
Going away would be strange. Yeah, I think.

68
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:23,130
I think if it was negative to make it simple, that makes sense. Yeah.

69
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,940
Exclude this person. Let me check this.

70
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:48,680
I just think it's missing. Yeah. Yeah.

71
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,260
Oh yeah, it goes all the way down to eight or nine.

72
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:19,100
So it's just that one. Yeah. So it's just, you know, it's, I say okay, okay.

73
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,140
So it's kind of it's to this.

74
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,630
I just need to have a DNA test. Oh, yeah.

75
00:11:44,400 --> 00:12:12,500
Yeah. Cause there's. There's. Zero.

76
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:42,600
It's missing. Miss. That makes sense, right?

77
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:51,030
Actually, that's right. Because if they do, less than zero will be in code.

78
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:54,299
All the missing zero. Yeah, they can do.

79
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,410
Also, less than dozen see lots and lots.

80
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But this is fine. I do it down here.

81
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:17,010
BAZZI Yeah. I was like, I'm trying to remember. Her husband died.

82
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:26,080
It's like you exactly getting around what you were saying. Like if you say less than zero, it's going to pick up the missing.

83
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,590
I just can't remember if it's less than or equal to or something else.

84
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:38,860
So, you know, that's not going to be good. I think it's I think where you had it before I was there.

85
00:13:39,070 --> 00:14:00,350
Oh, yeah. Right. No, I.

86
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:21,130
Just got. This.

87
00:14:41,290 --> 00:16:32,810
What's. Why?

88
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:42,249
Should I just delete them in the step or in the mini?

89
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:48,040
In the model? When you here.

90
00:16:48,040 --> 00:17:12,139
Here you. Yeah.

91
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:22,740
Listen, Andrew, so we want to keep these people free. I think that it's just that person.

92
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:33,230
But if we do something more, the ability in the observation we could if both were greater than 100, then gross we're equals missing.

93
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:38,729
Oh, so that at least they keep them for if they have other right variables at work.

94
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:43,190
Yeah. Okay. Okay. So then you do the same.

95
00:17:45,490 --> 00:18:08,890
Once. Just check the scanner.

96
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:35,300
I do. Yes.

97
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:51,980
It's just. You are 50.

98
00:18:54,150 --> 00:19:01,920
Yeah. Should be in less than 100 or greater than.

99
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,780
The story. 3000.

100
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:13,960
1020. So.

101
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:50,690
Alexandre. Yeah.

102
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:57,190
Okay. Okay. So those are all the variables that flow from Nano.

103
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:04,480
Okay, good. Yeah. Total population.

104
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:15,630
£25,000. This one is quite large, actually, but for the mean to be 25.

105
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:21,830
And then it jumps to you. So.

106
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,590
People in a census tract. It's like I'm in New York, right?

107
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,810
It's impossible. In particular. Yeah.

108
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:38,020
That's Jack. That's census data.

109
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:50,160
Give me a break. Oh, that's pretty good.

110
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,520
People in 4000 people or 8000 people.

111
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,340
It must be going to be a high res, high rise area. Yeah.

112
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:06,310
We can't split up an apartment building. Right, right, right.

113
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,270
I mean, yeah, there are some very densely populated cities out there, so.

114
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,330
Now. I guess I trust the census data more than the net status.

115
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:24,740
That's Netflix. Francis Trump's points.

116
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,890
For the athletes, the max to be like 100%.

117
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,819
Is that normal. Yeah. So it's just a proportions from zero one.

118
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:40,020
Yeah. So the proportion of people like it's a mean. Yeah.

119
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:49,450
It's not like there are people who are like maximum affluence and very highly affluent neighborhoods,

120
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:53,020
which is exactly how affluence, where it's kind of concentrated in place.

121
00:22:53,290 --> 00:23:02,410
People with education, income and wealth will concentrate and live in kind of communities where everybody is the same.

122
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:07,349
Right. The Transit stop.

123
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:15,240
246. The means.

124
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,480
We're in the metals. And that's to. I mean, it's not that far out.

125
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,090
I mean, but this is like 110,

126
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:59,770
maybe 250 units per 1000 people that might be in the area where there's a whole population of lots of transistors that make.

127
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:10,060
More. Person. And there would be some place like New York, which has a lot of has a lot of people.

128
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,990
You want to check the zip code? Okay. Just.

129
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:28,670
Just learn from Paul.

130
00:24:44,010 --> 00:25:09,170
Greater. Just.

131
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:22,570
Oh, Minneapolis. Okay.

132
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,320
So a lot of transit stops that's been pretty dense in the urban area and it's capturing like all different kinds of transit stops.

133
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:35,149
And it probably doesn't have a lot of people living in that area.

134
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:38,450
Just more of a downtown commuter area.

135
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,970
Yeah. And that's why it turned out to be, right?

136
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:45,590
Yeah. I mean, it looks like it's like central downtown.

137
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:52,270
I mean, if you look at the street, even, you know, it's obviously a.

138
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:09,600
You know a lot of people living here. Yeah. But at the same time, needing to be accessible for commuters was very interesting to me.

139
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:44,830
Happy driving work. I came out with the metric 15 something time.

140
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:51,460
After tweeting. What goes.

141
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:16,610
2500 person. Yeah.

142
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:24,090
She said that it was okay. I'm even counting the 12.

143
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:06,979
Oh yeah. I out to. This is a data set that doesn't have complete coverage either.

144
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,510
So being not the greatest variable. Right.

145
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:17,400
That's why we have no traffic here. Everything else.

146
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:26,800
Oh, for these ones. The elderly, disabled persons.

147
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:34,799
Instead of sales was greater than zero because they're like usually like volunteer drives or like, you know, free services.

148
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,420
I did. Two plus employees instead of six problems.

149
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,260
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Uh.

150
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:17,170
I. Right.

151
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:34,960
So this is the table that we were looking at with the poll business model to the covariance with interaction between condition and age or age group.

152
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:41,200
So I pulled out, this is like the full table and I pulled out what he recommended.

153
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:50,350
We look at, which was like the age between each disability group and then the age groups between.

154
00:29:50,900 --> 00:30:02,770
Yeah. So it's showing the risk of cardiovascular disease amongst people with.

155
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,520
I'm the same age with different conditions. Yeah.

156
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,130
And this is the. This one. Yeah, the second.

157
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:38,350
So these movements aren't that different if you are 65 and your recipe space is no different.

158
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:46,720
He does write something Japanese-American.

159
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,480
This was about also his time as.

160
00:30:53,790 --> 00:31:02,350
Everything we see there seems to have a higher risk. And that's, you know, and that's.

161
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,450
Yes. Because of this ambulatory issue. Yeah.

162
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:21,530
And they are just like. Like for I don't know.

163
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:29,180
For me, this is not the most interesting interaction I think is going to be cognizant of that there are differences in.

164
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,440
In my condition, depending on the age.

165
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:42,790
But I think I think I'm more interested in the question that we have is whether those differences in their affect on the environment.

166
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:47,650
Conditions. What's your thought?

167
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:58,610
I mean, I think seem like these interactions are not this.

168
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:10,370
Gradual as like I thought that first survival thing like you know, where is the lowest.

169
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:17,540
And then the US and then Asia. These ones don't really support that story, I feel like.

170
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:25,700
Right. That's why after you just put it right, you know, you see the same differences, although you still see this slightly higher risk of a major.

171
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:33,050
Yeah. Um, and that seems to be played out, you know, by looking at these interactions too, like, yeah, even people at the same age.

172
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:40,639
But, but these interactions I think tell the story of like as you increase in age with a common condition,

173
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,700
with a given condition, that risk increase which makes sense.

174
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:51,140
Yeah. And ah so we have age of the models that I can choose.

175
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:04,020
Let's look at this one again. It's just the comparisons, you know.

176
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:10,050
So then the first woman or the first man or woman.

177
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,870
Is with the US demographic.

178
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:21,230
So population disadvantage, affluence and then transit stops per capita.

179
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,140
Population is a total population with a population density.

180
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:34,190
Total population. Okay. I don't know.

181
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:43,990
Oh. Would that be this one person's post? Yeah.

182
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:59,060
Jesus won instead. He's had one because I've done an injustice for the area, the size, the spatial area of the census tract.

183
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:07,540
I want to check. Yeah.

184
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,060
Yeah. That means that.

185
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:45,050
Oh, that's a small population. That's. Let's see.

186
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:59,930
Mean. Oh.

187
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:19,760
Much of the commentary. Did you check in 18?

188
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:43,780
I mean, it was significant, which is such a big deal, does everything right.

189
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:48,720
So it's like. You know.

190
00:35:51,300 --> 00:36:08,620
Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

191
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:40,670
That's crazy. You might need to just pick either a disadvantage or affluence.

192
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:49,420
Yeah. Maybe he wants to just pick out. And that's just take advantage show.

193
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:56,690
At least that's captures like, you know. Positive aspects such.

194
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:49,670
So 15 were told. Once again people in, you know.

195
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,860
Tell. 27.

196
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:04,110
That's of what he's going to do for you.

197
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:20,590
Okay. So. You know, you just.

198
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:33,930
Six. Okay.

199
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:43,730
I was thinking. If the principal interest is a condition.

200
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:57,310
That's an example of my next door neighbor. Would HMO like having additional HMO affect the neighborhood?

201
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,670
Yeah, I guess so. It's what is HMO? It's it.

202
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:06,159
They have like an additional insurance.

203
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,250
Insurance, like in addition to Medicare. Okay.

204
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,550
So sometimes that's like Medicare Advantage and that could be anything else.

205
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:16,570
More money, extra coverage, extra money and extra coverage.

206
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,840
Yeah. And so and you're seeing those.

207
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:27,040
In fact, they're like, Yeah, I was thinking that I kind of added it in just thinking like automatically,

208
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,820
but I'm trying to think it through and I don't know if.

209
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:39,800
Yeah. It actually is a confounder because it doesn't influence the neighborhood.

210
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:45,620
Yeah. Does it like affluence would affect HMO.

211
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:51,290
Right. But not the other way around.

212
00:39:54,700 --> 00:40:03,660
I just. The dependent variable is parity of.

213
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:15,850
And then the exposure. This is like amongst a cohort of people with physical disabilities.

214
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:22,210
So we're talking about neighborhood resources or characteristics.

215
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:29,180
And I mean the think that we have.

216
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:37,260
Like HMO being a proxy for education resources.

217
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:45,690
So people with more money, more resources would select into better neighborhoods.

218
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:52,110
We'd be more likely to live in advantaged neighborhoods with more resources.

219
00:40:52,920 --> 00:41:00,720
Yeah, I guess if it's a proxy for like. Affluence or resources like financial resources.

220
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:06,060
Okay. So if we say that affluence is they just want to share like an affluent neighborhood.

221
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:10,130
Yeah. That's going to have, I mean, reduce your risk of CVD.

222
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:15,560
Yeah. People with HMO are more likely to be living in affluent neighborhoods.

223
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:20,940
So that's a positive. And people with HMO are less likely to have CVD?

224
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:26,010
I think so. So that would be accounting for that negative association.

225
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:36,240
So it would be a confounder. Okay. And what else do we have in the model is age, sex, race, age, sex, race.

226
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:41,040
Um, number of comorbidities.

227
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:54,489
Okay. And again, the same kind of idea that if you have like comorbid conditions, you're more likely to have kids.

228
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:55,540
And that's really hard to do.

229
00:41:56,050 --> 00:42:03,640
You might be less likely to live in advantaged neighborhoods because you've had a lot of health problems that are probably accumulating over time,

230
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,799
which means you can't work, which means your income is going down.

231
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:12,190
So you're not going to be able to move in or live in an area that's slightly negative, and that would also then account for that.

232
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,260
So that makes sense. Oh, okay. Okay.

233
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:28,300
So I did actually check for a common area amongst the covariance, but generally because I feel like a went up and.

234
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:36,110
Egypt. Oh, no, no.

235
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,540
I guess they just think each moment at once will definitely be incorporated.

236
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:48,910
I didn't check it out. I just checked for culinary gain amongst the neighborhood.

237
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:55,610
Yeah, I think it's okay if they're calling it nothing, because that's what we are trying to account for.

238
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:03,950
Oh, I think with that, with the neighborhood variables, what we're worried about is we're considering them all as exposures in that same group.

239
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:09,459
I think it. Okay.

240
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:16,270
So each panel is offering what we think it's like. Well, an Alex Holder's operating okay.

241
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:22,900
And then we have population density. Well, as I said, I'm.

242
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:28,840
And that person was. What are we in the record?

243
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:41,330
Should something happen to. I don't think we need to, but we should just check with, if you like.

244
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:48,410
A we. She?

245
00:43:54,070 --> 00:44:14,070
Does. This. Somewhere it looks like.

246
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:29,390
It's. Something's happening to it as it's before it gets to. You want to look at it with just population density or maybe without.

247
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:35,820
So this different kind of cancer. Yeah. He's.

248
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,290
Sarah, what's the line on this one? No, that's just your cursor.

249
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,780
Oh, yeah. Sorry. Yeah, that's true. That's just weird.

250
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:56,870
It doesn't make any sense. Yeah. And what if you take it.

251
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:00,600
If you did the other variable. That total. Yeah.

252
00:45:55,890 --> 00:46:06,960
This first. Same.

253
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:22,940
Understand. You know, the is it's just so such a small you know that's why because it's just we need to.

254
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:30,500
Need to change the variable to be like instead of like persons per square mile have it be like.

255
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:38,270
Because it's going to be so. But what is the metric of population density?

256
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:10,260
Actually here's want to do. And description of that fracking are very.

257
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:41,810
Of the DNC. It really doesn't matter to me. Okay.

258
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:53,350
Any specific options or anything? Persons per square mile.

259
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:18,210
The maximum is this huge. Okay.

260
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:31,080
Extreme observation. So did you see her?

261
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:42,320
I mean, tweet has to be more like zero risk.

262
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:48,500
I don't want money. That can't be.

263
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,110
Good. Because we have.

264
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,450
These are people. Yeah. Like there's at least one person living here.

265
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,360
£46. All right, but.

266
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,710
These are. Zero.

267
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,770
If you do the total population and we still have zeros.

268
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:59,490
Yes. So I bet you that's why I address.

269
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:06,510
Hopefully we don't have too many zeros. I can check.

270
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:27,730
Okay. Just equals zero density or actually two means.

271
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:44,530
Can you. There isn't anything missing on the other features.

272
00:50:55,350 --> 00:51:23,670
This. Oh, that's.

273
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:43,740
These are. Oh.

274
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:50,360
I wonder if they know they're. It was 2008 to 2014, I think.

275
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:58,760
So it's I wonder if maybe they're in this. Some of these are still.

276
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:15,000
What's the sector? Population? But not looking out for him is awesome for.

277
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:21,200
Is that from? It's from the cross.

278
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:35,480
It also has, as you know. And there are this one is in 2013, but there should be.

279
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:39,510
Everything else should be within and between and.

280
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:51,860
And when you look at the white in zero. Oh, I see.

281
00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:00,040
Which is pretty. So we need to go.

282
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:23,750
So. Ken is obviously going to be like.

283
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:33,670
The problem that we're having there was like, you got that verbal assault against me.

284
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:43,960
And also, I've never. So let's look at that variable population density univariate.

285
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:55,570
Okay. And I just want to see why it's coming. I think the problem is the values of this are so high, which is that 20, 20, 60.

286
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:05,630
Yeah, 2016. And then it's like a unit increase and we need to do it so that it's.

287
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:13,750
It seems to find we need to create a scale and variable.

288
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:23,070
It's. The number of persons per square mile each regulate thousands of persons per square mile.

289
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:31,320
Oh, so I can actually estimate because it's estimating the effect of a one unit change.

290
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:36,240
Yeah. And it's. That's why it's so tiny. Oh, right. So we did.

291
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:42,429
And the max is. It's huge.

292
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:50,200
But if anything, if we went find like thousands of people per square mile versus I think thousands would work.

293
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,560
We just need to. Divided by 2000.

294
00:54:56,610 --> 00:55:02,700
Divided by 8000. Divided by the times of.

295
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:08,050
Tens of thousands of. Okay.

296
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:11,900
I think I think there's a way to look at Reynolds.

297
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:17,870
Okay. Like a maybe in a. You just create a new variable?

298
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:35,270
Oh, yeah, that's probably easier. So I'm just saying.

299
00:55:36,340 --> 00:56:00,070
Tens of thousands. Wouldn't that make it bigger, though?

300
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:05,560
Yeah. And then. But then it's because like in the results, it's like it's an entry.

301
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,360
It's tiny. Yeah. So that would be good, large or anything.

302
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:20,110
It should make it larger because this is just the it's like it's this 18000.

303
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:27,470
Zero. So she should maybe get.

304
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:36,140
And I think you should be about people because I think you want to make it these numbers, though, if it's only 28,

305
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:43,220
68 for him as the mean, I think we divide it by a thousand, for example, it's going to go one, two, three, it's going to be 2.8, six.

306
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:51,169
It's going to show and the effect of a one unit change going from 2 to 3 as opposed to going to it.

307
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:58,760
682869. Oh I see. So I guess it's worth thinking about and what we can do about it for you.

308
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:03,040
10,000 people, as we should be. We just heard that.

309
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:09,670
This is going to be zeroes. It's going to be outcome. Okay.

310
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:45,240
And just a quick read on that. Okay.

311
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:49,290
So this is 146 is the max.

312
00:57:54,040 --> 00:58:04,950
That should work better. I know.

313
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:09,950
Yeah. Yeah.

314
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:14,610
Makes us look. Drawing on his time with her.

315
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:50,760
So that would make it population density per 1000 people per square mile.

316
00:58:51,240 --> 00:59:03,350
Okay. The number of thousands of people per square mile is much too many people.

317
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:27,029
Yeah. Oh, yeah, persons.

318
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:30,380
Yeah. So, 1000 persons. Makes sense.

319
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:42,020
Okay. It's better. Yeah. If still living in a more densely populated area.

320
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:52,880
This is. The sentence because of the fact that there's something about living in cities versus.

321
00:59:56,690 --> 01:00:00,080
And I wanted to protect you and try to.

322
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:12,910
This is a good race. Why?

323
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,230
And one because I understand.

324
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:32,160
And I don't know that we're talking about transit systems because the transit stops would affect access to like grocery stores and things like that,

325
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:40,470
access to like gyms and fitness centers and access to community services.

326
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:46,970
For a lot of computer programs. I think that was the thing.

327
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:55,080
Like it would affect all the other models. Transportation.

328
01:00:55,250 --> 01:01:03,090
Yeah. I mean, you might want to just drop it and it's not turning out to be something that's coming out.

329
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:12,120
Or is it? Would you mind running it in one of the competitions for the other variables are probably pretty stable.

330
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:13,260
And doing that. So that's 911 to you.

331
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:18,570
Yes, it's different because abstinence is not significant when it was before.

332
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:35,170
It wasn't easy for the government. Yeah. I mean, the hazard ratios, they.

333
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:45,100
Okay. This is not really. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

334
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,630
That's a pretty good feeling. Leave it out. Right.

335
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:54,130
Yeah. We can only continue.

336
01:02:57,090 --> 01:03:08,819
Okay. So okay. So what is unadjusted model to is plus covariance model three is plus I see us in terms of if we

337
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:19,620
decide to put American model for is covariance plus x demo plus grocery or like food consumables.

338
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:27,660
And. Yeah. And then after that recreations.

339
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:33,510
I put this quite heavy, but I can go this perfect.

340
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:41,640
And then after that is health care. Social services. And then the last one is everything combined?

341
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:52,650
Okay. Did you run them all? No. But because I wasn't sure, like, if you, like, wanted to take them out, we've got a significant jump.

342
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:57,390
About $0.50 to just run them and we'll get me. I wrote them all out, but I didn't.

343
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:21,490
Okay. So this is food and consumption because this.

344
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:56,070
So don't spend some money you don't need to put in.

345
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:07,740
Because I remember we were we were debating whether because some stores include groceries and they're not related.

346
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:11,160
Yeah, some people. Oh, yeah.

347
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:14,970
I guess relations are not that.

348
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:22,430
Yeah. Right. Yeah, but we told stories.

349
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:30,310
If it doesn't include of course we want to include it in like the food consumables.

350
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:37,010
So the only reason is because in the rural areas, they don't have grocery stores, but they have dollar stores.

351
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:41,240
That's the only reason that there could be any of that.

352
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:45,300
So. Yes, so. Too much.

353
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:56,430
If you run it, you just. Just drop it. Yeah. Keeping everything here is really good.

354
01:05:56,430 --> 01:06:04,680
And that Super Bowl makes it right. Oh, I am so sorry.

355
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:06,750
I'm just going to talk to you really quickly.

356
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:14,100
I may need to ask for an extension for the paper, because this morning I ran to deal with this situation.

357
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:19,049
My car got broken, too. They actually stole stuff from the car.

358
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:22,650
So. So I have a police report on everything right now.

359
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:26,890
And if you remember, I have no idea how many.

360
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:31,210
That's completely fine. Yeah, I'm just gonna tell you.

361
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:37,350
Sorry. Did you lose that really valuable stuff? Yeah. I lost a berry jacket that was around $2,000.

362
01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:44,969
And all my ski equipment and my ice skating stuff and snow goggles and basically,

363
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:48,959
like other winter interest for stuff because I kept them on my car, which was totally my fault.

364
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,300
Right now, if you. I'm so sorry.

365
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:55,760
I am so sorry. That is horrible. So, so sorry.

366
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:04,160
Yeah. This is like another car got broken into as well, but they find anything on her car, so they smashed her, which is not uncommon last night.

367
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:09,900
Have you seen the new show? And I actually met the lady and she said, you know this show?

368
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:14,559
Yeah. She has more repaired than me, smashed my car's windshield.

369
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:18,460
That's going to be like a $7,000 repair. Yeah.

370
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:23,200
Oh, my gosh. I am so sorry. Look, whatever time you need, it's completely fine.

371
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:24,580
I'm just gonna worry about it.

372
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:33,370
Deal with it like these two days, and I'm going to arrange around to get a repair and probably for my interest company as well.

373
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:39,250
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And just so we can write the whole thing and deal with all of that.

374
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,180
Yeah. They even found the tool they used to hack into my window.

375
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:46,450
It's a it's a like a Trump stuff like you.

376
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:50,890
We played instrument, like the drum, like the piano, the better one.

377
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:55,480
So they probably stole it from somebody else. Yeah, right. And I took it to the place.

378
01:07:55,480 --> 01:08:01,060
I just came back from department, and they were like, Just tell me you just wait.

379
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:08,320
I mean, there's really nothing you can do. I mean, I can think about the work and just insurance and do that and focus on that.

380
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:14,270
Yeah, that's. My word. That is at least 80.

381
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:19,610
Of course. Right now. Right now, like your exams, everything else, right?

382
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,079
Yeah. I don't, you know, like I have exam like next week, like real exams.

383
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:29,930
But I do have like do this like a lot of dos. Actually, this weekend, I'm just going to have to hear my professors.

384
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:33,770
I just. I can't write at home. So you can talk to me.

385
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:37,340
Don't worry. I'll just give you a sentence the next week until the 16th.

386
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:41,360
I'm just. Yeah, I'm going to Dallas first and.

387
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:49,390
Yeah, that. That's I it right then. Yeah.

388
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,900
Right. But after all, I can think of everything, like outside of your life.

389
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:58,490
It's just physical stuff. I remember my. I guess.

390
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:01,300
Yeah, that's true. Okay, I'm just going to. Yeah.

391
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:06,530
And actually, I do have some questions on paper, but I parked my car in the emergency room, so I can I just, you know, you.

392
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:13,700
Of course. Yeah. Perfect. I'm going to run to the dealership, right, to get a quote about the window and make you the big breath.

393
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:19,280
You know, I'm not sure that I was really from where like walk to where they called me.

394
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:22,720
And but like right now, think about everything. Like, how can they do that?

395
01:09:22,730 --> 01:09:28,550
Yeah, that's crazy. They were saying, like, homeless, but can you believe they even took my dog carrier?

396
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:35,809
Oh, he's had a car. It was like a dog meadow sitting by and they took him housing a homeless.

397
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:40,410
These died. Well, you never know. I actually kept saying that I.

398
01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:45,860
I don't know. It's so sad. I just. I'm sorry. That's one way to relieve stress.

399
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:47,809
I'm not. I'm going to deal with it.

400
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:55,000
I mean, I'm just going to give myself two days to, like, walk through the incident and go, you know, people are done.

401
01:09:55,880 --> 01:10:02,010
If it happens, it happens. What are you saying? That I think that's what I'm going to deal with it and I will leave you guys.

402
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:07,240
So sorry about just interrupting everything here. I'm, like, available for people, and that's what I'm here for.

403
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:10,940
It's so nice of you so much. Yeah, I was going to be here anyway because I just.

404
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:14,780
I do have a question for the this, but I'm going to be doing a course.

405
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:20,530
Invited me another chance and to just take that offer and I'm going to deal with the car so yeah.

406
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:24,379
Yeah. Thank you. Good luck. And, you know, thank you so much.

407
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:29,760
You guys have a good day, okay? Yeah. I'm thrilled that I'm gonna.

408
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:41,050
Okay. So this is the model? Yes. So what about grocery warehouse?

409
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:47,210
Increases risk. So the number of grocery stores increases.

410
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:51,300
Yeah, we saw this before. Um.

411
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:56,230
Because just because you have a grocery store or something, you're going to be buying food.

412
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:00,550
Sure. Convenience of the other ones are not.

413
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:09,490
And so shall we start making some decisions that we want to keep in here and maybe even drop the dollar stores because that's.

414
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:18,450
But on the fringe, do you. Yeah.

415
01:11:28,770 --> 01:12:16,910
You want to see what it looks like without it? Okay. Okay.

416
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:21,020
I'm happy with this and we will just keep those for the time being.

417
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:41,240
Stories makes it go down. Okay.

418
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:58,880
So this convenience store. Can you?

419
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:03,170
Check. This is where of the interactions.

420
01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:25,680
Condition. Between.

421
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:41,720
Think. So the ones that were projecting that would looked like they were going down like so let's just look at.

422
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:49,690
Fast food I condition that's. The average.

423
01:13:51,790 --> 01:14:19,950
Average American actually had. That's.

424
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:30,520
Oh, wait, the conditions are. But this one isn't.

425
01:14:32,120 --> 01:15:03,110
Just. Let me ask you.

426
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:50,510
Oh, yes. That novel is just a placeholder for the consumables.

427
01:15:55,240 --> 01:16:01,420
How much time? Know I don't need to tell you.

428
01:16:02,530 --> 01:16:09,930
It's better to keep everything else you know. Yeah.

429
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:22,530
Next. There's got to be a recreation.

430
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:41,720
Yeah. I think I like. So we got on this issue.

431
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:55,640
I right. So this is when we run this, it's going to be a reduced sample size because of that traffic.

432
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:03,950
And then you can drop traffic and see what the other effects are. All right.

433
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:38,740
So this is for people. Means different.

434
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:41,740
Like. Like a pro? No, not at all.

435
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:50,770
I mean, I have to check my notes every month, so I guess it's not quite like second nature for me.

436
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:55,360
Yeah, but like I said, I have to check my notes too much to start doing.

437
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:03,600
You're just you're really, really good.

438
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:23,230
Yeah, but, like, barely. Because it's probably such a small.

439
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:27,480
The number of cars passing.

440
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:53,470
Let's turn to the traffic in Hollywood. A sample. I mean, for.

441
01:19:15,230 --> 01:19:18,320
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

442
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:27,560
This one. Medically it. But I think it will automatically thing because I would just want an idea.

443
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:42,940
Okay. But other people will be. Yeah. Okay, so just. Maybe you.

444
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:12,320
Oh, no, we did. So this is 24 722 free people.

445
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:20,030
With. Do you look at traffic data?

446
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:26,770
24. And now it's not only.

447
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:33,790
Oh. So it's just that it's dropping people who don't have traffic data doing the same thing.

448
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:39,450
Have to that. Excluding the traffic variable to keep.

449
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:55,760
Yeah. So this went through your checking. Even without.

450
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:10,170
So I. And we could do the same thing we did with pop density, with the traffic lights,

451
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:14,489
like the effects are so small that it's just a number of cars that try and avoid the distribution.

452
01:21:14,490 --> 01:21:21,780
And that was for the moment, I think you remember this green line when.

453
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:27,810
You're not going to communitarian going to find.

454
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:12,190
It's going to be a great. I.

455
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:23,720
What do you think? Yeah, I think that makes sense.

456
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:31,670
Okay. So Highway 100 could be number of cars or average number of cars on the highway.

457
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:41,580
So average number of cars per intersection per 100 people.

458
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:52,300
No, I'd be like. Must be like average number of cars, average number of cars per intersection.

459
01:22:53,650 --> 01:23:06,820
Okay. This.

460
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:17,450
Period. Yeah.

461
01:23:18,110 --> 01:23:25,590
I mean, legally, just right now. So.

462
01:23:34,390 --> 01:24:13,300
U.S. Yeah, that makes sense.

463
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:28,540
Okay. So instead of this.

464
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:49,090
Right. I thought it was about that many people.

465
01:25:26,590 --> 01:25:29,670
So for everyone in car, it's very interesting on average.

466
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:36,180
For. That's 50% increase.

467
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:57,020
Something that. Okay.

468
01:25:57,710 --> 01:26:01,910
This is good. Okay, let's do the next kind of thing.

469
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:18,180
So this. Health care, social services.

470
01:26:48,790 --> 01:27:04,960
At the same time. I think he just.

471
01:28:22,960 --> 01:29:02,290
Okay. 2000 and.

472
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:21,920
Yeah. I want you to know what you're doing.

473
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:39,380
I'm afraid if I can find. But I.

474
01:30:23,930 --> 01:30:28,360
All right. So those are three groups.

475
01:30:30,110 --> 01:30:34,480
You want to see any of these women? Or.

476
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:46,510
I was wondering if transistors. We should do transistors actions already in a way that.

477
01:30:54,190 --> 01:31:01,570
Because it would also affect the chance. Like the public transit usage.

478
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:13,059
As I said, it hasn't really thinking of the price right now.

479
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:16,150
I see people have.

480
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:26,170
Or I guess I don't know. More likely to use a subway ride like in the morning.

481
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:30,060
I like most of these terms it sounds for and.

482
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:39,740
During. I saw that.

483
01:31:45,230 --> 01:31:49,930
So for the. At this moment.

484
01:31:51,990 --> 01:31:59,630
Transit systems. Okay.

485
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:52,630
Just for her health right now. I mean, it affected the pharmacies.

486
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:12,000
Increasing risk. Yeah. I mean, like, medications are the only way you can also get.

487
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:17,070
Unhealthy foods. That's true, but not the drinks in tobacco.

488
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:22,940
I think it depends on the city and. And it depends on the story, too.

489
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:26,670
In California, CBS doesn't have it.

490
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:39,490
Mr. Cummings argues. And then you put them all together.

491
01:33:41,150 --> 01:33:54,650
So I think for this health care model. No one can take you now.

492
01:33:56,090 --> 01:34:14,360
You're just here now. Because it's really how far you try to have to be take out just home health and military health care and.

493
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:19,410
It's just like your access to money for Taco Bell, for example, right now.

494
01:34:20,770 --> 01:34:29,410
So much of this in. Things. Since the beginning of more.

495
01:34:30,700 --> 01:35:21,780
All right. Here, this. Ambulatory.

496
01:35:22,170 --> 01:35:25,940
So this is just things like I was ambulatory.

497
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:30,850
It just means anything we can go to that's not like a hospital, like in and out, you know, like,

498
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:36,620
you know, I get health care, like it's physician doctors offices, and so it's not like invasions.

499
01:35:37,130 --> 01:35:54,130
Okay. Yeah. Let's make this about health care as kind of.

500
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:01,930
During. And the have.

501
01:36:13,780 --> 01:36:17,870
And those. So that's.

502
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:24,800
Okay. All right. In an hour.

503
01:36:25,930 --> 01:36:32,270
All right, great. Because I'm on TV. Burgess.

504
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:36,370
How? So this is the traffic issue.

505
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:42,820
Let's just look at this right now. Again, remind yourself for me.

506
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:49,580
I think because it was there's nothing for parks. There's nothing that I did that was.

507
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:12,020
Try. Looks through.

508
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:19,920
Okay. That's good. Let's actually let's talk about that. So we write that down.

509
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:30,290
Thanks. Yeah. During.

510
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:36,870
Okay. And then other consumables. Let's try that.

511
01:37:38,130 --> 01:37:41,700
So this one, we don't need to see the dish. Not yet.

512
01:37:53,790 --> 01:38:03,700
Down here, the suicide action. Yeah.

513
01:38:05,570 --> 01:38:12,559
Tobacco. Okay.

514
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:20,370
Silence. I think we can drop tobacco. We could combine.

515
01:38:32,170 --> 01:38:47,880
I can look at your. I'm sorry.

516
01:38:54,150 --> 01:38:58,500
I was trying to keep liquor and tobacco.

517
01:39:13,230 --> 01:40:25,460
And. No, no. Justice. No. Okay.

518
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:34,020
So now. Let's see if we can get a final model of the combined model.

519
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:47,830
Where? Do you want to look at this when the traffic because I feel like traffic or transit definitely influence at least here.

520
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:51,700
Sure. Yeah. And I think you're right. You can kind.

521
01:41:54,900 --> 01:42:16,150
One. Like everything you do and everything.

522
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:22,430
And I'm just happy to catch you administering a test.

523
01:42:22,430 --> 01:42:25,940
So you're administering the test? Yeah.

524
01:42:25,940 --> 01:42:34,720
I'm just that student who missed the final. Oh, thank you.

525
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:40,280
Thank you. Thank you. See you next year.

526
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:45,540
Two actually related to the final four.

527
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:48,980
I'm hoping to get ready to go. Do you mind that?

528
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:52,040
It is wildly specific? No. Okay.

529
01:42:52,550 --> 01:43:00,680
I'm going to follow all the guidelines, but it might be a little bit specific when you say specific, specific topic or.

530
01:43:01,820 --> 01:43:10,879
Yes, looking at how the Soviet Union sort of developed as a trauma as a result of Soviet Union

531
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:16,070
dissolved the concept of community in Eastern Europe and how that impacts social isolation.

532
01:43:17,330 --> 01:43:23,050
So I've been writing sample for just for the applications.

533
01:43:23,060 --> 01:43:23,360
Yeah.

534
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:35,060
I think one of the professors are interested in working with Harvard does with trauma a community urban design planning and like post trauma areas.

535
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:44,600
Yeah, but I just thought about, you know, I've seen read it and I go, wow, this is incredibly neat.

536
01:43:45,950 --> 01:43:49,870
Yeah, yeah. No, I think so. All that.

537
01:43:52,630 --> 01:44:04,360
You know, I think you and I are both kind of encouraging you to do, even doing just back and forth.

538
01:44:04,740 --> 01:44:07,750
So, yeah, it's in there.

539
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:12,120
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.

540
01:44:12,490 --> 01:44:20,800
Good luck. And keep an eye out for this.

541
01:44:24,190 --> 01:44:30,210
Transit star. So we were looking for.

542
01:44:33,630 --> 01:44:43,920
Which is why I thought I wanted to see instead of trying to do something better that would affect the.

543
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:52,040
Took our customers past this one.

544
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:58,070
One went down and five. You were like in the fifties, dumbass.

545
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:03,290
Do you think it's because it's this type of sample or something about.

546
01:45:08,380 --> 01:45:20,810
How many people? Yeah. I mean, I feel like it's because or at least that my hypothesis is because, like when there's outdoor traffic, you know,

547
01:45:20,810 --> 01:45:26,190
like you're less like even less likely to make more of an effort for it to, like,

548
01:45:26,190 --> 01:45:38,210
get healthy if you kind of just go to the closest, which can often be fast food, like, you know, anything else.

549
01:45:40,070 --> 01:45:46,420
Interesting. I'm not sure what tobacco stores, but I know somewhere in the right direction.

550
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:50,140
Mm hmm. Okay.

551
01:45:50,530 --> 01:45:53,950
Let's let's do a quick combine. Okay.

552
01:45:55,050 --> 01:45:58,940
Happens when you start to combine tobacco and liquor from.

553
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:02,330
No, I want everything to. Okay.

554
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:11,940
John. A check come near here? Yeah.

555
01:46:12,390 --> 01:46:21,510
So this is the. Let's look at the model itself.

556
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:40,650
Let's see what I didn't hear already. So. I'm going to do this from now.

557
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:56,560
So grocery warehouses are taking out convenience store gas.

558
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:12,310
She had three variables. Her tobacco has to be this aspect of tobacco.

559
01:47:12,580 --> 01:47:16,030
Okay. For me to combine the tobacco, you know? All right.

560
01:47:16,310 --> 01:47:19,360
Yeah. This is the summary. Yeah. Yeah. So.

561
01:47:19,650 --> 01:47:35,770
Yeah. I.

562
01:47:57,570 --> 01:48:02,280
Right. Just happened.

563
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:10,490
Or. That's.

564
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:50,820
We just shook. Yeah.

565
01:48:51,000 --> 01:49:02,950
Okay. Dementia.

566
01:49:02,950 --> 01:49:16,560
And I told him not to do this. You know, I stood.

567
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:36,580
It's a grocery warehouse. Must be. We have parks, gyms, gyms in the centers, and that's going to be very much right now.

568
01:49:37,410 --> 01:49:41,010
And then health care where, you know, we keep ambulatory.

569
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:52,360
This allows. I'm taking up a social science degree in Australia.
