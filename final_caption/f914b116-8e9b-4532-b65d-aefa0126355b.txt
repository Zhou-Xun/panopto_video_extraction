1
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:11,530
We had a a ghost lecture here when we were at the lab doing our regular blasting, but that thing goes on automatically.

2
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,069
So there was nothing. And actually, there were people here.

3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,870
So I saw that something had been posted like books on there, like people discussing,

4
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:25,150
like they're putting on some project from Fox with a noticeable person, I believe.

5
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:40,600
You know this the paper garbage, you know.

6
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,690
I didn't know they were there.

7
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:09,200
Yeah. Israel.

8
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:25,000
Support is going to get bigger and.

9
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:33,460
I don't know how you I say if you want to give up that.

10
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:48,890
You never doubt yourself. Oh, no, no.

11
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:22,720
The. That's where we are going to figure it out.

12
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:29,350
Nowhere. And I did the substitution.

13
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:39,730
You know, I think. By.

14
00:02:51,640 --> 00:03:07,540
Oh. You.

15
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:38,710
So it begins. People want to talk to, you know, where we're at and we're going to talk.

16
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,400
And it's not as as you should.

17
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:54,960
Yeah. Right. That oriented yourselves where we are in a semester midway ish.

18
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:04,620
Um. Okay. So we finished our wet lab or whatever and had fun and then necropsy sort of way does our wet lab.

19
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:12,450
Um, today we're going to set the stage for the discussion of results.

20
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:20,340
So today is the 21st. I saw as of last night, most of the method sections I think were turned in.

21
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:26,310
Hopefully everyone got those squared away. Let me know if any problems, but I will work on getting those back to you.

22
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,440
My goal is to have them back to you by next week. So again, it's just kind of comments.

23
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:41,700
Edited draft. Okay. At the end of today, I'm going to talk about the beginning, but today we're going to assign all the non histology data.

24
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,000
So the blood work parameters, the serum antibody levels, things like that.

25
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,629
So today we're going to assign a review and we're going to distribute that across the class since it's a limited time class.

26
00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:00,390
So you don't have to individually review all data in next week's class, which will be the 28th.

27
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,200
We can go through and interpret all that data.

28
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:15,190
So I'll show you in a sec. I distributed the data after in our protocol discussion, you had been assigned like something that was directly relevant.

29
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:20,549
Like if you were assigned to talk about, I don't know, like the virus plaque titer in the context of virus titer,

30
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,320
you got assigned that data set so can make it follow up with what you talked about before.

31
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,620
Obviously everyone has to sort of understand the methods behind each set of data,

32
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,710
but just to try to split up the discussion so you're each kind of assigned a data set.

33
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:38,550
So that is gonna be assigned today and we'll talk about it next week.

34
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,820
Um, just big picture, if that's true.

35
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:49,920
And then after we do that, you'll have all the information that you need to write your results section for everything except the histology,

36
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:58,710
except the microscopy data. So the assignment of writing the results section is the assignment is made, yeah.

37
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:04,680
Is made next week and then that won't be due as a draft until two weeks after that.

38
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:11,820
So you have like two weeks to write that part of the results section and that seems all confusing to me, but that works best.

39
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,620
And then in the interim, we're going to talk I have the other half of today's lecture and talk a little bit

40
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,390
about interpretation of histology data and that we're going to review in class.

41
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:26,070
It's just gonna be a little bit quicker that way, given we have a limited number of classes remaining.

42
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:32,009
Okay, so once we review the histology data, you'll be assigned to write the results section for that.

43
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:37,620
So that'll be the last little sort of coda to your results and that'll be due two weeks after that.

44
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:45,370
So basically we have, you know, pretty much every class for now for if something is assigned.

45
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,870
So just kind of pay attention to when things are assigned and when they're due.

46
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,430
And each thing that's sort of a written assignment, you have like a two week period of time to write that.

47
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:05,010
Okay. So then on the 11, so then we'll have finished talking about the non Istio data, we'll have finished talking about the histo data.

48
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:11,999
And at that point we'll have a pretty good idea as of that class and the fourth of what our conclusions are in relation to toxicity,

49
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,010
in relation to efficacy. Some of you might even have guesses as to what the mystery vaccine is and what the mystery of viral infection is.

50
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,780
But on the 11th will be sort of our big reveal. And we'll wrap things up.

51
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,670
We'll give you some background material.

52
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:31,740
You'll know finally we might actually reveal at the end of class on November 4th, just so you have some context.

53
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,940
But on the 11th, we'll really get into talking about the big picture,

54
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:41,639
putting everything in context and trying to bring all the data together to and to really answer

55
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:48,090
the study objective and the bring all the information that you'll need to write the full paper.

56
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:58,610
That will be the 11th. And I have a little spillover design, like in case I don't know, the history runs long and we have some jockeying around to do.

57
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,150
There's still some opportunity. If we have to kind of finish that up on the 18th, we can do so as well.

58
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:10,380
But the main thing I want to do on the 18th is review for the quiz,

59
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,510
because like the two main graded things that you have remaining or your paper obviously and then the quiz,

60
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:26,969
if you look under modules, um, under your lecture modules, there already is in case you're starting to get anxious about it.

61
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,680
A study guide on that last day.

62
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,620
What I usually do something to show you this recipes here with a complicated.

63
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:50,130
Okay. So some of the stuff that we learned is a little bit more didactic, a little drier, easier to assess in the form of a quiz.

64
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:58,240
Other stuff is being assessed in your paper. So the first module we did was just intro to talks, path and study design.

65
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,790
And so this is kind of a list of the main points in that module.

66
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:09,900
So when it comes time to review for the quiz, use this to guide what you look at in that module.

67
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,650
Okay. The quiz in this class is much more straightforward. Not very much.

68
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,670
Not like the midterm that you just took for 616. It's more like, do you know it?

69
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:26,579
And it isn't in class. It isn't in class quiz. It's not an open book quiz, but this is designed to really shouldn't be any surprises.

70
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:32,309
Tell you what you need to know for that. Okay. So we did that first module.

71
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:38,100
We did an animal welfare modules is a bunch of stuff associated with that, mostly just memorizing stuff for the most part,

72
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,590
all the middle things like the immune system lecture, the module on reporting.

73
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,310
You don't need to go back to that that's being assessed by your paper.

74
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,520
Okay. So the only besides those first two besides that intro talks back in the well and the welfare thing,

75
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,910
the only other two lectures that you're being tested on are today's, which is stats for continuous data.

76
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:05,490
And then we have a module that talks about pathology data, interpretation,

77
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,700
has a little bit of stats in it, just some general path data interpretation.

78
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:17,700
So there's really only four lectures that comprise the material for your quiz, and this document will kind of walk you through that.

79
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,990
So as you're studying, you should use that to guide what you're reading in the PowerPoint.

80
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:29,760
Okay. And on that review and that process, on the review on that 18th or whatever it was.

81
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:37,579
Basically what I usually do is I just I make I pull slides from those PowerPoints that kind of address each of those things.

82
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,820
So you have kind of a summary PowerPoint that has slides from each of those four lectures.

83
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:47,160
So you have everything kind of consolidated to study from, okay, so that's what we'll be doing on the 18th.

84
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,550
Here is the schedule again, but.

85
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,090
It just seems like it goes so fast at the end of the 18th.

86
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:07,090
We'll do that in class review. Then we have Thanksgiving. But during that time, obviously you'll be finishing your paper.

87
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:14,799
As I said, you're not required to pass in, you know, an interim draft that has your intro and conclusion.

88
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,360
You can if you want to, but to give me time to have feedback, I have to have.

89
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,990
If you want that feedback, you have to get it to me by the 28th. Okay.

90
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:26,380
So that I have some time to get it back to you. I'll do my best.

91
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,630
And then the second is our last day of meeting in this class.

92
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,710
Okay? And all that's going to happen is that's the day the paper is due.

93
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,709
So we'll have that sort of period of time to finish it, a paper review at the start of class,

94
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:47,440
and you'll have your final quiz in class on the ninth, which is still class time.

95
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,850
There's no class for the 717 because that's the day of the 660 final.

96
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:55,150
Okay. And I want you to be able to focus on that. All right.

97
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,430
Look, I made that more needs to be. Does anyone have any questions about what all is going to happen?

98
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:07,389
Okay. Yes. Is the final quiz open resource or is that just but it's closed book.

99
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,800
Yeah. It should be a lot more straightforward, though, because the questions are more like, do you know what or not?

100
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,880
Like, I'm doing an open book I want to try to take. Can you use the information questions?

101
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,720
If I'm doing closed book just because of the time constraint, it has to be a little bit more.

102
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,350
Do I know this or not? All right.

103
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,030
Yeah. Okay.

104
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:38,590
So I said that today we're going to assign results to review a big book.

105
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:42,069
So what do you need to do? So the results files are now available.

106
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,479
They're now visible under study protocol and results. So there's a bunch of tables.

107
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,870
It's a bunch of figures. It was actually even the raw data like Excel file, the right Excel files.

108
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:59,499
Nice to look at you. See where the data came from. But all that you were going to be kind of interpreting like when we do data interpretation,

109
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,640
I'll show the table or the figure from whatever the data is. Okay.

110
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,620
So the list of assignments we're going to go to in a second and basically you're going to be

111
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:14,020
responsible for reviewing your assigned results file and explaining the data to the rest of the class.

112
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:20,710
So just like if we did the study, we have our group meeting. Well, here's what happened and the things I want you to try to address.

113
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,209
So remind everybody what the purpose of the essay was. What was the purpose of this assay?

114
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:32,500
What question where we trying to answer was this part of the efficacy was a set of toxicity was the purpose of the assay briefly,

115
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,750
briefly in the operative term, briefly explain how the assay was performed.

116
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,860
So you've already written your methods. You can kind of refer back to that. And as I said, I tried,

117
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,030
if it was applicable to match you to whatever you explain the methods form so you

118
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:49,990
could refer back to your protocol and the material from the protocol discussion class.

119
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:56,950
Let's just remind everybody what we're talking about here and then you need to answer what statistical testing.

120
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:02,110
So based on what we talked about today, what statistical testing would be appropriate to evaluate this data?

121
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:08,770
Okay. You don't need to go to the raw data file, compile it all, run the stats.

122
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:13,419
You don't need to do all that. It's just not a long enough course.

123
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:19,000
We don't have enough time to go into it. We're not set up to provide everyone with equal access to the same stats program.

124
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,690
So you're the stats have actually been run for you.

125
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:32,500
When you get your data set, you'll either have no indications that anything was statistically significantly different, which means that it wasn't.

126
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:40,420
So some of you may have a boring data set and I'm sorry, but the real data or you'll have an asterisk indicating that something was different.

127
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:46,060
Okay, so your figure or your table will tell you already if something was different.

128
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,960
And some of you, unfortunately, we have more data sets, some of you have more interesting data sets.

129
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,790
But remember, the what you're going to try to do is explain, okay, I'm showing this data.

130
00:14:54,790 --> 00:15:03,099
The purpose of this assay was this this was performed by this methodology and maybe nothing was statistically significant,

131
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,940
but an appropriate way to evaluate this data would be whatever test it is.

132
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:15,310
And then answer the question What do the results of this assay tell us with respect to the question we were trying to answer in this experiment?

133
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:22,270
Okay. For those of you with boring data sets, again, it's not going to be very exciting to evaluate your data.

134
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:27,490
If you would like, you could give an example.

135
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:34,660
Okay, this data set is boring, but this type of data, for instance, if we were studying, trying to do a good example, I don't know,

136
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,720
something like the liver examples that we showed in class this morning,

137
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:44,380
this enzyme would be elevated because it's a hepatocellular cytoplasmic enzyme.

138
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:50,740
So if you want to pick some example of something that would be changed in a certain toxicology context

139
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:55,270
and use that just to kind of explain how someone might use your ter look at your data and toxicology,

140
00:15:55,270 --> 00:16:00,160
you can feel free to do that. But the main. Thing is, we want to know, obviously, what the answer was in this experiment.

141
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:06,040
All right. So that's what you need to do. These are the data scientists, color coded.

142
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,020
And the reason I did that.

143
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:15,460
So for people who are doing body weights, for example, body weights were measured both for talks and for the efficacy arms of our study.

144
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,500
Okay. So remember, we had four groups, but two of them related to efficacy, two of them to toxicity.

145
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:25,320
So it's really the same data, all the same things as far as the mean.

146
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:32,620
And the methodology is going to be pretty easy for explaining body weights, but you can basically do both.

147
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:40,270
So I would add to that, Neal and Amber, I have you guys for body weights because I think that fell under the broad category of what you talked

148
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:46,240
about in our methods discussion and you'll just give the results for both for efficacy and for toxicity.

149
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,600
Let's see who else we have. So, Izzy and Oren, you guys have well.

150
00:16:53,930 --> 00:17:00,640
Hmm. Yeah. So you're going to do clean pap, but only hematology.

151
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,290
So the couldn't have tables are on the same file.

152
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:11,830
So there is the hematology analyzer, one at the top, the blood counts, and there is clinical enzymes at the bottom.

153
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:16,380
So you're just doing hematology and within that data.

154
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:21,520
So one way you could split that up in that data, there is red cell and white cell parameters.

155
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,610
The one of you could do red, so one of you could do white zone. Okay.

156
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,830
And underneath all the assignments here,

157
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:32,740
there's information if you need like help remembering what the assay is or if you want some other information about interpretation,

158
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,930
it kind of tells you, like in our protocol group discussion, which slides were relevant to that topic.

159
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,820
And here's another guideline for you. Okay, so let me know if you have trouble finding those should all be there.

160
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:50,620
Well, we have Jade and Michael. You guys are going to do the the other side of that, the clinical chemistry.

161
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,610
Okay. So same thing. You have some items to help you.

162
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,180
Jennifer and Margaret, you're going to do organ weights.

163
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:06,820
And that's another one that reflects both is in both studies, you'll just interpret for both.

164
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:14,740
Um, and then like I said, I gave you some things to look up and then Dongyu and Starhill you guys are going to do.

165
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,780
Oops, what are you doing? You're doing serum, neutralizing antibody because you guys did some immune stuff, right?

166
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:25,030
So again, I'm just going to review what that assay was.

167
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:29,890
And you have interpretation for both arms of the study. And then I have an odd number of students.

168
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:37,140
Sorry, Tiffany, you're going solo, but you did the plaque forming assay which is relevant to the virus titer.

169
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,479
So if you could and that's only in the efficacy study anyways, it's just one bit of data.

170
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,710
So if you could do that. Yeah. Okay. So that's the main data that we did.

171
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,960
We also have one other dataset or one other figure really,

172
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,950
which is a total serum antibody at least we're just going to interpret that together in class.

173
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,020
We could do that at the end because like something is going to become clear from this and this is going to partially explain why that is.

174
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:03,610
We'll do that together. All right. Does everyone kind of understand sort of kind of what we're supposed to do?

175
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:10,450
All right. I'll do that. Okay. If you have any questions with that, let me know nothing.

176
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,950
I think that's listed as an assignment for the participation thing, but nothing that needs to be turned in.

177
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,710
And most likely, I'm probably just going to show the figure or the table while you explain it.

178
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,209
If there's something else you'd like me to show, please feel free.

179
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:26,890
But we're going to try to keep it pretty short, like 5 minutes or so for each discussion.

180
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,640
And there's nothing really necessary beyond that. You have to prepare.

181
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:39,610
All right. Does that make sense? Okay. And that thing is under I think it's under the same module as a study protocol.

182
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,690
Just let me know if you can't remember what I said. I do.

183
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:50,710
So one of the things you're going to talk about is the appropriate statistical interpretation of your data.

184
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:57,130
And the data that we're going to be talking about next week mostly falls under the category of continuous data.

185
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:08,080
So let's talk a little bit about how we might interpret that in toxicology. So some of this is like the review from Stats Plus,

186
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,049
we're going to try to keep the focus a little bit more on how under what context you

187
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:20,200
apply individual tests and what are those most common tests used in toxicology pathology?

188
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:29,740
Okay. So but if you think about types of data, as you know, you can divide types of data into continuous or categorical divisions.

189
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:34,030
So continuous data is where every number has a meaning.

190
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:39,190
And that could either be the category of interval data where zero has an actual value.

191
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:47,830
So the easiest way to think of that is temperature, right? Zero degrees is an actual thing versus ratio data where zero means there's none.

192
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:53,500
So zero for a cell count, I mean, zero for a weight, although it's biologically impossible, but.

193
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,620
Or zero has means nothing. Means nothing is there.

194
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:04,520
And of the two ratio, data is more common in in vivo toxicology, obviously, unless you're measuring body temperatures, I guess you could do that.

195
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:10,810
But a ratio data that is a type of continuous data that's probably the most common one that we evaluate.

196
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:16,260
Categorical data, on the other hand, is not a series of numbers.

197
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:23,950
You can have every value in between. It's something that either is nominal or a named category where there's no intrinsic order.

198
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:31,140
So that could be like types of tumor. Like I'm reading a study on how many have a hematologic tumor or how many have an epithelial tumor.

199
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:39,580
I'm just slotting things into different categories. I can have a dichotomous type of categorical data with two categories.

200
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,559
So is there cancer present? Yes or no or something?

201
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:50,500
That's pretty common in types. Path is ordinal data, which is nominal but ranked.

202
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:57,520
So it's not like I'm counting something, but I might be grading the severity of lesions like mild, moderate, severe one, two or three.

203
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,360
And that's sometimes gets confusing because we do often use numbers.

204
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,640
One is mild to moderate, three severe, and it gets very tempting to treat those like actual numbers.

205
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:15,009
But those are really just categories. Okay, so that's non continuous data because there's nothing really in between those and a

206
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:20,310
value of two doesn't necessarily mean that it's twice as bad as the value of one.

207
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,760
It's just ordinal. Okay, those are a little bit harder to handle statistically.

208
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,230
We're going to talk about those a little bit more when we talk about path data. But today we're going to focus on continuous.

209
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:35,470
So this is basically what we just talked about, a little bit more examples given out for you.

210
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:45,610
And also to note that for regulatory talks like for GLP study, for things that are going to support like an FDA R&D application,

211
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:51,460
most regulatory type studies only apply actual statistical comparison.

212
00:22:51,940 --> 00:23:01,749
Like let's you like significance testing to continuous data, so severity scores and things like that.

213
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:07,959
For histology, it's relatively unusual for them to apply statistics to histology severity scores.

214
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,290
It's much more problematic to handle from a statistics standpoint.

215
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,970
So the histology scores are often evaluated only descriptively.

216
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:22,720
And if you do evaluate the histology, you kind of artificially convert it a lot of times into numeric continuous data.

217
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,090
So you might ask how many animals in this study in each group had a tumor?

218
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,299
So like, that's something that's essentially continuous.

219
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:38,140
You can have whatever number of animals and you might evaluate that because you can do that more easily by parametric methods.

220
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:46,600
So in so the continuous data and the statistical comparison of continuous data is more common and these are often just descriptive.

221
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:51,310
But again, we'll address that a little bit more next week or whenever we talk about that.

222
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:56,860
Okay. So when you're trying to do a statistical comparison in talks path or in any field,

223
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,150
really the first thing you need to do is have some description of your data.

224
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:08,830
So that's descriptive statistics, which for our purposes typically means a mean and a measure of dispersion about that mean.

225
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:14,260
Okay, so we have to decide what type of measure of dispersion we want to use.

226
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,050
The measures that we most commonly use are related.

227
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:25,450
So a lot of times we're either using standard deviation, which as we talked about on the first class, is a measure of the variation within the data.

228
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:35,260
It's kind of an inherent measure of how variable or how much dispersion is there in this parameter, just inherent to the parameter.

229
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,890
So this is supposed to be two lines, a blue line.

230
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:42,510
I don't know which group that is, the control maybe, and an orange line.

231
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:49,900
So they've just drawn little dots here. And the standard deviation is a measure of, you know, in a regular in a normal population,

232
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,710
how much variation is there generally about the mean for this parameter?

233
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:58,930
Okay. So the standard deviation in statistical terms is the square root.

234
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:04,270
Of the variance. So if you remember, you can take the distance of each value from the mean.

235
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,590
So like you get kind of an average of the distance for each value for the mean,

236
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,470
you square that and then the square root of that is standard deviation.

237
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:17,140
But for our purposes, all we have to know is that it's a measure inherent to the data of dispersion about the mean.

238
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:26,380
Or we could measure our data by standard error of the mean, which tells us something about how precise we think our estimate of the mean is.

239
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,510
Okay, so this is related to the number of samples we have.

240
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,090
So how good of an estimate do we have of our mean for that population?

241
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:38,020
So that's another measure of dispersion. Okay.

242
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:45,129
At different times, you might use different you might use standard deviation.

243
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:48,910
You might use standard of error. Standard error of the mean to represent your data.

244
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:54,100
The important thing is if you're showing a graph or something, at minimum, define your error bars.

245
00:25:54,730 --> 00:26:00,910
So this is a nice description of the same data set represented in different methods.

246
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,720
So this is mean plus standard deviation. So these are all the data points, right?

247
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:09,370
So you can see it's kind of dispersed. This is mean plus or minus standard deviation.

248
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:14,410
But these data points are kind of collected over here. So this is a median value.

249
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:20,229
And if I'm looking at it in terms of standard error of the mean, like with the number of data,

250
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:24,640
a number of data points I have, I can get a pretty good reflection of the mean.

251
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:30,730
So I've pretty tight standard error bars. But this is the same mean, just a different measure of dispersion.

252
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,930
Okay. So kind of a tongue in cheek.

253
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:41,800
I don't know if you've ever seen this. A little bit of a joke in one of your stats class when people are trying to decide what to use.

254
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,540
Standard error of the mean is usually smaller than standard deviation.

255
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:52,329
So a kind of tongue in cheek thing is if you're if you want to emphasize small,

256
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:58,780
meaningless differences in your data, if you show your data as mean plus or minus standard error.

257
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:05,770
But these total error bars and I've another one over here. It looks visually like things are really different.

258
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,299
But if you look at the true standard deviation, they might not actually be that difference.

259
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:15,970
So you can show a mean standard error and hope that the reader thinks that standard deviation and if you want to hide differences,

260
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,960
show standard deviation and hope your reader thinks that it is standard error.

261
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:27,339
So I'm not saying to do this, but it actually is kind of a good way to remember that fact that those tend to differ in that way,

262
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:32,890
and they're each really measuring a slightly different aspect of the data.

263
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:38,620
So at minimum, you want to define your error bars and you need to pick the measure of dispersion that you're going to use.

264
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:45,340
So there's descriptive statistics, and now we're going to look at comparison and hypothesis testing.

265
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:52,870
So our starting assumption in hypothesis testing in general and certainly in most instances in toxicology,

266
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:57,730
is the null hypothesis that the data we got from our treatment pot treated population

267
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,590
is the same as the data is from the same population as in our control population.

268
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,900
So there's no true difference between the means.

269
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:11,440
So this is kind of the idealized null hypothesis where the treatment population equals the control population.

270
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:18,960
Okay. But we're always taking a subsample, right, of the total population.

271
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:24,300
So we have observed data from our treatment group, which is the orange for the red.

272
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,250
Yeah, looks like an orange group here. And we have observed data from our control group.

273
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:33,059
And from a hypothesis standpoint, what we're really asking is,

274
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:42,000
are these curves really representing different populations or really given the variation in that data?

275
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,510
Are these just sub samples that we had from a larger population?

276
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:55,020
That's the same. So we want to know if the difference between these means is more important than the error or the dispersion within each population.

277
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:01,290
Okay. So translated, we want to know are the observed data from the same or different populations?

278
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:06,630
And the p value tells us that assuming that the null hypothesis is true.

279
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:11,280
So this really is from the same population. There was no true difference in those means.

280
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:18,750
How likely is it that the observed difference between the means of the experiments of the control groups,

281
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:22,440
how likely is it that this distance would arise by chance?

282
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,000
Like if this is all the same population, how likely would we see that degree of difference?

283
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:38,910
That's kind of another way of looking at the p value. And so our hypothesis testing is based on generating a P value or a likelihood to answer

284
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:44,750
that question in terms of how we typically accomplish hypothesis testing and toxicology,

285
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:54,209
these are the most commonly utilized tests. So if we have two groups like in our experiment, we have an efficacy arm and a toxicity arm.

286
00:29:54,210 --> 00:30:03,630
And in each arm we have two groups. Obviously, you're going to use a T test if the groups are not paired.

287
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:13,200
So we just have randomized control randomize in the test group as opposed to one animal tested against its own baseline over time,

288
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,840
which is something that we sometimes do in large animal talks.

289
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:24,360
But if they're not related in any way, that would be an unpaired t test, which is probably the more common, again, that we're using in talking about.

290
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:32,520
So the unpaired t test. So here's a little example of what is actually calculated in the unpaired t test.

291
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:38,610
So it gets its name. Well, the thing that you're calculating is the t statistic.

292
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:46,050
And in order to calculate it, you basically only need to know the mean, the standard deviation and the number of samples.

293
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:52,060
Okay. So the t statistic is basically calculating the central tendency.

294
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,739
So the difference between the means are they closer together and further apart?

295
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:01,800
The central tendency of the data over the dispersion, the inherent measure of dispersion of that data.

296
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:11,220
Okay, so there's the equation. And then in the olden days, you would calculate that, and then based on the number of samples in your dataset.

297
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:16,830
So you can calculate the degrees of freedom from the numbers of sample of numbers of samples in your dataset.

298
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:20,250
You can look up a p value based on that t statistic.

299
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,350
Nowadays, you kind of plug in your median, your standard deviation, your n can calculate the standard deviation and get this value.

300
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:32,580
But that's essentially what you're doing is calculating a T statistic.

301
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:41,560
So the bare essentials of the test is that in computing that t t statistic,

302
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:48,880
you're comparing the differences in the mean versus the error, if the difference in the mean is much less than the degree of error.

303
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:53,870
So if it's within that error or your measurement of the mean, it's a non-significant finding.

304
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,920
So that would be a p value greater than 0.05.

305
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:01,840
If the difference in the means is much greater than the error, it may be significant.

306
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:09,610
You know, some depends again on the sample number. But essentially, again, you're comparing the difference in the mean to the error in the data.

307
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:20,020
So t test pretty simple unpaired samples comparing two groups, but there are some applications and assumptions that you need to bear in mind.

308
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,059
So one is obvious.

309
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:31,120
We know that we're comparing two groups and this is applicable to continuous data, two data that where you could have any numerical value in between.

310
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:35,200
Okay, so not something like my histology example.

311
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:45,010
There are some assumptions underneath the T test, although it's a little bit more flexible than some other potential tests.

312
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:52,500
So one assumption is that the means have equivalent variance a practice setting this word variance.

313
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:59,770
The equivalent variance in the means is the most contested city I tried essentially.

314
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:03,880
So a good example of this is shown here. So this is scatter plots, right?

315
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:10,450
So one of the means shown with this is plotting all the data set and these groups are both clustered together.

316
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,440
A lot of similarity.

317
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:19,780
So they have very similar variance is equivalent variance as opposed to if we were trying to compare these two, the variance is much different.

318
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:24,070
So a T test would be less valid if I were comparing these two.

319
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,360
So one of the things we want to make sure is that you have equivalent variance.

320
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:34,860
Roughly equivalent variance and also that the errors in the mean are normally distributed.

321
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:46,739
I'm going to talk about that in a second. However, a caveat in true the T test as a statistical test is relatively robust to minor

322
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:53,340
deviations from normality and from very from lack of equivalence and variance.

323
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,330
Unless the sample sizes are very different or unless your end is very small.

324
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,950
So you may be able to get away with still applying a t test,

325
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:09,120
but you have to be aware if you are applying a t test in that context that may be less reliable data than if you meet the assumptions of the test.

326
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,680
Okay. So knowing that the T test has two basic assumptions that there's equivalent

327
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:18,090
variance and that there is normal distribution and the standard error mean.

328
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:24,600
Okay, I want to show this first.

329
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,850
So how do we test those assumptions?

330
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:35,800
So one I already showed you for testing variants, you can actually just use a scatterplot, visually assess the spread of the data.

331
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,670
And in many cases, for biologic data, that's often all you need to do.

332
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:44,350
There are formal tests for equivalent variance.

333
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:51,610
Some of them require a large sample numbers that might not be applicable in the context of a mouse study if you only have like five or six animals.

334
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:58,270
But one pretty effective means or a method is just to plot the data and look for variance visually.

335
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,469
Okay. And remembering that the t test is pretty robust unless you have something

336
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:07,740
ridiculous in most cases it's going to be fine for normal error distribution.

337
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:15,600
One of the things you can do again is plot the data. So here we plot the data and we can calculate a mean if the data are normally distributed,

338
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:19,270
the error of the mean is likely to be normally distributed as well.

339
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:24,070
Okay. So if you just again, plot the data and look to see if the data has a normal distribution.

340
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,100
One thing that commonly happens with biologic data is you have weird skewed tails.

341
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:34,990
So either you have something where the normal values are way over towards zero.

342
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,770
So like liver enzymes are like this, the normal values are like 0 to 30% liver enzymes.

343
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:46,390
And then you have this long tail. So the normal distribution is skewed.

344
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:53,380
So what are you going to do if that happens? One thing that you can do is log transform the data.

345
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:58,870
So if you have that skewed data set, if you log transform the data almost always,

346
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,770
not every time, but almost always, that will result in a normalized distribution.

347
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:09,760
So you can do this in most stats programs. Just log, transform your data and then run your stats on that log transform data.

348
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:17,980
And in many cases, that solves the problem. And you can meet the assumptions of the T test and use that parametric test to run your data.

349
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:29,530
But if that doesn't solve the problem of log transformation is unsuccessful, you may need to utilize a non parametric test as an alternative.

350
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:36,790
So the non parametric equivalent of the t test is the mann-whitney you test.

351
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:43,840
And essentially what this does, it still the same assumption that the groups are independent,

352
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:51,970
but it does not need a normal distribution of the data or the errors because essentially it's using a ranked version of the data.

353
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:59,829
So it looks at the median and then it ranks the data, one, you know, based on your numerical and the, the actual values of the data,

354
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:08,560
one to whatever number of data sets you have and determines if there's a difference in the sum and distribution of ranks between the groups.

355
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:16,600
So are more of my data in the low range in my control group, more of my data in the higher ranks in the in the test group.

356
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:20,230
So it's not using the actual absolute number.

357
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:29,380
So a non parametric unpaired t test can be helpful in those situations where you don't have normally distributed data.

358
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:34,270
The downside to it, though, is that it's less sensitive than a parametric test.

359
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:41,260
So like, sometimes the temptation is like, I don't want to worry about what I meet, the assumptions, I'm just going to run non parametric anything.

360
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:48,160
But that wouldn't be the greatest idea because you're going to decrease the sensitivity of your ability to detect differences between groups.

361
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:54,010
Okay. But it is something that you can do if the data is just hopelessly non normally distributed.

362
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,420
Going back just to my unpaired t test for a moment.

363
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:07,330
So most cases, especially in rodent studies or data, are going to be unpaired and toxicology mice assigned to groups in large animals.

364
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:16,420
Sometimes you have small group sizes and you're comparing each animal to its own baseline or and we have some of this data in our own dataset,

365
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:19,540
you might be comparing something at different time points.

366
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:25,990
So I have a control group of mice and a treatment group of mice, and I'm measuring like body weights, for example, over time.

367
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:32,980
So in that case, in addition to there being a variable of which group the animal's in,

368
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:41,860
there's also a variable of time and an animal's result at any one given time is related not just to the group that it's in,

369
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:46,720
but also to whatever its body weight was or whatever the parameters at the previous time point.

370
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,650
Okay. So it's a paired version of the test,

371
00:38:53,470 --> 00:39:02,230
a t so the way you can do this over time in most instances is actually to use a repeated measures ANOVA with a group of two.

372
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:11,950
Okay. So an a nova with a group of two from a standpoint of the end result is essentially equivalent to a T test.

373
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:16,230
The T test is a simpler test than the calculations of the difference.

374
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,790
If you have unpaired groups, we're just going to run a t test.

375
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:24,130
But if you have two groups that are compared over time, you can utilize any NOVA to do that.

376
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,120
You just have to use a.

377
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:33,710
Version of the ANOVA that understands that each data point is related not just to the group but to that previous variable for that individual animal.

378
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,580
So that's a repeated measures they know. And we'll talk about that in just a second.

379
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:44,360
All right. So those are bare essentials for the T test. Two groups comparing the difference in means over error.

380
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:49,820
There are some assumptions related to variance and normal distribution, but it's fairly robust two deviations.

381
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:57,650
And if one, transforming the data doesn't work, you can actually use a non parametric version which uses the ranks of the data.

382
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:04,880
It's going to say something else about that came out what it is. Okay, so that's for two groups.

383
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,670
But in our study we just have two groups.

384
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:17,959
But it's pretty common in toxicology to have three or more groups in a more common situation in vivo toxicology where I have a control versus a low,

385
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:25,910
medium and a high dose. So one thing I can't really legitimately do is just run a bunch of T tests upfront.

386
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:31,760
Lots of comparisons. That's actually going to create a lot of error in my data because of all those multiple comparisons.

387
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:37,850
So the first thing I'm going to do is run an ANOVA, which just asks, is there a difference between any of these groups?

388
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:49,260
And the types of I know what I'm going to run depends on the number of factors or the number of independent variables that I'm evaluating.

389
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,790
So first, let's look at the bare essentials slide for ANOVA, which is analysis of variance.

390
00:40:53,790 --> 00:41:00,690
As you know, probably this is the most commonly used test in preclinical toxicology because we usually have multiple dose groups.

391
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:09,240
So it's a comparison of three or more groups. As I said, if you're comparing two groups from a results standpoint, it's basically a T test.

392
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,950
It has similarity in the assumptions that it has the it carries the assumption

393
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:18,570
of a normal distribution of the errors and equal variance between the groups.

394
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,140
But like the T test, it's actually pretty robust.

395
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:29,940
Two minor deviations from normal normality and from homogeneity of variance, unless you have widely differing sample sizes.

396
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:38,730
So you can use the same strategies of plotting your data to see if you are basically consistent with the underlying assumptions of anything over.

397
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,620
The point of the ANOVA is to tell if there is a difference between groups,

398
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:50,460
but by itself as a test, it's not going to tell you which groups are different.

399
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,570
To do that, you have to do some post hoc testing, which we'll talk about in a minute.

400
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:03,720
This slide describes the types of they know about, which are typical or most commonly are one factor or a two factor based on study design.

401
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:09,240
So one factor refers to the fact that there is one independent variable.

402
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,020
So remember, independent variables are variable like you're assigned at the beginning,

403
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:18,330
which gamma group you're in and the dependent variable is the result like what's my liver enzyme volume?

404
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:22,799
So the most commonly you have an independent variable group.

405
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:33,390
So there's my dose groups, for example. So the only difference there is group or I might have a study that has another independent variable like sex.

406
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:39,510
So I'm running my same study. I have a low, medium and high, but I have males and females.

407
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:44,580
So like this one should be written a little bit differently. These could be the males, this could be the females.

408
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,170
Ignore time for a second. These could be the different dose groups low, medium, high or something.

409
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:56,969
So that's a two factor ANOVA. If one of the factors is time, you get kind of a special flavor, I guess you'd say,

410
00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:02,370
of a two factor ANOVA, which is the repeated measures ANOVA that we talked about before.

411
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:08,700
And the difference there is that there's a relationship between, you know, for an individual animal,

412
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:14,880
it's body weight per se at this time is related not just to the group that it's in, but also to its previous body weight.

413
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:21,930
So the calculation for repeated measures, ANOVA has to take into account that interaction between the factors of time and group.

414
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:31,990
So that's kind of a version of a pair test in a way, because it's pairing its own data to the previous data point I have.

415
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:36,740
So remembering that in our two groups is essentially from a results standpoint, a T test.

416
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:45,590
If you're trying to run a repeated measures ANOVA on two groups in Graphpad PRISM, you're actually just have to figure out the process of elimination.

417
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:57,349
You're actually using a two factor in over with the number of groups as to you is doing is computing an F values.

418
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:05,180
It's a bit different calculation, but it's computing an F value, which is basically a means of comparing variance between and within groups.

419
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:11,150
So you're measuring the variance between your different dose groups, but also within the group.

420
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:18,470
And if the between group variance, the difference between your dose groups is much greater than your within group variance.

421
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:25,760
So that's a measure again, again of the dispersion about the mean or within group variability than the group names are significantly different.

422
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:35,600
So similar in terms of similar in terms of measuring like how relevant is this difference between the means?

423
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:45,550
Okay. So in other comparison, more than two groups, one factor or two factor, depending on the number of independent variables,

424
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:53,770
has the same assumptions as the T test in terms of equivalent variance and normal distribution of the errors in the mean.

425
00:44:54,340 --> 00:45:01,210
But if you have a violation of those assumptions, you might need to turn to a non parametric version of the ANOVA.

426
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:06,040
So there is a Crystal Wallace test or Crystal Wallace that, you know what it's sometimes called,

427
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:13,420
which is essentially equivalent to a one way ANOVA, sort of the multiple groups equivalent of the unpaired t test.

428
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:20,380
And this is a non parametric test that also uses the median, the median and the interquartile range.

429
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:25,720
And like the ANOVA, it tells whether there's a difference between the groups but not which groups are different.

430
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:34,870
Like our non parametric test. For two groups, it's the less sensitive than any ANOVA, so it's not something you're going to want to default to.

431
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:41,890
At first you should try things like log transport in your data to see if you can use a parametric test for the greater sensitivity.

432
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:46,390
But a crystal ball is actually pretty commonly applied in toxicology as well.

433
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,360
You can start probably of these assumption violations.

434
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:57,999
The unequal variance is the more common one because depending on inter animal variation,

435
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,809
you can have some that are more strongly affected than others by whatever compound it is.

436
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:10,150
So it's not uncommon that your test groups, particularly your high dose group, has a much more variability in sort of the enzyme value.

437
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:16,690
But again, you have to kind of judge whether the variability is enough to warrant using a non parametric test.

438
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:25,470
Okay. So, you know what I told you determines that there's differences between groups, but now we usually want to know which groups are different.

439
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,070
So to do that, we're going to have to do some post-hoc testing.

440
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:37,710
And essentially the post-hoc testing is going to tell us which groups are different by calculating a P value for the difference between groups.

441
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:46,740
But it's going to do that while accounting for the greater chance of error that we acquire by making multiple comparisons.

442
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:55,260
So at the very beginning, when we showed that normal distribution of data we talked about when we set up our experiment,

443
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:59,940
we try to set up our parameters so that there is no more than a 5% chance.

444
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:06,270
Right, that a value will emerge above our threshold, value in our control or in our normal population.

445
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,840
So the flip side of that is that there's about a 5% chance that a value, you know,

446
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:17,790
that far away from the mean can arise just by chance in our control group.

447
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:24,270
Every time we make a comparison, we have that 5% chance of essentially a false positive result.

448
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:32,850
So if I have multiple groups that I'm making multiple comparisons, that's a cumulative addition.

449
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:37,920
So I'm going to have 5% chance every time I make a comparison to have that error.

450
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:44,460
And so by making a lot of comparisons, it really increases the likelihood that I'm going to get a significantly different value by chance.

451
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:49,870
So to correct for this, there's a number of different post-hoc tests that we can use.

452
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:54,910
One of the more commonly known ones is Roni Correction, which you guys must have heard of before.

453
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:57,680
And this one's fairly simple to understand.

454
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:04,810
But essentially what it does, it corrects for the multiple comparisons by adjusting the type one error rate that we call significant.

455
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:15,400
So essentially you're just dividing your normal cutoff appears point equals 0.05 or 5% by the number of comparisons that you're making.

456
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:22,720
Okay. So if I'm only making one comparison like I one group compared to another, the p value is .05 percent like normal.

457
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:28,630
But if I'm making ten comparisons, I'm increasing the likelihood that I'm going to get a result by chance.

458
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:35,020
So I have a more stringent p value and I divide by .05 by ten the number of comparisons that I'm making.

459
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:41,710
So in order to declare a result significant, I have to have a p value of less than 0.05 in that instance.

460
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:49,150
Simple, easy to understand, super versatile, because you can make as many or as few comparisons as you want.

461
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,510
So you can decide ahead of time. I only want to compare a certain of these groups.

462
00:48:53,050 --> 00:49:00,040
A disadvantage is that it's simple, but it's kind of an approximate correction, and it's also pretty conservative.

463
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:07,690
So you run the high risk of having a Type two error of saying something's non-significant when it really is a difference.

464
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:14,820
So this is something that you want to choose when you apply it, even though it's simple to understand.

465
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:22,240
If you if there are differences that are relatively subtle, you have a higher risk of missing them if you're applying a strict bonferroni correction.

466
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,550
Turkey's test is somewhat similar, but it has a different calculation.

467
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:33,360
It's sort of like a background test where you would compare all groups.

468
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:43,130
So Tukey's test by definition compares all groups, and it does it in a pairwise comparison but performs an exact correction for the p value.

469
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:51,440
The disadvantage is that it's still a pretty strong correction because it's so many comparisons.

470
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,060
It's comparing all the groups and if you're not interested in comparing all those groups,

471
00:49:56,180 --> 00:50:02,570
it's probably too stringent a correction because it's going to adjust for comparisons that are not important to you.

472
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:11,270
It makes an exact correction for the P values. It's a little bit more statistically robust and a little bit less conservative than buffer only.

473
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:18,950
But again, you might not be interested in all those comparisons, so it still might be a little bit too much correction.

474
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,959
So probably more commonly in toxicology.

475
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:31,670
And then my personal favorite post hoc correction is the done it's test where you're comparing all the dose groups back to the control.

476
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:37,160
This makes a lot of sense in toxicology because we have low, medium and high doses.

477
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,380
So we already, outside of the experiment know the relationship between those doses.

478
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:48,890
So if I'm only making those four comparisons now, I don't have to robustly correct my P value as much.

479
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:56,870
And I myself can make an assessment like if I have a control group and I only have significant differences in my low dose group,

480
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:04,639
but unless I have some reason to think that I have a weird shape dose response curve that biologically might be less important

481
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:11,450
to me than if I have an experiment where I see differences from the control in the high and the medium dose group here.

482
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:17,690
I'm saying so like dose dependance is an assessment that you can apply outside of the context of your statistical test.

483
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:24,020
So Doenitz is very commonly used to compare your dose groups, all just back to the control.

484
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:33,820
You can't perform the other group comparisons in a dance test, and it's kind of incorrect to then go back frantically and try to compare all those.

485
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:39,270
And it's kind of meaningless anyway, because if your only difference is really between like you're low in media,

486
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,590
it doesn't really say much for you in the context of a toxicology experiment.

487
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:52,780
So most commonly used in regulatory talks, the comparison to control is usually the most important comparison to be made.

488
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:59,919
And as I said, the assessment of whether a finding is dose dependent can be made sort of outside the context of the statistics,

489
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,250
and then you can decide how much weight to put on that result.

490
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:07,990
Because I sense. Okay.

491
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:12,240
So there's our summary slide. We talked for the statistical test.

492
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:15,820
We talked about what type of tests we might use if we have two groups.

493
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:23,860
In most cases, we're using an unpaired t test. We're going to assess our data for normal distribution.

494
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:28,719
So assess whether we can use a parametric test like the T test or if we need to

495
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:33,430
lab transform our data to fit the assumptions or apply a non parametric test.

496
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:42,129
We talked about, you know, was the most common test applied to three or more groups and in terms of paired results for multiple groups,

497
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:51,430
probably the most common instance of that and in DEVO talks is is measures over time are most common situation where you get into

498
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:59,350
dependance between the groups but but is the parametric test for three or more groups and then we have crystal balls for non parametric.

499
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:08,890
The Friedman test is a way of doing a non parametric version of a paired or a repeat measures test.

500
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:12,999
I know, I know people use it. I have not used it that much myself.

501
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,990
I put it there for completeness, but it's not something we're going to focus too much on in this course.

502
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:24,549
Okay, so that's hypothesis testing in the context of our in vivo tox experiment.

503
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:28,150
So we can get a few though. Is it statistically significant? Is it not?

504
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:33,910
But we also have to remember the p values are not the only consideration, as I'm sure you know.

505
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:44,080
So a p value of less than 0.05 does not itself ensure that an effect is real.

506
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:51,700
So real, true, positive or an important effect. So here's a nice this paper is really nice if you want to look at that later.

507
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:54,610
This is a really nice review in the context.

508
00:53:55,520 --> 00:54:05,530
I think it's an experimental tox or in pharmacology in the context of pharmacology, how some of the statistical tests we applied can lead you wrong.

509
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:08,770
So it talks about false discovery rate has some really nice examples.

510
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:10,360
Here is one of them.

511
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:18,810
So if you imagine a situation where we're screening a thousand compounds for a defined effect, so it could be giving them to an animal.

512
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:23,080
It doesn't matter what the test is, giving them to an animal in a hepatocyte cell culture or something.

513
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:33,340
So we've set up our first experiment so that it has standard power, 80% to detect whatever effect it is that we want, and 95% confidence limit.

514
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:38,050
So 95% confidence that our results would not arise by chance in our control group.

515
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:46,120
And let's say that of this thousand compounds, we can assume that 10% of them really have an effect in our assay.

516
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:53,380
So maybe our assay is like a measure of hepatocellular toxicity, like in a cell culture, LDH level or something.

517
00:54:53,980 --> 00:55:03,190
So we have a 10% likelihood, based on whatever previous data, that 10% of these compounds are going to elevate that LDH above our threshold level.

518
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:11,110
So if that's the case, all of our thousand compounds, 10% of them are the actual positive.

519
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:23,530
So it's 100, right? And then we have 900 true negatives, but we've set up our experiment so that we have 80% power to detect a positive result.

520
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:32,770
So all the statistics line up. Basically, that means that of our 100 true positives, our experiment could detect maybe 80 of them.

521
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,730
Okay? And so we're going to have some proportion of false negatives.

522
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:45,310
And similarly, we've set up our experiment so that 5% of the time we're going to pull a result from our negative group,

523
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,569
our normal group, and it's going to show up as positive. Okay.

524
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:55,930
So there's our false positives. 45 of the 900 samples went to bed.

525
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:05,110
So the total number of positive results assays that we have in this instance are 125.

526
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:15,670
But of those 125 positive assays, 36% of them are actually false positives.

527
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,959
Okay. So these are values that showed up positive in our assay.

528
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:26,320
They have a P value of less than 0.0 5% because we've screened all our compounds, but they're not a true positive.

529
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:34,570
And that's sort of set by the fact that we have a large number of compounds here and we've accepted a 5% confidence limit.

530
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:39,400
So if we have a large number of compounds here, we're going to have a fairly good sized number here.

531
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:47,920
And depending on the proportion of the and the number of false positives that might make up on the

532
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,810
number of true positives that might make up a significant chunk of our total positive result.

533
00:56:54,160 --> 00:57:00,130
Okay. So false discovery rate is the rate of false positives over all positives.

534
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:06,310
And false discovery rates are actually affected by the prevalence of the measured effect.

535
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:13,240
In the population. So in my previous example, I used the measured effect level of 10%.

536
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:17,560
So I said, that's relatively low. 10% of that thousand compounds were true positive.

537
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:24,100
So if I take the same 1000 compounds and now I'm looking for an effect that's more prevalent like 50%.

538
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,930
So now my actual positives are 500, right?

539
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:35,350
And then we follow through true positives, false positives, 25 or 25.

540
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:41,500
Now of my positive results, only 5.9% of them are false positives.

541
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:47,350
So the false discovery rate is affected by the prevalence of the measured effect in the population.

542
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:57,730
So if you think of it as false positive over false positive plus true positive, the false positives are always at 5%.

543
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:04,600
They're kind of fixed. So if I'm on the denominator, if I have a large number of true positives.

544
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:09,309
So what's the common effect that's going to kind of wash out the effect of the false

545
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:14,860
positives better by drawed as opposed to the previous example where I had a low number.

546
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:19,900
And so my 45 was a significant chunk of the true positives.

547
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:28,060
Okay. So false discovery effect, false positives out of total positives, and it's dependent on the number of true positives in the population.

548
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:37,060
So the false discovery rate is an example of the fact that P is less than 0.05, does not ensure that an effect is real.

549
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:45,700
So you have to remember that for rare findings or events, a significant difference from control is more likely to be a false positive.

550
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:52,570
So you have to bear that in mind. And for common findings, a significant difference for control is more likely to be a true positive.

551
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:59,499
Most statistical programs will actually allow you to set the false discovery rate so you can set your criteria that you

552
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:06,760
need a p value of less than 0.05 and you want to limit your false discovery rate to like whatever you can tolerate 1%,

553
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:11,410
5%, 10%, depending on what you want for your experiment.

554
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:21,190
Okay. So we talked about how statistical significance does not ensure that a result is a

555
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:26,410
true positive and it also doesn't ensure that a result is biologically meaningful.

556
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:33,300
Okay. So this is this from the same article and the question it's asking here for these experiments.

557
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:37,090
The question is, is treatment two meaningfully different than treatment one?

558
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:41,530
So there are 100 experimental repetitions.

559
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:49,150
We had our standard conditions, power of 80%, confidence interval 95% and resuming a 10% probability of effect.

560
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,810
The results of this experiment for experiment.

561
00:59:52,810 --> 01:00:00,040
See, we were asking, you know, is there a significant difference between these means, one or two versus 100?

562
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:05,980
Seems pretty tight, but we came out with a P-value that shows significance.

563
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:15,640
So. But the actual effect size for experiment see is pretty tiny.

564
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:19,420
So it's only a two degree difference between the means.

565
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:25,120
So a couple of things we have to figure out what is this biologic marker that a unit of two

566
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:29,320
biologically based on what we know about this biologic marker as a unit of two matter.

567
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:33,400
I mean, maybe if it's blood, that would probably matter quite a bit.

568
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:39,370
If it's like, I don't know, white cell count two neutrophils is not going to make or break you.

569
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:46,450
So you have to apply some biologic, I don't know, truth test to your data.

570
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:53,379
So one way you could think of this, if you have 135 people and you're looking at, I don't know,

571
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:58,180
body weight, but these are pretty skinny people, but I don't know, middle school student body weight.

572
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:04,390
You could cherry pick people like a group of 135 people such that the true

573
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:09,640
mean of that group is one or two and the true mean of your other group is 100.

574
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:13,299
And, you know, you have all those people front of you.

575
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:20,500
Assuming that's your entire population of middle school students, maybe you have a pretty high degree of confidence that that's the true mean.

576
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:25,440
So like the confidence interval, the difference between the means is pretty tight there.

577
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:31,810
So we're pretty confident about that mean. And that means that we can pick out minuscule differences between those two groups.

578
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:38,320
So statistically, we've set up our assay to differentiate between two populations that are where the means

579
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:43,750
are very close because we have just a tight distribution of data around that mean.

580
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:50,080
But biologically it might not even make any sense compared to this value.

581
01:01:50,080 --> 01:02:00,130
And this value is kind of the opposite problem, is that to say about this, this one has a big difference between the two means.

582
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:07,690
So we're only measuring three people. So our confidence interval is 46 is pretty big.

583
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:15,610
It's so happens that just by where the data where the data lay for our particular sample set, we came up with a significant difference.

584
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:22,540
But our confidence in the reliability of that value is a little bit lower than if we had a better representation of the mean.

585
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:26,710
So Experiment C and D both show a significant difference.

586
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:31,209
The confidence is high that the measured differences are real differences.

587
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:40,360
But for C, the effect size is tiny and most likely this is a result that's statistically significant, but biologically not so.

588
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:44,469
So again, don't be driven just by your statistics.

589
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:51,310
Apply the wider view and whether a particular parameter that you're measuring is biologically important or not.

590
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:57,570
Um. I can read about this. Oh, so this is kind of the flipside of it.

591
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:06,360
This is the that a p value that's greater than 0.05 doesn't necessarily mean that a difference is not biologically meaningful.

592
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:11,340
So here we have an experiment. The p value looks like it's kind of a negative result.

593
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:21,390
But based on our confidence interval, we don't necessarily have a great representation of the mean in some of our samples.

594
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:28,500
So in experiment B, again, we've only looked at three individuals.

595
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:33,720
So if we were able to sample more individuals and get a better sense of what our true mean is,

596
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:37,350
we might actually be able to uncover a distance, a difference.

597
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:43,440
So essentially, this is kind of an underpowered experiment for looking at differences of that magnitude.

598
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:50,310
So the conclusion for Experiment B is much less reliable than for Experiment A,

599
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:56,550
because the confidence interval, the difference between the means for B is so much larger.

600
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,210
We have a lot of uncertainty in our estimate of the mean for me.

601
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,840
Okay. So the summary is that some significantly different results?

602
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:10,830
The P is less than 0.05 are false positives.

603
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:16,650
So that was our false discovery rate. And that's kind of inherent to the conditions that we've set for our staff.

604
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:23,310
So they're false positive, not really different from the control. There's the definition of the false discovery rate.

605
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:27,960
We know that that is dependent on the frequency of an event or a condition in the population,

606
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:32,700
and that's another parameter that you may want to control in your experiment

607
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:37,410
before you decide whether a particular result has true statistical relevance.

608
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:44,040
And then the converse of that is some statistically different results are not biologically different.

609
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:49,710
So we used our really tight example of weights to illustrate that and vice versa.

610
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:56,280
Versa. So some biologically true, biologically true differences are not statistically evident.

611
01:04:56,820 --> 01:05:00,690
So that's the famous I'm trying to make something out of my thesis project.

612
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:04,460
I have a trend towards significance, but it might be true.

613
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:11,100
It might be that there is a biologic difference. But the particular test that I'm using to pull out that difference is not sensitive

614
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:15,570
enough or is not the right question to be asking to pull out that difference.

615
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:20,850
So again, the big picture is that you always have to be thinking holistically about your data.

616
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:27,060
Think about the question you're trying to answer. Am I using the right assay to get at that question?

617
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:32,400
Am I evaluating the data that I have in front of me by the right statistical method?

618
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:37,380
And does all my data together tell a cohesive biologic story?

619
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:44,200
Okay. So hopefully more than one thing and the number of assays that you're looking at are going to be altered.

620
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:47,940
And that makes it the weight of evidence of all those tests that are altered,

621
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:54,750
makes it more it makes a more plausible case that something is actually causing toxicity or is not.

622
01:05:55,170 --> 01:05:58,710
So, again, holistic look, weight of evidence. Okay.

623
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:02,480
So this is the second to last slide. This was your summary slide.

624
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:09,800
So when you study for your quiz, this again will sort of come up as your cheat sheet for tests, for continuous data.

625
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:13,470
And this will come up again, no doubt when we have our data next week.

626
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:21,060
I'm also going to say for your data next week, like I said, statistical tests have already been applied.

627
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:24,270
So it's going to be hard for you really to assess sort of normality.

628
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:28,400
You can certainly look at the raw data sheet.

629
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:34,260
I would not suggest it's not required for this class that you actually put out the data or spend a lot of time crunching the numbers on this,

630
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:38,070
but just be aware of the appropriate statistical test for your data set.

631
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:42,570
I mean, if you want to say something about normality, you can feel free to do so.

632
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:48,600
Yeah, but this is just kind of the summary slide for that and our summary of the other aspects.

633
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:54,510
All right. So a little bit drier than what we talked about this morning.

634
01:06:54,900 --> 01:07:01,229
But I think important to think about as we look at our data and hopefully we can kind of keep taking what you learned

635
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:07,080
and stats to us and applying it to how do you actually use that in the context of an individual tox experiment?

636
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:11,400
All right. Is everyone clear on what we are going to do next week?

637
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,360
All right. Let me know if you have any questions as you go through the data.

638
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:19,410
And I will work on your methods drafts.

639
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:24,300
It's going to be a lot of kind of repetitive reading for me, but I'll push through it.

640
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:38,780
All right, everyone, have a good weekend. The word excel, she said after a few days.

641
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:44,270
Yes, I do remember it. Yes. Oh, yes. I mean, I guess that's like optional.

642
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:50,910
Oh, do you want to start for that?

643
01:07:51,290 --> 01:07:54,780
Oh, yeah. Whenever you're. That is an excellent question, right?

644
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,700
Yeah, I was waiting for the exit. Now. And it's not so bad either.

645
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:03,710
Hold on a sec. Oh, is it continuous data?

646
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:09,040
I know of a problem. Okay, I will put that up tonight.

647
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:16,340
I forgot to put that up there. I'm sorry. I think Costco's here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I suppose.

648
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:27,230
Whatever. Yeah, I was, you know, I wasn't worried about it.

649
01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:31,339
There was nothing. Yeah. I'll see you later.

650
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:35,360
Yeah, I'm never going to be. I know, but, like, if you've seen them before.

651
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:38,920
Yeah, yeah. See, I don't know.

652
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:46,390
Here. Yeah. Here's something down here they can't do.

653
01:08:46,580 --> 01:09:03,309
You know what you're. I said, I think it's so hard to divert unrelated to like what you're hearing about like, oh, you have to do things we like.

654
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:15,270
Transcript of Prejudice Expression. That is so funny that you're doing a conversation, Laura, right now with her lead exposure.

655
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:20,290
If you started beforehand, she was a transcript of day or so soon.

656
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:25,360
We did our regions of interest. I'll give my first look at Transcriptomic data.

657
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:30,640
You know, I don't really get concerns now other than pathologists are like, I know,

658
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:36,280
but I know you're saying something that very simply, oh, I was just wondering if it's like,

659
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:48,580
have you based on your experience and you see that between transcripts domains and I think that's an easy think and I think open transcript.

660
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:58,700
If so, you know, now that you know the process I might recruit you to, I think I'm seeing these typology silos.

661
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,290
Yeah. Are you thinking like people have to really define,

662
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:12,350
define their questions with because I think whatever like like if you have no idea what you may be responsible for,

663
01:10:12,370 --> 01:10:17,319
you may still there is a little bit of attempting, oh yeah, I might be born this way.

664
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:21,800
She's like, okay, well, Michigan is like, Oh geez, I was down now, but I want to use Transcriptomics.

665
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:30,010
Okay, I was, I right now I heard that maybe like more so molecular with the problem.

666
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:37,300
Like if you have a repeat. Yeah, it's like I think the likelihood is when you go into how things are likely to start slowing down.

667
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:37,560
Yeah.

668
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:49,059
The manifestation of time, your college hours combined with their knowledge or the may maybe your cells are not bigger in any way that the lifetime.

669
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:52,299
But finally there are some basically by transcriptomics.

670
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:55,770
Yeah yeah. You wouldn't get that much data by transcript.

671
01:10:55,780 --> 01:11:03,190
You know, it's like there's a lot of delivery and you know, just like we talk about your, your early like DNA chips.

672
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:09,639
Yeah, I used to get like all the data expression and like, you got a lot of calls significant.

673
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:20,980
But when you have to be kind of in line with your logic, probably never the factors that are yeah, I really like that way.

674
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:27,459
But now I say no, no, not at all.

675
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:33,670
Going to just kind of random like really read papers that I've been reading right is this.

676
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:42,490
And, and we found 35 gene benefits for information that's basically one end of the day and you know, I know it's great.

677
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:48,670
So to me, I think the challenge for us is how we have some great tool doesn't get much really like that.

678
01:11:49,870 --> 01:11:58,689
So that whole approach to and desire not to be a static entity, things are going to change over time.

679
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:04,990
You know, the changes that you just described, the status quo, the changes in hormonal select,

680
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:11,590
separating out changes in towards consistent understanding of fluctuation,

681
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:15,250
variable environment and finding that reminder I think is going to be challenging.

682
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,559
But I do think that one group that we're working together like with a patient or

683
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:24,880
you're connected to and they study people who have new generation like memory,

684
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:34,600
for example, that leaves issues all weekend and then they get an outpost of American rupture because all of a sudden I've heard that you're

685
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:43,120
dying to carry foreign breakfast through and we must model the genetic things in mouse models that replicate exercise.

686
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:54,909
The problem is that added sugar, one that's going to happen up at the time that they were I'm sure inherit the air is everywhere every minute.

687
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:59,450
So you can't predict, you know, think you have this prepared.

688
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:06,810
You don't want to be like, well, user digital sorry. At any moment you may drop dead or you know it's like it's a national.

689
01:13:07,210 --> 01:13:10,510
Yeah, you want to be able to tell them, okay, that obviously is a factor.

690
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:15,580
We're going to look at marker X in your blood and that just shows that your aorta is weak.

691
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:22,900
Yeah, right. And so I think in our modern technology looks like this.

692
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:25,880
Okay, first of all, the normal labs, right?

693
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:34,610
But I feel if we could still name, I guess something just I think it's like a lot like the border between the walrus connective tissue for sure.

694
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:44,320
If I have to put more on my wall, looks totally fine until there a stress getting that overcomes and then the wall collapse or something.

695
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:49,050
So I think that's a molecular changes. So we could identify the transcriptome very well.

696
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:57,000
And that's happened. Over time, maybe that would maybe there's like an integrated scenario as it tries to kind of get better upfront, right.

697
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:07,500
So I think Transcriptomics Technologies, if we have an indication we're going to have a ground zero years that can transcriptomics here.

698
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:14,700
We know like on average this person of our life, nine, 12 months have a vested interest in this scenario.

699
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:21,550
They've already got, I think it's like a little bit more directed towards of things like our I think of transcript and I

700
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:27,700
saw you laugh so hard to make sure I mean kind of like an so more so predictive biomarkers and that

701
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:33,729
can distinguish anything you want those like you know as an adaptation of signs of injury or like

702
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:39,670
probably some of it is just going to be on like if there's something that tells the environment,

703
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:46,270
you're starting to get that ability to compensate. I think that or in a separate apology.

704
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:50,860
Sure. There if you have a question about a mechanism. Yeah, I like to transcribe it.

705
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:58,899
It's my job to talk about that is associated with this outcome because the work maybe Transcriptomics will

706
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:04,860
help us have together what's happening to the cell in terms of or like surviving a student's trajectory.

707
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:12,550
Yeah. Molecular do that vary trajectory of pathology we're in for.

708
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:16,380
Yeah. Like I did this morning whatever. Yeah, yeah.

709
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:21,700
Yeah. So even for those, so you die when something's happening.

710
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:25,720
So like, we're kind of and completely ignoring that the biology.

711
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:29,480
Okay, we're together another day. Oh, and then sorry to hear that.

712
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:43,030
Or like all that we know about mechanisms that particular way that's not sorry is just like I don't know.

713
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:50,559
Okay, so kind of just like evaluating different scales of complexity and yeah, if it's something that might cause transcript on,

714
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:56,170
you know, just super cool but like too much data yeah it's hard to get into that.

715
01:15:56,620 --> 01:16:05,379
Yeah. Yeah. So it's very yeah. So far only the transcript of this module is so like you have to know sorry for

716
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:10,930
your no no worries because like even in a modern kid anything you can't do.

717
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:18,520
Transcript on case for folks you have to do whatever is happening is effective and that feels good to have

718
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:26,020
was like an average of it but but like oh this was like your target areas or something or even small.

719
01:16:26,370 --> 01:16:31,899
Like I just said, you know, isn't there like a special transcriptomics program going on and.

720
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:35,620
Yeah, yeah. So not well, not really.

721
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:38,739
I mean, so that that as far as I know,

722
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:45,940
the advanced genomics law and so they are a major part of the zero form and they

723
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:54,729
started out with the time joining us now stream because again like I always like and

724
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:58,540
then I don't just think well you know I think new is working with a group I think

725
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:06,999
that's all that does like which is like not yeah you know like I think they had one.

726
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:12,010
Yeah, they like yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's like an outside company.

727
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:20,450
So like you're putting slides and all that is that now I submitted to this company that when it's been submitted on patient issues,

728
01:17:20,530 --> 01:17:23,560
then that's when I don't know much about like no, there's no word yet there,

729
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:29,950
but like they're used to spatial trends, they're done these platforms and this genomics class.

730
01:17:30,370 --> 01:17:36,639
So usually I can make good money. So like if you decide to help out here, still undecided, right?

731
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:45,190
Yeah. And then Maureen she wanted to get idea and make different regions overlap the right

732
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:49,690
atrial left atrial and the different chambers so I know like they are like drawings,

733
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:54,760
but yeah, yeah, yeah. Like hotspots for trying.

734
01:17:54,910 --> 01:18:02,110
Yeah, yeah. I draw sort of interest because that's where you want to draw and just have to like go on to make sure for her.

735
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:06,130
So she's definitely that issue, the legend. So don't make sure you have that.

736
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:11,830
How or like other order prospects, prospect is different loads of the pricing of different ilium.

737
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:15,129
You want to know what was it about your area?

738
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:23,530
So because I have transferred patterns, you know, I think that's really cool to be and then like everything I do is very visual, very morphologic.

739
01:18:23,530 --> 01:18:28,310
Yeah, but the missing piece is you don't have like march like collected or part, okay?

740
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:32,530
And it used to be like, okay, you could chew on a tissue, get simple like in a part,

741
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:40,030
but then you can't titles together approaches to some of the reason I tried to understand would finally bring together on the expression

742
01:18:40,930 --> 01:18:49,760
and the location of for a story so that is I don't like I in the microenvironment yeah within like our aorta and also you know our.

743
01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:55,650
Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine. And then we have a bubble, and we're going to be reminded that it's all broken.

744
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:58,690
So much so that it would be so cool to know. Like what?

745
01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:03,280
This looks fine. What's happening here? Yeah, that part is out of there.

746
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,370
So that's going to look like I've got an arsenal.

747
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:13,750
But is something happening in that seemingly rational part compared to like a control in that that's protective of that?

748
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:22,120
You don't have that until now. So yeah. Yeah. And so just like as a follow up in future, how do you like, for example,

749
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:27,040
like the million dollar things that a cancer diagnosis like I guess breast cancer for example,

750
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:34,650
how do they decide whether they're ever using like targeted analysis or is that just based on empirical expert type?

751
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:38,110
Well, I think will it be in like to be involved? Well, I mean,

752
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:46,059
my version or like they would know that is better as they hired have the breast cancer and so indications

753
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:50,469
or like things that you know that's the that my whole genome and the three in development you would

754
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:59,620
identify a particular family so or some mutation so such that sort of single gene gene I have usually

755
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:05,880
done base studies that identify the population like those of the family has a high incidence of cancer.

756
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:10,690
Let's figure out. And now I think they're doing more.

757
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:21,020
But like if you're able rod like hold up that same thing, you know, take four aorta samples, you take patients that have the outcome like writing,

758
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:25,770
you don't have a lot of things and then you're doing like it's a shotgun sequencer and that's what,

759
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:35,590
you know, make sure I can see in there they were they're able to identify like tabs a lot of different tools like means to that phenotype right here.

760
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:41,010
So even doing that kind of shotgun approach, if one of their underneath,

761
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:48,849
okay well this kind of thing are driven by mutations that could just what is group is different about mutation in a minor

762
01:20:48,850 --> 01:20:55,070
college so like even though you're not helpful because like clinically physician from the physician side they're all like,

763
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:59,950
that's the question, aortic valve replacement or yeah, yeah.

764
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:03,220
Emergency means that they have different molecular.

765
01:21:03,410 --> 01:21:10,719
Yeah, I mean I think the same outcome. But depending on like some types of college, it has a lot of redundancy.

766
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:15,100
So if you have a mutation in a minor pathogen, maybe it's not able to integrate into something.

767
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:20,620
But there are sometimes the colleges are more critical. So those patients are more experience.

768
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:28,059
I've seen this. They're actually sort if you have one other neck course mutations equally important to know which one do you have so and

769
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:34,690
like are the people who have that mutation for that question that's how is that a critical or more likely to have an adult.

770
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:42,130
Yeah so maybe that's a person and more importantly to see if they have like a purge area as is aorta.

771
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:45,220
I mean, this is something where it's a minor pathogen essentially.

772
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:49,030
Yeah. Or that standard, they might be left there and then some are like, oh, okay.

773
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:54,040
And is that kind of we've got access to that.

774
01:21:54,730 --> 01:21:55,959
Yeah, I was just curious then.

775
01:21:55,960 --> 01:22:03,260
So is that kind of also related to how they decide like single nucleotide polymorphisms as like usually like like greater than just 1% in

776
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:13,629
population but then so I'm not students a genetic predisposition so so pretty much a geneticist feels better value to us no question but yeah.

777
01:22:13,630 --> 01:22:16,420
So yeah, I know some of them as well.

778
01:22:16,570 --> 01:22:28,070
Like call 581 is a minor college and what about for like in order to title it's for like a pleasure, not like fiber dysplasia in the order.

779
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:32,950
So that goes on the wall of an A or something.

780
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:40,930
I, i other words, like other hard review that was identified as 301.

781
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:43,620
And I brought that over my shoulder, did come up.

782
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:51,670
But then they were also just like other media technologies that pertain to jump into the type of or presence

783
01:22:51,670 --> 01:22:57,340
of names that also affect that up and say something I didn't I mean I don't know I would have genetic.

784
01:22:57,340 --> 01:23:01,120
Yeah. And that could provide any false where they make an call a true answer.

785
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:11,499
Yeah. Okay. 2.0 hundred and they might be written scripted and then I it's kind of like harkening back to Transcriptome and so

786
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:18,430
like if that's what you're like or not or like I always like multiple discovery turned kind of rainbow even if,

787
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:21,130
let's say, like for like individuals like, like me,

788
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:28,480
because we're if we're trying to like go into position as and is assigned a unique set of high corresponds to yeah better being dysregulated

789
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:35,680
how do you differentiate between an array as did the statistical significance and like a nucleotide in machine versus like you know,

790
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:38,530
maybe in the individual population it's not significant,

791
01:23:38,530 --> 01:23:43,750
but there's still like the same or my full gender and side like tell I mean that that is the crux of all that.

792
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:49,640
Well I think I think. Well, yeah, because I'm I mean, in many instances you can't you're just taking your best.

793
01:23:50,580 --> 01:24:00,149
Yeah. Okay. So I mean, that's like omission of anything in toxicology for like, you know,

794
01:24:00,150 --> 01:24:05,370
the cream is a very crude example, but yeah, kabakov experiment contact lens background as well.

795
01:24:05,370 --> 01:24:11,300
I think they had some findings that suggested that in high doses with amateur eyesight,

796
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:15,690
but then you have other findings that might just be that noise in the population.

797
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:24,310
And so like, you know, always are so central to your population that by chance maybe you're having an increase in your high dose.

798
01:24:25,230 --> 01:24:33,420
But is that really is that really papules like we have a possible biologic that we can exclude

799
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:39,479
liver toxicity either like to increase the chance of BSI do we can be extrapolate that to humans.

800
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:43,170
Other question because we know that mice are more sensitive to paddock carcinogens.

801
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:51,059
Right. And or you know, it's not a generic cookie cutter, it's a living animal just like any other creature that moves along time.

802
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:58,139
It's a symptom of increased cancer. Okay, so we have a background mouse on top of everything, right?

803
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:01,850
So, like, that's just like any other, like, trial is repetition.

804
01:25:01,890 --> 01:25:07,050
And yet consistently getting these results, we'd like to think is either by chance, which is unlikely to happen.

805
01:25:07,290 --> 01:25:16,079
City If you put in your experiment and in fact your dogs are something so like hundreds of evidence that you go on to write about even something,

806
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:21,540
you know, weight compared with the weight of evidence of humans is a carcinogenic in more than one species.

807
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:26,669
And these are biologically plausible conditions. And how much risk are you willing to accept?

808
01:25:26,670 --> 01:25:32,290
I think so. Like with all the scenarios, if you have strong evidence that like, you know.

809
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:39,569
Yeah, you know, self awareness like that. Yeah, yeah, it's carcinogenic practicing this, you know, no matter how much you like that beverage,

810
01:25:39,570 --> 01:25:42,299
you might be the last one that take that runs the process.

811
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:50,010
If you have to take a life saving drug, really understand that it has a high capacity to get treated,

812
01:25:50,070 --> 01:25:53,080
life saving for which there are no other treatments for this.

813
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:58,010
I'm going to accept it greater than the previous ones are. Like there's been questions, right?

814
01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:02,970
Right. You know, and then there's like, Oh yeah, let's think about the results, right?

815
01:26:02,970 --> 01:26:07,050
Yeah. That's the hard part because there's no answers that everybody likes to answer to it.

816
01:26:07,650 --> 01:26:13,450
But obviously you have to have the science feels like you're drawing as you can because the best evidence of that, right?

817
01:26:13,770 --> 01:26:18,260
Yeah. Biologics just take the best evidence. Yeah.

818
01:26:18,350 --> 01:26:24,090
Yeah. So, you know, you just have to like get back, but it's very hard to challenge it.

819
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:27,710
But I think Iran's government is going to help us.

820
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:30,810
But I don't think it's going to sound like it's like a solid different.

821
01:26:31,050 --> 01:26:35,700
And like I said, in some ways it makes it work. It's getting closer because you can make out more subtle.

822
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:41,310
And like we said, cells are just the change all the time.

823
01:26:41,310 --> 01:26:45,690
So where do you draw the line or change is adverse?

824
01:26:45,690 --> 01:26:51,540
I mean, you if I was, then I'm right in here too.

825
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:55,170
Just like this is so adapted to its environment. If I wanted to talk around.

826
01:26:55,440 --> 01:27:03,059
Yeah, if you, if you just said yeah. Also kind of like listening to like future iterations, have you seen any legal issues or deep learning?

827
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:10,710
Oh my God. With like, I don't know if any slides or just like my gut has recognized me that oh yeah.

828
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:15,840
So yeah, we're going to talk about that a little bit about the thought because like traditional pathology research,

829
01:27:16,050 --> 01:27:20,040
the good part about pathology is that you way it's very broad.

830
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:23,630
All right. Like if I want to detect an inferior culture, I like it.

831
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:32,040
I have to take a PCR so I can run all the PCR and all the known infectious agents that get pretty expensive.

832
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:35,519
It's only gonna be like three times in pathology when I there.

833
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:40,830
Yeah. Um, you're looking at the tissues and like, it's like your mind has many diagnoses which have memory.

834
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:42,600
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

835
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:50,160
All this is something that cause our examination in the liver infection paper, the elastic, and then you can run specific confirmatory trials.

836
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:54,560
So in a way you the is kind of a cheap way to do a broad.

837
01:27:55,620 --> 01:28:03,220
Yeah so I that part about that you clinic but it's most sensitive way that I look at colon for

838
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:10,499
mild colitis it's very severe and you would say does that correlate with biological studies.

839
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:15,900
Well I Histologically said one of the colitis cycle is that person less symptomatic

840
01:28:16,350 --> 01:28:22,420
considering I'm looking at it that's why I think yeah section is that response to

841
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:29,520
the person is a no I'm just grading even better biological and you know I can try if

842
01:28:29,550 --> 01:28:37,700
I could hear it on bio own is there something is just effective and severe is um.

843
01:28:37,790 --> 01:28:44,340
I don't know high density effect in the entire like I try to define it but like your model and your malaria might be different.

844
01:28:44,550 --> 01:28:49,560
So it doesn't. I would just like for machine learning I don't know what now trying to use.

845
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:53,940
There's sort of like everything that comes up.

846
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:54,910
Yeah. Yeah. Different.

847
01:28:54,920 --> 01:29:04,489
You know, I like the idea and I know there was a I driven way using our training, you know, network to recognize the very things I train.

848
01:29:04,490 --> 01:29:10,320
You guys like to recognize the classes. Okay. Right. So you drink coffee and then you can express whatever.

849
01:29:10,370 --> 01:29:14,660
I think me or I could say, what's a percent of collection of $30?

850
01:29:14,810 --> 01:29:18,980
So I kind of converted the data actually, to a kind of continuous measure.

851
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:22,530
Yeah. Yeah, I think I can find a subtle difference, but.

852
01:29:22,580 --> 01:29:27,700
Yeah, that's cool. I like it because I get school work and then it's.

853
01:29:27,710 --> 01:29:30,770
It's like a helper tool. Yeah. Like, yeah, yeah.

854
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:37,010
I mean, that is really cool. I'm really excited when I really decide, but when I'm scoring, it's like, tedious.

855
01:29:37,430 --> 01:29:41,540
I want it to be done. Okay. We were doing my fish.

856
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:44,780
Yeah, right now, the human. You make some decisions. Let's see. I would.

857
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:51,510
The teenagers. But it's not going to solve all the problems either, because, like I said, even if I can, you know,

858
01:29:51,560 --> 01:30:00,470
run a machine perfectly as far as the degree of neutrophil infiltration or the degree of going on the cold more this person has 15%.

859
01:30:01,370 --> 01:30:05,670
Yeah. Like in this area, this person has 35 years of life.

860
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:09,500
And this is a snapshot. I'm looking at a section, a biopsy right now.

861
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:13,360
Does that correlate with the severity of the disease right now?

862
01:30:13,370 --> 01:30:17,690
How much variability or across I mean, characterizing their entire right.

863
01:30:18,170 --> 01:30:25,670
So like it doesn't completely remove you from allocating the risk and bias, I guess you'd say it was a kind of expert judgment.

864
01:30:25,910 --> 01:30:28,940
And then you have to like kind of I live by yourself.

865
01:30:28,940 --> 01:30:38,089
So that's the hardest thing for us to learn is actually because I am a very short so like I don't a the path meeting there

866
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:44,030
is a there's a guy downstairs did a lot of work with some of the pharma companies around here and Neil didn't even like 15,

867
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:49,070
20 years ago there was a rudimentary version of our monitoring software,

868
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:54,040
but our modern A.I. and the drug companies loved how they were going to run all the tissues.

869
01:30:54,260 --> 01:31:01,310
This and we want to help these people just like they have other kids like us or anything like that.

870
01:31:02,270 --> 01:31:06,280
I mean, you think it's easier to teach an instrument, to recognize a vision?

871
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:10,670
Yeah. Like I taught you guys to recognize necrosis. I tell you, guys do recognize it doesn't mean.

872
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:15,499
Yeah, but normal variation. I have a pretty good issue for the cut in the floor.

873
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:22,159
I just split the intestines sort of twisting in of the variety of challenges you have to figure out is so much greater than I mean,

874
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:25,979
you should chopping tools the way they're being used now,

875
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:33,290
like in farm animals like if there an experiment or I knew or probably likely to get information from

876
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:38,540
like a screen all the slides it runs it and then the pathologists can go through a reality check.

877
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:43,670
But there is pretty much nothing out there right now that is not like the tricorder and start trying

878
01:31:43,690 --> 01:31:49,070
to smell the tissues there and have like a mental list of everything that's normal that doesn't exist.

879
01:31:49,310 --> 01:31:53,510
The human brain is still the best at that. I definitely think that.

880
01:31:53,570 --> 01:32:03,590
And then how do these code it's all going the way of A.I. but like I said, I'm not worried that it's going to replace the human brain entirely.

881
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:09,100
And just like I mean, facial recognition, self-driving cars, like look at self-driving cars.

882
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:17,580
Yeah, I can do that. Well, yeah. But like, I mean, there's something about the commentators that they're great at putting things in context.

883
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:24,350
I think for a next technology, there is going to be, you know, the things that are shooting is better.

884
01:32:25,130 --> 01:32:30,730
Like my eyes can difference between 39% tissue affected 30 and oh yeah,

885
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:39,440
my leg so like there's development there but that frees you up to kind of take concrete picture data.

886
01:32:39,510 --> 01:32:48,100
I'm just trying to correlate on an algorithm like the actual disease manifestation or actual human.

887
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:57,170
Yeah. But yeah, there's a lot of I have a program now or maybe some expensive ones that I tried to buy from them,

888
01:32:57,740 --> 01:33:02,950
but it's cold stuff before you pay for your policies.

889
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:09,499
And I thought, Oh yeah, thank you.

890
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:12,920
So now I'm training it to recognize the lesion so I can compare.

891
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:16,100
Well, have a good weekend. Thank you. Take care.

892
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:22,729
So hair like how does the machine store compared to human and more importantly because we also have like so to

893
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:30,430
find data maybe we need a machine for and reflect those independent markers of disease better than human scoring.

894
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:33,770
Yeah. Or like so I'm like totally excited about that.

895
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:39,800
So and it's like kind of going on that topic again. My concern is like governmental efforts and like organizations.

896
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:48,260
Can you just like name a top of like just like some of these organizations that are doing work in this domain and like whether or not there is I mean,

897
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:53,840
I know that pharma. Like Sierras and things like Charles River, which is one of the big scrolls.

898
01:33:54,320 --> 01:34:00,190
I know pathologists who just do image analysis now that they have data scientists and toxicology.

899
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:01,070
So it's like a team.

900
01:34:02,090 --> 01:34:11,749
So a lot of the pharma companies, most of them have some sort of a mostly in their non GAAP side because when you look at regulatory stuff,

901
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:18,379
the other thing yeah, and that's true in human medicine to write a diagnostic test has to be approved like for its efficacy.

902
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:24,140
So like in human medicine, even digital slides like looking at a slide on a computer,

903
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:31,340
we can focus up and down digital slide approval for diagnosis like you know,

904
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:33,700
if you're a pathologist signs off on a diagnosis,

905
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:43,279
the kind of using a digital slide for the final diagnosis was not or to my knowledge is still not approved for clinical diagnosis.

906
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:48,589
It may have changed with the pandemic, but for a long time you couldn't have a diagnosis.

907
01:34:48,590 --> 01:34:52,930
Sign up in clinical medicine on a digital slide because a digital slide,

908
01:34:52,930 --> 01:34:58,610
just like an electronic version of a glass slide, is considered a different diagnostic test.

909
01:34:59,630 --> 01:35:07,070
So it's like you have to show. And they did this first I think for breast cancer like you did immuno diagnostics on breast cancer.

910
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:10,010
So like e are PR expression and HER2 expression,

911
01:35:11,210 --> 01:35:16,760
digital slides are approved for that and they had to actually show that like having a digital read of her too.

912
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:21,739
And, and their estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor was equivalent to an expert human rating.

913
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:26,720
And so there's like a regulatory burden and that's really expensive to do those levels of approval.

914
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:32,750
Yeah. So most of the push in like image analysis and digital pathology has been on the experimental side.

915
01:35:33,170 --> 01:35:36,350
It's like we don't have to have as high burden of sure approval.

916
01:35:36,830 --> 01:35:41,750
So even in in like Charles River doesn't start, Pfizer has a brand branch.

917
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:48,410
Most of the large kind of pharma and serums have some branch that's doing image analysis mostly on like their

918
01:35:48,630 --> 01:35:56,210
their discovery research non GAAP side and probably eventually they want to put it into the GOP setting.

919
01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:04,700
But in a way it's kind of more fun on the Discovery side because you know, if you if I were ever to go to industry,

920
01:36:04,700 --> 01:36:09,020
I would definitely want to be on the discovery side just pushing glass all day.

921
01:36:09,410 --> 01:36:15,680
And so I guess like given like the idealized, like isolated nature of these like training datasets,

922
01:36:16,190 --> 01:36:22,090
what are some like skill sets or like things that you should look out for when you're trying to do these?

923
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:24,829
Can I really do automated deep learning? I don't know.

924
01:36:24,830 --> 01:36:31,400
I mean, I think I it works really well with like a team approach because like you still need a subject matter expert.

925
01:36:31,490 --> 01:36:35,120
Okay, it's harder.

926
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:39,290
Well, it depends on the person, but okay, so it's like it's it's I mean,

927
01:36:39,290 --> 01:36:44,540
there are individuals like if you're a pathologist and like all your life you've been coding on the side or something,

928
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:52,100
like how you could have a pathologist who's like pretty savvy about coding and about neural networks and sort of develops that side of it.

929
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:57,830
It's relatively uncommon to see that as it is relatively uncommon for a data

930
01:36:57,830 --> 01:37:03,230
scientist or like a machine learning scientist to have in-depth pathology knowledge.

931
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:10,310
So most of the pharma companies usually take the approach where they'll have the person in charge of image analysis is like,

932
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:18,950
you know, a computational computer scientist or machine learning expert or toxicologist who's like develop themselves in that area.

933
01:37:18,950 --> 01:37:23,750
And then they're working side by side with the subject matter expert, the ground truth person.

934
01:37:24,230 --> 01:37:29,420
So the ground truth person will explain, okay, well, this is what's biologically important.

935
01:37:29,660 --> 01:37:35,120
This is what it looks like. So when I'm looking at the slides, these are the things I'm picking out, right?

936
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:38,870
And then that influences like how you annotate the side of your training,

937
01:37:38,870 --> 01:37:42,350
the neural network, or what parameters you put in if you're doing some other,

938
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:47,329
you know, just traditional machine analysis and then you run whatever your data is,

939
01:37:47,330 --> 01:37:51,050
and then you look at it together and you see where it's making mistakes.

940
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:54,860
And then you have to sort of define like, what is the reason for this? Do we need training?

941
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:58,850
Is it taking like some artifact that we underrepresented in our training set?

942
01:37:59,450 --> 01:38:03,360
It's kind of a combination approach, so it's like a iterative like team.

943
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:06,829
Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. I mean, it's really fascinating.

944
01:38:06,830 --> 01:38:15,379
And I because it took so long to get there are some open source programs that do a little bit of image analysis or something called Q Path.

945
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:19,820
Q You know, like if you need to, that is really nice.

946
01:38:19,820 --> 01:38:22,430
And there's some really I'll probably put that in the pathology.

947
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:27,440
I'll put a slide in for some of the online things that people can look at to see, just for starters.

948
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:33,349
Q Path is nice that a couple of people in this program who've had Ph.D. projects that involve a lot of you know,

949
01:38:33,350 --> 01:38:39,980
I've pointed them to Q paths because of account like immunologically stained cells where you don't have automatically Oh yeah,

950
01:38:40,010 --> 01:38:44,780
don't want to spend your time any more clicking on a slide. I never used to do that.

951
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:49,190
Never want to do that ever again. So like, that's simple.

952
01:38:49,190 --> 01:38:57,920
And then. I'm just getting started in terms of like training, like a neural network, which is a more advanced pattern based type of learning.

953
01:38:58,220 --> 01:39:03,560
Eventually, I mean, that would be great to interpret, incorporate like in a class like this.

954
01:39:03,570 --> 01:39:10,100
I don't have a good dataset for that yet, but eventually I think that's where certainly in experimental biology that's going to go.

955
01:39:10,190 --> 01:39:18,400
But as I said, I think I do think that's another team science area because just like, you know,

956
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:22,240
many other areas where you're bringing together people who are data,

957
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:27,170
like people doing big data, like with clinical databases, like looking at medical records.

958
01:39:27,290 --> 01:39:30,740
Mm hmm. Those are usually a combination between physicians.

959
01:39:30,950 --> 01:39:35,060
It's like the physicians know, like, okay, clinically, I typically these things are important.

960
01:39:35,090 --> 01:39:37,010
This is like the typical progression of something.

961
01:39:37,490 --> 01:39:44,510
And then data scientists know how to crunch datasets and how to build models that pull out the relevant factors.

962
01:39:44,630 --> 01:39:51,320
Mm hmm. But then you have to come together to sort of reality, check it and figure out, you know, is this an artifact of have constructed the model?

963
01:39:51,340 --> 01:39:56,810
Is this something actually relevant? Is this something that's even going to be useful from a clinical standpoint?

964
01:39:56,840 --> 01:40:00,620
So I think all of those are sort of team science type efforts.

965
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:04,339
But I mean, anything like if you're interested, that third area,

966
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:12,020
I think depending on like whether you're looking at like a big data sort of number crunching approach or like true image analysis.

967
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:20,750
Mm hmm. I mean, the people who are writing models, like from from clinical data.

968
01:40:20,870 --> 01:40:23,960
Mm hmm. You have some usually coding background. Mm hmm.

969
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:37,129
So I think there's even, like, this, I think through computer engineering, maybe there's like a I can't remember.

970
01:40:37,130 --> 01:40:41,340
I have to look again to see what it is. There's, like, a, like a one year or a two year.

971
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:44,900
Like data science, like just training or master's or something.

972
01:40:44,910 --> 01:40:49,250
I don't know. And there's certainly, like, I even took, like, Python is forever.

973
01:40:52,490 --> 01:40:57,560
You know, you can sort of certainly learn a little bit, I think for image analysis.

974
01:40:58,990 --> 01:41:02,809
I mean, Genesis has been hard. Like I've spent a lot of time trying to teach myself that.

975
01:41:02,810 --> 01:41:09,469
And what I find is it tends to either quickly go like, I mean, I can write simple things like in images and stuff,

976
01:41:09,470 --> 01:41:17,470
but I'm not really a coder and it's either quickly goes over my head and is like too far on the programing side, like the math.

977
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:22,640
So yeah. Or on the pathology side, sometimes it needs.

978
01:41:22,670 --> 01:41:26,389
You need a better understanding, like some pathology, like, oh, I'm doing digital pathology.

979
01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:30,379
Just because you're looking at a digital side, you're not really just looking at a slide.

980
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:33,950
You're not doing digital unless you're like measuring something.

981
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:39,440
So I think again, kind of a joint approach. Yeah, I'll put it in the his stone queue path is a good place to start.

982
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:43,429
And they have like they have like a YouTube tutorial thing that was written.

983
01:41:43,430 --> 01:41:47,809
It's based in Java. It's kind of old, but it's based on image.

984
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:53,240
JS If you've ever used Image J, which is the NIH Image Analysis Free program.

985
01:41:53,340 --> 01:42:00,959
Mm hmm. It was based for like, like TIFF images, but you have is like sort of expanded and written to apply to whole digital slides.

986
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:06,230
So, and there are some really nice tutorials for how to use it for really simple things like color coded.

987
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:12,070
Deconvolution hmm. So like for our track stands, we have a lot of people just want to know how much college is there.

988
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:20,180
So we do a try from it's run in, it's blue and I use keypad to tell them what percent of like it has really nice annotation tools as like this

989
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:26,840
real time meditation but like instead of having to draw carpal tunnel like the outline of the entire thing.

990
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:35,600
It's like a smart education tool. So like, it kind of knows at a low resolution level the difference between class, like just plain white and tissue.

991
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:39,770
So you kind of pass the magic wand over the tissue and it automatically draw like a Photoshop.

992
01:42:39,950 --> 01:42:44,900
I love it. That's interesting. It's so fast and so it has some nice tools.

993
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:52,210
It's limited to, at least in my skill set to do like morphology based, something like for the neural network,

994
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:58,250
if I want to train to recognize a lesion that may not be able to do it in my it's better if I'm

995
01:42:58,250 --> 01:43:03,260
like I want to count the number of neutrophils here or I want to count how much blue was in this.

996
01:43:03,410 --> 01:43:09,049
Uh, okay. But for many problems that we do here, like many things that you're doing in like part of a thesis,

997
01:43:09,050 --> 01:43:14,240
a lot of times it's just a cell counting exercise or like a staining difference exercise.

998
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:17,350
So, like, really distinguishable features. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

999
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:24,480
I mean, image analysis is not magic. So like the question when I was working with the data science people on our side of project there already

1000
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:30,020
some pictures like can I hear you also can a human I pick up this difference and the answer is yes.

1001
01:43:30,380 --> 01:43:36,890
Then you can write long for it. So if the answer is no, it's not going to really it's probably not going to work.

1002
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:42,919
Yeah. Like it has to be something that's visually observable bearing in mind that like what a computer

1003
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:47,960
can see at a pixel level is different and more subtle than what I can see with my eye.

1004
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:55,860
But again. You know are you looking at find such fine differences that it you lose significance.

1005
01:43:55,890 --> 01:43:58,890
I don't know. Yeah. Is it like really. Yeah. So, like, you always ask like,

1006
01:43:58,890 --> 01:44:05,700
is there a difference that you can pick out and you tend to get better models if there is a difference that a human can pick out.

1007
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:11,819
And then the instrument saves you time and gives it a more precise measure and you can tell

1008
01:44:11,820 --> 01:44:17,270
me exactly what percent area and then I can apply parametric statistics versus severe,

1009
01:44:17,310 --> 01:44:22,800
right? So. So yeah, I think it's super exciting and I think that team approach is going to be,

1010
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:28,090
you know, whether for transcriptomics or image analysis, the approach of the future.

1011
01:44:28,370 --> 01:44:32,370
But I don't know. Do you think that oh, I'm sorry to take your time.

1012
01:44:32,550 --> 01:44:40,410
I was just curious then. Is there, like, a systematic or, um, you know, was there like any annual reviews for, like,

1013
01:44:40,410 --> 01:44:47,160
internet server agreements between like, like board certified pathologists just to see, like over time has like the concordance.

1014
01:44:48,590 --> 01:45:01,800
Oh, I mean, there are plenty of papers out there and looking at, you know, for scoring system X in disease Y, what's the like.

1015
01:45:03,810 --> 01:45:07,260
Inter Observer. Look at the ICC.

1016
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:12,690
Look, there's a core of concordance that you can use to measure between observers.

1017
01:45:13,190 --> 01:45:16,140
So they're more on an individual project level.

1018
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:25,860
So like there's tons of papers out there that are like we evaluated a standard scoring system for agreement and a lot of the severity scoring,

1019
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:32,040
like most people can tell, the concordance is better to tell if there's something there.

1020
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:40,680
Yes or no? Yes. Usually if it's an expert observer, that's usually good and most people can tell a little bit from really bad.

1021
01:45:40,980 --> 01:45:44,490
That's easy. The middle part all over the place.

1022
01:45:44,580 --> 01:45:53,570
Okay. So like in human like colonic biopsies where you take like people who have a PCC or like, you know, familial and an ominous hypothesis go.

1023
01:45:54,060 --> 01:45:57,670
They think those little boxes in those boxes get rid out because those are benign.

1024
01:45:57,670 --> 01:46:02,880
And what you're trying to predict is like which one is is this person likely to develop carcinoma?

1025
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:10,980
So those get read out as by pathologists and they used to grade those as like I

1026
01:46:10,980 --> 01:46:14,549
think there was a three point grading system and the concordance on that thing

1027
01:46:14,550 --> 01:46:20,640
is a horrible it's just even expert pathologists because it's just your your

1028
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:24,030
you're that you're asking your eyes to make really a molecular assessment.

1029
01:46:24,450 --> 01:46:31,229
So now they just kind of do sort of low, high, like really disparate, really disparate, which is not as useful,

1030
01:46:31,230 --> 01:46:38,790
but like you're kind of fooling yourself and potentially if you're letting a person who potentially is healthy undergo more procedures.

1031
01:46:38,910 --> 01:46:42,110
Yeah. If you're like cause you're between a rock and a hard place.

1032
01:46:42,110 --> 01:46:45,179
So we talked about sensitivity and specificity you don't want to miss.

1033
01:46:45,180 --> 01:46:46,620
Someone is going to get a cancer.

1034
01:46:46,890 --> 01:46:51,960
So your tendency, if it's if it's a human being on the end of that, your tendency is be like, well, better be safe than sorry.

1035
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:59,690
Right. They'll have a subtotal colectomy. But but you don't want to be having a subtotal colectomy if you don't have to.

1036
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:06,870
But if you're more conservative, you're gonna miss you're absolutely are going to miss a few people who go on and develop cancer.

1037
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:15,150
It's just there is no diagnostic test, be it a human being's eyes or a molecular test that's 100% discriminatory.

1038
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:19,559
So. Right, that's a challenge. So, yes, striking a fine balance.

1039
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:21,840
And it just out of curiosity, I hope you don't mind me asking.

1040
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:28,709
So for future career considerations, everybody, scientists, what do you think's going to be really in-demand?

1041
01:47:28,710 --> 01:47:34,590
Like, how is your training in places like toxicology pathology and what was like kind of the skill sets you developed?

1042
01:47:35,310 --> 01:47:41,340
And then do you think do you think there's like a oversaturation, like the bioinformatics where we need more?

1043
01:47:41,910 --> 01:47:51,120
I mean, I think you have to have I think if you were a toxicologist, having some background in bioinformatics will be very helpful.

1044
01:47:51,210 --> 01:47:56,490
Okay. I think I mean, I don't know, probably that'll be the question for bioinformatics person.

1045
01:47:56,610 --> 01:48:02,220
Can you can say over the whole field of bioinformatics if it's oversaturated, I have a hard time imagining that.

1046
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:12,180
But like if you particularly want to geared towards biomedicine, I think you have to have some background to what biomedicine is.

1047
01:48:12,990 --> 01:48:18,600
So I think maybe if it's a toxicologist like having some training like coursework

1048
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:23,700
or certificate or masters or something in bioinformatics or an image analysis,

1049
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:28,770
if that's even just is I think tends to be more.

1050
01:48:29,190 --> 01:48:37,739
There are relatively certainly for kids, there are relatively few pathologists that are really do that really do image analysis.

1051
01:48:37,740 --> 01:48:39,870
They're almost always the subject matter expert.

1052
01:48:41,610 --> 01:48:49,080
Their pathologist is a little bit more because like the people working in experimental or in pharma, like we tend to be more broad anyway.

1053
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:53,240
M.D. pathologists are very specialized pathologists.

1054
01:48:53,670 --> 01:48:55,799
You don't look at all the variety of slides that we do.

1055
01:48:55,800 --> 01:49:02,400
If you're clinical, you're like, you're a lymphoma expert, and I like looking at hematologic malignancies all day.

1056
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:07,260
Yeah, as a veteran, it's all just for the most part, it's like anything.

1057
01:49:07,530 --> 01:49:15,419
Yeah. So it's broader in that sense. So and they tend to think more a little bit comparatively because you have to and because we don't have the

1058
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:21,960
regulatory aspect like we can be more experimental in adding a new technique in because we don't have that.

1059
01:49:22,290 --> 01:49:26,770
I have to like make a regulatory case that this is equivalent of the right.

1060
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:34,110
Yeah. So like it doesn't have anywhere near the regulatory burden. So like in, in tax payers like in pharma,

1061
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:40,200
most of the people do in talks about anyway on the preclinical side are veterinary pathologists more than the M.D. pathologists,

1062
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:49,200
and they've been more adopting of newer technologies, probably because they don't have that regulatory burden and like it can just be broader.

1063
01:49:49,770 --> 01:49:58,230
But I mean, I wouldn't to be a GP like a veterinary pathologist is a long road and like, you know,

1064
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:02,520
a veterinarian first, then you go to a residency and a lot of that is just a small version of a.

1065
01:50:02,570 --> 01:50:08,150
A lot of that is geared in a totally different way than like even the stuff that I'm doing now.

1066
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:12,710
Like I think back at the stuff that I did in my early, like, I mean, I was a practicing vet.

1067
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:18,410
Like I was like giving your dog the heartworm pills. I mean, was great.

1068
01:50:18,410 --> 01:50:27,170
I love having had a varied career, but like for people here who are primarily interested in doing talkspace, you know,

1069
01:50:27,170 --> 01:50:31,430
unless you have a strong interest in being the pathology subject matter expert,

1070
01:50:31,550 --> 01:50:35,540
those are people that might want to consider going the veterinary route and the pathology route.

1071
01:50:36,170 --> 01:50:37,729
From the toxicology side, though,

1072
01:50:37,730 --> 01:50:46,250
I think there's a lot of opportunity for collaboration with the subject matter expert and for really doing the image analysis side of it.

1073
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:54,170
Yeah. So being more flexible in your approaches and the collaboration more on the data side and understanding image analysis.

1074
01:50:54,650 --> 01:50:59,809
So like I think being strong there because very few pathologists are and you can always look,

1075
01:50:59,810 --> 01:51:05,000
especially if you're going to work in industry, you can always collaborate with the pathologists to just provide the subject matter expert.

1076
01:51:05,130 --> 01:51:09,140
Mm hmm. And like, I mean, they're they are just muscles.

1077
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:12,469
They're not going to know how to do, like, even hi.

1078
01:51:12,470 --> 01:51:17,810
Like I can sort of speak conversational image analysis, but I'm not a programmer and nor will I ever be.

1079
01:51:17,810 --> 01:51:25,730
I have to develop way have to like go do a whole other graduate program and I don't even have a page D I did a master's in talks and I'm,

1080
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:28,880
I'm happy where I am. I'm happy with my collaborative role.

1081
01:51:29,210 --> 01:51:37,550
So but I think like data science, even in toxicology, that would be a great thing to bring to like the traditional toolset of a toxicologist.

1082
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:45,139
I mean, I don't know, in the other parts of the coursework, I know Justin's lab and Mori's lab are doing the Transcriptomic type things.

1083
01:51:45,140 --> 01:51:50,180
Yeah. So they might have some other additional insights in terms of toxicology specific,

1084
01:51:50,180 --> 01:51:57,440
like what skillsets are available to students here or what skill sets you might acquire and wherever your next steps are.

1085
01:51:57,530 --> 01:52:03,139
And I don't know. And then this is kind of like going off topic,

1086
01:52:03,140 --> 01:52:11,090
but like I heard there's like this term going around really omics is that's something completely separate from a term of I know

1087
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:17,290
is that referring to radiology or to like yeah apparently they're looking at CT scans and then just applying image analysis.

1088
01:52:17,290 --> 01:52:22,370
So I was curious if there was like any like like research efforts going on here.

1089
01:52:22,430 --> 01:52:29,270
Radiology was first in image analysis, actually, because they did like digital films, you know,

1090
01:52:29,450 --> 01:52:35,010
other than X-ray films like that was the old school, but they went to digital images before pathology ever did.

1091
01:52:35,670 --> 01:52:41,729
That's probably, I think, an offshoot of that, I guess, because I was wondering then kind of they like extrapolate some of the methods

1092
01:52:41,730 --> 01:52:46,290
from like just like traditional radiology to what is going on in the mean.

1093
01:52:46,620 --> 01:52:53,370
I don't know. I know that radiology has used digital images like to remote read because there's there's not that

1094
01:52:53,370 --> 01:52:58,320
many radiologists so radiologists are usually sitting in a darkened room somewhere like basically.

1095
01:52:58,470 --> 01:53:05,040
Yeah. So but I would assume and I don't know like how much of that is still it's probably

1096
01:53:05,130 --> 01:53:10,050
because that also has to be like regulatory cleared for actual clinical diagnosis,

1097
01:53:10,050 --> 01:53:19,410
right? So that might still be pretty experimental, but I would assume that they do want to apply some sort of A.I. because fatigue is a real thing.

1098
01:53:19,780 --> 01:53:23,879
Like if you're a human being and you're looking at however many radiographs a day, you're going to miss stuff.

1099
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:26,610
Because right here I can only take so much.

1100
01:53:26,700 --> 01:53:32,790
So it's probably going to be like with pathology, like the pathologist assistant to where it slides things and then the human.

1101
01:53:33,270 --> 01:53:41,880
Because remember we said that like the normal is hard. So like for I image analysis programs tend to pick up normal things and call them abnormal.

1102
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:48,600
So then you have a human comes off some tissue falls and nothing but that will be helpful in and of itself.

1103
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:52,649
Right. Just to screen, you know, you know, you're going to have a percent in there.

1104
01:53:52,650 --> 01:54:03,210
That's like nothing. Right. Just to pick out the the questionable ones that have a human screen, those I don't know.

1105
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:11,820
I think it's I think it was a lot I mean, traditional pathology was like and I still there still are a lot of people in pathology fields like that,

1106
01:54:11,910 --> 01:54:16,110
but it's the class that is going in your eye. But like, I think, like I said, I mean,

1107
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:20,580
it makes life easier and I think a lot easier is like you can do the things that the human brain is going to do.

1108
01:54:20,730 --> 01:54:22,139
You know, the answers around it.

1109
01:54:22,140 --> 01:54:28,590
Like, I do not want to spend my time sitting there clicking consoles and like it's a waste of a human being's mind to do that.

1110
01:54:28,590 --> 01:54:35,160
Yeah. So let the tools help you and then like you apply your brain to the outside of it.

1111
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:45,030
So I don't know. So I kind of just like going back, just kind of like for future looking at this, just like you mentioned, QPR tool.

1112
01:54:45,030 --> 01:54:50,090
I mean, the project mission was to see if you or I don't know.

1113
01:54:50,310 --> 01:54:56,290
Oh yeah, I work with them in micro immuno. There's a group that studied Clostridium difficile for like many years.

1114
01:54:56,290 --> 01:54:59,760
So there's actually a guy who was at MIT when I was there. And our careers have strangely.

1115
01:54:59,940 --> 01:55:05,610
Parallel. Vince Young is an M.D., Ph.D. in microbial.

1116
01:55:06,180 --> 01:55:11,160
He was a MSU when I was he was in my team. I was there. There was an embassy when I was there.

1117
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:14,549
And now we're both at U of M, not by any planning whatsoever,

1118
01:55:14,550 --> 01:55:20,700
but I've known since like before I was a pathologist, so I'm basically the study pathologist for that group.

1119
01:55:21,150 --> 01:55:24,540
And that's great because that's a group that has infectious disease docs.

1120
01:55:24,540 --> 01:55:27,930
It's basically with Vance's infectious disease scientists.

1121
01:55:28,230 --> 01:55:31,350
It has epidemiologists, it has data scientists.

1122
01:55:32,010 --> 01:55:36,540
We have like microbial ecologists, pathologists.

1123
01:55:36,750 --> 01:55:45,959
I love it. So they do a lot of like very team science based things looking at we have mouse models of C diff, we have data from patients.

1124
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:51,420
So the data scientists use predictive markers for the patients and then we try to vet,

1125
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:54,960
we make hypotheses about progression because those in our mouse model.

1126
01:55:55,260 --> 01:56:01,350
So to me like that's my favorite kind of science because like I mean I'm not imaging all six burn or non microbial oncologists,

1127
01:56:01,350 --> 01:56:08,249
but I've learned so much about both those fields and like that's the best way because no one person can have all those knowledge areas.

1128
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:12,780
Right. And I mean, I sometimes think it's hard though, and I think we're getting better.

1129
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:20,520
But in academia, there's still a little bit of the silo, like I have to like come up with something great and run my lab.

1130
01:56:20,820 --> 01:56:23,520
There's a little bit of exclusiveness, I think still.

1131
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:28,740
Like you have to kind of prove yourself to set up your love, to get the funding, to have like your students and stuff.

1132
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:33,120
And then if you're part I think is getting a little bit better, particularly in the med school.

1133
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:35,249
But if you're part of a team science effort,

1134
01:56:35,250 --> 01:56:40,590
I think one of the challenges in academia has traditionally been when you come back for tenure or whatever,

1135
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:45,910
they're like, Well, what are you that you're not an independent scientist because you're just a team member, right?

1136
01:56:45,930 --> 01:56:49,050
But like if you look at how science works.

1137
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:56,339
Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I mean, in some countries they have like an institute model where you just have groups of scientists.

1138
01:56:56,340 --> 01:56:59,430
And in many ways I think that might be better.

1139
01:56:59,610 --> 01:57:02,610
Yeah, but I think it's changing a little bit now.

1140
01:57:02,610 --> 01:57:08,939
And the med school at least certainly, and like even in toxicology, we have these big initiatives and like you grants and things.

1141
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:17,639
So I think that has to be the way it goes. And just out of curiosity, you mentioned like patient drive, like samples say, oh, patient drive.

1142
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:22,469
Yeah. So I was just curious about some of the methods to like collect and like propagate those

1143
01:57:22,470 --> 01:57:26,970
patient derived samples are using like people like cell lines or do using like spheroids or.

1144
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:31,290
Yeah, or Zach Freeman is a faculty member.

1145
01:57:31,290 --> 01:57:36,749
Your lab has a little bit more. And my colleague Mercator Hoff, the other pathologist, they've worked a little bit more with that than I have.

1146
01:57:36,750 --> 01:57:45,000
I'm mostly on the downstream end, but like I know some of those cells, some of the cells are propagated straight from the patient in mice.

1147
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,500
So essentially, oh, chunk of tissue. So immunocompromised mice.

1148
01:57:48,510 --> 01:57:51,150
Yeah, others are cultured so you can develop a cell line.

1149
01:57:51,450 --> 01:57:56,189
So I think it depends on the experiment, some patient derived xenograft or actually just injected cells.

1150
01:57:56,190 --> 01:57:59,639
So like hematologic malignancies, like a mouse. Yeah.

1151
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:06,750
And like the mice get really strange. Like they have these extremely immune compromised mice.

1152
01:58:06,750 --> 01:58:09,760
So they're knocked out for their innate immune system.

1153
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:16,360
They're knocked out for their acquired immune system. Some of them are reconstituted with like human bone marrow derived cells.

1154
01:58:16,420 --> 01:58:26,700
There are humanized mice in that allegedly they have a human immune system, but really they're like a Frankenstein creature.

1155
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:35,700
They're neither a mouse nor a human. So like we have some my colleague I do just like lab in pathology course every year.

1156
01:58:35,700 --> 01:58:40,889
And she works at St Jude Children's Hospital. She's a pathologist there and they have some really great papers looking at

1157
01:58:40,890 --> 01:58:44,400
some of the naturally occurring pathologies in some of these humanized mice.

1158
01:58:45,540 --> 01:58:52,679
And they have all kinds of weird things happen. So like, unfortunately, they're, they're a good model, but they're a model like anything else.

1159
01:58:52,680 --> 01:59:00,300
And they're not exactly they're neither fully reflective human immune system nor mouse immune system, but hybrid.

1160
01:59:00,360 --> 01:59:03,360
Yeah. And some of the pathology that you see in them,

1161
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:09,870
you have to bear that in mind in interpreting and like they're not again, they're not the be all and end all.

1162
01:59:09,870 --> 01:59:13,649
It's not like a mouse with human immune cells is just a tiny for a human.

1163
01:59:13,650 --> 01:59:18,420
It doesn't really work that way. Right. And I just really survive because they.

1164
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:24,500
Like Toto, the musicians. Yeah.

1165
01:59:24,500 --> 01:59:27,560
I mean, those mice are kept like, very clean condition.

1166
01:59:27,590 --> 01:59:29,110
So they're like almost the bubble mouth.

1167
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:36,160
So, like, when they have these immune compromised mice, usually they have their own hematologic like their own red cell system,

1168
01:59:36,170 --> 01:59:43,309
but then before they give them human cells that irradiate them so like wipe out their bone marrow and then certain percentage of I mean,

1169
01:59:43,310 --> 01:59:48,020
it's rough on them, but then they get humanized cells which repopulate the bone marrow.

1170
01:59:48,470 --> 01:59:54,650
So in theory, you're giving them a functional immune system, but still they are very susceptible.

1171
01:59:54,650 --> 01:59:57,710
I mean, when you give them the human immune system, in theory,

1172
01:59:57,800 --> 02:00:01,910
they're sort of disease resistant because they have a normal immune system, but they're really not.

1173
02:00:01,910 --> 02:00:05,810
And like those are kept in housing conditions that are very super clean.

1174
02:00:06,410 --> 02:00:09,890
Like even all our housing conditions compared to like a wild mice are clean,

1175
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:14,480
but like the highest containment or the barrier facilities, we have different health levels.

1176
02:00:14,990 --> 02:00:20,140
All the immunocompromised mice are in the area where like you're very controlled in what comes in every year.

1177
02:00:20,150 --> 02:00:24,639
All kinds of people eat other mice that are not as specialized.

1178
02:00:24,640 --> 02:00:32,410
They're not kept there. So like they're super, super controlled because they are more susceptible to like infectious agents like Samantha.

1179
02:00:33,230 --> 02:00:37,340
I was curious then, have you also worked with like conditionally reprogram cell lines?

1180
02:00:37,340 --> 02:00:45,900
Because I heard like I wasn't like too familiar with the technology, but, um, like ro kinase inhibitors or I forgot what the NIH was like prescribed.

1181
02:00:45,980 --> 02:00:50,389
So, um, I don't know, I mean, not me specifically.

1182
02:00:50,390 --> 02:00:53,900
We see a lot of we're downstream for a lot of stuff.

1183
02:00:53,900 --> 02:00:54,240
Okay.

1184
02:00:54,260 --> 02:01:06,739
So people either treating with inhibitors of various kinase pathways or people giving like cancer cell lines that have particular kinase mutations.

1185
02:01:06,740 --> 02:01:10,940
In a lot of times we're in the downstream and they just want to know, you know,

1186
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:14,690
is it a tumor model or did it decrease the size of the tumor or are tumors developing?

1187
02:01:15,080 --> 02:01:18,469
So sometimes we're pretty downstream.

1188
02:01:18,470 --> 02:01:21,410
So like not involved in like the upstream mechanism part of it.

1189
02:01:21,980 --> 02:01:28,969
Um, I mean there's a lot of transgenic mice now, but with cruise systems and with CRISPR,

1190
02:01:28,970 --> 02:01:31,850
then genes are being more precisely regulated and knocked out.

1191
02:01:31,850 --> 02:01:37,729
So a lot of stuff that we do too is just phenotype being like, Oh, I knocked out this gene, I knocked down this thing.

1192
02:01:37,730 --> 02:01:45,230
What is my can you look at the lung of my mouse and tell me if there's anything different from the you know, yeah, typically normal control.

1193
02:01:45,290 --> 02:01:50,060
So a lot of what we do is just kind of phenotyping and comparing and then depending on

1194
02:01:51,110 --> 02:01:55,430
depending on like how involved we are the project part of the team like for the seed

1195
02:01:55,670 --> 02:02:02,659
or I just kind of give the results and his daughter yeah and work for so like it's

1196
02:02:02,660 --> 02:02:06,020
better I mean I think you get more information if you work more closely with a group.

1197
02:02:06,410 --> 02:02:12,410
Some people are just asking like a very specific question. It's almost like a one off and other people just don't know.

1198
02:02:12,440 --> 02:02:16,729
And they're like I said, some people are really protective about their data almost to a fault,

1199
02:02:16,730 --> 02:02:20,000
because sometimes I need more background to give you good information.

1200
02:02:20,090 --> 02:02:27,050
Yeah. Yeah. So it depends. But and you know, like everybody else, we're really busy, so depends how much we can do for that.

1201
02:02:27,110 --> 02:02:32,300
So I say, I mean, it's fascinating because you do learn a lot, but I don't know.

1202
02:02:32,900 --> 02:02:35,940
And it's like super cool. Thank you again for you.

1203
02:02:36,610 --> 02:02:45,470
Have a great weekend, you two. How are you doing on your good so sorry I sort of feel like you've got of I find it actually

1204
02:02:46,130 --> 02:02:53,430
I use the word generation can I use that with the foul smelling like a bad reputation.

1205
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:58,490
And is that the generation. Yeah. So you have to treat all this, you know.

1206
02:02:59,120 --> 02:03:02,990
Yeah, that's right.

1207
02:03:03,350 --> 02:03:10,880
Okay. Usually, usually I use the word again stepping back, big picture.

1208
02:03:11,030 --> 02:03:18,200
Usually we use the word generation. We're I'm trying to get at feel where the impression I get is that there's something injuring the cells.

1209
02:03:19,190 --> 02:03:22,669
Maybe some of them are dying. So that's necrosis.

1210
02:03:22,670 --> 02:03:28,970
Or if I'm just if that's the case, they come to us as if some of them are dying and some of the cells are sublethal injured.

1211
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:34,790
So not quite injured. So usually where I use the generation as a morphology term,

1212
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:42,560
I'm using it because it's part of a spectrum of changes that suggests to me that there is cell injury.

1213
02:03:43,310 --> 02:03:47,870
So like the liver, acetaminophen example, I have cells that I know are dead.

1214
02:03:49,070 --> 02:03:53,059
So yeah, the generation thinks they were there are that those were the ones around the central

1215
02:03:53,060 --> 02:03:57,520
banks that's necrosis the ones around the portal tracks which were just evacuated.

1216
02:03:57,620 --> 02:04:04,470
Those are degenerate. And that was a high dose amounts that are shown in my medium dose me for my low dose.

1217
02:04:04,550 --> 02:04:10,250
Maybe I had no necrosis, but instead I just have vacuoles around the central veins.

1218
02:04:10,790 --> 02:04:16,909
So in my low dose group, maybe all I see is degeneration in my medium dose group.

1219
02:04:16,910 --> 02:04:22,010
Maybe I had a little few necrotic cells, or maybe a couple of apoptotic cells and mostly degeneration.

1220
02:04:22,420 --> 02:04:26,160
And my high dose group. I have a lot of necrosis and then some degeneration.

1221
02:04:26,950 --> 02:04:32,770
So the overall picture there is cell injury leading to cell death.

1222
02:04:33,010 --> 02:04:41,139
So like, if I'm thinking about all those mice, I might say necrosis, if I'm not seeing over like dead cells,

1223
02:04:41,140 --> 02:04:45,430
I might just use degeneration to indicate that there's injury going on.

1224
02:04:45,730 --> 02:04:55,000
Like in those in the cirrhotic liver, I know those round blobby things are really hepatocytes that are proliferating.

1225
02:04:55,180 --> 02:05:00,820
Right? So they're dividing. They can't divide completely, but they're being constructed by fibrosis.

1226
02:05:00,830 --> 02:05:06,730
Yeah. But yeah, but they're regenerating because there's been injury.

1227
02:05:07,420 --> 02:05:08,799
So, like, in that instance,

1228
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:17,050
the reason I said degeneration and regeneration is because I'm trying to get at the idea that in these areas of altered hepatocytes,

1229
02:05:17,050 --> 02:05:21,870
I have some cells that are being injured and like some of those I can't even see anymore.

1230
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:26,320
So that's the hepatocyte loss. Like in fibrosis, I have some cells that look strange.

1231
02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:29,380
They're vasculitis and then I some cells that are dividing.

1232
02:05:29,410 --> 02:05:36,370
So that's why I use my kind of combo degeneration regeneration more from description.

1233
02:05:36,730 --> 02:05:44,680
Because in my view, if I just use one of those, it doesn't fully describe what I have the whole yeah.

1234
02:05:44,830 --> 02:05:50,230
Like it's not just if I just use degeneration to describe the liver, a cirrhotic liver,

1235
02:05:50,830 --> 02:05:56,440
I wouldn't really fit it because then it doesn't explain why I have those lumps or if I just use regeneration.

1236
02:05:57,310 --> 02:06:00,530
But why are they regenerating? Am I trying to say it's a neoplasm?

1237
02:06:01,060 --> 02:06:07,810
They have to have a reason for them to proliferate, and the cells connected to their degeneration has a tendency to make them.

1238
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:17,490
Yeah, it's a stubborn, lethal injury. So remember we said the hallmark of reverse of irreversible injury was nuclear change in vision?

1239
02:06:17,660 --> 02:06:24,069
Yeah. So that's a cell that's dead. Like all those big cells are going to get cleared away on its way to death.

1240
02:06:24,070 --> 02:06:30,640
We get all those changes like circulation. Maybe the cell gets all small, that gets pink, but the nucleus still looks fine.

1241
02:06:31,570 --> 02:06:34,600
And, you know, we study those as isolated processes.

1242
02:06:35,050 --> 02:06:40,980
But in real life, you know, by the toxicant, in the tissue, some cells are going to be sick.

1243
02:06:40,990 --> 02:06:45,640
Some cells are going to die. Some cells, yeah, some cells are going to regenerate.

1244
02:06:46,540 --> 02:06:56,650
And like where you are, the like the acetaminophen toxicity clearly mostly had necrosis because that was a super high dose,

1245
02:06:57,010 --> 02:07:00,040
you know, that most probably was 24 hours post dosing.

1246
02:07:00,040 --> 02:07:05,469
That's like the equivalent of like somebody, you know, a toxicity of Tylenol.

1247
02:07:05,470 --> 02:07:11,620
So it's an amazing thing. The cow with aflatoxin says that animals in the middle of it,

1248
02:07:11,770 --> 02:07:16,330
like if we were to look at every individual cell, we probably would see some necrotic hepatocytes in there.

1249
02:07:16,660 --> 02:07:23,110
But that animal was chronic toxicity, right? So it has necrosis, it has degeneration, regeneration, all those things.

1250
02:07:23,620 --> 02:07:27,730
So my morphs are really they're trying to get the best picture.

1251
02:07:27,790 --> 02:07:33,759
Like, if I just look at what the worst of what really is going on and then that cow thing just

1252
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:39,940
saying regeneration kind of a weird thing because you'd want to know why that's happening.

1253
02:07:40,630 --> 02:07:43,750
Because cells don't answer unless they're neoplastic.

1254
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:48,880
They shouldn't just up and proliferate. Yeah. Without that, there is degeneration first.

1255
02:07:49,110 --> 02:07:57,969
Yeah. Yeah. Like you would get very actually that in carcinogenicity studies if you say regeneration,

1256
02:07:57,970 --> 02:08:04,060
like if you say hyperplasia and you don't have it in the context of like necrosis or degeneration,

1257
02:08:04,570 --> 02:08:07,750
the people interpreting the study get very concerned that you're trying to suggest

1258
02:08:07,750 --> 02:08:11,530
that there's a neoplastic tendency because like it's an alteration of growth.

1259
02:08:11,890 --> 02:08:20,560
So if you just had hyperplasia that they maybe adenoma or something, that's a neoplastic process project, probably not progression,

1260
02:08:21,490 --> 02:08:29,560
but if you have hyper regenerative hyperplasia, then I'm saying that I have hyperplasia because there's been injury, so there's a reason for it.

1261
02:08:30,460 --> 02:08:35,850
So like a cell shouldn't just decide. You shouldn't have just hyperplasia by itself.

1262
02:08:36,010 --> 02:08:41,590
Don't have to see that reason because that would be cells that were normally quiescent, just deciding to multiply.

1263
02:08:42,160 --> 02:08:46,000
That's where something like dysregulated growth or neoplasia.

1264
02:08:46,540 --> 02:08:49,840
But cells in the liver are supposed to proliferate if there's injury.

1265
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:57,190
Right. So regenerative hyperplasia is response to injury just hyperplasia as an isolated lesion?

1266
02:08:57,670 --> 02:09:02,170
Potentially, it could be the start of a neoplastic process, but it doesn't tell you much.

1267
02:09:02,230 --> 02:09:08,650
It a sign of it up because like, you know, maybe it was injured like four months or three weeks ago and I just didn't see that part.

1268
02:09:08,920 --> 02:09:17,139
But it's something that like if you were reading a talk study and you try to learn what you explain, what does it look like?

1269
02:09:17,140 --> 02:09:22,000
Is there any other change? Why you think this hyperplasia as president may or may not be able to answer that question?

1270
02:09:22,340 --> 02:09:29,120
But it's something that would raise a concern. Like if I gave a drug and it caused hyperplasia and the liver building,

1271
02:09:29,150 --> 02:09:35,090
a lot of alarm bells would run out as a regulator of I give you a drug that causes your hepatocytes to proliferate,

1272
02:09:35,090 --> 02:09:37,370
even if they're not in your plastic now. Mm hmm.

1273
02:09:37,910 --> 02:09:43,940
If I'm giving you a drug that over time causes a higher cycle of replication in your liver, that's a risk factor for cancer.

1274
02:09:44,200 --> 02:09:46,130
Do you I mean, yeah, that is appropriate.

1275
02:09:46,530 --> 02:09:55,580
So, yeah, I mean, it's funny because it's all very visually based, but you also have to understand the context of the cell.

1276
02:09:55,610 --> 02:10:00,070
The signs are really telling you a story. Yeah. But you don't have the complete story.

1277
02:10:00,080 --> 02:10:06,650
And so there still is a lot of like interpretation around it and that we might then have to back up with other data.

1278
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:11,750
So it's a challenge.

1279
02:10:12,230 --> 02:10:17,660
Thank you. Thank you. Have a great weekend. I thank you again for your time. Sorry about that, Christopher.

1280
02:10:20,180 --> 02:10:26,060
All right. I think you're my stuff. Just so just hang on.

1281
02:10:27,050 --> 02:10:35,810
I think that there's a bonus project. Is it just RNA or was it something that she has a couple of different projects.

1282
02:10:35,820 --> 02:10:40,470
Right. Is there are you just. I just want to know the definition of transcriptome.

1283
02:10:40,980 --> 02:10:46,060
Oh, referring to odor and mayonnaise or ethanol apartments, including a smaller.

1284
02:10:46,110 --> 02:10:51,709
This is one of the smells the market. Yeah it's like yeah trans transcription.

1285
02:10:51,710 --> 02:10:57,260
You know, it's generally Emory and I think for the most part it's looking at mirror transcripts.

1286
02:10:57,470 --> 02:11:01,040
Yeah. But then epigenomics is like all the is.

1287
02:11:01,370 --> 02:11:04,880
Well, no, EPIGENOMICS is looking at the DNA analysis.

1288
02:11:04,910 --> 02:11:06,850
Oh, yeah. Mm hmm.

1289
02:11:07,070 --> 02:11:14,300
I think I don't know what that we call there is a method of looking at, like, non-coding RNA or like, yeah, I think that's more bull.

1290
02:11:14,460 --> 02:11:21,200
I don't think it's done with spatial. I think spatial transcriptomics on a slide is mostly just m rna.

1291
02:11:21,530 --> 02:11:26,599
Okay. But rna seq like rna seek RNA sequencing, which traditional.

1292
02:11:26,600 --> 02:11:35,600
I think there are ways it you might know more than me. I know you can chew up a cell like run up cells and look at the entire Miranda Transcriptome.

1293
02:11:36,020 --> 02:11:42,800
But I think there's also ways, you're right, that you can look at like like specific sets of ah yes, non non-coding areas.

1294
02:11:42,860 --> 02:11:47,310
I think that's done on bulk RNA like just grinding up the tissue and looking at the RNA content.

1295
02:11:47,330 --> 02:11:52,710
I don't know that there's a way of doing that in a location like with spatial transcriptome.

1296
02:11:52,790 --> 02:11:57,140
Like the whole thing with spatial transcriptomics. Mm hmm. It's basically RNA seq.

1297
02:11:57,320 --> 02:12:03,770
Mm hmm. But you're adding a location component to it because you're tying it to where the expression is in the tissue.

1298
02:12:04,010 --> 02:12:08,989
Right. Yeah. And you're just doing tissue slices and then seeing it online, which is super cool,

1299
02:12:08,990 --> 02:12:15,049
because I might I should throw a first line in it that I'll be honest and appreciate to our class.

1300
02:12:15,050 --> 02:12:18,590
But it's an interesting insight.

1301
02:12:19,030 --> 02:12:22,430
Thank you. Sure. No, it is. I'll turn off the light.

1302
02:12:23,110 --> 02:12:26,140
All right. Yeah, I'm good.

1303
02:12:26,170 --> 02:12:31,410
I'm going to go back on, though. We are not having that at major that we now.

1304
02:12:31,430 --> 02:12:36,409
We are not. I'm sorry. I was last, but the last one. I know you had a great show.

1305
02:12:36,410 --> 02:12:40,520
Generally Jet, get ready for that. He had to make that measurement team.

1306
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:44,350
He's really handy for me. Yeah. Yeah.

1307
02:12:45,080 --> 02:12:51,470
If you have any feedback or any suggestions or any of the central things you want to see for the program, we'd love to hear everything.

1308
02:12:51,830 --> 02:12:58,100
Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Were you able to contact your A.D. or.

1309
02:12:58,160 --> 02:13:04,410
Yeah, I'm ready to go. Oh, okay. I don't know. You do need to match me with that.

1310
02:13:05,120 --> 02:13:08,840
I don't. I was just by serendipity that we had those similar interests.

1311
02:13:09,290 --> 02:13:14,620
Interesting. But I'm glad it worked out. Hopefully it was okay for you to hear from me.

1312
02:13:14,850 --> 02:13:18,570
I'm just curious about that. Yeah. Yeah.

1313
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:25,110
I'm sorry. We could. We can also match you with, like, additional students and, you know, and everything like that.

1314
02:13:25,460 --> 02:13:30,620
Yeah. Just participate through this program. Mm hmm. And now, thank you again for your participation.

1315
02:13:30,830 --> 02:13:35,380
We realize that. Yeah.

1316
02:13:36,080 --> 02:13:39,610
Yeah, because I think the whole department wants to make that the norm.

1317
02:13:39,940 --> 02:13:46,180
So the new standard for when people come into the room. Yeah, it's good for the community, obviously.

1318
02:13:46,300 --> 02:13:55,810
Yeah, exactly. And then you get the experience put on your resume and you read a lot of the stories and what's the what's your future plan?

1319
02:13:56,200 --> 02:14:01,390
I think a lot of do you are you going to go into IBM as a player?

1320
02:14:01,730 --> 02:14:05,290
But they are doing it right now. This year. This year? I think so.

1321
02:14:05,560 --> 02:14:09,320
Do you have any skills to be a player? Yeah, I'm trying to apply here now.

1322
02:14:09,780 --> 02:14:14,800
Hopefully, I don't know if I'm going to do toxicology. I was supposed to do cellular and molecular pathology.

1323
02:14:14,850 --> 02:14:18,180
Oh, that's is not the issue. That's medical school. Yeah, that's a medical school.

1324
02:14:18,280 --> 02:14:21,890
Yeah, because I'm like, really interested in, like, what she was talking about, like transcriptomics and those.

1325
02:14:21,910 --> 02:14:26,890
The spatial side. Yeah. What are you planning to do for if you had a Ph.D.?

1326
02:14:26,920 --> 02:14:31,600
Yeah. I'm still like, say here especially.

1327
02:14:32,080 --> 02:14:35,590
Especially because hear that I'm doing something about area.

1328
02:14:36,340 --> 02:14:39,350
Oh, okay. So it's still toxicology for the toxicology part.

1329
02:14:39,370 --> 02:14:46,920
That's cool. Exposure and the parents and it's very cool with with the people that were in here maybe be today.

1330
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:53,500
Okay. Does she do research? I thought she was only her working group that did the research nowadays.

1331
02:14:54,280 --> 02:14:58,780
Or maybe I don't know. She just so. Yeah, that was like I thought she was like.

1332
02:15:00,010 --> 02:15:03,549
Yeah, that's cool. That ah.

1333
02:15:03,550 --> 02:15:08,800
You find that other schools are just trying to get into here here at Duke University.

1334
02:15:08,820 --> 02:15:12,639
You do have area schools. Yeah. Like Duke John Hopkins and that was good.

1335
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:20,260
That yeah. It, it, it, it, I think you'll get it exactly as I think you have because it was just like out of my knowledge.

1336
02:15:20,260 --> 02:15:24,610
I mean, I'm really excited to hear about yourself.

1337
02:15:24,630 --> 02:15:27,820
Yeah. Now I finish. I love. I love hearing what you have to say, too.

1338
02:15:27,820 --> 02:15:31,280
It's it's also good to, like, get a better understanding of what everybody's doing in the whole field.

1339
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:37,479
So that's interesting. I was curious. Wait, so do does it have like a good toxicology program?

1340
02:15:37,480 --> 02:15:42,940
Do they have a company called Education Program?

1341
02:15:43,010 --> 02:15:49,030
Okay. But it's not with a benefit. I don't know. But yeah, she went to do okay interesting.

1342
02:15:49,690 --> 02:15:58,630
She's she's graduate from Harvard for I guess my student master class is in Duke.

1343
02:15:58,900 --> 02:16:04,180
Oh, that's impressive. Have you already started your application?

1344
02:16:04,180 --> 02:16:11,079
Like I got a recommendation. I was. I'm still writing. I haven't really read almost that except for the recommendation.

1345
02:16:11,080 --> 02:16:15,490
And waiting for the recommendation that was. Yeah. Oh you already got your whole essay done there.

1346
02:16:16,150 --> 02:16:19,990
Yeah. Right. That's impressive because I applied it about.

1347
02:16:20,860 --> 02:16:24,720
Oh, okay. So you already knew what you're going to do. Yeah. And to have a go to.

1348
02:16:25,390 --> 02:16:28,480
That's impressive. That's impressive. Yeah. So still writing is that the whole point. Yeah.

1349
02:16:28,900 --> 02:16:33,400
Well, ah, um, there's like priority deadlines. Some first, December 1st.

1355
02:16:56,200 --> 02:16:59,830
Yeah, that's going to help you cook something. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1356
02:16:59,870 --> 02:17:07,149
I actually appreciate that. We do. And if people are interested, are you going to go to Arianna's bonfire tomorrow?

1357
02:17:07,150 --> 02:17:10,540
I think she's, like, inviting the environment, but I don't.

1358
02:17:10,540 --> 02:17:13,540
I don't know that that's. She did.

1359
02:17:13,540 --> 02:17:17,169
She sent you? Uh, she didn't.

1360
02:17:17,170 --> 02:17:22,209
I don't know. I'm not sure, but I just heard people, and she was, like, telling us about it.

1361
02:17:22,210 --> 02:17:26,190
But if you're interested, you can. Yeah, yeah. Thank you for that.

1362
02:17:26,480 --> 02:17:30,430
I'll send you the address. I think it's in the group. Me too. I think she sent it in the group.

1363
02:17:30,850 --> 02:17:34,089
Are you over me? Oh, the idea of. Great.

1364
02:17:34,090 --> 02:17:38,889
So what's your. What's your phone number? I don't know if I have your phone number.

1365
02:17:38,890 --> 02:17:43,450
I have everybody's group B, but not phone numbers group for me.

1366
02:17:43,660 --> 02:17:48,930
I don't have you have that. Oh, oh it's just like a group chat and.

1367
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:52,120
Ah no. By the way, are you thinking about human genetics this semester.

1368
02:17:52,130 --> 02:18:01,030
Are you taking the biochemistry chemistry? Is it interesting that you guys are?

1369
02:18:01,210 --> 02:18:06,820
They're all like, um, chemistry majors, students, and they'll be one of the agents.

1370
02:18:06,850 --> 02:18:09,850
Get in there. Oh, no. So I heard you in chemistry.

1371
02:18:09,850 --> 02:18:13,600
I'm sorry. Human genetics is not that interesting either. Human genetics.

1372
02:18:13,930 --> 02:18:24,430
541 Yeah, but we took cell biology together and that was pretty interesting is that it does,

1373
02:18:24,430 --> 02:18:28,989
does a lot of fun cause I was very they had like 12 different instructors.

1374
02:18:28,990 --> 02:18:32,260
Yeah. If you want to fit your kind of analysis. Thank you.

1375
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:39,010
I'm surprised I was, you know. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'll probably just give them the message.

1376
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:42,980
That's your letter. Oh, you send the invitation.

1377
02:18:43,010 --> 02:18:47,680
That's the way we get it. But, yes, we were admitted to the program.

1378
02:18:47,830 --> 02:18:51,490
Oh, well, I think I just sent it to email. Or maybe I would like that.

1379
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:54,850
I didn't know anybody. I didn't know. I don't even know that Gmail because.

1380
02:18:55,060 --> 02:18:59,740
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I. I tried. I didn't have access to the Gmail.

1381
02:19:00,190 --> 02:19:04,490
Yeah, I know. So.

1382
02:19:04,860 --> 02:19:08,640
Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. I'll send you the details.

1383
02:19:09,690 --> 02:19:17,580
Awesome. Well, do you have any plans for the weekend, or are you just going to work on this if you have some homework to do?

1384
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:20,780
How did you. How was the tough stuff?

1385
02:19:20,780 --> 02:19:23,940
Because I was too busy, like 17th last week to write.

1386
02:19:24,780 --> 02:19:28,470
You mean that these little things? Yeah. That the quiz. Did you take it?

1387
02:19:28,740 --> 02:19:32,010
Yeah, I think it's already quite straightforward.

1388
02:19:32,060 --> 02:19:36,810
Obviously reduce it. Other things.

1389
02:19:36,870 --> 02:19:40,470
Oh yes. There's a lot of open ended as it as. No worries.

1390
02:19:40,740 --> 02:19:44,430
Okay. I was concerned. It was like that in the exam, which is very long.

1391
02:19:45,960 --> 02:19:49,380
Yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah, I think we can.

1392
02:26:37,110 --> 02:28:41,220
Hmm. Oh.

1393
02:57:02,050 --> 02:57:02,410
Now.
