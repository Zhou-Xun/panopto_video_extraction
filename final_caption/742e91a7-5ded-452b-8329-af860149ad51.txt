1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:07,650
What do you make of this lawsuit on the other side?

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,450
Good afternoon, everybody. Could you. I'll do it today.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,390
You guys hanging in there? All right.

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,290
So a couple of things, I guess, before we start today.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,190
The first problem said problems. That one they've opened up.

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:37,830
You should be able to see that. And you had to go along with that.

7
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,750
You are going to need to put yourself in a group. Right.

8
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:52,170
So if you go to the people's and you're over on canvas and click on the project groups, you should see something like this.

9
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,310
Looks like some of you have got your stuff in there. That's great.

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:04,980
Three or four groups here and then a couple of here. So make sure you just put yourself in some group, even if you're going to work on your own.

11
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:13,710
You should get yourself into one of these empty groups at some point to that.

12
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,200
This is how canvas is going to grade those things.

13
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,540
There are only one of you in the group needs to turn it and how great it.

14
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,270
And then I'll give everybody in that group the same angry and.

15
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:40,550
There is also the integrity affidavit, which is right here.

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,040
You can find a link here or in the assignments tab.

17
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:53,640
You'll find it here as well. Most of you have done that, but there is there's a handful of you that still need to do that.

18
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,130
I appreciate if you do time as well.

19
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:16,790
Right. So the plan today is we're going to finish up that first module lecture a little bit more about virtual sites.

20
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:27,200
That's going to be important for your coming lab, which is the first one is going to be next Thursday.

21
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:37,650
And we'll probably take a break or so around that time, and then we'll come back and do module two,

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,540
which is more about the kind of the biology and the genetics we're going to be talking about this semester.

23
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:57,900
There's time. At the end, we get through that and I'll give you an opportunity to work on your problems at the end of the class.

24
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,310
I'm good. All right.

25
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:16,310
So last time we talked about, you know, kind of some of the definitions of epidemiology,

26
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:25,280
genetic epidemiology, and we talked about the history behind the the field.

27
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:35,630
Some of the omics which you talked about, genetic architecture, gave an ABC example there.

28
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,890
And then we started talking about kind of the different study designs.

29
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,280
So we had case control cohort, descriptive, analytic, quantitative, qualitative.

30
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,720
And this could all be done in unrelated and related individuals.

31
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:02,060
I think we get up to here, we're talking about related individuals.

32
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,260
You're going to have any questions about that stuff we talked about last time before we continue.

33
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,880
So are descriptive studies and related individuals.

34
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,740
We're really looking at the distribution of genetic traits or diseases in families.

35
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,790
So you could do case families versus control or you could do case families versus families in the general population.

36
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:45,560
You can also assess whether the disease occurs more often relatives of cases than relatives or controls.

37
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,780
So you might look at twins or siblings or parents in offspring.

38
00:04:50,930 --> 00:05:02,450
You can look at the correlation between those groups. So here is an example of a study, a qualitative study in twins.

39
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:11,660
So samples pretty small, 44 not divided diabetics do each had a minor.

40
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,930
They got a twin with type two diabetes.

41
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:23,240
So the study design here is they found twins where one twin had diabetes.

42
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,170
The other did not at the start of the study.

43
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:34,850
Then they followed them for up to eight years are up to 18 years actually with a mean of eight years.

44
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:46,010
And what they found was as time went by, the concordance of the two twins grew and grew.

45
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:52,040
So after one year, 17% were concordant.

46
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:59,630
After ten years, 57%. And after 15 years, follow up 76%.

47
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:16,070
Okay. So even though they started off discordant as twins, three quarters of them ended up being discordant after 15 years.

48
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:26,510
Right. So obviously, that implies that there's a pretty strong genetic component to type two diabetes.

49
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,440
However, it doesn't mean it's all genetic.

50
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:39,260
Obviously, there's an environment here as well. They weren't 100% important.

51
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,540
These are mine was I got a glimpse of an identical genetics.

52
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,740
Right. So the environment must be playing a part here as well.

53
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,570
All right. Here's another example.

54
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,969
This one, two nuclear families in the frame.

55
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:14,560
It did Framingham Heart Study. It looked at 1300 nuclear families and their offspring, 216 of them had type two diabetes.

56
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:23,500
And so what they were really looking at here was if you had a parent with type two diabetes,

57
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:30,220
what was the risk to the child initially developing Type two diabetes?

58
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:43,990
Okay. And it turns out if your mother was affected, then you had a 3.4 odds ratio.

59
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:57,260
So you had a 3.4 times higher likelihood of developing type two diabetes if your mother was, in fact, similar, if your father was affected 3.5.

60
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:12,740
But if both parents were affected, that jumps up to 6.1 out of 500 over 500% increased chance of developing type two diabetes.

61
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:18,320
If both your parents also had it. Right.

62
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,350
So again, there's a pretty clear genetic component here that must be play.

63
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:28,790
All right.

64
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:39,500
Now, for analytic analytic studies in related individuals, you're really trying to assess the risk factors that may cause this familial aggregation.

65
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,820
You want to identify those specific genetic mechanisms in those families.

66
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,730
You could certainly also perform any of the studies we discussed in the unrelated samples,

67
00:08:50,720 --> 00:09:00,440
but you would have to employ special analytical techniques because the individuals are not independent.

68
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,730
Right. They're related to each other.

69
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:10,670
You have to use some kind of statistical technique there where you might use random effects or something like that in family groups that make sense.

70
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,070
This comes. Q And as as my framework.

71
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:27,260
This is really just a good way to think about your studies, a good way to think through them.

72
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,380
If you take 515, this is probably review. How many of you did take 515?

73
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,630
Just a handful, huh? All right. Well, that's okay.

74
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,780
Um, well, we'll review a lot of the things that were in 515, but going in a little more detail on them.

75
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,290
Anyway, this this framework is just a good way to think through your studies.

76
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,749
So you need to start with a question, obviously, and then genetics.

77
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,579
You're going to decide whether to focus on specific traits or diseases and then

78
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:08,860
develop genetic questions around that or focus on the genotypes of the genes,

79
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,430
develop questions for different traits or diseases around that.

80
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,000
Once you get your question, you need to figure out which measures are going to be.

81
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:33,650
So you need to find the trace of disease of interest, as well as any demographic characteristics, covariates and any possible environmental factors.

82
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,030
Of course, you also need your genome types, if that's part of your question.

83
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:48,590
Then you can decide on a relevant sample for that question.

84
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:58,370
And there's many possibilities, as can tend on what your question is, but it could be inter-related, related individuals or unrelated.

85
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:08,640
So you have to decide that from your question. Then you need to figure out your analytical approach.

86
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,610
And again, that depends on your question as well as your measures in your sample.

87
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,170
So are you going to do models? Are you going to look more descriptively?

88
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:28,290
And then finally, you can make inferences from your from your analysis.

89
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:38,850
And those inferences obviously are going to depend on everything above. So this is a good way to think through your study.

90
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,980
You need all these elements and you need them to align. That's that's the tricky part.

91
00:11:53,190 --> 00:12:03,120
Alzheimer's disease is a very well-studied disease, which we'll talk about a fair amount in this course as well.

92
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:12,690
And it's interesting from a genetic standpoint, because there is there's a pretty strong genetic element to this disease.

93
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:18,480
Alzheimer's is a type of dementia that causes problems with memory.

94
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:26,730
Thinking of behavior and symptoms are usually developed slowly and get worse over time.

95
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:35,480
It does account for a high proportion of dementia cases. Something like at least it's a quarter.

96
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:48,090
So you've got a lot of Americans, 5.2 million that had dementia in 2014.

97
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:56,610
And that number has been growing since then. And early onset is is also an issue.

98
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:03,360
Early onset is those dementias that occur before age 65.

99
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:12,160
It's the sixth leading cause of death in the country. The only cause of death among the top ten in the U.S. not currently being prevented.

100
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:30,250
So it's a pretty serious problem. From a health standpoint, from an epidemiologic standpoint, the genetics of Alzheimer's is interesting as well.

101
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:42,130
There's deterministic genes that actually cause at least the early onset version of dementia, of Alzheimer's dementia.

102
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:48,190
There are kind of two forms of Alzheimer's.

103
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:53,140
You've got this early onset and late onset while they're the same disease.

104
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:59,140
You're almost like two separate phenotypes.

105
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:11,860
The early onset can be determined from these genes you see here the amyloid precursor protein,

106
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:20,080
or if you had mutations in the present one or two, if you actually cause that early onset form of the disease.

107
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,880
But there's also susceptibility genes, the primary culprit being able to be very well studying gene.

108
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,420
This is a gene that codes for apolo protein.

109
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:59,230
E Apolo proteins are these these proteins which kind of attach themselves to lipids and that kind of our what's the lipids transport among ourselves.

110
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,140
So that's kind of their function.

111
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:12,820
There are several genes that have been have been identified with Alzheimer's, but Applebees is the big one and always pops up over and over again.

112
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:23,800
There's actually three major isoforms of every genes.

113
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:32,070
Epsilon four. They call. They call. It is the major risk, Leon,

114
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:46,570
for Alzheimer's and actually may be a factor in about a quarter of all dementia of Alzheimer's cases does act in a dose response manner.

115
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,590
So that means, obviously, you have one.

116
00:15:52,330 --> 00:16:01,540
One Leo from your mom and one from your dad. Right. So if you have one set, your risk is increased.

117
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,770
But if you have two sets, it's increased even further. So there's the dose response there.

118
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,260
It may also affect the actual age of onset Alzheimer's.

119
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:20,350
So if you had this particular isoform the age of people, Gene, you're more likely to develop Alzheimer's earlier.

120
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:26,319
Yes. Kind of going on a tangent just because you were talking about I was just like

121
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,050
a while ago there was a article about fraud from University of Minnesota.

122
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:36,220
I'm not sure if you're aware of like a protein the identified called amyloid beta.

123
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,700
I think that's actually not true.

124
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:46,960
And Alzheimer's, I'm just wondering because I think when they called it fraud, they were saying the Western blot had a problem with it.

125
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:56,740
But if that's something that's also confirmed or like on their chat experience, I am not sure about that.

126
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,379
I just thought it'd be cool to see if like, like any sort of like g laws or something can actually show if that thing like

127
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,220
whatever gene that's coding for that protein actually exists in Alzheimer's or not.

128
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:16,719
Oh yeah, I know. That's certainly very interesting. I'm not familiar enough with the like in the article.

129
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,770
It is it was a big amyloid beta.

130
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:26,200
It was like a certain form of amyloid beta, like a bunch that are implicated.

131
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,830
So I think. Oh, really? Yeah. Well, that's very interesting.

132
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:42,129
It was cool because someone was like there was a fraud. Well, you know that that does happen in science now and then, unfortunately, um, you know,

133
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,820
there, there's certainly an element of trust that happens when we were doing these studies.

134
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:52,420
You have to, you have to rely on the person not to make things up with their data.

135
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,610
You have to rely that they're doing things appropriately.

136
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,790
So unfortunately, these things happen. Anything else?

137
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:12,339
Yes, probably silly question about terminology, but how does one distinguish a deterministic and susceptibility gene?

138
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:19,329
Like I know in bacteria you can do mutations in confrontation and with the presence absence of a gene, for instance.

139
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:30,100
But in human populations like what is how can a scientist be confident in a gene variance being deterministic or susceptibility or there yeah.

140
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,820
When we're talking about it here, at least for this class,

141
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:41,440
the deterministic ones are really genes that have these variants that actually cause the disease directly,

142
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:55,750
their dread causes where in a susceptibility gene you have some variant, but it doesn't necessarily cause it, it just increases your risk.

143
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:01,420
So that's really the distinction we're making here. And.

144
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:15,120
The questions. And to say that a gene is deterministic, you have to know how exactly it is.

145
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:26,809
That's a very good question. Well I think yeah.

146
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:37,790
To finally to fully understand how that is, is deterministic, you'd have to know the functionality of that chain just to understand how it's working.

147
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:44,900
So, yes, it's a yes. So it's not enough to just be like, Oh, we have five cases and all of them have this chain.

148
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:54,560
Right. And that's. That's not gonna make it. Yeah. Well, first of all, because if it's even out with Alzheimer's,

149
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:00,560
but if it's something that's rare, you could have five cases and they all have this gene.

150
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,730
But that doesn't that's maybe not sufficient.

151
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:10,040
Right. Because of the disease, because we all have.

152
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,970
It might be necessary, but not sufficient. That makes sense.

153
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,920
Yep. Right.

154
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:28,280
It's kind of a picture of the actual APOE gene.

155
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:41,570
It's on chromosome 19, and there's kind of this two piece structure, the sort of the apelin protein.

156
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,680
There's a receptor binding portion there, an Olympic binding portion.

157
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:55,220
And the key part here is that there's these two locations, these two amino acid locations here.

158
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,210
112 and this 158.

159
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:13,340
And the differences in how those are coded, either as teams or Artemis margins, determine that your isoform of that, it will be the gene.

160
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:27,350
Okay. If you have a system on both of them and you have the Isoform to Epsilon two, you might just call it papery two.

161
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:40,940
And if you have this particular form, it actually lowers your risk of of Alzheimer's.

162
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,600
However, this isoform is very rare. Some not very many people have this one.

163
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:57,440
Most people have a protein three, which is a 16 on the 112 location and R.G. 158.

164
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:10,460
Most people have that as kind of neutral, and those with every four and Epsilon four I support have an arginine complications.

165
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,270
This is the one that's going to increase your risk.

166
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:28,010
Makes sense, everyone. Why is there no arginine?

167
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:34,480
One, 12 and 16 and 158. That's the. I guess that would be the opposing one.

168
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:43,130
The other possible combination. Right. Well, it turns out people don't really get that version.

169
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:54,140
So while it technically might be a possible isoform doesn't really exist in any meaningful way.

170
00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:03,440
Okay. So let's talk about a couple different studies here for Alzheimer's.

171
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:12,290
For this example, it was looking at the familial aggregation of Alzheimer's,

172
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:19,430
which just means the question is, do first degree relatives of those with Alzheimer's?

173
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:26,240
Are they at higher risk and those without a first degree relative in Alzheimer's?

174
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:38,480
So the findings are summarized in this nice little chart here, the dark squares.

175
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:47,140
That's your accumulative risk if you have a first degree relative with Alzheimer's.

176
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,990
And little white circles. There are your cumulative risk.

177
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,560
If you don't have a first degree relative with Alzheimer's.

178
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:07,130
So it's pretty significant here. And I say that for those with a first degree relative that has Alzheimer's,

179
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:18,680
probably about 30% or so also develop Alzheimer's by age 85, where that number is more like 10%.

180
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:34,420
Okay. Here's another example candidate gene setting comparing cases and controls.

181
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,790
Questioning is a frequency of HPV epsilon four higher in those infected with a CD than those unaffected.

182
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:54,160
And the findings here were that the risk for having Alzheimer's increased from 20 to 90%

183
00:24:54,460 --> 00:25:00,940
with an in the number of people we applied for alleles again and this is dose response.

184
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:11,800
So you can have zero one or two. And also the mean age of onset decreased from 84 to 68 years with those increasing o'neills as well.

185
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:25,130
So that's. Yes. So I just kind of went back to deterministic versus susceptibility genes in this case that it really is up to 90%,

186
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,490
like, I guess deterministic of developing Alzheimer's.

187
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:35,629
But then because it's I mean, it's not guaranteed, but the odds are so high that still technically a susceptibility gene.

188
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:43,100
And then if so, are there any genes that are actually deterministic or is that just always going to be really, really high that never guaranteed?

189
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:54,320
Know that's a very good question. And I would say because it isn't guaranteed and it's not technically deterministic,

190
00:25:54,830 --> 00:26:01,380
you can say something's I guess you could say something is near deterministic like it is.

191
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:08,110
In this case, in fact, it's near deterministic by age 80.

192
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,920
That's that's the 90% that the paper is talking about here.

193
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:20,450
But it's still out there. So it's still susceptibility, but it's very high susceptibility.

194
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:27,750
And. Right.

195
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:39,040
In this study, they did a device for Alzheimer's.

196
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:53,470
They had 17,000 Alzheimer's cases and 37,000 controls in stage one and then more stage two.

197
00:26:54,100 --> 00:27:00,310
They did measure across the genome, which included more than 7 million steps.

198
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:13,210
And they found 19 loci that reached genome wide significance, which is AP less than 5.5 times ten, you might see.

199
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:24,880
These were the results of that here. So this is what's known as a manhattan plot.

200
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,080
And you've seen these before? We've all seen these.

201
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:42,819
Most of you. A couple of notes. That's all right. Basically, the idea here is that each one of these dots represents a snip along the bottom.

202
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:52,270
You've got them all ordered in chromosome order, and on the Y axis you've got the minus log10 p value.

203
00:27:54,610 --> 00:28:01,720
So the higher you are on that on the y axis, the more significant the result.

204
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:14,140
Okay. So there's something around here would be a p value of like one times heading to the -40.

205
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:25,180
And so what we see in this thing now is that there's this huge big spike right at any point.

206
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,340
All these snips are right around that.

207
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:39,309
Oishi You've also got this been one.

208
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:42,400
This is another big, big one that comes up a lot.

209
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:47,530
You can see there's several others as well. See our one clue.

210
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:57,190
So on ABC7 is an interesting one that happens to be the strongest the strongest one after it when we non-African-Americans

211
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:06,310
this particular device was found in European ancestry for African-Americans this ABC in seven is a very important.

212
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:22,790
All right. Another interesting phenotype is height.

213
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,700
It's interesting because it's behaves nicely.

214
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:33,080
If you're normally distributed, it's easy to measure.

215
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:39,080
It's very familial, but it's also very complex.

216
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,690
There's not one gene in one location nor genome.

217
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:52,090
That's that's determining your height, right?

218
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,620
It's many, many areas along the genome.

219
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,070
So in this little chart here, we've got a couple of studies.

220
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:07,690
First one, which was done in Finland is on twins.

221
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,030
You've got another one, Norway,

222
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:17,620
which just looks at siblings and they're just looking at the correlation amongst the heights of those twins, their siblings.

223
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,419
Okay. You've got 91% correlation between moms.

224
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:29,980
They got it. Males, 51% between days I got two males and so on.

225
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,670
So looking at this, do you think height seems to be primarily genetic or environment?

226
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:53,810
You say? Yes, it looks to be genetic.

227
00:30:55,070 --> 00:31:04,640
Now, why do you say that? Because the in the manner psychotic twins, you see really high correlation.

228
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:11,130
And then compared to the guys I got it.

229
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:14,420
Males or guys I got twins.

230
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:21,079
And then in addition for the guys, I'd attack siblings and then the brother, brother, sister, sister.

231
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:26,930
You see about point five correlation, which is about what we would expect. Yeah, yeah, that's exactly right.

232
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:37,420
Yeah. We've got very high correlation between amount of psychotic twins and roughly half of that for other siblings.

233
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:42,890
Right. So that's very suggestive of a strong genetic component.

234
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,710
Does it mean there isn't any environment? Well, no.

235
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:56,520
If there was no environment in which it is maybe twins 100%.

236
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:00,410
Okay. So there's some environment there.

237
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:11,150
Does it heritability of might appear to be different by sex. We've got that.

238
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:23,560
Not really. Not really. Why do you say that?

239
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:30,550
You just look at each pair of like I would die psychotic males.

240
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:34,590
I mean, that's lot of psychotic males. Females.

241
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,020
It looks pretty similar. Yeah, 91 versus 87.

242
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:42,980
And you do the comparison for the other. You do that for the days. Got it. You got 15, 15.

243
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:47,260
You do. For regular siblings, you get 47 versus 46.

244
00:32:49,680 --> 00:33:00,130
Yeah. It seems like maybe for some reason females have slightly less correlation there, but it's not much of a difference.

245
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:04,170
Right? And if anything, probably not statistically difference.

246
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:10,950
Right. So yeah, it doesn't look like it probably differs by sex.

247
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:23,830
It makes sense to everybody. If you do a genius on height.

248
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:32,950
Here's an example. This was a fairly large study.

249
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:41,020
253,000 was a sample across 79 different studies of European ancestry.

250
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:49,270
They found 423 loci that were influencing adult height.

251
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:58,000
It's quite a lot and a lot which attests to the complexity of this particular phenotype.

252
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:04,150
It was enriched for genes involved in growth related processes. That makes sense.

253
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:14,830
But what's interesting here is those 423 loci were explaining only 6% of the total variance in height.

254
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:24,340
And if you measure the heritability, it's being approximate to be around 0.8 for height.

255
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:32,320
These these found loci. This partner of 23 explain only 20% of that heritability.

256
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,490
So what's going on? Why would that be?

257
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:49,910
Where is the rest of the heritability? Anybody have any ideas?

258
00:34:51,530 --> 00:35:07,990
And this might happen. Yes.

259
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:13,120
You didn't sequence every single location in the genome?

260
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:17,710
Maybe. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. This wasn't.

261
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:25,750
This wasn't from sequence data. This was from a regular device chip data.

262
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,940
So they didn't measure every single snap. It's absolutely true.

263
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:36,700
Yeah. So there might be some snaps, some unmeasured snaps that are also playing a part.

264
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,560
That could be one factor. Anything else?

265
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:49,390
Yeah. I was thinking there might be a lot of loci that cumulatively contribute a lot,

266
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:55,900
but don't on their own reached like a threshold for what they consider influencing the height.

267
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,590
Yeah, that's a great point. These 423 reached significance, right?

268
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:04,300
But there might be a lot more that don't quite reach that.

269
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:12,130
Or maybe they're not even that close to significant, but they do play a little bit of a part.

270
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:18,850
Right. So cumulatively, they may be playing a rather large part.

271
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:29,650
That's a good point. And the next slide will talk more about what does it mean by enriched for genes involved in related processes.

272
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:39,460
Yeah. So a lot of times what we do after we find these snaps of these loci,

273
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:52,150
we'll see if those those particular loci are showing up in genes more often than expected.

274
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,500
Right. So these particular which show up in growth related process genes more often than expected.

275
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:04,630
So that makes sense. Yeah. Yes. Is there a project Ping,

276
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:11,950
where they kind of address the missing heritability idea of like you have to super important genes that explain a little bit of the heritability.

277
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:18,370
A bunch of like not super important genes that explain the rest of it. We can't find the not very important genes.

278
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:24,130
Yeah, I'm not familiar with the paper, but yes, that certainly makes sense.

279
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:32,360
Yeah. Yes.

280
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:36,950
There was an FBI genetic component for Gene. Oh, yes.

281
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:43,100
That's that's another excellent point. Genomics or epigenetics may be playing a part here.

282
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:53,210
Epigenetics are kind of what regulates the genome is going to tell how genes are turned on and off.

283
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,970
Right. That could be playing a part.

284
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:06,140
There could also be some kind of interaction with some kind of gene environment interaction or the utility as well.

285
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:17,570
Okay. So these are all excellent reasons why you might be missing some of the heritability which is summarized here a little bit.

286
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:28,620
So going back to the point where there might be little bits that are accumulating.

287
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,770
If you actually use all 1.8 million snaps and have Map three reference panel,

288
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:42,930
you can actually explain up to 50% of the total variance and about 62% of the heritability.

289
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:47,400
So much better. Much better.

290
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,550
But there's still a pretty good chunk there that's missing. So that's going to be due to these other factors we discussed.

291
00:38:55,620 --> 00:39:04,410
We talked about the environment, interaction, genetics. Rare variants are another possibility that could be causing this issue.

292
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:14,880
So these are rare variants. Remember, are those with those snips with minor little frequency less than 1% or so.

293
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:29,130
So because they're rare, we may have not measured any big differences between those with the risk level and those without.

294
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:35,480
And yes, I think I'm a little confused about the definition of heritability.

295
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:43,220
I've always thought heritability is present variance explained by the coefficients ordered like.

296
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:48,540
So it's the proportion of variance explained due to genetics.

297
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:54,180
So what it's like, what is the difference between the number of 50% and 62.5?

298
00:39:55,620 --> 00:40:02,130
So, yes, so there's there's a total variance, right?

299
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:06,270
And then there's a portion of that variance that's explained by genetics.

300
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,730
Right. So you should think of it like this.

301
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:19,380
We've got variance that's due to genetics, you've got variance that's due to environment.

302
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:24,000
And the sum of those is the total variance. Right.

303
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:34,340
So if you just look at the amount of variance explained by these loci and divided by the total, you're getting to 50%.

304
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:45,990
But if you divide it by that, by the genetic portion of that and it's 62, an EPS that makes sense at different denominators here.

305
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,610
Yes. And you say then how is heritability calculated?

306
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:03,000
How is it calculated? Well, we're going to talk a lot more about that later. But you can do it with family studies.

307
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:12,149
You can look at kind of way the diseases and particular loci are are are going together.

308
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:21,930
So you can use linkage to that. You can also do you can also do it in unrelated individuals as long as you have a computing power to do it.

309
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:29,970
But it's a little more complicated that way. We'll talk more about it later in class.

310
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,940
The questions here. Right.

311
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:46,960
So that's that's the end of our first module there.

312
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:58,840
So the next thing on the agenda is virtual sites.

313
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,030
So this is really going to be important for us in doing our labs.

314
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,760
So I have here on campus, there's a link to some slides here.

315
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,630
It's just very brief, but I want to make sure I go over it. I want to understand Skip's just closing.

316
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:30,920
That. Okay.

317
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,690
So anybody tried to try to do this yet?

318
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,820
Anybody who's been on virtual sites before. Would you have an emergency?

319
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:47,410
It has changed recently. So that's got got me.

320
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:55,920
Little kids as well. It seems to be working quite well and much easier than it was before.

321
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:11,310
So the easiest thing to do is just follow this link and download the virtual site's desktop client.

322
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:20,100
You can do this for Windows or for Mac and you can just follow the directions around that link.

323
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:32,759
It's pretty similar to standard download. It will be a bit like an installation wizard that opens up when you click on

324
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:40,680
the file you download and you have to sign in with your Ubuntu credentials.

325
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:51,780
And it's pretty simple. So when you actually do log in, this is going to open up a remote desktop window.

326
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,580
And in that window,

327
00:43:53,580 --> 00:44:03,810
you have a list of all the available software that you can then run those programs directly from the window as if they were on your local machine,

328
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:18,239
which is pretty nice. Now, if you're really used to that kind of the old way that was before this update, you can also click on in that window.

329
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:26,040
There's an icon for the Voice GPG desktop. If you click on that, that will open up a whole new virtual desktop.

330
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,880
This is kind of how it worked before or when you log into virtual sites,

331
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:35,309
you can come up and do like a remote computer which will be completely separate.

332
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:43,950
And you you've run everything from there. So you can still do that through this particular version of this desktop.

333
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,450
All the programs in that case will be on the start in the start menu.

334
00:44:54,210 --> 00:45:02,970
The only reason I'm I'm thinking to do that right now is if well, if you're just more comfortable doing it that way.

335
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:09,120
But also one of our programs that I noticed wasn't showing up in the window.

336
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,830
I mean, the remote desktop window for one reason.

337
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:18,690
When I logged onto the GPU desktop, it was it was there.

338
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:24,360
So we may have to work around that when we start use an app that's later in the semester.

339
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:30,030
I see if I can get them to put it on that remote stop window as well.

340
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:36,260
And either way, it's there. And we can still we can still use it in our work.

341
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:45,290
I also recommend that you set up storage for use on virtual sites.

342
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,490
If you haven't done this before, you should definitely do this.

343
00:45:53,380 --> 00:46:02,540
You go to this Cuomo website, you can log on with your unique name and password and authorize the cloud service of your choice.

344
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,270
So you've got a Google drive that comes with your email, right?

345
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:12,590
You might also have Dropbox.

346
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:24,860
And through them, both of those you can authorize to be used on virtual sites for the cloud service.

347
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,340
We should only have to do that once, once you authorize it. You shouldn't have to do it again.

348
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:41,350
If you're on the CPU desktop thing, that remote desktop, you'll really need that because you won't be able to save stuff otherwise.

349
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:47,680
Okay. So you need to set that up so that you can save things in that in that version.

350
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:58,870
When you do set it up and log on to the virtual desktop, you'll see your Google drive or your Dropbox,

351
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:04,000
whichever one you authorize as a as a little drive on the computer, an explorer.

352
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:12,350
And. If you are using the remote desktop window directly,

353
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:22,610
you may actually also be able to save and retrieve drives on your local computer and it will have a weird name.

354
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:31,460
So if you open up like an explorer, like you're trying to find a file, you would see your drives there and they'll be somewhere there,

355
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:43,160
like a weird desktop number and then the drive number or the scenery or whatever, whatever your drive letter is.

356
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:50,720
Right. And then there will be one that's just see, that's the virtual desktop version.

357
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:59,480
So if you want to say something locally, you should be able to find that little desktop number with your drive and save it to that location.

358
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:07,370
This is very new, so I'm hoping it works well.

359
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,640
I don't have any prior experience actually trying that, but it looks like it should work.

360
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:19,670
I have played around with a little bit. Looks like it should be able to say things directly to your local computer.

361
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:29,750
Okay. This is a list of all the programs that we're going to use at some point for the labs.

362
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,590
You can download these directly on your computer if you like to.

363
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:50,450
That being said, I do highly recommend virtual sites, mainly because it's always available and for troubleshooting purposes.

364
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:56,000
So if you're having trouble with the version that you're downloading directly on your computer,

365
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:03,590
it might be a little more tricky for me to troubleshoot those issues that you're having since every computer is different.

366
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:12,020
I'm not that familiar with Macs, for example, and so that'll be a little trickier to solve those issues.

367
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,040
But if you're using virtual sites, I should be able to help you.

368
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:24,530
So Plink and G playing are the main ones that we'll use throughout the course.

369
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:32,940
Apple Vue as well integrates with Blink, Blink Essential Program.

370
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:40,980
Blink is actually just a user interface for Blink, so link is a command learning program.

371
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:50,160
Benji playing will allow you to have dropped down menus and it's a nice nice user interface for that.

372
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:59,580
Apple view is something we'll use to look at LV and other other things.

373
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:09,120
It's also a nice way to open up some of the data files and you can use that with G Blink as well as G.

374
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,420
CTA is another program which I mentioned AR.

375
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:17,220
We will use briefly for one for one LAN later in the semester.

376
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:30,270
We're going to use it mainly through our studio studio and we may or may not use Quantum, which is a program that does some power analysis.

377
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:42,450
So these are links to all the sites where you could download these if you want, and I'll leave that part up to you.

378
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:55,460
Questions about any of that. I think it's a good start.

379
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:08,405
Good point to stop and take a break. Let's come in around 4:00 CNN last night.

380
00:51:12,001 --> 00:51:30,241
Started again here. Just plant the plates and different things for you to sort it out.

381
00:51:36,061 --> 00:51:46,081
All right. So we'll talk a little bit more about the biology here.

382
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:58,851
Show of hands. Many people read this chapter and knew most of what was in here is new.

383
00:51:59,081 --> 00:52:03,021
Okay. All right. So we'll go through this.

384
00:52:05,091 --> 00:52:10,941
This is what most partners should be review for a lot of you.

385
00:52:11,721 --> 00:52:15,771
And if you're finding it's not.

386
00:52:15,891 --> 00:52:20,031
There's definitely a lot of good resources for you.

387
00:52:20,421 --> 00:52:24,231
I listed some electronic books at the end of the syllabus.

388
00:52:25,401 --> 00:52:30,591
That would be helpful. And if you need more information on this particular type of material.

389
00:52:32,511 --> 00:52:38,781
If you're having trouble, just let me know. There's definitely resources out there for you to catch up.

390
00:52:42,171 --> 00:52:49,551
All right. So just a few key definitions here, Jeanne.

391
00:52:49,941 --> 00:52:54,231
While we've been talking about this line already, but the definition is evolving.

392
00:52:54,931 --> 00:53:01,491
But basically, it's a hereditary unit that produces some functional product, like a protein.

393
00:53:02,781 --> 00:53:16,671
And transcription is the synthesis of a single strand and RNA from a DNA template,

394
00:53:16,701 --> 00:53:22,071
from the sun nucleus it's supposed to use to catalyze or it's catalyzed by RNA polymerase.

395
00:53:24,471 --> 00:53:27,951
So this is the actual production of the messenger RNA.

396
00:53:29,781 --> 00:53:37,071
It's those are these proteins that the DNA kind of wraps around, organizes itself.

397
00:53:40,161 --> 00:53:43,461
You've got chromatids, chromatids your sister chromatids.

398
00:53:43,461 --> 00:53:53,801
These are two parallel strands of chromatin connected at the centromere and this constitutes the chromosome after DNA synthesis.

399
00:53:56,691 --> 00:54:00,531
Segregation is a disjunction of homologous chromosomes in meiosis.

400
00:54:03,651 --> 00:54:11,331
We've got homologs. These are pairs of chromosomes, one that's inherited from your mom, one from your dad.

401
00:54:11,511 --> 00:54:16,161
So you've got two, two chromosomes of each type, right?

402
00:54:16,701 --> 00:54:22,461
So those those matching pairs are called homologs or homologous chromosomes.

403
00:54:28,641 --> 00:54:36,351
Non disjunction is a failure of those homologous chromosomes where sister chromatids separate during meiosis.

404
00:54:37,551 --> 00:54:40,581
These are some of the key terms about pregnant.

405
00:54:45,191 --> 00:54:48,161
Here is your basic structure of DNA.

406
00:54:51,241 --> 00:55:01,021
So you got your basis adding thymine, guanine and cytosine that are attached to this sugar phosphate backbone here.

407
00:55:01,321 --> 00:55:14,101
So each each one of these little nucleotides consists of a five carbon sugar, which is obviously ribose and a phosphate group.

408
00:55:16,761 --> 00:55:29,480
Which is attached to it now. You can see from this picture here, we've got our our five carbon sugar phosphate, we've got our base.

409
00:55:29,481 --> 00:55:36,351
It's attached to the one prime carbon of that sugar is five.

410
00:55:36,351 --> 00:55:45,751
Carbons in the sugar are numbered one through five. All right.

411
00:55:45,781 --> 00:55:49,021
So we've got a couple of other interesting things.

412
00:55:49,141 --> 00:55:55,141
The A's always paired with T. We've got GS always paired with C.

413
00:55:58,431 --> 00:56:05,961
And another important aspect of this is that this strand can be read in two directions.

414
00:56:05,961 --> 00:56:11,001
So it can be read five prime to three prime, which is the typical way we do this,

415
00:56:12,531 --> 00:56:18,351
which basically just means reading five prime to three prime in this direction.

416
00:56:18,531 --> 00:56:25,791
Right. Or you can read it three prime to five and read this direction here.

417
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:35,581
To make sense. It's going to be important when we reference the actual sequence.

418
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:38,091
We need to know which direction we're talking about.

419
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:46,761
And so you want to designate when you're writing some kind of sequence, whether you're starting from the five prime end or the three pregnant.

420
00:56:51,111 --> 00:56:58,881
Okay. Here's another picture and it's related.

421
00:56:59,181 --> 00:57:10,581
That one, you've got your McHugh sugar phosphate backbones there with all your bases attached to make up your DNA strand.

422
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:15,561
You've got two of those strands which are matching together, right?

423
00:57:15,921 --> 00:57:32,331
Giudice and T to a the Jesus sees bond with three hydrogen bonds between them and the CS I'm sorry, the eyes on the TS on the two hydrogen bonds.

424
00:57:34,731 --> 00:57:41,181
So these base pairs match up together and form a form the two strands which make up the double helix.

425
00:57:49,531 --> 00:57:58,861
Requirements of shared material. So we need that this genetic material to replicate accurately during cell growth and duplication.

426
00:58:00,541 --> 00:58:03,931
We need to be sufficiently stable so that mutations are rare.

427
00:58:09,061 --> 00:58:13,201
We need them to have the potential to carry all kinds of necessary biological information.

428
00:58:14,761 --> 00:58:20,160
We need them to be the blueprints for the functioning of our body.

429
00:58:20,161 --> 00:58:27,781
Right. And we need to be able to have them be able to transmit biological information to the cell itself.

430
00:58:29,611 --> 00:58:35,941
So that's really the whole purpose of the of the genetic material itself.

431
00:58:38,971 --> 00:58:46,561
All right. So mitosis is the process of duplicating a cell in particular.

432
00:58:48,421 --> 00:58:55,471
You start with a diploid cell. Diploid, because it has two sets of chromosomes.

433
00:58:55,831 --> 00:58:59,310
One set from you got it from your mom and one from your dad.

434
00:58:59,311 --> 00:59:10,081
Right. It's deployed in humans. We have 23 x 22 what we call autism's and one pair of sex chromosomes.

435
00:59:12,121 --> 00:59:16,591
Mitosis actually occurs in somatic cell. So those in your general body.

436
00:59:18,001 --> 00:59:22,171
And it has a nice little sequence kind of designated in this picture here.

437
00:59:22,201 --> 00:59:33,781
So what's going to happen is the chromosomes are going to replicate themselves and then they'll all line up at the center in the metaphase there.

438
00:59:35,581 --> 00:59:41,521
And those sister chromatids, which are the replicates of each other,

439
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:48,361
will then get pulled apart opposite sides of the cell within the cleavage splits between them.

440
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:52,051
And you end up with two daughters cells which are identical to the original.

441
00:59:57,541 --> 01:00:01,651
Right. I've seen this before.

442
01:00:03,341 --> 01:00:10,501
Can't get. Meiosis is similar, but different.

443
01:00:10,511 --> 01:00:18,271
You start with a Diploid Cell again. But now we're actually creating four haploid daughter cells.

444
01:00:18,721 --> 01:00:23,521
So these are going to be your gametes, eggs of females and sperms of males.

445
01:00:25,141 --> 01:00:28,951
So in this case, you're starting with your your homologous chromosomes.

446
01:00:30,181 --> 01:00:36,091
So in this case, you might say this these pink ones are, let's say, chromosome one and two from mom.

447
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:47,481
And chromosome one and two from that. So then they kind of pair up as homologous pairs.

448
01:00:49,431 --> 01:00:53,541
And what's interesting here in meiosis is there can be a crossing over that occurs

449
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:58,911
between those homologous pairs where some of that genetic information is actually slight.

450
01:01:02,551 --> 01:01:11,281
Once that's allowed to happen, then those families homologous pairs gets pulled apart and separated into two cells.

451
01:01:15,481 --> 01:01:19,041
That's right. So that's the enemy. US is one,

452
01:01:19,881 --> 01:01:26,810
INEOS is two is it's more similar to mitosis where then you've got all your your chromosomes

453
01:01:26,811 --> 01:01:36,021
lining up with with each other in the center again and the the sister chromatids are

454
01:01:36,021 --> 01:01:45,531
pulled apart you absolute directions and you end up with four cells which this time are all

455
01:01:45,531 --> 01:01:51,861
genetically different because of that recombination that occurs over here in metaphase.

456
01:01:53,451 --> 01:01:57,291
I think it's making sense.

457
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:08,901
Seen this before too. Yet this is a little closer look at that recombination that occurs.

458
01:02:09,741 --> 01:02:15,501
So just another picture. So when they pair up with each other,

459
01:02:16,401 --> 01:02:21,021
you can actually add this crossing over here which forms this kaiama and then these

460
01:02:21,081 --> 01:02:25,041
two little bits on the end will actually get swapped and they're pulled apart.

461
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:35,141
You do have an average of about one of these recombination per chromosome?

462
01:02:35,311 --> 01:02:50,801
Ah, this varies quite a bit, but it's about one per chromosome arm, which means about two actually to 2 to 3 per chromosome.

463
01:02:50,891 --> 01:03:00,071
Terminus There's two arms here, right? You've got these two arms here that are kind of touching and you've got these two down here.

464
01:03:01,121 --> 01:03:05,741
So it's on average probably not two per chromosome uses.

465
01:03:08,021 --> 01:03:14,471
There are more of them that occur. Maternity and paternity summaries.

466
01:03:16,061 --> 01:03:22,551
And it occurs a little bit more often in the larger chromosomes than the smaller ones.

467
01:03:24,871 --> 01:03:35,091
There's there's definitely variance and how often this occurs. Mendel's laws.

468
01:03:36,231 --> 01:03:42,081
So if you haven't heard of these, there's these two laws the law of segregation and the law of independent assortment.

469
01:03:44,091 --> 01:03:50,631
The law of segregation has to do with deals at the same locus and when they're separate and during meiosis.

470
01:03:52,971 --> 01:03:58,791
So if there is no recombination that occurs, there, those levels at the same locus.

471
01:03:59,061 --> 01:04:03,141
The one from the ones that are going to separate during meiosis one.

472
01:04:06,461 --> 01:04:16,091
But if there is a recombination that occurs between the centromere and that locus, then they're not going to actually separate until meiosis two.

473
01:04:17,711 --> 01:04:27,021
This picture that makes my. There's a lot of independent assortment has to do with the labels at different loci.

474
01:04:28,961 --> 01:04:33,531
And basically the idea here is that if they're at different loci,

475
01:04:33,891 --> 01:04:39,291
they're sorted independently of each other, assuming they're not physically linked to each other.

476
01:04:41,901 --> 01:04:47,931
So all the appeals end up in different gametes independently of each other and randomly.

477
01:04:51,011 --> 01:04:54,821
Okay. Here's kind of a depiction of the law of segregation.

478
01:04:57,101 --> 01:05:09,071
Here you've got a cell with the chromosome. You've got this copy from, let's say, mom, it's big at this level.

479
01:05:09,641 --> 01:05:19,331
And from dad. You get a little peek at that same O'Neill. So in meiosis, they replicate each other.

480
01:05:19,451 --> 01:05:25,361
Right. And then if there's not a crossing over, they're going to separate.

481
01:05:25,751 --> 01:05:31,871
So you've got this separation of maternal and paternal lille's at Meiosis one.

482
01:05:37,101 --> 01:05:46,971
But if there happens to be a recombination that occurs, say, right here between the CENTROMERE,

483
01:05:47,031 --> 01:05:52,281
which is the center of the sex and the locus, it happens right here.

484
01:05:54,621 --> 01:05:56,721
And those pieces get swapped.

485
01:05:57,831 --> 01:06:05,391
Then you'd have in this cell when they get pulled apart, you have a big P and a little P on this one in a big P and a little P on this.

486
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:10,521
So they're not separated yet. Was Leo's maternal and paternal?

487
01:06:10,521 --> 01:06:14,031
Leo's are not separate until they split again.

488
01:06:14,031 --> 01:06:21,281
And it's two sets.

489
01:06:25,361 --> 01:06:30,581
Cool. All right. Here's the kind of depiction of a lot of independent assortment.

490
01:06:31,871 --> 01:06:40,061
So, again, you got some some material from mom or dad and you got, let's say, dad here and mom in green.

491
01:06:40,751 --> 01:06:46,741
So you've got a big ah, big line from mom.

492
01:06:46,751 --> 01:06:51,721
And I think whatever Blue will say is mom's and Green is dad.

493
01:06:51,741 --> 01:07:00,611
You've got a little R and little y, so they might line up like this at metaphase one and get separated out like this.

494
01:07:02,411 --> 01:07:07,511
Or they might line up like this and get separated here.

495
01:07:09,601 --> 01:07:14,821
So this kind of pairing up, this alignment happens randomly.

496
01:07:15,061 --> 01:07:26,821
And so either these could happen. And so you've got this random assortment of all the elements that make sense.

497
01:07:29,291 --> 01:07:35,761
You can. This is what's called a karyotype.

498
01:07:37,831 --> 01:07:53,521
These are basically come from from as a gel stain thing, which is just kind of depicting all the chromosomes here, one through 22 and then the X line.

499
01:07:56,401 --> 01:08:05,791
So what it's interesting here really is that these chromosomes are highly condensed genetic material.

500
01:08:06,721 --> 01:08:11,251
They you can see from this these pictures over here that it loop around each other,

501
01:08:11,251 --> 01:08:15,931
that actual DNA loops around itself is wrapped around these histones.

502
01:08:16,471 --> 01:08:23,101
It's highly complex organization. It's right here in how they're actually packed into the cell.

503
01:08:28,661 --> 01:08:38,681
It can also kind of extend itself like here can extend itself to be not so packed in regions where you actually want transcription to happen.

504
01:08:45,661 --> 01:08:49,831
Initially these were meant to be numbered. And a bite size.

505
01:08:50,901 --> 01:08:55,771
That one's biggest. And you're supposed to go down in the smallest happens.

506
01:08:55,921 --> 01:09:03,421
That's not quite right anymore. For example, 21 is a little bit smaller than 22 as far as.

507
01:09:04,671 --> 01:09:09,381
Base pair links, but for the most part, they're organized by size.

508
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:24,581
So the central dogma here, you start with your DNA, your double helix.

509
01:09:27,631 --> 01:09:29,941
The double helix kind of gets unzipped.

510
01:09:32,071 --> 01:09:44,881
And you've got this RNA polymerase, which is an enzyme which comes along and reads the the template strand here.

511
01:09:47,491 --> 01:09:49,411
And creates the messenger RNA.

512
01:09:55,691 --> 01:10:10,181
You've got Enrons and stuff that get spliced out, and then the messenger RNA can be read in the right office to create a protein.

513
01:10:11,381 --> 01:10:22,211
You'll have this sequence of cases which can be read as triplet pairs to create different amino acids, which then chain together to form a protein.

514
01:10:22,871 --> 01:10:28,411
That's the general idea. We've all seen this before, too.

515
01:10:28,441 --> 01:10:35,091
Yes. Well. Is it typical chain structure?

516
01:10:38,711 --> 01:10:46,481
You've got some proximal control elements or enhancers and you've got a promoter.

517
01:10:48,161 --> 01:11:00,041
These are all these are all upstream of the actual transcriptional start site, which is which is in this area here.

518
01:11:02,881 --> 01:11:12,871
These enhancers are really just kind of regulatory elements for the transcription that a promoter which promotes the transcription,

519
01:11:14,131 --> 01:11:19,620
but there is in that promoter there's a tattoo box which there's actually a specific

520
01:11:19,621 --> 01:11:25,591
enzyme which binds to that thing which helps the RNA polymerase in the transcription.

521
01:11:28,061 --> 01:11:33,691
You've got a five prime untranslated region here, which really is just functioning as kind of a buffer.

522
01:11:36,421 --> 01:11:40,471
And then you actually have your start of transcription, an excellent one,

523
01:11:41,641 --> 01:11:48,301
get all your enshrines which gets play style, although there's some variability in the way that can happen.

524
01:11:51,811 --> 01:12:00,301
And then you've got an ending point here and they've got this three prime untranslated region, which is a trailer which includes this Polish,

525
01:12:00,301 --> 01:12:09,001
a K which is added, and that kind of helps with the transport of the messenger RNA through the cell.

526
01:12:12,991 --> 01:12:19,631
The questions about that. Okay.

527
01:12:21,831 --> 01:12:31,011
Here's another picture transcription. So you start with your your DNA here.

528
01:12:32,091 --> 01:12:35,091
The RNA polymerase comes along, reads the template strand.

529
01:12:35,391 --> 01:12:39,771
You end up with this stuff where you get all the introns cut out and essentially

530
01:12:39,771 --> 01:12:48,131
the ExxonMobil stitch back together a coherent code which can be read.

531
01:12:51,341 --> 01:12:56,741
Creative protein. Another interesting point about this particular picture.

532
01:12:57,881 --> 01:13:08,801
You have these kind of these specific bases at either sides of the exons, which are important for kind of regulating splicing.

533
01:13:11,741 --> 01:13:17,711
So that's interesting because if you happen to get a mutation in one of these bases,

534
01:13:19,601 --> 01:13:25,391
that might kind of mess up hearing splicing and cause potential issues.

535
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:36,181
All right. Which leads me to alternative splicing.

536
01:13:39,241 --> 01:13:46,711
It's believed that that at least 70% of all the human genes partake in some sort of alternative splicing,

537
01:13:48,361 --> 01:13:51,751
which gives rise to almost 60,000 distinct translations.

538
01:13:55,661 --> 01:14:01,451
So if the splicing is in change, that means the proteins can change, right?

539
01:14:03,401 --> 01:14:07,871
And this might occur at different development stages.

540
01:14:08,891 --> 01:14:13,151
It might happen in different tissues or in these conditions.

541
01:14:13,871 --> 01:14:21,131
These might be reasons why this happens, and it can actually be accomplished by doing several different things.

542
01:14:21,491 --> 01:14:23,741
You can actually skip some of the exons.

543
01:14:25,481 --> 01:14:34,541
You could keep one of the Introns says, splicing it out, or they could actually be cut in different locations.

544
01:14:36,341 --> 01:14:43,271
Again, this might happen because of different cell types, for example, might do this differently.

545
01:14:48,631 --> 01:14:56,241
Right. He estimated the number of human genes has changed pretty drastically over time.

546
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:06,381
As late as 1990 or so. They thought there were like 100,000 genes.

547
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:15,361
These days, we believe there's more like 20, 21,000 genes.

548
01:15:18,601 --> 01:15:23,911
So what might be some of the reasons for this decrease? And.

549
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:29,581
Yes. Precise definition of a gene?

550
01:15:30,541 --> 01:15:42,961
Sure, it could be. The actual definition of a gene. In fact, they believe they believe that one gene is equal to one protein.

551
01:15:45,001 --> 01:15:50,771
Right. So that means they didn't really account for all this alternative splicing and.

552
01:15:58,541 --> 01:16:09,431
Way, way back in the beginning, they also thought that basically the whole genome was coding something, which also is not the case.

553
01:16:10,091 --> 01:16:15,851
So there's a lot of regions which are not genes at all or just other genetic material.

554
01:16:19,631 --> 01:16:28,690
So either way, we think there's about 21,000 now. Yes, I have a question about splicing, because when you were mentioning that previously,

555
01:16:28,691 --> 01:16:34,810
they thought there's one gene for protein and now with alternative splicing, is that like a very consistent event?

556
01:16:34,811 --> 01:16:39,551
Because like theoretically when you're trying to regulate like gene transmit prescriptions like that,

557
01:16:39,911 --> 01:16:43,631
that's how you regulate the amount, almost the amount of protein that's in your.

558
01:16:43,661 --> 01:16:50,051
Like a certain cell environment but is like is alternative splicing also regulated somehow.

559
01:16:51,251 --> 01:16:58,061
Just out of curiosity. Yeah. You know, there must be some regulatory ways that that happens.

560
01:16:59,741 --> 01:17:04,151
We talked about how there's these these specific bases here.

561
01:17:04,571 --> 01:17:07,691
They may be regulating that to some extent. I see.

562
01:17:11,201 --> 01:17:18,431
There may be some some epigenetic type of things as well. So you could have like one gene coding consciously for like two different types of proteins.

563
01:17:19,271 --> 01:17:27,521
Yeah, I think the textbook that was recommended was because they said the transcription

564
01:17:27,521 --> 01:17:33,641
factors like find the motor and then can affect the splicing is different.

565
01:17:35,321 --> 01:17:49,951
Yeah, exactly. It's. And that is that per individual that would be definitely Spicer is a market tissue specific

566
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:54,151
thing that alternative splicing is getting at a tissue specific expression of a gene.

567
01:17:55,201 --> 01:18:04,321
Yeah. So this this would probably occur in different tissue types, different developmental stages and so on.

568
01:18:04,831 --> 01:18:11,791
That's, that's why this really happens. Yeah. It makes sense.

569
01:18:22,691 --> 01:18:34,361
Okay. So again, you've got this double stranded DNA trying to emphasize kind of the directionality here again.

570
01:18:34,871 --> 01:18:37,391
So you've got a five prime to three prime strand.

571
01:18:37,931 --> 01:18:48,941
You might call this the coding strand or the sense strand, which is you guys corresponding template strand or non-coding strand four antisense strand.

572
01:18:51,551 --> 01:18:57,431
And the Miranda that's is created from this from this DNA,

573
01:18:58,211 --> 01:19:06,941
we'll have the same sequence as the coding string with the exception that uracil is replacing.

574
01:19:07,061 --> 01:19:14,470
Same. So this Miranda down here at the bottom matches.

575
01:19:14,471 --> 01:19:17,471
Exactly. This coding strand at the top.

576
01:19:18,431 --> 01:19:31,661
The exception you place is t RNA polymerase reads the template strand from three prime to five prime sent synthesize that messenger RNA.

577
01:19:33,551 --> 01:19:41,201
But then the mirror is read five prime to three prime again so that it matches the sequence of that coding strand.

578
01:19:43,241 --> 01:19:45,281
So you're going to have these triplets,

579
01:19:45,551 --> 01:19:56,771
these codons that correspond to the in the five prime and three prime direction that make up the sequence of amino acids that are produced.

580
01:19:58,421 --> 01:20:10,631
You've got to start codon. Just a yogi always starts with genes start going down encodes for the finding and you've got to stop codon as well.

581
01:20:12,521 --> 01:20:22,871
Here's a couple of others and also our squadrons. You are the UAE and you are also stuck with us.

582
01:20:28,021 --> 01:20:35,371
Yes. In the image on the previous slide and is a basic notation that the template

583
01:20:35,371 --> 01:20:41,911
strand and the antisense strand is the one on the bottom of what's being shown.

584
01:20:43,501 --> 01:20:47,671
Sometimes they can be transcribed in both directions of DNA strands.

585
01:20:47,701 --> 01:20:51,990
How is the nomenclature like? The way that that's given?

586
01:20:51,991 --> 01:20:56,411
Is that. Can you know which one you're supposed to consider?

587
01:20:56,481 --> 01:21:03,961
Mantis shrimp? Well, yeah.

588
01:21:03,981 --> 01:21:07,821
So that that brings up the difficulty and of the reason I'm trying to emphasize this.

589
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:17,581
You have to specify which strand is the coding strand and which direction it's going in.

590
01:21:18,271 --> 01:21:24,661
So it's important to specify which one word we're talking about whenever we're referring to that sequence.

591
01:21:25,711 --> 01:21:32,461
Okay. So if it's if the Mirna is produced from this one, we'd call that the template strand.

592
01:21:33,161 --> 01:21:39,841
Right. And we if we compare the sequence,

593
01:21:40,171 --> 01:21:48,931
we'd know which direction it was in because it always reads the plumber's RNA for reads from 3 to 5 prime of this temple strand.

594
01:21:50,261 --> 01:21:59,021
That makes sense. So. So it's really important to specify the direction in which strand you're looking at.

595
01:22:01,661 --> 01:22:05,761
Right. All right.

596
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:18,331
So these little triplet base pairs, so triplet codons we call them actually codes for different amino acids.

597
01:22:21,891 --> 01:22:25,131
Again. It's read by a friend of the three friend.

598
01:22:25,461 --> 01:22:31,221
So when we're talking here in this chart, the first base is closer to five prime.

599
01:22:31,581 --> 01:22:39,951
The third base is closer to three prime. And so we've got things like UK-EU it.

600
01:22:40,161 --> 01:22:44,511
So we code for are you EU territory.

601
01:22:45,471 --> 01:22:56,881
EU 16. So it. What's important here to recognize is that there is degeneracy, especially in the third base.

602
01:22:58,201 --> 01:23:03,151
So 16 is coded by both CGU and UTC, for example.

603
01:23:06,541 --> 01:23:15,311
And that's actually going to allow for some mutations to occur, in particular in that third base and have it not affect the protein in any way.

604
01:23:18,001 --> 01:23:22,471
We would call that a synonymous mutation.

605
01:23:25,881 --> 01:23:30,141
It's a mutation that occurs but doesn't actually affect the immediate amino acid that's

606
01:23:30,381 --> 01:23:44,121
produced as opposed to a non synonymous mutation which well maybe changes you here to a right,

607
01:23:44,421 --> 01:23:50,871
and then you've got to stop codon instead of a cysteine, which is actually what's known as a nonsense mutation.

608
01:23:55,111 --> 01:23:59,681
Okay. This this is just part of the table, obviously.

609
01:24:00,381 --> 01:24:06,991
The full table is in your your chapter text.

610
01:24:08,091 --> 01:24:17,541
You find it there? Yes. Does that do the stop and start or not end up being interpreted and made into proteins?

611
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:25,521
Or does it read the transcription stop before you get there?

612
01:24:27,281 --> 01:24:32,391
Yeah, that's a good question. So the start codon actually codes for my thinking.

613
01:24:32,811 --> 01:24:39,741
So it is an amino acid. The stop codon is basically just read.

614
01:24:41,241 --> 01:24:47,991
Um, it just tells the, the ribosome said to stop translating there.

615
01:24:48,771 --> 01:24:54,801
So I guess it's cut off at that point. So do proteins always start with binding then?

616
01:24:55,371 --> 01:25:02,641
Yeah, that's right. Okay.

617
01:25:04,841 --> 01:25:10,611
The questions. Okay.

618
01:25:14,511 --> 01:25:23,731
Right. So in that case, with 15 minutes left, I guess.

619
01:25:24,361 --> 01:25:30,781
So I'll let you at least get a little start on your first problem setting.

620
01:25:34,681 --> 01:25:43,951
So you'll have to you'll have to form your groups then, and make sure you put yourself in a group, work together, and I'll let you do it.

621
01:25:45,301 --> 01:25:59,381
I can certainly circulate around them with any questions. You speak?
