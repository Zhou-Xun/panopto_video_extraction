1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:12,630
Okay so, we're back again to talk about mental health, and now that we have a basic understanding of what it is, we want to get into the meat of it.

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:20,190
What are the skills that we can use for our personal and professional wellbeing? Take care of ourself across that continuum that

3
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:27,960
we talked about in mental health. So most of the things that we're going to talk about are going to all under four categories self-awareness,

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,250
self-care, self-talk and social support, which I sometimes just referr to as squad.

5
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:43,000
One of the things to think about here, is that most of us come to the idea of mental health with

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,830
beliefs about how important it is and how useful these skills are.

7
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:52,320
So, again, as I talked about before, we can kind of have a mindset of like I don't really have time for this,

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,430
this sounds kind of like soft skills, that kind of sounds fluffy.

9
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:05,320
But what I will tell you, as somebody who works with a lot of different leaders across different areas of life,

10
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,500
from athletics to activists to leaders of companies, that these skills really go a long way in,

11
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,960
number one, just feeling like a whole functioning, vibrant person.

12
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,790
Also a person who can get through things that are difficult.

13
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:28,320
And also a person who can show up in a really intense high achievement settings and continue to do well for a long time.

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,030
I'll also admit that I'm somebody who taught a lot of these skills, without practicing them for myself for a long time.

15
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:41,500
So what I would urge you to do over the next few weeks, even if some of the things feel silly, is to give them a try, try them out for a while,

16
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:49,960
and see how they are for you. We'll try to give a variety of things, so that you can find what works best for you.

17
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:59,380
So today, we're gonna start with self-awareness. And this is important because a lot of times by the time people start therapy,

18
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:06,310
by the time they come to see a psychologist like me, they'll often say, I don't even know where to start.

19
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,220
Like when I'm asking, what do you want to focus on and what's bothering you?

20
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:17,280
And I'll get some variety of something that sounds like all the things, because things have been stacking up for so long.

21
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,440
And so an important practice is beginning to tune into ourselves from day-to-day.

22
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,790
So we know where we are on that continuum. So we know what's affecting us.

23
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,860
And so we can take these small, incremental steps to care for ourself.

24
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,850
It's kind of like a car that you've like run down, you haven't done any of the maintenance.

25
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:45,960
And when you finally start to deal with it, it's going to be a lot more work, a lot more money because of how far

26
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:52,120
the damage has happened, how long you've been running on these breaks that need to be replaced.

27
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,230
Our system is kind of the same.

28
00:02:53,230 --> 00:03:01,150
It needs day-to-day care, especially when we're in intense academic programs, especially when life is just challenging in general.

29
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:06,110
So we wanted to develop habits of checking in.

30
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:13,870
I have these images up here and I'm going to talk a little bit about them as different ways of thinking about checking in with yourself.

31
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:19,780
And you can kind of decide which one seems to resonate most for you.

32
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,350
So the first image that you'll see up here is kind of a meter,

33
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:30,070
like you would see when you get in your car and you look at the dashboard and it tells you how much fuel is in there,

34
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:37,240
how hot or cold your engine is running. And sometimes just pausing and checking in with ourself,

35
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,250
what is my fuel tank look like? Almost like the battery cell on our cell phones.

36
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:51,600
And are there any hazard lights flashing? You know, is there anything in me that says, hey, I need help, I need attention?

37
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,110
Another kind of check-in image, that I'll use sometimes, is this idea of a backpack. What am I carrying around, because sometimes there's a lot of thoughts,

38
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:04,770
there's a lot of worries, and we've been stuffing them into our backpack or purse, whatever you want to think of,

39
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:10,290
and we haven't kind of gone and seen all of what's in there. And it's slowly starting to weigh us down.

40
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:16,050
And so we want to have times where we pause and we clean everything out of there and we see what we're carrying around

41
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:20,800
that's effecting us. Another image is the idea of a plant.

42
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:27,450
So any of us who've gotten into planting a little bit, you'll know that you kind of got to check the soil,

43
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:34,260
you've kind of got to look at what the leaves look like, and then you've got to make little adjustments about does the plant need more sun, does the plant need more water?

44
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,330
Well, our systems are a lot like that.

45
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:43,350
And often, we can get to a place where we're really stressed, we're really worn down, and we're being hard on ourselves.

46
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:49,560
We haven't checked in to see what does my system need more of? What's maybe getting put into the soil

47
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,790
that's not helping? The next image, kind of down in the middle,

48
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:00,830
is this person trying to balance all of these plates and a lot of us have a lot

49
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,780
of roles in our families and different extracurriculars and then academics,

50
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,930
and it can feel like we're just juggling a lot of plates, sometimes on paper

51
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,460
even, just writing down all of the stuff that we're trying to do, so that we can get clear about it.

52
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,140
So we can even understand why we feel so stretched thin and so that we can

53
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,670
prioritize what we're gonna attend to and what we're going to maybe pause.

54
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:31,370
We can take things kind of one step at a time as opposed to feeling so all over the place.

55
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:41,030
That can be another type of check-in. Another one is just what's on my plate right now, which is pretty similar, kind of like to the backpack or the spinning plates.

56
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,930
We have this kind of what we need so that we can focus on one thing at a time.

57
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,740
Or is it kind of like, you know, when you go to the buffet, sometimes you stack your plate

58
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:56,450
so full? A lot of us are saying yes to more things, not realizing that things are falling off of our plate. And so

59
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:02,240
checking in from time to time about how much is on your plate can be really important.

60
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:09,550
We'll talk later about saying no, and boundaries and some of those things. But we first need to know what's on our plate?

61
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:15,520
Another kind of check-in that I like, especially when it feels like there's no word for what's going on or it's just hard to describe it,

62
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:26,590
if we're not used to talking about feelings a lot, it's hard to name them. Sometimes thinking about what song kind of expresses what I'm feeling right now?

63
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:31,590
And what song expresses what I need to kind of help me through today?

64
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:40,620
And those two songs, the lyrics, the tone of them will tell you a lot about what's kind of going on in your internal world.

65
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:52,080
For some of us who are more, maybe creative or visual, thinking about what color, what images represent how we're feeling right now, what's going on?

66
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,350
What color and images represent how you want to feel or what we need right now?

67
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:03,610
And the last one, can kind of be simple is like what emoji would express what you're feeling right now?

68
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:09,250
Any of these check-ins are something that you could do really quickly and daily,

69
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:17,430
and it would give you a lot of information to know what you need to do to kind of keep yourself

70
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:23,010
functioning how you want to or what you might need to add, to help you through what's going on,

71
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:28,380
and there are a lot of apps, and I'll give you some of these resources where you can, just kind of right there on your phone.

72
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:37,990
Some of them are emoji based, how are you feeling? Check-in and they can give you some suggestions.

73
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:43,020
Sometimes what I'll do with people is just draw a little gingerbread person,

74
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,340
and then we will put all kinds of stuff on it to represent what's happening, and this can help sometimes,

75
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:54,150
and if you're not really great at talking about emotions, and you just want to check-in with your body and see what's there.

76
00:07:54,150 --> 00:08:01,100
It'll sometimes tell you what has been building up and happening that you haven't necessarily been paying the most attention to.

77
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:08,390
If you're noticing knots in your stomach, knots in your shoulders, just tight in your chest and hard to breathe,

78
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:21,280
those are really important signs. If your thoughts are feeling kind of all knotted up and messy or if it's just feeling really cloudy, sad, intense.

79
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:28,810
If there are things happening that are creating a lot of emotional pain, if you're really low on energy.

80
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:36,250
There's lots of feelings of anger or shame. These can all be things that are really helpful to talk about, to journal about,

81
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,170
but most importantly to just know,

82
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:47,780
because often we're so busy keeping it moving that we're not checking in with these things and making the small adjustments that make

83
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:55,030
what help us take care of ourselves while we keep moving or even taking a break and getting back to moving.

84
00:08:55,030 --> 00:09:01,600
So there's some sentences that you kind of fill in the blank here that might help sometimes.

85
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,090
I am. I feel. I want.

86
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:17,400
I need. I will. And I'll show you another slight variation of this.

87
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:24,090
So I would encourage everybody, for two minutes a day, twice a day,

88
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,200
this could be while you're brushing your teeth. Just ask yourself the question,

89
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:35,340
what I'm feeling right now? What am I thinking? What am I holding? What am I carrying? What's floating around inside?

90
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:43,140
Pick whichever of those words fits best for you. And then the question, what do I need right now? When you answer this question,

91
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:49,290
we're not thinking about, like you know, a month long vacation, that many feel like what you need right now,

92
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,190
we're not thinking about what you need for the whole month. Just for that day,

93
00:09:53,190 --> 00:10:00,450
just for that next hour, what do you need? And sometimes that's going to be something like I just need to take a quick nap.

94
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,970
I need to set a reminder for this thing, it's like bugging me

95
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,790
and I think I'm going to forget. I need to check on this family member

96
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,140
that's kind of been weighing on my mind or have a conversation with somebody about deadlines that

97
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to meet. I need to break down this task, because I'm really overwhelmed by it.

98
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,820
I need to eat. I need to drink some water. I need to go for a walk. I need to get outside.

99
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:30,130
They're really just trying to identify one thing based on how you're feeling

100
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:39,050
that would be helpful. Once you do this check-in, take a deep breath and then ask yourself what's the next moment about?

101
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:44,330
So this can often be helpful when you sit down to start working on projects or reading and there's a lot going on.

102
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:51,270
You're just going to do this brief check-in. And then you're going to ask yourself what the next moment is about, so that you

103
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:57,260
can reengage and just focus on that one thing and be fully present to that one thing.

104
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,550
So this is one of the habits of self-awareness that we want to work on.

105
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:06,410
And we'll give some supplemental exercises to continue to just try different things.

106
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:13,870
But the big takeaway, is that it is crucial to your mental health and to your professional life, moment-to-moment, day-to-day,

107
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:22,480
the habits of checking in with what's going on inside and then making subtle shifts based on the data that you gather,

108
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,400
take care of yourself based on what you're experiencing.
