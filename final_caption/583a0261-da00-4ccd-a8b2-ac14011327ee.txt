1
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:10,759
and calculating person time. First, let's talk about incidence.

2
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:16,759
Incidence is the frequency of development of new cases in the population over time.

3
00:00:16,759 --> 00:00:21,759
Incident cases are newly occurring cases of a disease to measure

4
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:26,759
incidence, cohort members or population members must be followed over

5
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:31,759
time throughout the session. I will refer to both populations

6
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:37,759
and cohorts. Please note that when I say population, what I'm typically referring to

7
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,759
is the population of a geographic region such as a state or a country.

8
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:49,759
And when I say cohort, what I'm typically referring to is an epidemiological study.

9
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:55,759
Incidence may be expressed as a proportion or a rate, so

10
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,759
as alluded to in the previous part of this session. The incidence

11
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:05,759
proportion is simply a proportion. But time is not included in the measure

12
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:10,759
itself. It is incredibly important to specify the time period at which

13
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:17,759
the incidence proportion applies to. But it is not included in the measure of incidence itself.

14
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,759
There are limitations to incidence proportions, and so we typically prefer to use

15
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,759
incidence, rates where time is included in the denominator and thus

16
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:34,759
in the measure of incidence itself. And the incidents rate is a true rate.

17
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:40,759
Incidence rates are also referred to as incidence density and are defined

18
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:45,759
as the number of incident cases divided by the total person time,

19
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,759
such as person months or person years of observation at risk

20
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,759
for the whole study population. This is simply calculated as

21
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,759
the number of new cases divided by the total person time at

22
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,759
risk. So we can say that the incidence

23
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,759
density or the incidence rate over t naught through to t is calculated

24
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,759
as I over PT. Where I is the number of incident cases that occurred

25
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:22,759
during the follow up, and PT Is the total person time at risk.

26
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:27,759
Please note that incidence density is sometimes expressed as one over time

27
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,759
or time to the negative one. This is because time is in the denominator and thus

28
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:40,759
we are talking about the reciprocal of time as the units.

29
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:45,759
So how do we calculate person time? How is person time accrued in

30
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,759
an epidemiological study or in a population that is under surveillance?

31
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:55,759
So first, it's crucial to note that person time contributed

32
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:01,759
is limited to the time that a given individual in the cohort or population

33
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,759
is at risk of the outcome. And I cannot emphasize this enough.

34
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:11,759
Individuals do not contribute person time to observation when they either

35
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,759
have the disease or are otherwise not at risk of the disease.

36
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:22,759
So once an individual develops the disease under a study, they no longer contribute person

37
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:27,759
time to the denominator of the incidence rate because they are no longer at risk of

38
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,759
developing the disease. There are other reasons why individuals may

39
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:38,759
become not no longer at risk of the disease and thus no longer contributing person

40
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:43,759
time. So, for example, death can occur and that is a competing risk

41
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:49,759
to developing a disease. Under a study that if we are looking at

42
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,759
a population, people may migrate out of the population and thus no longer be

43
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:59,759
part of the population and they would no longer contribute person time.

44
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,759
In an epidemiological study, an individual may drop out or choose to no longer take part in the study.

45
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:09,759
And again, they would no longer be at risk and they would no longer contribute person time.

46
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,759
And finally, there can be other competing instances that can occur. So, for example, in a

47
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,759
longitudinal study of the incidence of female breast cancer, if a woman

48
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,759
has a mastectomy, they would no longer be at risk of developing breast cancer.

49
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,759
Thus, they would be no longer at risk of the disease and they would be censored or removed from

50
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,759
the study. I would no longer contribute person time. I will also note here

51
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,759
that often studies are limited to the first incident occurrence of disease,

52
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,759
and that is what we will focus on in this session today. It is possible to estimate

53
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,759
incidents from multiple recurrences of disease. So, for example, consider a study

54
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,759
of the incidence of influenza over a five year period. And influenza is a disease that people

55
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,759
can get and then recover from and then get again. But this is not the focus for today.

56
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,759
If you are interested in estimating incidents from multiple recurrences of a disease, it is described briefly

57
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,759
in Modern Epidemiology on page 36.

58
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,759
So how do we how do we define person time? Most commonly we work in person

59
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,759
years. We can also work in person months or person weeks. So an example of

60
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,759
how one person year can be accrued. We could follow one person for one year.

61
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,759
We could follow 12 people each for one month. We could follow one person for five

62
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:40,759
months. One person for four months. And one person for three months together. This would add up to

63
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,759
12 months of person observation or one year of or one year

64
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,759
of observation. The possibilities to accrue one year of person time. We

65
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:56,759
need to just follow a given number of people over a given number of months that add up to the total

66
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,759
of following one person for one year. And note again that person time

67
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,759
only accrues when the person is at risk of the disease.

68
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,759
So let's get into a more formal formula when the follow up duration

69
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:18,759
is known or can be assumed. And again, this would be for an open population

70
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:23,759
where people can enter or leave the population at any given point in time.

71
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,759
The total person time, which is also referred to as the population time,

72
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:34,759
is simply the sum of the individual person time that is accrued

73
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,759
for all people in the study. So here, formally, this is referred to

74
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,759
as the sum of Delta t I, where I equals one over N Prime,

75
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,759
where N prime is the total population size and Delta T i is

76
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,759
the duration of observed follow up for the ith individual from their

77
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,759
entry into the study until either the disease occurs or they withdraw. So

78
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,759
you can think of Delta t i as one individual person's person time

79
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,759
that they contribute and PT as the total population person time,

80
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:16,759
which again is the sum of all individual person time of observation.

81
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:21,759
And again, there are many reasons that withdrawals can occur and these need to be accounted

82
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,759
for because we do not want this time to erroneously be included

83
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:32,759
in the denominator of the incidence rate.

84
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:38,759
So a limitation of using this method is that we must know the exact time of disease

85
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:44,759
onset and of withdrawal, which can actually be kind of difficult in practice.

86
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,759
So let's consider Intervale data. So let's think practically, if we are doing

87
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,759
a longitudinal cohort study and we have people dropping

88
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,759
out of the study or developing the disease as time elapses.

89
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:05,759
We may not actually have continuous daily monitoring of this cohort

90
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,759
to identify the exact times when study dropouts or withdrawals

91
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,759
and diseases occur. We may, for example, assess our population on

92
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,759
a monthly basis or a yearly basis. And yet let's use a yearly basis to think about

93
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,759
this. So here, our intervals of observation would be one year.

94
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,759
So let's say at year one of our study, we may observe a certain number

95
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,759
of people have withdrawn from our cohort and a certain number of people have developed the disease.

96
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,759
But we could assume that withdrawal occurred exactly on the day of assessment

97
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:48,759
one year into the study. And same thing. We can assume that disease onset occurs exactly on

98
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:53,759
the day of assessment one year into the study. But this is probably wrong. Whoever dropped

99
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:58,759
out of the study probably did so at some unknown time point between years zero or,

100
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:04,759
you know, day one of the study. And year one or day a hundred. Day three hundred and sixty five of the study.

101
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:09,759
One simple way to account for the fact that we don't know the exact study

102
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:15,759
withdrawal or disease onset times would be to assume that the disease occurs

103
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,759
on the day of reporting, and then we can calculate the withdrawal as halfway between

104
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:26,759
the time of the last study contact and the first unsuccessful attempt at contact.

105
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:31,759
So in the example where we are doing yearly assessments, if someone has dropped out

106
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:37,759
at year one, we would just assume that they dropped out at six months to account for the uncertainty

107
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,759
in the date in which they actually dropped out. So we would simply calculate the

108
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:47,759
total person time by dividing the number of withdrawals that are

109
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,759
observed at a given interval, which here is your one by two, and then

110
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:57,759
subtracting this from the number of individuals at the beginning of the interval

111
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:05,759
and multiplying by the duration of follow up to estimate the total person time under observation.

112
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,759
An alternative approach, which I think is slightly preferrable, would be to

113
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:16,759
assume that both the disease and the withdrawal occur halfway between two timed points of assessment.

114
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:21,759
And here all we would do is divide the number of withdrawals that are observed at a given interval

115
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:27,759
by to divide the number of incident cases that are observed at each interval by two.

116
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,759
Subtract both by the number of individuals that are present in the population or cohort

117
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:37,759
at the beginning of each interval. Multiply by the duration of follow up and this will give us the total

118
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,759
person time under observation that we can then use as the denominator

119
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:47,759
in estimating the incidence rate. And so the

120
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,759
previous examples that I showed are for open populations where we can actually have withdrawals from

121
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:59,759
the population or the study. So how do we calculate person time in a steady state population?

122
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,759
So recall that in a steady state population, the number of people leaving a population

123
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:09,759
is balanced by the number of people entering within levels of age, sex and other key determinants

124
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,759
of risk. And because of this, we do not actually require knowledge of

125
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:20,759
individual follow up links because the total follow up is on average

126
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:25,759
complete for the full population or cohort. And here, person time

127
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,759
can simply be calculated as N prime by Delta T, where N prime

128
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:35,759
is the size of the stable at risk population. And Delta T is the duration. A follow

129
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,759
up time note that with a rare disease in prime is approximately equal to the total

130
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:46,759
population because incidents will be very low and will account for a small number of individuals

131
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:51,759
in the population. When we have a non steady

132
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:57,759
state population, we do not actually require knowledge of individual follow up periods again.

133
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:02,759
And we would just simply calculate person time as the number of disease free individuals in the population

134
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:07,759
at the midway time point of the fall. What period which is denoted here as in prime

135
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,759
one 1/2 by Delta T. This slide shows

136
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:19,759
a summary of the four methods of calculating person time.

137
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,759
And that's it for part two. In part three, we will learn methods to estimate risk.

138
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:29,759
And we will actually get some hands on methods in calculating person time. And these

139
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,759
will be accompanied by visual aids, which I think are very useful in conceptualizing and estimating

140
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:40,759
person time. And should nicely complement the formulas that are shown here in this

141
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,430
section.
