2
00:00:07,106 --> 00:00:11,450
In this unit, we're gonna talk
about newborn screening diseases.

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,520
This is one of the best
examples of taking the science

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:21,420
of disease into populations to save lives.

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,479
It started in the 1960s,
when a doctor, Dr. Robert Guthrie,

6
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:31,451
developed a simple test to make
routine newborn screening of PKU,

7
00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:33,879
phenylketonuria, possible.

8
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:37,061
He actually had a family
member with this disease,

9
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:40,992
which is what led him to actually
the development of this test.

10
00:00:40,992 --> 00:00:45,326
It was a very simple bacterial
inhibition assay that was developed so

11
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:49,958
that it could sort of be portable, and
the blood could just be collected on

12
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:55,640
filter paper, something pretty simple
to do out within a population.

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,350
It only took him a year or

14
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:02,620
two of working with the Massachusetts
Public Health Laboratories to try the test

15
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,830
on all the newborns in
1962 to see whether or

16
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,090
not this test could identify
individuals that had the elevated

17
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:19,670
levels of the phenylketonuric byproduct
and was actually poisoning them.

18
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,420
In that one year,
when they measured over 50,000 infants,

19
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,680
they discovered nine
infants actually had PKU.

20
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,360
This was much more prevalent than
what they had thought previously.

21
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,070
And it was a key marker within
the history of newborn screening that

22
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:44,020
started this whole wave, and other
states wanted to take it up because we

23
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,990
could identify the children, change their
diet, and actually save their lives.

24
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,430
He then went on to develop
several more of these assays,

25
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:00,810
to actually detect deficiencies in
Leucine, Galactose, and Methionine.

26
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,990
And today, there are over 50 different
diseases that can be tested in the newborn

27
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,820
in a single blood drop on a filter paper.

28
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,560
All states have newborn screening
programs that are supposed to be

29
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,390
operating within the first 24
to 48 hours of an infant's life

30
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:24,140
to collect the blood spot and
send it to a state laboratory.

31
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:30,180
But not all states actually look
at all 50 or 60 different tests.

32
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,014
There are some states that only look,
for instance, at eight or

33
00:02:34,014 --> 00:02:37,260
nine different inborn
errors of metabolism.

34
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,600
Where other states, for instance in
Michigan, we look actually at 50 or

35
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,080
60 different inborn errors of metabolism.

36
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,810
PKU was the very first newborn
screening test, and it provides

37
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:57,430
a nice view of how we go from the science
to the actual improvement of health.

38
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,180
The science of the inborn error of
metabolism is pretty well known,

39
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,421
because it's just the metabolism
of an amino acid's phenylalanine.

40
00:03:05,421 --> 00:03:10,960
When the mutation actually stops the
conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine,

41
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,270
it goes then into a shunt pathway
that creates phenylpyruvate,

42
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,570
and it's phenylpyruvate that is a toxin.

43
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,790
And the toxin that's flowing in
the little baby's body is what is then

44
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,760
influencing the nerve structure and
leads to basically

45
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:35,550
developmental disabilities that the child
can never actually recover from.

46
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,350
Once the metabolism was understood,

47
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:42,990
the biochemistry, then the search for
the genes started.

48
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,300
It took nearly 30 years
to identify the gene.

49
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,010
And once it was, there was this whole
worldwide effort to figure out well,

50
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,790
what mutations do these babies have?

51
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,840
Thousands of mutations have been
identified in this single gene.

52
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,810
And this sort of tells us
that this is probably not

53
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,260
something we'll go do a genetic test on.

54
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,020
We can go look at
the biochemistry of it and

55
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,600
actually identify babies much
easier through that mechanism.

56
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,990
How does somebody get PKU?

57
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:18,310
Well, it's an autosomal recessive disease.

58
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,170
That means that they have to inherit
the mutation from their mother and

59
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:27,130
from their father, which means
the parents both have to be carriers.

60
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,990
If we look at a family where both parents
are carrying one of the mutations,

61
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,830
then of the children in that family,
sort of probabilistically,

62
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:42,870
one in four children will
probably have the disease.

63
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,946
Two in four will be carriers, and
one in four will likely be normal in

64
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:53,577
both of the alleles or both of the
chromosomes they get from their parents.

65
00:04:53,577 --> 00:04:56,788
How do we actually treat the disease?

66
00:04:56,788 --> 00:04:58,770
Well, it's all about diet.

67
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:03,570
Because phenylalanine isn't
a central amino acid, in order for

68
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,323
the children to be able to
not have phenylalanine,

69
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:10,567
protein has to be
eliminated from the diet.

70
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:15,422
So very special sort of medicalized
diets are what are used to help

71
00:05:15,422 --> 00:05:23,090
the children grow without the toxic
consequences of the phenylalanine.

72
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:28,490
When we started this program as a nation,
most doctors thought,

73
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,760
well, the PKU children only really
needed to be on this diet for

74
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,110
maybe, I don't know, six or ten years.

75
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,810
And when they took the children off,
they suddenly saw a decrease in

76
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,330
normal markers for development,
they saw drops in IQ,

77
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:50,560
they saw increased learning disabilities,
behavior problems, neurological problems,

78
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,570
like seizures, as well as some personality
disorders pop up in these kids.

79
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:02,820
So it was a hard won piece of evidence,
but right now, where the diet sits is that

80
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:09,880
an average individual should really
stay on it for 20 to 21 years.

81
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,620
As we've done really well at improving
the health of children with PKU,

82
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:21,200
we found one more glitch in
the system we had to fix.

83
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,410
So women with PKU,
who got into their reproductive years and

84
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:34,330
actually had babies presented another
piece of the biological or medical puzzle.

85
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:41,100
Because they had children that
actually had mental retardation,

86
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:46,060
problems with intrauterine growth,
microcephaly, or

87
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,930
even congenital heart defects.

88
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,460
Because the mothers had
gone off of the diet,

89
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,800
they could handle that phenylpyruvate
toxin moving in their system,

90
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,960
but their babies inside
of their wombs could not.

91
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,790
And so another way in which the public
health force then actually helped mothers

92
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:13,950
with PKU is to educate them that when they
want to actually try to become pregnant,

93
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:18,090
they have to return to that
protein restricted diet so

94
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:23,530
that their unborn fetus can
actually grow and thrive.

95
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,680
Newborn screening is one of the best
examples of the use of public health

96
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:34,340
surveillance to actually save
lives in one of these very simple

97
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:40,490
events of taking blood at birth,
sending it to a public health laboratory,

98
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:46,600
and identifying the children that if they
got the right diet at the early stages,

99
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,805
could actually lead very healthy lives.
