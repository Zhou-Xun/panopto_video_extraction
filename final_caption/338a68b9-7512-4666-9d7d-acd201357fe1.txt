00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,980
Hi, my name is Matt Zawistowski.

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,780
I'm a clinical
assistant professor in

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,250
the Department of
Biostatistics at

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,025
the University of Michigan
and like you'll soon be,

5
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:19,610
I'm a graduate of U of M.

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,880
I'm also the instructor
for this course,

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,990
applied longitudinal data
analysis using R. This is

8
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,070
the final course in

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,370
the Biostatistics sequence
for the online MPH program,

10
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,960
so let me congratulate you on

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,640
making it this far and let's

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,810
take a minute to talk about

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,235
the material we'll
cover in this course.

14
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:39,370
You've undoubtedly learned about

15
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,050
many different study designs

16
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,195
in the classes
you've taken so far,

17
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:45,830
in this course, we're going
to focus on one design,

18
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,730
in particular, the
longitudinal study.

19
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,470
In longitudinal studies
we are interested in

20
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,330
how an outcome of
interests changes over

21
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,040
time and identifying factors
that affect that change,

22
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,660
for example, maybe
we're interested in

23
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,075
how cholesterol level
changes as people

24
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:04,430
age and how lifestyle
choices like

25
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,400
diet and exercise
impact that change.

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,590
The key feature of
the longitudinal

27
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,120
design is that measurements of

28
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,040
the outcome are collected
on the same set of

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,425
individuals at
multiple time points,

30
00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:18,710
for example, in the hypothetical
study of cholesterol,

31
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,500
we could imagine collecting
a cholesterol sample from

32
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,325
every person in our cohort
every year, for 10 years.

33
00:01:25,325 --> 00:01:26,900
This type of data has

34
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,450
some really nice features
because it allows us to

35
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,250
observe changes in the outcome

36
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,580
over time within individuals.

37
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,205
However, it can also complicate
our statistical analysis

38
00:01:37,205 --> 00:01:39,380
specifically because we no longer

39
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,200
have independent
measurements of the outcome.

40
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,690
The goals of this course
are to understand

41
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,390
the benefits of using
longitudinal studies

42
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,030
recognized by some of the
statistical methods you have

43
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,925
already learned don't work
for longitudinal data

44
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:55,970
and to learn a new statistical
tool called linear mixed

45
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,410
effects regression that can be

46
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,290
used for longitudinal data,

47
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,773
so let's get started.
