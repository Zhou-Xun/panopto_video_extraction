1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:07,430
Yeah, I know.

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:19,590
Yeah, I guess it's just.

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:29,160
Good morning, everybody. I hope you're enjoying the conjunction of the days when the days get shorter and the mid-terms get longer.

4
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,250
Oh, so today is primarily lecture.

5
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,900
That's because this is the first of two classes on the courts. And the reason you're getting lecture 12 is a couple of reasons.

6
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:48,480
The first one is that this is teeing up what's going to be some fairly interactive reading of actual decisions and amicus briefs for next class.

7
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,630
Asterix Try to book in time to read the Dobbs decision.

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,170
I'll touch on that more trying to read. Actually, we can come prepared to discuss it.

9
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:06,530
And also because what you're going to get today is a slightly heterodox view of how the law works,

10
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,140
because we have a number of things that we need to simultaneously reconcile.

11
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,950
One was the thing in the readings, which is that the Supreme Court in particular,

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,900
but the federal and state courts more generally have been this subject of a decades long,

13
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:25,370
and especially the Supreme Court level, substantially successful effort by the conservative movement to redirect the course of American law.

14
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,880
Which means then if you're not a conservative,

15
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,990
you probably have some very strong views about the Supreme Court and they're not happy and could show the American public would agree with you.

16
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,479
On the other hand, we've just come out of the Trump administration, which had,

17
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,900
shall we say, an unusual attitude towards compliance with the rule of law.

18
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:49,089
And one of the striking things is the extent to which the federal courts did not do what the Trump administration wanted,

19
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,670
including frequently appointees of the Trump administration.

20
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:59,320
So on one hand, law is trending in a direction that conservatives are going to like more than liberals as a result of concentrated,

21
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:07,870
determined political activity. At the same time, it's not it's clearly not just the political instrument that it's often made out to be

22
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:14,440
trying to pick through what's going on there and how it shapes what you can do with them.

23
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,280
On what the law can do to you is what we're going to be talking about today.

24
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:24,280
So it's against the backdrop of the readings you've had, which range from John Roberts rewriting the Affordable Care Act, for example,

25
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:31,209
making Medicaid expansion optional on grounds that had not been seen before through to the absolutely

26
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,920
chockablock slate of Supreme Court decisions that we had last year and that are going on in the coming term,

27
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,150
including the arguments last week. So there's gonna be the classic I talk.

28
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,830
Put your hand up if you've got a question.

29
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:48,129
In some cases, the question might be something I'll answer in two slides, but I would love to be interactive.

30
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:53,080
But equally, this is a view that doesn't have a set of readings behind it that I can easily assemble.

31
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,079
The other point, a lot of the activity of law is basically heartbreaking stuff, right?

32
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,760
Starting a family court. Think your way through the criminal court.

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,690
Think your way through the kinds of issues that lead to rights cases in front of the Supreme Court.

34
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,250
A lot of what the law is about is really, really terrible content.

35
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:15,960
Right. I mean, a bad divorce is emotionally wrenching.

36
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,770
And that's before we even get to some of the cases that involve abuse of children, for example.

37
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:28,850
So a lot of the mechanism of the law, a lot of the socialization of lawyers is precisely to focus on the law of the

38
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:33,290
case and minimize their engagement with the facts of the case and thereby

39
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:39,200
give themselves a cushion right to the same way that doctors can't fully engage with the humanity of people if they're about to cut them open.

40
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:45,500
Lawyers can't fully engage with what's going on in front of them if they're to be competent practitioners who can survive the day.

41
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,070
This is the kind of disassociation necessary for any kind of professions.

42
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:56,659
In the case of political science, it means that we have fields with names like comparative, comparative authoritarianism and research into mass death.

43
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:02,420
And you just have to come up with an intellectual apparatus to think about genocide all day and then go on and make dinner.

44
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,580
What this means is that we're talking about some extremely hot issues.

45
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,170
It's very easy to find out what I think about jobs and the Supreme Court. You just have to go read my writing.

46
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:20,070
But we want to disassociate ourselves from the personal and political stakes as much as possible,

47
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:27,870
because the focus on the political system and the reason to do that is that having strong opinions, as I will explain it, isn't much of law.

48
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:34,049
Understanding the law have shifted is what should the. So that's all we're trying to do.

49
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,150
Understand the place of law and legal system in practice, thinking about the way litigation works.

50
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:45,050
And we'll do more of that next class themselves. Dogs. So Husband Podcast Basic Greetings.

51
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,709
The United States is quite a legal sector than a legal system.

52
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:55,280
We've got 51 plus interconnected legal systems. The plus is because there's all sorts of stuff like specialist federal courts,

53
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,670
court of International Trade, for example, court of claims that you never think about.

54
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,780
And also because there's legal systems, you know, branches of the federal legal system that technically in places like Samoa and Puerto Rico,

55
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:11,450
but the core of the American legal sector is 50 states and the entire federal judiciary.

56
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,460
The federal courts are divided into three levels. District courts try cases.

57
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,490
So if you get yourself put up on some kind of a federal criminal charge, for example,

58
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:28,130
it will be a federal district judge who oversees your trial, which is kind of like your image of most courts.

59
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,650
After that, though, you get an appellate courts, which are two levels circuit and the Supreme Court.

60
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,240
Appellate the word comes from appeal. You don't try facts in an appellate court.

61
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,880
An appellate court is not where you take the. I didn't do it.

62
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,280
The appellate court is where you say there was some kind of error of law which invalidates the conviction.

63
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,540
If it's a criminal case.

64
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:57,950
So what this means is that, for example, if you do something in Texas that might be unconstitutional, people see you in front of a district judge.

65
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:04,130
The district judge makes a decision. But some of the appeals that it goes to the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans, they make a decision.

66
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,960
If somebody appeals that, then it goes to the Supreme Court. To the Supreme Court, which is to take it.

67
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,100
So notice the appellate versus district distinction.

68
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,800
And we're going to be talking in large part about the appellate courts, because what they decide is the law is fundamentally the law.

69
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:28,389
Now state courts are very, very highly variable. They if this is one of these cases where, you know, one state, you know, one state.

70
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:33,040
So and a cardinal error, especially if you actually work in an adjacent law,

71
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,760
to assume that the thing that works in Michigan necessarily works in Indiana.

72
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,820
But states also have their own constitutional law.

73
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:48,669
Right. So you have regular cases which are arguing and we're going to have one in front of the Supreme Court this year.

74
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:55,960
This could potentially be very consequential for American politics. State constitutions are the guiding documents of the state government.

75
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,440
So in a sense, everybody has two constitutions, the federal one governing the federal government and the state, one governing the state government.

76
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,230
And that means that every state has a body of its own constitutional law.

77
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,690
Now, federal judges are appointed for life terms with the, quote, advice and consent, unquote,

78
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,790
to the Senate, which we usually take to mean the Senate has to vote to confirm them.

79
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,240
Because judges are something that matter to both political parties.

80
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:23,100
Judges are voted through on a majority basis to eliminate the filibuster for judicial appointments.

81
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:29,580
Once you get on the bench, no matter how incompetent you are or ideological, you are out of step with the times you are.

82
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,840
You're there for life. It is a very, very high threshold to impeach a federal judge.

83
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:39,550
They have to have done basically a pretty significant crime. Speak to all sorts of systems.

84
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,930
For example, anybody here voted in Michigan. Did you enjoy trying to figure out how to vote for the Supreme Court?

85
00:07:52,100 --> 00:08:01,230
Did you try? We have a phenomenally high rate of what we call roll off in the ballot, roll off, meaning people who vote at the top and then drift out.

86
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,070
And it's really, really high with the Michigan Supreme Court because the quirk of Michigan.

87
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:13,120
Is that on one hand? We admit in every practical way that the Supreme Court is a very, very political body and elections to it matter a lot.

88
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,900
It's going to be deciding whether the Michigan Constitution includes a right to abortion.

89
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,060
That's about as political as you can get in 2022. So the parties endorse candidates.

90
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,250
But we must respect the majesty of the law and not celebrate party politics.

91
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:32,499
So we won't put the party identities on the ballot. Right.

92
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,809
So normally how you vote in Michigan, you say I'm a Republican and you take all Republican in your ballot.

93
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:42,640
You're basically not. You take I'm a Democrat, all Democrat, and have your ballot get done.

94
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:49,540
This elects everything from the governor to the senator for the regents. Well, if you do that, you don't vote in a Supreme Court case at all.

95
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,220
And even if you are politically and you go down and you vote for each individual candidate because you like Whitmer and don't like Biden or something,

96
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,389
you're going along just fine with all these high name recognition people with party labels.

97
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,620
And then you get to people you've probably never heard of, no party I.D. To give you any clues, you vote.

98
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,060
You probably don't. So in other words, if you wish to vote for the extremely important Supreme Court of Michigan,

99
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,620
you have to figure out ahead of time what the parties have endorsed.

100
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:23,550
Right. And, you know, if you're incredibly lucky, driving around Ann Arbor,

101
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,230
you can see a Bernstein Holden sign, which is your only clue as to who the Democrats are.

102
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:34,720
I haven't seen a Republican sign, but then again, I've been in Ann Arbor. So, you know, it's like a PSA, right?

103
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:40,220
The contested race right now is between incumbent Judge Brian Zorra and Democrat Bolden.

104
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,570
And very, very few voters are ever going to know that and they're not going to vote.

105
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,750
That's Michigan. That's Michigan. Former selection.

106
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:55,310
In which we spend an astonishing amount of money to mobilize almost no voters for a very, very important job that people don't understand.

107
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:01,580
So I would be say that's a great way to do it. Every state has some pork filled election method like that.

108
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,130
Now these courts matter. They matter for a lot of public health issues.

109
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:15,530
The Michigan Supreme Court, under a lame duck Republican majority, eliminated our 1946 state of emergency law,

110
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,650
which was the basis for most of Governor Whitmer's powers to combat COVID 19.

111
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,360
We had three states of emergency laws,

112
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:27,860
one required in the seventies and required that the legislature agree to give the governor emergency powers after, I believe, 90 days.

113
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,490
The legislature said they didn't think Gretchen Whitmer needed more powers.

114
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,750
Think back to the mood of the state in 2020 as contested.

115
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:43,339
And so they did last under those powers. So Whitmer said, Ha, here's the 1946 state of emergency law.

116
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,219
I still have powers and went to the state supreme court.

117
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,629
And state supreme court said there's no way we're giving Gretchen Whitmer longstanding state of emergency powers.

118
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:56,540
And they struck it down. Then, of course, that was in the lame duck period when the Republicans were about to lose their majority.

119
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,829
Right. So if the case had arrived a month or two later, it would have been upheld straightforwardly.

120
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:06,380
Political decision here. If the Democrats had been in charge, Whitmer would have kept the powers and we'd still have the 1946 law.

121
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:15,339
Which means now any pretty trivial, any actual public health measures being taken in response to COVID 19 or under the public health code?

122
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,570
And we don't really have anything but the 1976 very limited state of emergency.

123
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:26,050
I go through all that because that's the basis for essentially everything that was done to combat COVID 19 for a couple of years.

124
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,980
And you'll notice that the salient question is basically, should Governor Whitmer,

125
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:34,810
a very concrete person who happens to be a Democrat, have powers that you don't normally have?

126
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:40,420
And the decision was made in straight party line votes in the state Supreme Court that people can vote for on party lines.

127
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:49,520
Now they also matter for the health of our overall democracy. The rule of law is key to democracy and protection of rights.

128
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:53,310
If you take an American citizenship test, it says, what is the rule of law?

129
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,150
And the multiple choice question that is correct and I like this is nobody is above the law.

130
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:05,860
The law applies equally to everybody. And this is absolutely crucial because if you apply the law to everybody,

131
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,610
that's really powerful because what a lot of people want is the law for them, but not for me.

132
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:17,350
Right. But a lot of people's preferences is that I have a limited rights and you don't have rights if they bother interfere with my activities.

133
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:22,930
So applying the law impartially is a big deal. This is the argument we're having right now about Mar a Lago.

134
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:31,840
Essentially, the judge, the district judge who is blocking FBI review of documents seized from Mar a Lago is doing it

135
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,470
on the grounds that Donald Trump is so important that he shouldn't have the law applied it.

136
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,570
And that is why the 11th Circuit, the appellate courts, to whom this decision was appealed,

137
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:47,740
first struck down what she'd said and then proceeded to go on front page after page, absolutely roasting her decision.

138
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,850
Because what they want to say is this is radioactive. This is toxic.

139
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:59,620
You will glow in the dark if you try this argument to get you will be done with American legal credibility in the American legal system.

140
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,889
Why did they do that? Because it was about the rule of law.

141
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:07,030
It was about testing the basic thesis that some people are so important that the law doesn't apply to.

142
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,040
But what is the law? What happens if the law is systematically biased?

143
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,060
I don't think you have too hard time thinking of ways in which the law is systematically biased.

144
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,720
I'd be surprised if you argued otherwise.

145
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:27,440
And likewise, the law is always being driven and pulled and pushed in one ideological direction or another, which means you can always be outraged.

146
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,590
Half the population can always be outraged about the direction that the lawsuit.

147
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,250
So figuring out what is the law is a large conceptual problem.

148
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:41,630
And here's what we're going to pass through the mirror and the law allows. What do you want?

149
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:49,760
The law. You want predictability. If the Panera in the basement building catches fire and it does half a million dollars worth of damage.

150
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:54,220
Who pays for it? You want a nice, clear question?

151
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,830
If Panera catches fire insurance company, whatever pays to fix it.

152
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:07,360
That's what you hire a lawyer to do. If I write my will this way that my grandkids will get the house.

153
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,550
If I arrange a divorce this way, then I will get the cat.

154
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,920
Whatever. The problem is, all legal documents have some gaps.

155
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:24,520
Take, for example, the September 11th attacks, which happened when the buildings were in the middle of being sold.

156
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:30,610
So you had four parties. You had the people who had just sold the buildings and hadn't received the money yet.

157
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:38,560
You had the guy who just bought the buildings and had the money. You had the old insurer on the buildings and you had the bridge insurer.

158
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:45,160
Who? The old insurer, meaning the person who is the company that was insuring the previous owners who hadn't yet really got rid of the building.

159
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,330
And you had the bridge insurer contracted by the new purchaser to make sure there was some cover.

160
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,969
They had insurance policies written on the assumption that the kind of things that happened to the World

161
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,560
Trade Center in New York is that the pioneer catches fire and does half a million dollars worth of damage.

162
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:06,980
Guess what? Nobody had written any insurance contracts on the basis that both World Trade Center

163
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,280
towers would be knocked down on one morning in the middle of the transaction.

164
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:17,040
Right. That's what we mean by incomplete contracts. Not one hospital in America, as far as we can tell,

165
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:23,850
is contracting for PPE and other equipment in 2019 on any basis that anticipated what happened to them in 2020.

166
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,840
Because of this, contracts are all necessarily incomplete. Things happen that aren't anticipated.

167
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:39,170
Right. The electoral counterpart had been applied with essentially the vice president in a ceremonial role since the 19th century.

168
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:45,740
Well, Donald Trump's lawyers thought, wait a minute, how about if the vice president isn't a ceremonial role?

169
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,680
How about if the vice president actually triggers a different set of actions than you can read into the law,

170
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,300
which would lead to questioning the validity of electoral votes from three states?

171
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,870
Well, suddenly we discovered the Electoral Count Act is actually quite hard to read and understand.

172
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,010
Like if you try to do it as a flowchart, you get just the math and you don't understand what's going on.

173
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,020
So, Judge, his job is to create predictability.

174
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:15,590
Where the contracts are and complete the job of judges is to enunciate principles that allow us to figure out who pays when the

175
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:20,810
World Trade Center towers are both completely destroyed in the middle of a transaction and governing their ownership and interests.

176
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:26,720
Judges are there to say how you update constitutional rights to reflect current events.

177
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,340
So, for example, what is cruel and unusual punishment?

178
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,360
Does the definition of cruel and unusual punishment change over the last couple of hundred years?

179
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,160
It's up to judges to enunciate the principles that allow the rest of us to fill in the gaps there.

180
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:48,990
This is why they care so much about precedent. Because on what basis do I as a lawyer say if you do X, then Y will follow?

181
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:54,090
Maybe I've got what they call a black letter law. Maybe you can go look at the law and see if X and Y is the code.

182
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,340
But often it'll be the effects that why?

183
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:03,950
Because courts regularly decide this. How do you ensure that courts regularly say effects than why?

184
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,840
Because they refer to other courts saying it.

185
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:16,329
So it's kind of explicitly a herd mentality and it's a herd mentality because the point of the legal sector is to give us the predictability is

186
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:22,450
to make sure that you don't get judges deciding based on whether they like to look at you or they're in a good mood that morning or something.

187
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:28,229
Doesn't always work. No. You know, there's some little studies showing, for example,

188
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:32,640
that you get harsher sentences in the afternoon in some courts because everyone's tired and wants to go home.

189
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,830
Throwing him in jail is the way to do that. But.

190
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:44,320
The precedent is really important because it allows everybody to anticipate what will happen if you do X as agreed of what's likely to happen is why.

191
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:50,170
Now, this is about rules of judging, but it's also fundamentally about the nature of the law.

192
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:58,940
In many ways it's about what is the point of a lawyer? Because and it explains why the legal system was resistant to Trump's actions.

193
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,500
What do I mean by that? Put aside the rules.

194
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:08,390
Put aside the ACLU. You remember the Muslim ban in 2017.

195
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,030
Bear in mind that one of the things that happened was people from countries,

196
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,250
Muslim countries put on the list can come to the United States by executive order.

197
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,190
They were on the airplanes. Right. So you're just flying along watching a movie.

198
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,299
You land and suddenly discover that you're basically going to be detained at

199
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,080
JFK until the United States throws you out on a very questionable legal basis.

200
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:41,660
This meant that suddenly there was an urgent need for legal representation at SFO and L.A.X. and JFK airports and so forth.

201
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,480
So there was a big demonstration outside.

202
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:49,819
And let's just say of the many things I never thought I'd see a giant political demonstration in the baggage claim.

203
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,390
And Detroit Metro was definitely on that list. Very weird.

204
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,250
But you also had lawyers demanding the right to give counsel.

205
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:07,130
And were these lawyers, public defenders and lefties and law professors and ACLU activists, a bunch of them were $3,000 an hour Wall Street partners.

206
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:18,010
Trust me, it's not because you have uniform liberalism among the $3,000 an hour Wall Street lawyers who normally do M&A for you.

207
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:26,470
It's because they, on some level more or less articulated, understood that what they were looking at was lawlessness.

208
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,870
And lawlessness is not something lawyers like.

209
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,079
They were looking at something that was fundamentally outside the legal code as they understood what are they

210
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,700
there to defend some poor guy from Yemen whose flight had suddenly taken a terrible turn for the worse?

211
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:44,350
Possibly. But there's lots of nice things you can do for your fellow man without going to jail.

212
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:50,410
Capable of the nice. They were there to defend the law because what is the point of the $3,000 an hour lawyer?

213
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:56,290
If the executive action can overcome it, if executive action can say no, X needs to Z because I said so.

214
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,010
This is inculcated into lawyers have to have the law enough to have the precedent.

215
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,430
It is a moral offense to not do that.

216
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:13,920
It also means, of course, that they really care about their writing. I mean, a lot of problems right here, Professor.

217
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,950
You seen some of the stuff? We have to wait to see some of the stuff we have to write. But legal writing is bad in a different way.

218
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:25,740
Because what it's focused on is how to specify X and Y.

219
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:32,680
So a real story. A friend of mine was involved in adjudicating a decision as a clerk.

220
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:40,589
And. The black letter law, and the precedent pointed to an absolutely absurd outcome,

221
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,940
like just one where you look at it, it was a business case, so you don't have to get to morally involved.

222
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,680
But the outcome would have just been facially stupid, would have been a ridiculous thing to do.

223
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:58,710
And he wrote, therefore, and the judge approved the line that the inherent power of the Department of Commerce allows this to happen.

224
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,280
Because that avoided a stupid outcome in the particular case. So he completed an incomplete contract.

225
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:11,700
By referring to something that struck him and the judge as obvious, which was the inherent power of the Department of Commerce.

226
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,020
Guess what?

227
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:23,070
A few months later, a case is filed and somebody is invoking the precedent of the inherent power of the Department of Commerce to do something else.

228
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:30,660
So he created a fix for one problem, unable to anticipate what use future lawyers would put to it.

229
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:38,260
And that's why legal writing is so careful. They care about precedent and the precedent that has to be well written because

230
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,980
you have to figure out without knowing what's going to happen in the future,

231
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,670
what kinds of things are going to be done with the precedent that you create.

232
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,570
Furthermore, really good judges then are going to say, actually, I think I know how to do this.

233
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:59,780
And that's the trail of principles. Right. Just the chief justice, John Roberts, is extremely good at this.

234
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:06,740
You read decisions and especially his decisions as a very subtle book of instructions.

235
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:12,590
You read them as instructions on how to get the outcomes that you want from him in the future.

236
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:19,100
And so, for example, Roberts has had two major campaigns. One is that he doesn't like regulation of private business,

237
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:24,320
and he'd like to diminish the federal government's discretion to regulate private business without legislation.

238
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:29,880
And the general would like to diminish it. And he really doesn't like most of the Voting Rights Act.

239
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:34,770
He's really not interested in ballot expansion. That's been a provocation since undergrad.

240
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:41,079
He was writing for the college newspaper about it. And so if you trace the voting rights cases,

241
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:46,450
you can watch Roberts over and over again write opinions in which he says exactly what state

242
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:51,640
governments need to do and their attorneys need to do in order to take the next step in narrowing them.

243
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:58,600
And what he's he's doing is he's creating precedent after precedent to shape away parts of a piece of policy that he doesn't like.

244
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,010
In this case, the Voting Rights Act.

245
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:06,340
And likewise, he's creating precedent after precedent after precedents to reduce the regulatory power of government,

246
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,439
make it harder for government to act,

247
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:16,900
regulate it, to regulate in a flexible and quick manner, slow it down, and thereby allow private actors to have less government in their lives.

248
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:24,580
Two perfectly conventional conservative objectives. But the way he's doing it is the way that is best suited to the way the courts work,

249
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,330
which is that he's creating precedent after precedent after precedent.

250
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,219
So when you read Dobbs, Dobbs is as I said, it's an instruction book.

251
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:38,180
It's an instruction book written by Samuel Alito on how to take a couple of next steps.

252
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:43,809
The one that Alito is most keen on is he wants to make clear that he will lead a

253
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:48,130
majority in striking down any kind of a legislative effort to entrench Roe versus Wade.

254
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:53,710
So one of the things Democrats are talking about doing is entrenching old versus late in life.

255
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,250
They get a Senate majority. That doesn't depend on Joe Manchin in the next election.

256
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:05,630
If they do that. Alito has written very clearly on the Dobbs decision how he will lead the court majority and striking that down.

257
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:09,980
So that's one of the many constitutional tie ups we might be having in a year or two.

258
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,060
Likewise, he's also written how he will how attorneys will defend before him.

259
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,350
The national ban on abortion that he'd like to see.

260
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:28,069
Right. So he's basically written the script for the next case and everybody knows how it works.

261
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,530
And what he's doing is is signaling if you bring this to me,

262
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:35,060
if you bring a fetal personhood more to me, I will approve it if it's written in this way.

263
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,100
And if you bring a national legislative entrenchment of abortion rights to me,

264
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,220
I will strike it down in this way on the grounds that a fetus is a person.

265
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:51,350
And so all these things are instruction books. And therefore don't think about Davos or any of these decisions as the end.

266
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:57,170
They're not just the beginning. They're always the beginning and also the beginning of things you didn't anticipate.

267
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,460
What an amazing place. They had a lot of drawbacks there. Slow the reactors.

268
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:12,290
It depends on your bringing in place. Well, first of all, they're inescapably political.

269
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:19,260
Don't believe anybody who says the law is not political. Right? Because if you are regulating what the Clean Air Act means,

270
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:27,900
if you're regulating what happens to people who arrive at the U.S. border without documents, if you're regulating what's done with uteruses?

271
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:32,580
These are intensely political questions. You can no more take the politics out of it than you take the idea.

272
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:40,290
Therefore, the courts simply therefore everyone else in the political system knows it.

273
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,900
All our political elites will hold off on the voters for a second because they're an interesting story.

274
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:57,470
It would be incredibly remiss of any politician if you think this way to appoint a judge who's not on the team.

275
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,640
Right. It would be incredibly remiss to say this person is brilliant legal scholar.

276
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:07,999
I happen to disagree with them. But nonetheless, this is such a good lawyer that I think that this is what Harvard,

277
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,430
Yale law professors like to say whenever a judge hits the news, is that he's a very lovely person, a brilliant scholar.

278
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,190
You'll be glad to know that everybody on the federal bench is a brilliant scholar.

279
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:21,259
The reason Harvard and Yale professors write that is that they want their students to get clerkships with these people.

280
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:27,800
And obviously, brown nosing a Supreme Court judge in Bloomberg is an effective way to increase the odds that your students get clerkships.

281
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,500
Sorry, it's that group signature system, basically.

282
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,810
And insulting Supreme Court judges reduces the odds that they're going to like seeing anybody from your school.

283
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:43,020
So Democrats are going to appoint Democrats. Republicans are going to appoint Republicans.

284
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:49,500
Furthermore, within the parties, and especially on the Republican side, it's much more organized in the Federalist Society.

285
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,660
You're going to have people who have years and years of background, but everybody knows how they think.

286
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:02,760
Their social worlds, their intellectual approach and their entire careers are tied up with being conservative judges, conservative lawyers.

287
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:09,209
And you see this in the career trajectories. Broadly, the legal profession as a whole is is liberal, not very lofty.

288
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,420
But, you know, they're a bit to the left of the center of the political spectrum as a whole.

289
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:21,600
And it would appear that when you get to the appellate level, suddenly being a conservative, which is comparatively rare, really improves your career.

290
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:31,120
Right. So if your goal is the Supreme Court. And you can find a way to get through the initial stages when liberals are doing the hiring.

291
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:35,890
Once you get to the level of being considered for an appellate position in the federal government,

292
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,330
you you are your career would be best enhanced by being a conservative.

293
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:47,050
Because there's a machine built in place precisely to redress the liberal bias of the legal system as a whole.

294
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,130
So. Therefore,

295
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:58,850
we're going to treat judges as political actors and we and political parties are going to treat them as political actors and act accordingly,

296
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:06,880
particularly given that it's pretty sweet. I mean, who wouldn't want to have a lifelong legislative seat subject to nothing so sweet?

297
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:13,670
No. And the sanctions against them are mostly social. If you spend all your time in leftie, liberal legal circles,

298
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:17,930
and then you suddenly come out as a blazing libertarian or something, you're going to lose a lot of friends.

299
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:21,680
You're going to you know, it's going to hurt. So you tend not to.

300
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:29,600
Now it's also asymmetrical. If you think what you want is popular and can be legislated, you might choose to do that.

301
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:34,680
So to the extent that you want something unpopular, you're going to be especially interested in the legal system.

302
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,900
This cuts both ways. People, by and large, are into drinking clean water.

303
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,870
People, by and large, are into breathing clean air. So if you're objections are to the Clean Water Act, to the Clean Air Act.

304
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,110
You're going to have a special interest in the courts because they're a way to get what you want.

305
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:56,699
On the other side, there's an infinite number of individual rights that don't pertain to corporations,

306
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:04,620
that don't involve making money that liberals care about, and they likewise want the courts to defend minorities against the tyranny of the majority.

307
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:10,360
So it goes both ways. The politics, though, looks different because the law looks different.

308
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:14,150
Go back to what I said about president. So we'll tell you the story.

309
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:21,560
In 1964, a married couple brought the case, Griswold versus Connecticut, in which they argued that a 19th century Comstock Law,

310
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:26,600
most of the sexual regulation at the state level, recalled Comstock Laws after the influential Anthony Comstock.

311
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,820
And they said they'd like to use contraception within their marriage.

312
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,729
As you know, this is a very hot and hotly debated political question in the United States in 2022,

313
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:41,980
whether or not a married couple can use contraception in their home. While in Connecticut at the time was illegal.

314
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:47,040
And in Griswold versus Connecticut, the court said, this is nonsense.

315
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:55,000
Just on the intuitive level, you shouldn't have the government interfering with whether or not a married couple uses contraception, said the court.

316
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:58,430
But they can't say this is stupid. They have to formulate something.

317
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,040
And so they found in the Constitution the right to privacy.

318
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:07,340
In other words, they said, if you look at the whole mass of enumerated rights in the Constitution,

319
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:14,090
you will find that there is a broad right to privacy, the right against search and seizure, the right against having soldiers quartered in your house,

320
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:16,400
the right to free expression, the right to religious freedom.

321
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:23,389
This all adds up to a basic right to privacy, which the first instantiation in a majority opinion was Griswald versus Connecticut.

322
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:28,550
Your right to privacy entails your rights as a married couple have contraception without the state of Connecticut being involved.

323
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:36,050
Well. You have a right to privacy. What else does this mean?

324
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,600
It might mean that your right to privacy extends to same sex marriage.

325
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:50,550
The Obergefell decision. It might mean that your right to privacy extends to overturning Virginia's ban on interracial marriage.

326
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:57,230
Racist call it miscegenation. It might mean that you have a right to an abortion.

327
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:01,540
Roe versus Wade. All of these are drawing on the precedent. Right?

328
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:06,400
So watch it. We created the court creates the right to privacy in Griswold versus Connecticut.

329
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,040
And the right to privacy then develops new cases and new issues arise.

330
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:15,570
Is same sex sex legitimate? Right to privacy says it is.

331
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:19,350
Is same sex marriage legitimate? Right to privacy says it is.

332
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:23,220
Is abortion legitimate? Right to privacy says it is. You see how this is working?

333
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,230
These are all fruit of Griswald versus Connecticut.

334
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:33,980
You might be interested to know that Clarence Thomas and his concurrence on the Dobbs decision says Griswold was wrongly decided.

335
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:44,130
So Alito, in the majority opinion says no. The trio of the right to privacy that has grown since night it since the 1960s.

336
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,739
We're just going to seal off one limb that was wrongly decided. This bridge called abortion doesn't need to be there.

337
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,340
We're going to be the arborists of the Constitution sawed off and put it in the woodchipper.

338
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,710
Thomas says, Oh, no, no, no, no. There's no right to privacy in the Constitution.

339
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,840
In which case. Among other entertainments, Thomas lives in Virginia.

340
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:11,139
If you strike down Griswold, you have to avoid striking down loving versus Virginia,

341
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:14,020
which is the law that would invalidate his marriage because he's married to a white woman.

342
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:20,530
You will notice that Thomas's concurrence does not specify Loving versus Virginia as

343
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,830
one of the cases that would have to go if you got rid of the wrongly decided Griswold.

344
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:30,010
Layers and layers, right. Also notice the dates.

345
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:36,360
Look at how slow this stuff is. So right after Trump's election in 2017, there were panels around here.

346
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:41,320
A lot of families had a lot of panels. We had to talk through every possible implication of the Trump election.

347
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:47,709
It was really quite the environment in the school. And I got up and I said, Roe versus Wade is dead and you're probably going to lose Griswold.

348
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:50,770
And I got two answers. What do you mean? It's dead? And what's Griswold?

349
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,460
And I said, You just have to wait. It will be wait. Is this a dead decision? Walking.

350
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,969
And I was right. And the only question is, is Griswold at that decision?

351
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:03,030
Walker. And if it is, look at all the other things that go.

352
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,580
I have absolutely no idea what the political blowback that this would be.

353
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:12,600
We also have no idea what the political blowback of Dobbs is even going to be.

354
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:26,980
But we're going to get a lot about that next month. It's a different sort of custody and can like as it happens, that is the way it goes.

355
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:35,140
But there's something to be done. The different precedent is found that occurred before.

356
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:43,520
Part of the muscle that's so much likely to be happy.

357
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,030
You just have to deal the. That was a really good question.

358
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,600
Okay. Which amounts to can you put dollars back?

359
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,360
Can you say so, Robert? Can you say Dobbs was wrongly decided and Samuel Alito doesn't know how to do his legal history?

360
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:09,440
So. I'll talk into this thing while I fix the microphone.

361
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:19,740
Ever. I believe that.

362
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:29,440
The answer is broadly and this leads you down one [INAUDIBLE] of a legal history rabbit hole.

363
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:40,030
Courts don't like to overturn any kind of precedent, so the technique is to make the precedent so constricted in use.

364
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:46,060
That it doesn't apply to anything. Right? So the previous future of Roe v Wade until Trump's election.

365
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:54,500
Was that it was going to gradually have to five for court with Anthony Kennedy as the swing vote make it harder and harder to actually apply.

366
00:34:55,340 --> 00:35:02,870
So what you do is you just say gradually decrease the cases in which X leads to Y until there's ultimately no x leads to Y,

367
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:09,049
there's no ability to actually apply Roe versus Wade because it's been wanted by all these other cases,

368
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:12,140
say, for example, how states can regulate abortion providers.

369
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:17,230
That was the plan. And it was working.

370
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:23,680
It was getting harder and harder to get an abortion. And that's the plan for the Voting Rights Act is to eventually just make it so that

371
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,069
the Voting Rights Act starts all the decisions upholding the Voting Rights Act,

372
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:33,510
Stan. But there are so many exceptions to the Voting Rights Act that from a policy point of view, you might as well not have a Voting Rights Act.

373
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,980
So you could do that to Dobbs. You can start carving out exceptions to Dobbs.

374
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:43,089
Now, Dobbs is also a very, very I don't want to say crude,

375
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:47,980
but it's a real sledgehammer of a decision because it says the previous precedent is just flat out wrong.

376
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,330
And that's something you don't do much.

377
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:57,309
I think there's a sense in which Plessy versus Ferguson, which was the separate but equal decision, hasn't really been overruled.

378
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:00,910
It's just been given so many exceptions that you can't actually apply it.

379
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:07,530
Likewise the reconstruction amendments. I'm amazed nobody's asking me about Justice Jackson yet.

380
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:16,540
But look, the reconstruction amendments were essentially given so many exceptions that they weren't allowed to fulfill their main objective.

381
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:20,620
Those are the ones passed after the Civil War to end slavery and ensure the blacks would have the votes.

382
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,280
They get the same thing in business regulation. Right.

383
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:32,510
So we have this rather extraordinary effort to either chop off the branch called abortion or chop down the whole tree of privacy,

384
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:38,150
depending on whether you're listening to Alito and whether you think he's arguing in good faith or whether they're listening to Thomas.

385
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,220
We sit in the major questions doctrine. So West Virginia versus EPA.

386
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:48,990
This is the state of West Virginia suing the EPA on the grounds that the EPA did not have

387
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:53,400
the statutory authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon dioxide emissions,

388
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:59,639
greenhouse gases. And the thing is, if the plain text of the statute says the EPA does, right.

389
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,850
So if you went around and got a bunch of one L's and sat them down and they looked at,

390
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:06,210
they'd say, the EPA has this authority, but the federal courts said they had authority.

391
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:12,120
I remember I said Justice Roberts doesn't like regulation.

392
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,899
So what you'll notice is if you go back and there's a CRC report with all of us writing for this class,

393
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:25,050
but I figured leaving a CRC report on the evolution of the major questions doctrine was the last thing you needed in the middle of the semester.

394
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:33,329
It had been getting dropped into concurrences and dissents and majority opinions, and it was never the dominant legal concept.

395
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:40,380
But it meant that when West Virginia versus EPA came before the court, they could say, here is a body of precedent,

396
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:46,590
that there's a thing called the major questions doctrine and the major questions doctrine therefore didn't look like what it was,

397
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:49,710
which is something that just came blasting out of the head of John Roberts.

398
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,000
Instead, it looked like something that's been growing and evolving in the legal literature,

399
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,660
just like my friend who accidentally created the inherent power of the Department of Commerce.

400
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:04,700
The major questions doctrine is that there are some questions that are so important to

401
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:09,050
on policy grounds that the plain text of the legislation shouldn't try to guide them.

402
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:16,430
And instead the court should say, this is an overextension of the law because it's such a major question and Congress should have to legislate new.

403
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,940
If I just put it to you that way, it's bananas, right? Congress writes a law. Congress chooses not to amend the law.

404
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:30,680
Congress chooses not to repeal the law. The court comes along and says the agency implementing the law has exceeded the law.

405
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:37,520
Because we have decided that there needs to be an additional standard, after which it's such a big deal that we need to have a new law.

406
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,360
If you just say that as if it occurred to you one morning, you're going to be laughed out of law school.

407
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:47,910
But. If you can show how it developed in the system,

408
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:54,990
a precedent for appearing in dissents and concurrences and as a kind of throwaway line in major decisions, it has more plausibility.

409
00:38:55,470 --> 00:39:00,240
And you give lawyers and judges more confidence that this is actually a thing that they can define and litigate.

410
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:09,900
Now go back to the question of why you believe Wall Street lawyers were hanging out at SFO or JFK.

411
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:23,600
I'm sorry. I just. If you got to help me with the question.

412
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:31,480
Perfect question. Logically, yes. If the right to privacy doesn't exist.

413
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:37,190
Which is what you would what would be the effect of overrule the Griswald is get rid of the right to privacy.

414
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:43,610
Then what you would see is a sweep or operation where everybody doesn't like same sex marriage would immediately file a lawsuit

415
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:50,569
saying we wish to reinstate our state level bans on same sex marriage because same sex marriage depends on the right to privacy.

416
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:53,330
And the right to privacy was eliminated by overruling Griswold.

417
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:59,730
Now you could write some narrowly tailored decisions saying that married people can't use contraception.

418
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,920
But the right to privacy is intact. But I have trouble imagining who would do that.

419
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:07,320
Why they would. So if you strike down the right to privacy.

420
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:12,830
Then it's on Clarence Thomas to explain how his marriage is not a violation of the law of the state of Virginia.

421
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:23,179
Enjoying this. Because there's a lot of these laws.

422
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:30,620
Right. Michigan has a law from 1931 banning abortion. It's been stayed because a state judge thinks it might violate the state constitution.

423
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,919
That's going to go to the state Supreme Court, which is having an election in November.

424
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,130
So that's kind of important. Remember Zahra Bolden?

425
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,120
But equally,

426
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:46,549
what the courts would prefer to have happen is the referendum gives them a decisive steer as to what the population of the state of Michigan wants.

427
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:52,220
Right. So if the ballot measure to entrench a right to abortion in the Michigan State Constitution passes,

428
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:58,069
then the courts will breathe a big sigh of relief and say, we're done with this if you actually see it right now.

429
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:01,760
The Republican candidate for governor, Tudor Dixon, is extremely opposed to abortion.

430
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,480
She appears to have it no exceptions whatsoever back, including life of the mother.

431
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:10,390
So what's her line, given that this is not the majority opinion in the state of Michigan,

432
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,050
what's this poor politician to do when she's trying to win the race? She says it's a settled question.

433
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,630
The Michigan Constitution is settled. So you shouldn't vote for governor on the basis of it.

434
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:24,310
This happens to be wrong, but you can see why.

435
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,040
If I have very prominently held a position that could cost me the election,

436
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:31,850
I'm suddenly going to say that's actually not relevant to the governor's race.

437
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:38,690
It's absolutely the classic move to make in her position. So nobody really wants this hot potato, which is why a lot of courts,

438
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:43,370
especially and candidates would actually be grateful to have abortion entrenched in the Michigan Constitution.

439
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:50,050
Because from a straightforwardly political election winning point of view, the Republicans are like the dog with the car.

440
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:57,429
Now they're the ones who have to explain why maternal and fetal medicine specialists

441
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:01,870
and gynecologists and obstetricians and prescribing bedrest for ectopic pregnancies.

442
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:11,070
In Ohio. I mean, basically, the Mayo Clinic isn't doing like two thirds of the women's health stuff that it used to do because it's illegal.

443
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,800
Abortion is part of the standard of care for a lot of things.

444
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:22,920
So if the referendum passes, my bet is on a mayo Clinic branch in Detroit containing all the stuff to do with babies.

445
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,720
And that's avoid deciding on procedural grounds. Right.

446
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:32,440
The Michigan Supreme Court would like to avoid it deciding on the Michigan Constitution's courage

447
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,790
protections or lack of protections for abortion rights by having the voters solve the problem for them.

448
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:43,000
To Dickson would like to have the voters solve the problem for her because it's not helping her campaign for governor.

449
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:50,080
Gretchen Whitmer, of course, is campaigning explicitly on it. So you avoid deciding on procedural grounds.

450
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:54,739
For example, one of the first cases I ever read was Belarus versus Hardwick,

451
00:42:54,740 --> 00:43:00,460
which is the Texas case that said that it is constitutional to ban gay sex parties.

452
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:03,710
There's about two gay men who were thought to be having sex by sheriff's deputies.

453
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:10,100
The key thing is there were about ten procedural reasons why that should have never got anywhere near the Supreme Court,

454
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:14,090
starting with why was the sheriff's deputy upstairs in their house?

455
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,940
Everybody should have been there.

456
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:26,080
But the court wanted to make the decision, so they overlooked the procedural grounds and thus what should have been the trivial.

457
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,739
Throw the case out because the sheriff's deputy shouldn't have even been on the property.

458
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:35,170
Turns into a ratification of a ban on gay sex and stayed that way in the courts for 20 years, 20 plus years.

459
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:43,600
But alternatively, you can avoid deciding on procedural grounds. Why did it take 1973 until 1973 to turn Ruby this way?

460
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:50,259
Because in this case, it's the doctrine of standing. Standing means that you have an interest.

461
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:56,890
That means that you can legitimately be involved in this case if you don't have standing, you're at most a friend of the court writing that's.

462
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:04,580
So standing means you're directly affected. Who is directly affected and capable of filing a lawsuit?

463
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:09,290
When we're dealing with the right to abortion. The answer is somebody is pregnant.

464
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:19,540
Guess what? You have essentially no chance of getting to the Supreme Court in seven ish months, not even night.

465
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:23,560
If by some miracle you figure out that you're pregnant within hours.

466
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,870
Therefore, by the time any case actually made it to the federal appellate courts.

467
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:32,830
The baby had been had, and there it was moot. Nobody has any standing.

468
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:36,219
That's a procedural dodge, right? It's transparently stupid.

469
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:40,240
You can't litigate anything to do with pregnancy because the baby is born by the time it gets to the court.

470
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:44,020
That's what you do as a judge if you don't want to think about this.

471
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:48,990
And you'll see judges who just really on procedural grounds just don't want the case.

472
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,770
All those judges who previously said, I deny your abortion rights case on grounds of standing,

473
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:58,150
what they were really saying is I have found a procedural workaround to avoid thinking about this, and I like that.

474
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:04,480
Then there's find a reason why a holding does not apply to your specific case.

475
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,890
This is what I mean about anybody. So if the Supreme Court says X versus Y.

476
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:15,290
You say, Ah, but it's not X, it looks like X. But here's the real reason it's not X.

477
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:19,129
It looks like a major question, but the major questions doctrine,

478
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:24,860
as we see of these ten faces citing the major questions doctrine requires that it involve West Virginia.

479
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:28,670
I don't know. It requires that it involves some other characteristic. That means it doesn't apply.

480
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,330
That's what I said. Where what you do, if you want to get rid of it,

481
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:37,680
the subtle way is you gradually say Roe versus Wade doesn't quite apply because other

482
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,250
precedents say that you could shave away this piece of it without touching Roe.

483
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,050
Voting Rights Act doesn't quite apply because we're creating exceptions to it.

484
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:51,250
It doesn't hold. And that allows courts to leave precedent alone.

485
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:58,479
Quite a few of the rights of black Americans and only black Americans come from the Commerce Clause because even the reconstruction amendments,

486
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:06,310
which were explicitly written and intended and vastly documented to be about redressing the racial inequality clause by slavery.

487
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:11,740
The Court still didn't want to get rid of things like Plessy versus Ferguson or Dred Scott completely.

488
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:15,850
And so they found a different, strong basis on which to validate the decision.

489
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:22,410
Everybody else has rights in the 14th Amendment. But if you're black, a bunch of your rights actually come from the court,

490
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:26,820
from the Commerce Clause, despite the fact that the Constitution says exactly the reverse.

491
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,740
Furthermore, by the way, it's hard to get the right case.

492
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:37,050
Notice how, when I gave you the story of a case I started in Texas and I routed it through the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans.

493
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:44,240
That's because the Fifth Circuit is at the moment an incredibly ideological, unpredictable conservative court.

494
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:51,469
So nobody really wants to file constitutional cases up here because the court that governs us is kind of considered.

495
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:57,500
The circuit court that governs this is kind of conservative, but basically what the ninth is quite liberal.

496
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:04,430
The fifth will provide precedent and they will wave cases through on all sorts of grounds.

497
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:10,850
For example, they passed the Texas they accepted the Texas Bounty Hunter case on the grounds that nobody had standing,

498
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:15,110
because at no point was the state of Texas responsible for the law that it had created.

499
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,510
Now the Supreme Court is eventually going to strike that down because a abortion is the government of otherwise.

500
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:28,820
And B, the logical next step is for California to say, ha ha, let's have a bounty hunter law on guns.

501
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:35,600
And if you have a gun. Anywhere touching California or California.

502
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:43,130
Then, under the logic of the business of the Texas law, a bounty hunter could come take your gun and demand that you give him a $10,000 reward.

503
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:48,500
California could pass that law, and it would be constitutional under the terms set up by the Fifth Circuit in their abortion decision.

504
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,650
Do you think any judge of any description wants that world?

505
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,260
And certainly California is very aware of it, right.

506
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:01,950
I mean, I think they're just basically holding on to it to do it as some sort of a political stunt.

507
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:08,249
But unless as long as the Texas Bounty Hunter Law stays, you can actually have a California bounty hunter law for guns.

508
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:12,750
And my God, that would be a shootout at the okay Corral all up and down the Nevada border.

509
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,750
So that's why the Fifth Circuit matters is that you can bring cases and they will push them

510
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:25,210
up and give them the imprimatur and the legal argumentation of a federal circuit court.

511
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:32,200
Donald Trump lives in Mar a Lago, which means that a district court judge with a michigan law degree, by the way,

512
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:37,239
was able to basically say, I have a new version of the rule of law that applies only to Donald Trump.

513
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:42,100
And the 11th Circuit did what judges normally do, which is that they put it in the woodchipper right there.

514
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:43,290
That's why they wrote this law.

515
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:49,420
And the long decision went through basically every paragraph of her decision saying wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.

516
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,660
Meaning of which. Don't ever bring this argument before another federal judge ever.

517
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:06,770
Now, what about the sense? Top line of descent is is is a pity party.

518
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:10,669
It is where? SOTOMAYOR okay, good. Oh.

519
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:14,360
JACKSON Right. About why they don't like what the majority did.

520
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:23,750
You'd always rather have the majority, but. Think about how closed and self-referential the law is, right?

521
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,900
What is American constitutional law of abortion today? It is Dobbs.

522
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:37,070
You can have any theory about that, if you like, about the desirability or historical appropriateness of something other than Dobbs.

523
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:46,010
But the law of the land is Dobbs. It has been officially ruled, and that's that, because lawyers job is not to tell you what the law should be.

524
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:51,230
The lawyer's job is to tell you what the law is. And the law is what the Supreme Court said the law is.

525
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:59,970
So all those little tricks on the top half of the slide are about ways to avoid imply doing what the law says it is.

526
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:06,440
Where did the defense fit in there? They're the only way to introduce alternatives into the model.

527
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:11,650
So let's say you're in favor of abortion rights and you're very unhappy about those.

528
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:20,380
The dissents map out permissible, highly prestigious, highly validated alternative ways to think.

529
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:24,160
You can cite dissents as legal authorities.

530
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:29,740
There are obviously not legal authorities on anything like the scale of a controlling majority opinion of the Supreme Court.

531
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:38,030
But they're still there. So the purpose of these descents is to map out other ways that you can legally think.

532
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:45,950
So in a sense, the dissents are also guidebooks to how the next few rounds of legal argumentation are going to go.

533
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:52,110
So they're not just protests. They're alternatives. If you read the Dobbs decision,

534
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:56,440
you're looking at pretty much the entire menu of things that can happen in

535
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:59,760
right to privacy and reproductive law in the United States in the near future.

536
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:06,759
And the dissents are going to be things that are going to be grabbed onto by people who are in favor of abortion rights and right to

537
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:14,830
privacy activities at lower level courts in order to get some traction at all in a system in which the controlling law is the decision.

538
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:21,389
Periodic reminder. Don't forget individual legal socialization and training.

539
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:24,420
Right. Think back to those expensive Wall Street lawyers.

540
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:33,030
They're not liberals. But what they are as lawyers and why would I pay you $3,000 an hour?

541
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,570
What really matters is the decision of the executive branch.

542
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,130
Right. This is inculcated. What is a lawyer, if not someone who could tell you what the law is?

543
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:49,550
The system is not foolproof. There's wrecking crews inside the building with the circuit.

544
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:54,200
I think a lot of constitutional lawyers would say is essentially a wrecking crew against the American legal

545
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:59,390
system because it basically takes the most recent Republican manifesto as its guide to the Constitution.

546
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:04,819
But it's a very strong system because as you know from any theory of social change,

547
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:09,140
if you have a whole bunch of people who are very confidently doing something one way,

548
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:15,020
even if 10% of them start doing it a different way, it's going to be hard for that 10% to get much traction.

549
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:25,130
Now. I could have given all lecture up till now, save for all the references to jobs and West Virginia versus CPR and so forth two or three years ago.

550
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:33,860
Since 2020, over the age of 63, since the Trump presidency, we now have a63 conservative majority.

551
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:39,069
This changes the calculation of the courts, and it's why the Supreme Court is all over the news.

552
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:47,260
Suddenly, under five four, Chief Justice Roberts was the swing voter, which meant that he got to decide how a bunch of cases would go.

553
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:51,220
And remember, Roberts is the subtle guy. He's the precedent guy.

554
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:54,770
He's the guy who's going to eliminate Roe versus Wade without you knowing it.

555
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:59,470
He's the guy who's going to eliminate the Voting Rights Act without you knowing it. And it was going really well.

556
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:07,200
But now you have five conservative judges and they can ignore Roberts and still win.

557
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,010
Roberts has been voting with them, but he's basically lost control of the court when he was the swing voter.

558
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:20,310
And he got to decide what cases, how cases would go and he got to decide who would write the opinion.

559
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:24,600
Now he's just voting along with the majority. And if he's not right.

560
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,910
So far what he's done, as you would predict.

561
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:34,390
Just remember, these guys are politicians, is he's voting with his party because he doesn't want to defect to the Democrats on the court,

562
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:40,540
even though he's not he's almost certainly not happy with the direction that the train is suddenly going.

563
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:47,680
But he's still on the train. Now, what's interesting is these decisions are far less subtle.

564
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:49,239
We're not whittling away at Roe.

565
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:54,340
We're saying it was wrongly decided and we're writing on a map to get rid of Griswold versus Connecticut in two different ways.

566
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:56,140
Directly, Thomas says it's wrong.

567
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:02,500
Indirectly, Alito basically maps out the five criteria that you need to use in order to knock out other constitutional rights.

568
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:11,350
And you see it over and over again, right? West Virginia versus EPA, major questions, doctrine, ban, blanket application, tons of this stuff.

569
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:16,660
So what you have here is. A majority.

570
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:19,810
And there's two ways to think about it, right? One is and they're very hard to separate.

571
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,660
I'm not even sure that you need to separate them.

572
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:29,940
But one is that if you believe that Roe versus Wade was bad law, that has led to essentially all the cost, millions and millions of dead babies.

573
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,500
Well, then, obviously, stopping it immediately is the moral and legally correct thing to do.

574
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:42,880
Like, What's your justification for fooling around with complicated presidential games if you have the opportunity to stop this horrible event?

575
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:48,400
So that's one point of view. The other point of view is that they don't think they're going to have that long.

576
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:53,350
And they're going to they're worried about something. They're worried about losing the six three and going back to five four.

577
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:59,890
Given that Supreme Court judges have life appointments. What this means is that we all end up appearing on actuarial tables.

578
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:05,070
And Clarence Thomas is not a young man. Right.

579
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:08,560
This is why Ruth Bader Ginsburg really should have retired during the first Obama term.

580
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,700
But judges get very high on their own supply.

581
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:18,670
So for some reason they are really going hard.

582
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:24,240
They are basically trying to stamp their foot on the accelerator and processes that normally take years.

583
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:27,640
Remember, I said time is slow and courts are suddenly.

584
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:35,760
Happening very, very quickly with very big, sweeping legal pronouncements and guidebooks to change the law even more in the future.

585
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,810
Now this means in part you're seeing a reaction. The Liberals are dissenting in more ways.

586
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:44,730
Obviously, you get some quite fiery dissents published in the traditional manner.

587
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:52,260
But did anybody knows what happened in the Supreme Court last week? So the newest justice, Justice Jackson,

588
00:55:52,260 --> 00:56:00,540
Cassandra Brown Jackson was basically arguing from the court and she was making the completely accurate historical statement.

589
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:05,100
And my God, this is documented. You can go to the library and read the original documents yourselves if you want to.

590
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:11,250
But the reconstruction amendments were not meant to be race blind, but they were meant precisely to help free black people.

591
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:18,470
And guess what? They were passed by northern abolitionists trying to eliminate the legacy of slavery.

592
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:24,050
They were extremely clear about what they were doing. This is not some race blind intellectual exercise.

593
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:28,610
This is very concretely things being done in the late 19th century by people who had just

594
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:33,890
fought the Civil War and were 100% aware of how difficult it would be to root out racism.

595
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:40,570
There's no confusion to be had. The majority is going to continue shaved away the Voting Rights Act.

596
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:46,239
It's basically a case about whether the gerrymandered majority white Alabama state legislature should get

597
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:51,790
to gerrymander the Alabama House districts to decide how many black people go to caucus mail ballots.

598
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,870
Alabama has extremely racialized voting. So you basically do that.

599
00:56:56,870 --> 00:57:00,439
If it's a majority black district, it will elect a black Democrat in Alabama.

600
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,929
If it is a majority white district, it will elect a white public.

601
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:09,200
Then the question is whether the gerrymandered white Republican dominated Alabama state government

602
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:15,260
has to create enough majority black districts to allow black representatives to be chosen.

603
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:20,120
And the Supreme Court is going to say no. But Jackson changed it up.

604
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:26,500
You can analyze this in terms of a personality, if you like. You can analyze all of these people's personalities personally.

605
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,350
But I don't think that's such a great way to go. I think it's a learning process.

606
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:36,410
Because what she did is she basically broke precedent, argued from the bench, not precedent in the big legal sets, just precedent.

607
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:40,819
And the what do you do sense and argued from the bench that the conservative

608
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:44,510
majority was talking historical concepts in which she is completely accurate.

609
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:50,210
Why did she do it, though? Because it's the court of six three.

610
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:56,040
Right. There was an older era when courts were more diffuse and finely balanced and less partizan.

611
00:57:56,550 --> 00:58:01,620
And Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Anthony Scalia were horse trading. And that would actually constrain the decisions.

612
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,030
It was all very private and quiet.

613
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:08,520
You know, Bader Ginsburg and Scalia would work out some accommodation, which they'd temper Scalia's opinion or whatever.

614
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:15,260
That's not happening. It's pretty clear the six just aren't even talking to the Democrats because they don't need the.

615
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:20,150
They barely knew John Roberts. So.

616
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,530
How do you temper this decision and how do you create a public understanding of what's going on?

617
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:30,880
You might take advantage of oral arguments, which is exactly what Justice Jackson did.

618
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:35,909
So by calling them out is basically hypocrites and incompetent historians.

619
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:39,930
And if you're an originalist, being called out as an incompetent historian is kind of painful.

620
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:46,650
She is going to probably limit what could happen in the VRA because the conservative majority

621
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:50,790
won't wish to be embarrassed by what she's clearly prepared to do already in the dissents,

622
00:58:51,690 --> 00:59:00,530
which is in both history. And this is a way with the very limited tools that a judge has of alerting the public.

623
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:07,370
But what you're seeing here is basically a very, very strong conservative ideological group that is driving American law hard in the direction.

624
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:11,699
This also matters because remember, overall,

625
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:16,610
the two greatest judge approving machines that we've seen in a long time are the Trump presidency and the Biden presidency.

626
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:23,220
So the federal courts overall, the district of the circuit courts are about evenly split, Democratic and Republican appointees.

627
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:31,620
So there's plenty of Democratic judges who are going to be using those tricks to avoid implementing the stuff that the Conservative six are doing.

628
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:37,440
And they're going to be taking a steer and some inspiration from the dissents at the same time that the

629
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:42,330
half of the judges who are Republican appointees will be considering how to integrate the two decisions.

630
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,280
Quick point is also don't forget the legislature. Congress can constrain the courts.

631
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:51,150
The IRA did it twice. In one case, it said, no, no, no, no.

632
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:56,100
Now the EPA can regulate greenhouse gases. Shut up. This happens all the time.

633
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:06,720
It also said that the $35 per month cap on insulin costs is not subject to judicial review, which is a more forceful way of saying Shut up court.

634
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:14,650
Congress can do this. It's intact. The Supreme Court is constituted in very few words in the Constitution.

635
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:22,870
The rest of it is filled up by the Supreme Court Act. There is no clear reason save for 18th century precedent called Marbury versus Madison.

636
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:30,430
That has, of course, never been overruled and is very important in which it says the court could judge the Constitution at the expense of Congress.

637
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:34,990
But Congress could just say, Hilcorp, this doesn't apply to you.

638
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:41,050
And that's starting to open up a new potential way for combat between the legislative and the Supreme Court.

639
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:46,220
And in general, don't get on a court when that happens. You can expand the courts.

640
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:51,350
There's no reason it has to be nine. Used to be that it had as many members as they had circuit courts.

641
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:54,760
So each circuit court sort of had its judge. Now they're doubled up.

642
01:00:55,390 --> 01:01:02,080
So you could expand it to the argument that a liberal would make for that is that essentially the Republicans stole two seats,

643
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:08,170
Merrick Garland seat and Amy Coney Barrett's seat, and that therefore the court's already been packed.

644
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:13,659
That Republican president, a Republican majority that never won a majority of the popular vote,

645
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:18,160
stole two seats that should have been filled by Democrats. You can take a leave the argument.

646
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:20,920
Whether you do will depend on your own personal politics, basically.

647
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:27,190
But that argument's out there, and if the court continues to incur opposition, that argument might get more popular.

648
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:32,170
Also, the six don't seem to think this way.

649
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:36,460
But historically, when you start to see opposition building in the legislature,

650
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:43,240
that penetrates the epistemological bubble that judges live in and they start to draw back and forth a little bit.

651
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:49,290
Classic case was the New Deal, where the Supreme Court struck down basically everything FDR did for two years.

652
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:52,930
He threatens to expand the court. He failed politically.

653
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:59,080
It was a terrible, monumental failure for FDR. Very. But the court got the message that maybe they shouldn't be quite so dogmatic.

654
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:04,870
So this term, Clean Water Act, what's a wetland?

655
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:07,360
What are the standards developers have to fill?

656
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:14,170
Voting Rights Act being discussed right now, which amounts to do states under the Voting Rights Act have an obligation to create,

657
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:16,000
quote, unquote, majority minority districts.

658
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:22,480
A.K.A., if you don't, it's trivially easy to gerrymander Alabama so that the entire House delegation is white Republicans.

659
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:30,350
University admissions, we might overturn the University of Michigan decision, which says that diversity is a legitimate social goal in admissions.

660
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:34,660
Happy to talk about that from the point of view of admissions,

661
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:39,760
but it would not improve the quality of our student body to get rid of that, put it that way.

662
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:46,540
First Amendment. This is one of the things to watch, which is religious freedom, which is an expansion of the First Amendment.

663
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:51,670
And the argument is that you can't be obliged by civil law to do things that interfere with your religion.

664
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:56,049
What this means in practice is that you're the only pharmacist within 100 miles.

665
01:02:56,050 --> 01:03:00,600
And if you don't believe that condoms are acceptable in your religion, do you have a right to not serve to?

666
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:06,420
Not so people across. Does Walgreens have a right to say you're fired if you refuse to do your job?

667
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:12,540
That's the kind of cases we're talking about, although they all seem to come through bizarre cases involving cakes like wedding cakes.

668
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:18,490
But that's really what we're talking about. Does your religion give you a get out of civil law class?

669
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,260
Hobby Lobby, for example,

670
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:28,219
was had a case against the ACA where it basically got the court to buy into the thesis that the Hobby Lobby is privately held,

671
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:31,090
the religion of the owners, and that they shouldn't even act,

672
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:34,729
that they shouldn't have to pay for abortion under the ACA and they shouldn't even have to

673
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:39,530
minimally facilitate their employees purchasing abortion or as a kind of sidecar policy.

674
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:44,020
So watch religious freedom. Indian Child Welfare Act.

675
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:48,190
There is an appalling history of the federal government basically taking children away from Native

676
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:52,720
American children away and bringing them up in orphanages or giving them to white families.

677
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:57,129
Indian Child Welfare Act was passed to prevent that. It's under challenge.

678
01:03:57,130 --> 01:04:01,540
There's a reasonable chance that we're going to go back to that era at which the state basically pulls Indian kids off.

679
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:04,900
And instead of prioritizing Indian adoptees and Indian families,

680
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:10,540
it will start prioritizing whatever the state government wants and the independent legislature's theory of elections.

681
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:15,130
If you read the Constitution, the legislatures decide how electors shall be apportioned.

682
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:22,010
It appears to say. If you adopt the independent legislatures, you abrogate all state constitutions.

683
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:26,120
And it's what the state legislatures decide to send to Washington that elects the president.

684
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:31,310
The election doesn't matter. Governor doesn't matter. State constitutions don't matter.

685
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:35,569
It's only the state legislatures if that is adopted.

686
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:41,570
And we have four judges who seem to like the idea, if they pass that you will literally see the end of American democracy.

687
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:46,370
If you define democracy as there being a correspondence between the popular vote and the president,

688
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:50,360
because instead the President will be chosen by state legislatures,

689
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,570
many of which are gerrymandered because we've been shaving away the Voting Rights Act.

690
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:59,060
So it's exciting. What's going on there and with.

691
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:11,250
For a long time, Republicans campaigned against activist courts.

692
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:16,890
Systematic. Because activist courts had imposed Roe versus Wade.

693
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:21,370
And Obergefell. And so forth.

694
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:27,640
So Republican voters were sensitized to the court. They were much more likely to not respect it.

695
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:34,030
They were more likely to say that the court was a factor in their voting because since at least 1973 and before that,

696
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:40,120
it was campaigning against Brown versus Board of Education. There had been Republican systematic objections to what the courts were doing.

697
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:44,640
Now you've seen the flip. The courts have started doing what Republican voters like.

698
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:48,219
And you look at the lines crossed. We don't know quite what's going on there,

699
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:54,500
but I think it's that there were 60 odd cases brought to the federal courts by Donald Trump's campaign to say that he'd like to be president.

700
01:05:54,580 --> 01:06:01,570
All of them got tossed out, which I think fed through into a sense that the courts were not doing right by the Republican Party.

701
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:07,450
But I would say, first of all, this averages out to the lowest level of public support for the court ever.

702
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:12,580
And traditionally, public support for the court has been among Democratic voters.

703
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:18,340
And it would appear very concretely that Dobbs was the moment when a lot of Democratic voters decided

704
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:21,670
that actually the Supreme Court was a political body and they had a political problem with it.

705
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:26,739
So if you adopt the thesis that the court needs to stay broadly in line with public opinion,

706
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:31,780
we are now conducting a huge live experiment as to what happens when the court decides it doesn't

707
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:36,519
wish to state public opinion and furthermore is willing to accept being quite accurately,

708
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:40,150
I would say, viewed as a political body, a partizan political body.

709
01:06:42,370 --> 01:06:45,940
This is all firing up for us. I think we all have strong views about jobs.

710
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:52,330
You can find mine if you actually care what we're talking about, the way the system works, not whether it's desirable.

711
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:57,000
So we can talk about, for example, what it means for ectopic pregnancies.

712
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:04,510
We can't talk about whether that's good. And this is important because that's, first of all, the way lawyers talk.

713
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:10,719
So if you can understand lawyers, you have to think that way. And secondly, because this is about how the system works.

714
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:15,250
And if you don't like what the system is currently doing, it's about how to change it in a way that is intelligible.

715
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:24,090
Read as much as you can. The syllabus is an unofficial summary. The decision is by Justice Alito concurrence.

716
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:27,570
In particular, look at Thomas and the dissents, which are pretty fiery.

717
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:32,950
Remember what I said about words? At a minimum. Read them to try and figure out.

718
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:37,720
For example, Alito and Thomas are both telling future conservative litigants what to do.

719
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:41,470
They're getting roadmaps. What are the defense doing?

720
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:45,520
What is Thomas doing separately from Alito? Right.

721
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:48,969
Try to figure out the games. Try to figure out the legal issues. It'll be hard.

722
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:55,100
They won't do it perfectly. We're going to talk through it more. Bring devices.

723
01:07:55,100 --> 01:08:00,170
You've all got devices, bring devices so you can read them, put them out of your really old school apartment.

724
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:04,870
Ask yourself what they're really talking about and also read two abacus briefs.

725
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:10,770
They're mostly quite short. And remember, jobs isn't just a decision.

726
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:16,080
It's instructions. For the future. Thank you.
