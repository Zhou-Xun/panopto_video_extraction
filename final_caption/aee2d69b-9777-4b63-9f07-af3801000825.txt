1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:09,050
You know. All right.

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,590
So I apologize. I had finished grading the exams,

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:18,950
but then I decided that there was an alternative solution to a question that I wanted to kind of explore for some of you.

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:25,040
And so I'm trying to sort of sort out a little bit of that, but but I will definitely have them available on Wednesday.

5
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:33,230
So when see the proposed projects also do October 26th, that's come up.

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,680
So I would like you to maybe I'll just I'll try to get some space on here to upload,

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,469
but also like if you give bring a paper copy also and I'm also going to prepare

8
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:49,790
a rubric by then I mean not for the proposal that I can be very sort of loose,

9
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,960
but I will try to use some sort of target for how you should be writing,

10
00:00:54,230 --> 00:01:00,740
writing up your project kind of for those of you in bio and based on 6/99 nine so

11
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:06,170
be quite it's pre-crisis 699 but just to give you some sense of how to shape it.

12
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:14,240
Okay. So I guess any questions about the final project?

13
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:24,780
We're talking about it. So when those are groups and hopefully you've been having some conversation.

14
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,280
Okay. So I did also finish homework three and I kind of wanted to go through that.

15
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,160
So we got a lot of stuff going on here. We have the current work, which is more mediation.

16
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:45,780
You know, this is back a little bit on our principal certification approach.

17
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,000
So as well as the instrumental verbal work.

18
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,340
So you kind of have to go back in time here a little bit, but it's okay with that.

19
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,740
So so the two big problems on this homework assignment,

20
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:10,110
the first one of which was sort of variations on this noncompliance example, the principal stratification set.

21
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,859
And so I asked you to do a couple of different things.

22
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:26,249
The first one of which is to relax the exclusion restriction assumption, but retain this monitoring of the assumption.

23
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:37,710
So just to remember, we're in a situation where we have a situation where individuals are assigned at random to either treatment or control,

24
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,700
and then they can either take the treatment or control.

25
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,740
So there's some control over that. There are some situations where in this particular setting,

26
00:02:47,700 --> 00:03:00,179
essentially the physicians that were treating patients might have given people the sort of enhanced treatment,

27
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:08,370
even if they were not on the treatment arm that was sort of trying to encourage them to do the treatment.

28
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:16,890
And then the conversely, of course, individuals might not have gotten the sort of enhanced treatment even if they were arm in arm.

29
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:25,260
So so that allows us to if we assume that people don't defy so that they are not in a situation where

30
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:34,530
they would have gotten not an enhanced treatment had they not been physicians not being assigned to it.

31
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:42,209
But but they have not gotten the treatment had the physicians assigned then then we basically have three possible classes.

32
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:49,650
We have those that comply. So they basically get the treatment if assigned and don't if not the never takers.

33
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,520
Those people never get the treatment regardless of treatment on assignment.

34
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,570
And the always takers, they always get the treatment regardless of treatment or assignment.

35
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,559
So the distinction here is now we're going to allow in the never always takers to possibly have some treatment effect.

36
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:15,629
So it's kind of an odd situation. But but it's it's it's potential somehow that even if if, say, physicians were getting getting calls about this,

37
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,010
even if they didn't actually sort of formally change the the treatment,

38
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,300
there may have been something in their interactions with a patient that could have could lead to an effect.

39
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,260
So that's kind of the logic logic there and vice versa.

40
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:37,230
So so basically that allows for different means depending on whether they were assigned to treatment or control,

41
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:46,860
even if the treatment is never taken or always taken. So so I think pretty got this pretty much got this model correctly.

42
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:53,610
Right. You're basically now to index these never takers and always takers by what treatment they're assigned to.

43
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:03,690
So then I asked you to sort of, you know, use the existing code and update it to estimate the treatment effect among suppliers.

44
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,830
And then I asked you for evidence for against this assumption.

45
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:18,390
So first of all, in terms of basically the only real update here is for the posterior probabilities of the principle stratification membership.

46
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:24,540
It blows up a little bit more before we just had a constant mean,

47
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:34,890
regardless of whether individuals were assigned to the treatment or control for the for the always take a class.

48
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:42,959
Now we're letting that vary. And again, if if individuals are observed to take the treatment given they were assigned to it,

49
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,600
they could be a compliant or they could be an at least taker.

50
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:53,550
And similarly for the reverse side with or so alignment between the treat and taken, the treatment not taken.

51
00:05:53,670 --> 00:06:01,650
Obviously they can't be a compliant if they are the treatments and assignments and the treatments taken don't match.

52
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,419
So for the never take your side again,

53
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:15,569
we know basically that they are a never take her and always take her if there's a treatment assigned and not taken treatment.

54
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:20,280
Not taken treatment not assigned. Treatment taken. And again, the only difference being that we.

55
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:28,850
A kind of a justice for women in there on the treatment or control side of the always take care never take them so.

56
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:38,129
So now once we've done these draws, we assign people to a class part of the Gibson Opera.

57
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:42,930
Now we would take their mean. And again, now we need to distinguish the voice.

58
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,329
I guess I'm just updating what we had before.

59
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:51,660
So for the for the Lambda C's, we always would update those with a compliance assignment in treatment or control.

60
00:06:52,170 --> 00:07:03,389
Now we're going to do the same thing for the always takers never take us. So essentially we're just working with the groups the means conditional on

61
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:08,700
compliance assignment and compliance class assignment and no treatment assignment.

62
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,440
So. Got through a few issues.

63
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:20,049
Mostly we got something sort of in this range. I didn't I didn't show the output.

64
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,400
But actually my my example here is 50,000 draws. A lot of you use 10,000.

65
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,569
I think in that case, you might have been a little short on convergence.

66
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:33,549
I didn't want to turn this into a whole like based class, so I didn't worry too much about that.

67
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:40,690
But in general, there's a couple of ways you can just sort of visually see if it looks like you really

68
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:46,120
are you sort of getting some parts of the distribution that are not very stable.

69
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,630
If you do too much enough draws, we quickly drop someone's between.

70
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:59,979
You should be able to kind of get that down to a continuous a fairly fairly stable distribution and also do multiple chains to do an official test.

71
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:08,100
So you sort of start the the Gibbs sampler down initial values and then sort of see do the do that the means of.

72
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,000
And standard deviations of the change sort of start to converge.

73
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,810
But that so I'm not going to worry too much about that.

74
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:22,139
But one thing that was I think a lot of folks didn't seem to struggle with is actually the exclusion restriction self, right?

75
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:27,719
So that consider that you need to not look at this, but the exclusion restricted has to do with that.

76
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,960
The treatment effect is within the never takers and they always takers.

77
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,290
Right. So as part of all this, you're getting these draws.

78
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:41,010
You can look at the differences and look at the trend to treat effects and never take versus the always takers.

79
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:47,369
And again, you don't see I mean, they're not zero, but they're also the intervals are quite wide.

80
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,460
So you don't have a strong evidence against exclusion restriction.

81
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,640
You can't really say a whole lot about it one way or the other, actually.

82
00:08:53,880 --> 00:09:05,580
But but given that might consider it fairly reasonable, it's probably not too to too strong a step to to make it.

83
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:11,839
But. That's that would be the official test.

84
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:22,790
So if you if you saw these intense trade effects, it's the credible number of 16 zero that would be strong evidence against the exclusion restriction.

85
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:30,380
But it's got to be the ones with the never takers and always takers. So is that clear to people?

86
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:40,810
All right, so there's the code. I won't go through that. You can take a look at it if you have questions you can about me.

87
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:47,099
Of course. All right.

88
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,570
For the next problem. Now, I.

89
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:56,250
You can retain the exclusion restriction. So common mean regardless of treatment assignment for you.

90
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:02,280
Always take her and never take her. But now we're going to allow for two fires. Kind of a weird idea, but you could.

91
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:06,720
You could imagine. We're also talking positions which notoriously don't like for told what to do.

92
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,290
So maybe not impossible but that class could exist so.

93
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:22,520
So in terms of working through the conditional distributions to set up a Gibbs sampler,

94
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,580
kind of similar to what we had before for the situation where there's potential compliance.

95
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:42,980
So for the now, however, of the the.

96
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,170
I never take her arm. Well, if they take the treatment, we know they can't be the number take.

97
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:59,750
But if they don't take the treatment, regardless of whether or not they were assigned to it, they could be a never take or they could be a the fire.

98
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:05,450
Right. So now we're kind of kind of bringing this is the fire class here.

99
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:14,000
Right. And then we still have the same situation that if they're if they were to assign treatment, they didn't take it.

100
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,360
We can't tell if they're never take a campfire. So we keep that.

101
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:26,120
And since there is a change in the in the treatment associated with a treat,

102
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:30,500
the treatment taken associate the treatment assignment to fires even is the reverse of the campfire case.

103
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:41,510
We're well for some so we're going to indexes by the by the treatment the treatment assigned so.

104
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,340
Same thing for always takers. Right.

105
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:55,920
If they weren't a sign and they took it, we can't tell her and always take her or the fire that is on the sign to control form.

106
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:05,130
So that in there and then of course, the the fire group, you know, just takes the reverse of each other, too.

107
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,700
So we also now have to pick out the means.

108
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,280
Right. So conditional and being in a fire class.

109
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,620
Right. Because take the usual means when they're saying treatment or control.

110
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:32,129
So of course, in some sense, our main focus so is on this campfire outcome and I guess I asked about so I didn't actually put it in here.

111
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:37,440
But you can see the intent to treat effect on the fires is like negative point five, negative five.

112
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:50,160
So it basically sort of suggested that since you can define the total effect here without the parametric assumption, you can see that.

113
00:12:51,780 --> 00:13:03,790
Since. So it's essentially the total effect and it's going to be a combination of the campfire effect and the fire effect.

114
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:13,150
If you expect this to sort of be the opposite direction or at least less effective than actually taking the treatment,

115
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:18,430
this you would expect this this Complera effect to be stronger when you allow for the fires.

116
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:25,780
Right. So the whole thing and say it's negative seven and this is, you know, negative three or something,

117
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:33,190
as long as there's some non-zero probability here, this is going to be negative eight, nine, ten something depending on the ratio of these.

118
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,300
So that's exactly what we saw here.

119
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:45,410
Right. So you ended up with a. I guess that was what of me.

120
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:54,920
But. That was great. So that that's the kind of logic there as to why you would expect that to be player effect to be stronger if you allow for.

121
00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:00,270
Toward the fires. Okay. The code.

122
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:07,590
So questions about family. All right.

123
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,930
And for part four, part two moved on to instrumental variables.

124
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:25,140
This is actually real data from some early instrumental variable work actually on the effect of school attendance on on learning.

125
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:37,229
So so this is basically well, the Census Bureau for many years has for now,

126
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:45,540
they've sort of flipped it around something called the American Community Survey. But between I think 1950 and 2000,

127
00:14:46,110 --> 00:15:03,660
they basically did a a subsample of of the US part of the U.S. for full U.S. Census and did a more in-depth sort of questionnaire with with people.

128
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:10,320
And I think even so, they, they asked questions about their income, education, Europe.

129
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:16,290
And of course, we did have Europe birth because I think the average age but sort of these were the extra special questions

130
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:26,850
they asked this 5% sample and this furthermore sort of subset had to to men and to those born in in the 1930s.

131
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:30,510
So it would have been between 40 and 50 years of age in 1980.

132
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:42,390
So so the game they're going to play here is we're interested in this association between income and education.

133
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:51,840
But there there may be some endogenous, so there may be some some sort of confounding effects that sort of relate to both

134
00:15:52,800 --> 00:16:00,240
cause of education and the cause of income that that might or might impact this.

135
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:11,190
And it could go both directions. So could be that that, you know, there could be some situations where people were in addition to sort of,

136
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,450
you know, sort of lower skills being less educational and lower income.

137
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:26,009
You could have situations where people were blocked. There may be some some things that caused them to have less education, things like know racism,

138
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:35,100
just general parent poverty, situations that sort of prevented them from making for full use of their of their abilities.

139
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:47,240
So, so one way to kind of deal with this a little bit was to use quarter of birth as an instrumental variable, which basically means that I see.

140
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:53,460
And you can also see there's a there's a little subtlety here. It's probably not going to this has to do a lot about education,

141
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:05,760
pushing you to being high school educated versus not back in the day but but this this fact that when you're when

142
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,129
you're born during the year actually may cause you to stay in school longer because of compulsory education.

143
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,840
Less so. And of course, that also can have some additional feedback.

144
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:22,110
So even if it only has the effect for a few months, it could be those extra months of the year and so on and so forth.

145
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:26,290
Going to college grabs you. So it's not entirely just within that narrow window.

146
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:36,590
That's sort of where the strongest impact would be. So, okay, so it seems reasonable that quarter of birth might be exogenous to income, right?

147
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,830
Sort of imagine that individuals are sort of randomized from birth within a calendar year.

148
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,640
So over ten year period. So each time it's cycling through. Right.

149
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:51,000
So so that's that's basically an entirely an argument from logic.

150
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,640
There's no way to get good data on that. So we looked at the data, but that's we look at the observed outcome in this counterfactual.

151
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:02,610
So so there's no there's no real good way to do that.

152
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:07,010
Although if we have multiple instruments, we can also do some exploration as well.

153
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:12,140
So. So the other thing we need this we can test is, is an explanatory variable.

154
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:20,250
So I mean there's there's definitely are from logic, but we can also see in the data that if we look at the later you're born in the year,

155
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:25,350
the sort of additional we did have some additional schooling, a huge amount.

156
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:35,280
This is basically grades. So the average is sort of be half a year past high school and you get another, you know, another month or two out of that.

157
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:42,490
So but with a big, big sample going to get some of that's okay.

158
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,720
So there is sort of seasonal logic on that.

159
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,620
First of all, first thing was just to sort of see the unadjusted effect, this plot pattern.

160
00:18:52,950 --> 00:19:02,759
And you see that basically there's about a, you know, seven plus percent increase in in income for each additional year of education.

161
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,210
That's pretty pretty well estimated because again, a sample size of.

162
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:14,070
But this was. I want to save 300,000 a year.

163
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:19,260
Okay. So it's 33,000 in which.

164
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:23,190
But. But enough to give a good, stable estimate for a linear effect.

165
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:30,840
Okay. And then to go on and create this two stage least squares estimate using the quarter of birth as an instrumental variable.

166
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,230
So different ways. Here's my little code, basically.

167
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,730
So here's the outcome.

168
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:48,780
Here's the exposure of interest. And this is the this is the instrument variable.

169
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,640
And really probably should be using it as a as a as a factorial.

170
00:19:54,390 --> 00:20:03,600
You get to that point off with me because that's what I can do here. And try to use the same adjusted variance.

171
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,260
So. Okay.

172
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:17,870
So I guess new sort of quick little thing. I mean, this basically just showing they're getting some, some, uh, some degree of,

173
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:22,130
of of correlation here, although they are square, as we know, very large.

174
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:33,590
And then we have our two certainly squares estimate are sort of highly significant necessarily over at large.

175
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:43,100
But we do get a a larger estimate of the effect, although there's not work error here now because this is not a very strong instrument.

176
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,120
So it may be a good instrument from a sort of randomization type perspective,

177
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,270
but it does maybe it's actually defective, but but it's pretty weak in terms of its effect on.

178
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:04,760
So does give us a slightly larger point as to mental to comprehend autism doesn't exclude toward the original unadjusted value.

179
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:12,820
So mean if we sort of believe that this is bigger than there may be some kind of masking going on in the confounding that there's

180
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:20,870
sort of sort of negative associations that are causing the effect of education to actually be smaller and it would be the place.

181
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:29,790
So. Okay, so then I asked and so what is okay on that?

182
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:37,860
Right. I use the code. So I ask your birth as an instrument to determine the effect of education income.

183
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,759
So was this a good idea? Probably not. Right.

184
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,579
So one of the I mean, this is maybe a bit more subtle, even though some U.S. history here,

185
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:57,210
but but basically nursery school history that the Depression happened in the 1930s, pretty much all across at least the Western world.

186
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:03,150
And the conditions had greatly improved sort of later than earlier.

187
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,830
So there might have been changes in the resources available for for these kids or these boys when they were very young.

188
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,899
Also, quite obviously, your birth is a source of age, which is probably going to be a social income.

189
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,520
Generally, your income increases over time. As you get more experience, you may be promoted, so on and so forth.

190
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,680
So it's probably not a great variable from an androgyny perspective.

191
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:34,430
It is, however, associated, so it is inherent.

192
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,980
So still cinema is less significant.

193
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:44,340
So richness, explanatory component above and beyond quarter of birth.

194
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:52,410
So we put them in kind of a weird result that basically it's basically zero.

195
00:22:53,340 --> 00:23:01,590
There's no association with, with, with education and just using as a linear barrier.

196
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:13,680
And so we can test this. There's a couple I sort of work through the sort of direct approach here.

197
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,380
So we basically compute our.

198
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:32,890
So our first stage, we we fit education on our instruments and then we fit.

199
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:39,330
Ah outcome. Wonder why I hantz.

200
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:48,000
But now you actually want to take the residuals from that and regress those on the original.

201
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:54,780
That's from terminal variables. So if we were happy situation, there's sort of no association here.

202
00:23:55,650 --> 00:24:03,270
But we're not even some confusion about the degrees of freedom because it's not you're not using just the F test itself.

203
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:19,440
You're using this adjustment of the F test. So basically you have the total number of of variables in your instrumental variable set.

204
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:29,390
That's Q. So we have the three, the three court of birth indicators and then you're at birth.

205
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,690
So it's four and we have one exposure variable ultimately.

206
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:41,610
So we subtract that off. So we, we want to look at Q times F with Q minus P degrees of freedom.

207
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,720
So I mean, the conclusion is the same, right? That it's not great.

208
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,840
And it's consistent with your birth pin, androgynous with income.

209
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:54,340
So so they can actually compare this with some.

210
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:58,600
You went on to compare like say no we have more than one. More than two, so we can drop them.

211
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:04,120
And you showed that you in the year of birth looks to be a problem.

212
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:10,390
So we should also note, we think. The appearance.

213
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:22,549
Yeah. Right. So this surrogate test statistic, you know, it model gives you the same thing so you don't have to go through and do the two stage thing.

214
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:27,420
You can just kind of look directly at this. And. Dodge any test.

215
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:34,240
No. Okay. It's Monday.

216
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:38,430
Yep. All right.

217
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:42,190
So that's the homework again.

218
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:53,390
Apologies. I will get the exam to you Wednesday. Okay, so but I'm going to sort of go on lecture here.

219
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:10,299
Okay. So now we were looking at this issue of sensitivity analysis both for unmeasured confounding,

220
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,200
for total effects as well as for direct and indirect effects.

221
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:27,370
And we work through basically the logic of this is to assume that we have some unknown set of confounders we're going to call you.

222
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:38,200
And if we actually assume they're they're binary, we can get kind of nice closed form expressions for potential bias resulting from this.

223
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:45,910
And you sort of work that out for the for the total effect.

224
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:54,450
With regard to whether it was sort of a continuous linear measure or a.

225
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,850
Binary or in their outcome. So the bias would be on the odds ratio scale.

226
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,080
We then work out what the impact would be for control direct effects.

227
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:27,270
So. So the last thing I want to do along here is sort of work out the situation for an actual direct and indirect effects.

228
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:36,970
So. So this is kind of the ugliest situation.

229
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:44,080
Maybe also we have this bit of algebra we're going to do in the of course, you're at the top of the hill.

230
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:53,500
Okay. So we have our three previous assumptions about confounding.

231
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:07,299
Basically, we're wrong as we include you. We're back to being able to get independence between the potential outcome and

232
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:11,590
the treatment and the potential outcome in the mediator given the treatment.

233
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:18,700
This other one here is maybe a bit odder, and it has to do more with with how we're going to kind of try to summarize these bias effects.

234
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:32,680
We actually assume that the sort of additional condition on X that that you basically is is is no longer associated with that with the treatment.

235
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:39,850
So this is probably a little or even a little stronger assumption. It's not terribly necessary for everything we're going to do,

236
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:44,370
but it is going to be necessary for some of the some of the more summarized by US measures.

237
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:51,790
Yeah. So okay, so now we're looking at natural, direct, indirect effects.

238
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,639
We basically want to come back to being able to get the mediator potential outcome

239
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,380
of the mediator and the treatment and control to be independent of treatment.

240
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:09,100
So it's sort of randomized with respect to treatment and for the potential outcome to be independent of the mediator under the different arms.

241
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:16,120
So basically we had you and maybe X by itself doesn't do it, but we had you in there.

242
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,200
We were able to make these assumptions. So that's what you do.

243
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:30,830
And then we're going to end up. Coming up with some sensitivity measures, Delta and gamma measures that we thought we had before.

244
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:43,069
And basically now these are going to be conditional on a particular value of the mediator and they're going to average over that value,

245
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:54,110
that mediator either at the bow for the natural direct effect and the control value given ex.

246
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,030
These are all sort of dependent on X.

247
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:02,840
And so whatever we come up with this for a given X, we actually did averages over X to get an overall bias measure for the population.

248
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:09,960
And right.

249
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,019
So first of all,

250
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:19,040
we're going to sort of show this more general form and then this will then collapse back to this under these assumptions of binary use.

251
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:26,850
So. All right.

252
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:32,630
So I'm going to try to use this whole board here. So you have these hopefully your.

253
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,660
Please. Can you turn this off?

254
00:30:39,910 --> 00:31:08,870
It's. So.

255
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:45,100
Any working members left. He was not good.

256
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,180
Here I am. All right. Well, let's start with this.

257
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:52,630
I may have to run off and get. So basically this is what we have.

258
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:17,400
But. All right.

259
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:22,500
So this is our estimate of the natural, direct effect.

260
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:36,390
This is our true natural direct effects control outcomes.

261
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:10,110
At this point the media value constant and always conditions for next year.

262
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:15,780
That's our observed data so.

263
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:29,690
So I'm just going to call this one minus two, minus three plus four.

264
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,650
And this is not easy to read, right? All right.

265
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:45,830
Sorry, but I'm going to go find something more. Do you appreciate.

266
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:11,310
So. So I'm just going to rewrite one here now and condition on it.

267
00:35:53,540 --> 00:36:00,679
And then some over this series.

268
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:59,730
You. So in order to avoid keep running big equals at least our VM equals little and then just write even the small values here implied here.

269
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:39,780
Because I left it here to emphasize that it was something we used to store here.

270
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,760
All right, so that's that's my observed data.

271
00:37:52,590 --> 00:38:32,890
Now my counterfactual I'm come stuff. So I wonder if all the assumptions now jump to that counterfactual data.

272
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:56,950
Now you've been conditioned on the mediator values that a star since I independence between you and a.

273
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:35,420
But. Yes.

274
00:39:40,550 --> 00:40:08,150
So. So I'm going to rewrite this using Bayes rule is.

275
00:40:45,570 --> 00:41:05,550
So it's basically taking this part here. Having given you, if you give an MP of M for you and your condition a stance to remove.

276
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:37,220
And it's a little easier with a counterfactual outcome where the treatment and the media and treatment are the same.

277
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:09,810
All right. So converting again to observe data, your assumptions.

278
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:19,870
Okay. So. It's.

279
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:28,480
So it's good to have those pieces together a year.

280
00:42:46,920 --> 00:44:40,390
Can I write this down first? So.

281
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:54,240
That leads to here. This is being subtracted from this and.

282
00:45:52,280 --> 00:46:48,940
There. Cummings star.

283
00:47:37,760 --> 00:48:05,460
It's. Correct.

284
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:21,220
So I've gotten like this, but I don't. I have this.

285
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,730
So. Wow, that.

286
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:43,040
Basically have. Next here.

287
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:00,950
If you're down and pulling.

288
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:05,510
Why do you have to start? Yeah, that's a good question.

289
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:09,880
So I'm going to have to go back and check on that. But I want to finish this up.

290
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:16,820
So we're just going to live with that for now. Okay.

291
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:21,770
So we've got this part. This part.

292
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:27,740
Right.

293
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:46,800
So what I've done here is I've of bring that perspective that out here that around so remove factor those parts there we have that I did a check on.

294
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:59,120
So then for this piece here, I think I also need to expand this out kind of a similar way that I did three.

295
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,160
So. Please.

296
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:25,120
Star Wars star.

297
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:39,490
And then you start next, right?

298
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:47,740
So just again, if you if you give an end, give them giving you give, you will then conditioning things to our.

299
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:52,360
And you can actually see that these folks are here.

300
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:59,470
So what I'm left with is this part here.

301
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:05,049
This was over there. This part here. Which over there.

302
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:10,050
Because I've also got this part. Down here.

303
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:17,170
And since this is my this.

304
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:22,200
Right. So. Yeah.

305
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:27,720
Right. Okay. So sorry, I. Figure that one out.

306
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:33,060
Think about what? This sort of part of that afternoon.

307
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:50,150
So the.

308
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:26,170
If you're going to play this little game instead of use star as a reference so.

309
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:17,540
Okay. So basically this is the same I before that we can sort of get this is sort of a subtraction of zero across this entire summation.

310
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:25,310
So wrapping this piece in here really just corresponds to this appear.

311
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:29,950
So. But it's important because.

312
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:44,860
We're going to be able to make some. Within within these we're going to have of device terms so.

313
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:57,240
Right. I think it's more fair to leave this up here and go over there over their regular basis.

314
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:01,690
Which would people prefer? The race? This race. Okay.

315
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:14,020
So it kind of worked out. All that bias stuff boiled down to this.

316
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:34,050
Well, very far from here.

317
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:47,410
Reduced. So I assume you as independent as a given X.

318
00:56:49,160 --> 00:57:05,450
So that implies basically the condition they started relevant the same distribution way.

319
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:11,780
So that's going to start out.

320
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:31,920
So I'm just going to be left with this. And just canceled the fact that.

321
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:48,970
So. So the bias and this natural indirect effect, you know, extend.

322
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:34,250
I think when X is a binary, ambiguous binary.

323
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:44,660
Basically the difference in the probabilities of you, the one given in the star,

324
00:58:44,660 --> 00:59:12,920
conditional in math and then averaged over the distribution of either it's so and so this is just or gamma and this is our filter.

325
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:33,050
Let's just go in the slide.

326
00:59:51,760 --> 01:00:08,469
And making this assumption next is good that our sort of unmeasured confounders piece really is focused on the mediator part, not the treatment part.

327
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:15,330
Give an X so that allows us to cancel this event.

328
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:23,589
So this more complicated, biased expression can be reduced to essentially the opponent.

329
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:26,830
That has to do with the difference in the mean outcome.

330
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:38,310
Okay. Fixed. I think maybe that's the source of the problem.

331
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:44,690
Change. Yes, and that's that's great.

332
01:00:45,710 --> 01:01:03,080
So keeping a fixed and then changing you and then the the actual difference in this unmeasured confounder with respect to the cause of the treatment.

333
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:09,300
So. Right.

334
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,390
So that's sort of how the good Tony part works.

335
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:20,820
See how you associate the treatment and how the outcome outcomes associated with you above and beyond X.

336
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:29,290
Good condition on the meat eater, though. We threw some up over that. We're assuming you here.

337
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:35,380
Is this technically really could be any kind of molten oatmeal, but typically it just could be zero one.

338
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:40,210
So that's Delta basically.

339
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:48,640
And then Delta Gamma get affected by that and it'll be some that up over the new year values.

340
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:57,840
He'd been able to start because we're looking to reduce this natural, direct effect.

341
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:19,680
And as we'll see just to remind everybody. Of course, can't estimate Delta and Gamma.

342
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:28,060
That's why we think. Here's a sensitivity analysis. So we'll try to get a bit more specific about that in a minute.

343
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:52,840
So. Right. So this assumption that you as a dependent of a given X basically means that the total effect is unbiased.

344
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:56,800
Right. So basically our unmeasured confounding is in the mediation piece.

345
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:09,910
So, so under that assumption, then the total, the bias in the total effect is going to be zero, right?

346
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:15,310
So that's kind of the confounders. So we don't have any bias total effect.

347
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:23,950
And I think this was an exam question. Right. The total effect is the actual indirect effect plus an actual direct effect.

348
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:33,320
So that means that the since bias is a so when your function right,

349
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:39,550
the bias in the total effect is going to be some of the bias in the natural direct indirect effects at zero.

350
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:46,000
And basically they're in opposite directions and the same at the same absolute value.

351
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:51,280
So the natural indirect effect then just becomes the negative bias,

352
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:56,680
the natural direct effect under the assumption that basically unmeasured grounds when the mediator piece.

353
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:07,430
It's all kind of coherent. So.

354
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:13,450
Okay, so it's no, I see the same thing, but there's no one sort of confounding the treatment assignment that any bias in the natural, indirect,

355
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:21,400
direct or indirect effects due to an observed confounding between a mediator and the outcome will be an equal be equal in opposite directions.

356
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:36,600
So. Right, so here that was all in this sort of continuous setting.

357
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:41,820
The algebra gets kind of untenable, but.

358
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:50,230
But inappropriate, tedious to discuss in class, I think in the binary or mediator outcome setting.

359
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:58,350
So we're just going to give some results. You can go back to the text if you want to enjoy a few hours playing with with some algebra.

360
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:05,920
So. Okay.

361
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:11,230
So in this binary setting, though, it is possible to relax this no interaction assumption to then measure confounder and treatment.

362
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:18,370
So basically sort of relax that you as independent of value of next piece with some additional sensitivity parameters.

363
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:28,250
So. All right. So for a binary outcome, binary mediator model, right.

364
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:31,260
You're assuming no unmeasured confounding.

365
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:46,740
Right. We work on the log odds scale, so we have a log odds for the mediator given the given the treatment and X and y go to the outcome,

366
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:50,130
given mediator and treatment and a lot of potential interactions. And that's.

367
01:05:53,440 --> 01:06:02,200
So. Okay, so these will give or are various estimates.

368
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:17,730
So we have our estimate of a controlled, direct, natural and direct natural sort of natural, direct, natural, indirect effects.

369
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:23,160
Back on page 27, maybe I should pull those up quickly for the moment.

370
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:41,380
So they're basically these these. Exponentially versions of of A.I.M. and and M times AMOS The star of the interaction piece and the various betas.

371
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:50,300
So yeah, that's the total effect.

372
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:57,070
Sensitivity analysis for binary outcomes. We're going to posit basically a ratio of probabilities.

373
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:03,490
So basically the outcome conditional on X and A.

374
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:13,330
So if you as one, there's some increase in probability or decrease in probability relative to when you have zero.

375
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:14,530
Obviously,

376
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:26,140
if these two were equal and gamma is one and then we have essentially four distributions for the unmeasured confounder as a function of an N.

377
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:32,490
So basically some probability of of you have a10 at.

378
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,900
A and m hold up and say both.

379
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:55,450
10110100. So basically then work out the biases of these beta one and beta two and beta three from

380
01:07:56,390 --> 01:08:04,580
the logit logistic regression model above because it converts down to this form here.

381
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:12,240
So essentially, if Gammas won, there's no bias.

382
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:23,840
Right? So basically, we assume that you doesn't really there's no you out there that affects y and that if or if the probability

383
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:37,070
Google one is independent of a given M and X then that were these will this will be equal to one and so.

384
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:45,670
And so this just becomes one plus minus one diameter or just just one.

385
01:08:45,670 --> 01:08:53,200
So the bias is zero. So the extent that these things vary from each other and the gamma is not equal to one, then we start to get bias introduced.

386
01:08:54,610 --> 01:09:02,710
So, so this is sort of the bias associated with beta one.

387
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:05,260
It's the bias associated with beta two.

388
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:12,010
And then the bias to shoot beta three actually is this is going to be this plug B one minus long p zero up here.

389
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:19,210
So. So was.

390
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:22,650
Basically it's going to be.

391
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:33,170
Sort of difference in the logs of these quantities, but where we set the meter will be able to one versus the mediator value equals zero.

392
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:42,850
You get binary outcomes, binary mediators ask me whatever is.

393
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:54,220
So to then to get bias just this two meters we just subtract off is estimated as in the blast right so some fraction of

394
01:09:54,220 --> 01:10:02,240
the difference of these things back one in the years replace bad with being until they get bias corrected estimates.

395
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:13,270
So again after sort of plugging in Vegas for gamma and you can hopefully defer to probabilities by getting the bias estimate.

396
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:22,660
So we'll talk a little bit about with sensible values, make sure that how to kind of think about sensible sensitivity values and the example and.

397
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:31,680
So I guess I was going to write.

398
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:35,900
So to get these bias corrected estimates, you actually have to do a little bit of stuff.

399
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:46,170
Your time. I think it's we ought to move forward here.

400
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:14,020
So just to remind everybody. Two issues are here.

401
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:50,700
So. So we must have an zero in a controlled direct attack, which is going to be fatal once again.

402
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:57,520
And it is going to. So.

403
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:03,850
The vice president.

404
01:12:16,430 --> 01:12:20,490
So we've got an estimate this it's all sorts of dating back.

405
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:25,200
Back because this virus is a function of X.

406
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:45,280
So. So we just take our estimate bias and subtract off.

407
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:54,420
First Amendment bias sensitivity analysis.

408
01:12:56,580 --> 01:13:24,800
We got to do that for V3 as well. So.

409
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:34,880
So this is somewhat obvious that these are places where they don't have to basically have to stay in one place zero.

410
01:13:37,770 --> 01:13:41,530
That's. And 83.

411
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:47,810
That might as well be one of this. I am.

412
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:12,000
Yes. I mean, beta 310.

413
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:28,990
So. If we want to average this out over the various.

414
01:14:54,880 --> 01:15:09,790
Right. So we're just going to. Within our values of X and whatever their density is for X members that have their X.

415
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:20,220
It's zero or one zero.

416
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:53,000
And this is going to be. Kind of simplifies a little bit and then zero.

417
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:15,330
So that's just a constant with respect to X. Basically you're just going by the inverse of this material of X.

418
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:31,090
And if he just want to use the sort of non-material distribution from the sample estimate that.

419
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:52,060
To write this sort of inspired fires.

420
01:16:59,110 --> 01:17:03,010
And the families is one that's pretty similar.

421
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:27,800
Actually the council.

422
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:56,650
Indestructible. If we had a cigaret, this would be the bias here as well.

423
01:17:56,710 --> 01:18:01,690
Basically one then this is just another.

424
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:06,610
And. So here.

425
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:16,800
You have some very I think no oversight putting it in there.

426
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:56,490
For the proximity. Something else, the biosecurity checks.

427
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:23,400
All right. So this is all about point estimation.

428
01:19:24,570 --> 01:19:30,000
And in some sense, because the sensitivity parameters are fixed quantities not only subject to sampling variance.

429
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:39,659
So but if you are working over the absorbed for the things that are basically the first line up there,

430
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:53,010
that would basically be you could just the variance would just be the same as the variance of the unbiased odds ratio or yeah,

431
01:19:54,060 --> 01:20:01,440
controlled direct effect odds ratio would be shifting the credible intervals with with the change in bias.

432
01:20:01,950 --> 01:20:07,920
But if you're going to average over them, then there's some uncertainty in the axes and typically that's going to be done with a bootstrap.

433
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,910
Talk a little bit about that back next week.

434
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:24,959
So you can see or also slightly now for the first time out of sync with the syllabus that that is not shocking to me.

435
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:29,190
Had hoped it would be too far off. It's not really, I think, compared to what I did the first time.

436
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:32,880
But but you see, we sort of have a spare week at the end.

437
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:37,950
So I actually had if I was on track, I had some additions that I could put together.

438
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:45,360
But we'll still get through what I consider the core stuff, which is basically this next this next set,

439
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:54,120
this class notes ten will essentially cover what I consider the basics, the court basics of of causal inference.

440
01:20:54,690 --> 01:21:01,139
And these will kind of finish up with that and do a little bit to odds and ends and time variance stuff,

441
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:05,310
which is a little tricky because of the nature of thinking about the potential outcomes.

442
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:09,690
But now things are varying over time, so you got to worry about what happens to potential outcomes over time.

443
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:13,620
So okay. So that's based on the risk, of course.

444
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:18,900
Right. And I will I will have the midterms for you.
