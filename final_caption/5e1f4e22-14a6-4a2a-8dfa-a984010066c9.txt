00:00:01,324 --> 00:00:06,246
Progress Towards Health
Equity Interventions.

2
00:00:06,246 --> 00:00:10,776
Although social determinants of health
have now received national, as well as

3
00:00:10,776 --> 00:00:15,578
international attention, until recently,
the approach to reducing disparities

4
00:00:15,578 --> 00:00:21,830
has not always emphasized social,
environmental, and economic justice.

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,610
The unnatural causes report concludes
that we must move beyond debates

6
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:31,545
of whether disparities exist to
implement strategies to eliminate them.

7
00:00:31,545 --> 00:00:35,990
Your final paper, I ask you to pick up
this challenge by suggesting an upstream

8
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,660
approach to address a public health
disparity of interest to you.

9
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,748
As you consider your final paper,

10
00:00:42,748 --> 00:00:48,006
remember the progression of health equity
research has moved from simply identifying

11
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:53,266
vulnerable populations to understanding
key determinants of health disparities for

12
00:00:53,266 --> 00:01:01,304
the purpose of intervening,
reducing, and evaluating progress.

13
00:01:01,304 --> 00:01:05,936
Key to making changes are strategies
that reach large numbers of people,

14
00:01:05,936 --> 00:01:13,070
such as policy changes, environmental
changes, and systems changes.

15
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,110
Policy changes have received
substantial attention over the years.

16
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,030
More recently, environmental and

17
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:25,660
system changes, especially multisectorial
initiatives, have been explored.

18
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:31,510
Recent environmental initiatives
include community-based strategies,

19
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,830
data-driven advances,
multisectorial approaches,

20
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:42,344
federal efforts, and
philanthropic innovations.

21
00:01:42,344 --> 00:01:46,739
Any of these initiatives independently or
in combination can be applied in

22
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:51,440
strategies to reduce or
eliminate health disparities.

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,270
Koo and colleagues provide several
examples of each of these strategies.

24
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,791
Advancing system and policy changes for
social and racial justice involves

25
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:05,380
defining the type of social justice
approach to use to address root causes for

26
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,417
inequality.

27
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:12,703
Distributive justice can be defined
as the right to equal treatment and

28
00:02:12,703 --> 00:02:19,240
equal access to the same distribution
of resources and opportunities for all.

29
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,379
An example is providing vouchers for

30
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:27,024
farmers' markets to address
access to healthy foods.

31
00:02:27,024 --> 00:02:29,809
Procedural justice is
the right to equality and

32
00:02:29,809 --> 00:02:34,140
democratic inclusiveness
in decision making.

33
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,996
Community participation and
representation and

34
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:41,120
political process are key strategies here.

35
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,190
Structural justice focuses on
transforming economic structures,

36
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,900
such as implementing a fair minimum wage.

37
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,680
Cultural or
identity justice involves recognizing and

38
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,690
responding to the domination of
more privileged social identities.

39
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,750
The issue is power dynamics here.

40
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,020
Transforming dominant cultural
patterns that routinely disparage

41
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:13,240
marginalized groups requires gaining
recognition of new social identities.

42
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,922
Research and practice involving
social justice must change practices,

43
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:19,281
shape legislation,

44
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:26,773
and influence regulatory policies
designed to achieve health equity.
