1
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:12,127
In today's session of HMP600, the health services system.

2
00:00:12,127 --> 00:00:18,864
We will be talking about reforming health care in the United States.

3
00:00:18,864 --> 00:00:24,001
And in particular the 2010 Patient Protection and

4
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:30,830
Affordable Ce Act of the most recent health reform in the United States.

5
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,385
So what we'll do is very briefly identify previous efforts

6
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:40,227
at reforming the health financing system primarily in the US.

7
00:00:40,227 --> 00:00:46,127
Will go back and describe some of the conditions in the early 2000s,

8
00:00:46,127 --> 00:00:52,527
late 90s, 2000 that influenced what we see in the Affordable Care Act.

9
00:00:52,527 --> 00:00:57,603
Then explain key features of the Affordable Care Act, and

10
00:00:57,603 --> 00:01:03,311
discuss briefly the impact of the court decisions about the ACA.

11
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:10,456
And what that meant for subsequent implementation.

12
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:17,307
So, or the course of the 20th century, as we have discussed elsewhere,

13
00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:22,217
the US health care financing system came into place.

14
00:01:22,217 --> 00:01:28,422
And over the same time period of establishing employer sponsored

15
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:35,543
insurance and some of the changes in that system as they were coming about.

16
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:40,248
There were also a number of efforts to reform this

17
00:01:40,248 --> 00:01:45,197
structure as it was evolving in the United States.

18
00:01:45,197 --> 00:01:50,350
And in particular each of these was seeking to expand

19
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:56,930
insurance coverage either universally or to particular groups.

20
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,844
But as you can see many of these efforts failed.

21
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:06,431
So the first one in 1933 was Fanklin Delano Roosevelt in the new

22
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:11,543
deal had a plan for Universal health insurance in 1933.

23
00:02:11,543 --> 00:02:18,499
But because of very stiff resistance from the American Medical Association and

24
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:21,421
from employers more generally.

25
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:26,582
This was actually withdrawn from the new deal legislation

26
00:02:26,582 --> 00:02:31,637
that established other major social safety net features

27
00:02:31,637 --> 00:02:36,290
like Social Security and unemployment insurance.

28
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,189
The effort behind universal health insurance was

29
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:43,076
actually removed from the new deal.

30
00:02:43,076 --> 00:02:47,828
In 1947, Harry Truman tried to establish Universal Health

31
00:02:47,828 --> 00:02:51,890
insurance through something he called the fair deal.

32
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:56,174
And this also was met with failure and again,

33
00:02:56,174 --> 00:03:03,638
very stiff resistance from the American Medical Association and employers.

34
00:03:03,638 --> 00:03:08,626
And now the newly established health insurers were

35
00:03:08,626 --> 00:03:11,993
also very much against that plan.

36
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:16,988
In 1965, as we know, the Great Society programs

37
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:22,540
established Medicare and Medicaid, which substantially

38
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:28,230
expanded health insurance to various groups in the US.

39
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,653
In 1972, President Nixon had a more narrow plan

40
00:03:33,653 --> 00:03:39,200
that did pass new legislation that sort of allowed and

41
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,270
encouraged the idea of managed care more broadly.

42
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:51,018
It had no real significant impact in the 70s or even in the 80s,

43
00:03:51,018 --> 00:03:57,601
but really it started in the 90s that we saw the expansion of managed care.

44
00:03:57,601 --> 00:04:02,829
And as we'll see that idea show up again in the affordable Care Act.

45
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:07,533
And we'll talk a little bit more about what managed care means

46
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:09,450
elsewhere in the class.

47
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:14,950
In 1994, President Clinton had a major effort that was

48
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:20,570
to expand health insurance to universal health insurance.

49
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,091
That had a dramatic failure.

50
00:04:24,091 --> 00:04:29,210
That plan was one of the first times that significant numbers of

51
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:35,986
the medical establishment, including the AMA, did not oppose the legislation.

52
00:04:35,986 --> 00:04:41,068
Ad in that case, health insurers were the major group opposed

53
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:45,954
to that legislation as well as of course over each of these,

54
00:04:45,954 --> 00:04:50,939
there are political parties and groups who either support or

55
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:56,925
oppose this, but the insurers was the major industry against the plan.

56
00:04:56,925 --> 00:05:04,621
In 2003, President Bush expanded Medicare in significant ways.

57
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:12,112
That's when we got the part D to Medicare, the pharmaceutical coverage.

58
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:16,750
The expansion of Medicare advantage plans occurred in

59
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,590
that 2003 Medicare modernization Act.

60
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,180
And also the creation of health savings accounts was

61
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,310
established during that in that 2003 reform effort.

62
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,678
But those are much more, much smaller reforms

63
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:40,180
considering the efforts of the previous reform efforts.

64
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,235
And looking to the 2010 President Obama and

65
00:05:44,235 --> 00:05:48,501
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

66
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,874
Now let's think back to prior to

67
00:05:53,874 --> 00:05:59,731
the Affordable Care Act passing and the situation.

68
00:05:59,731 --> 00:06:03,959
So this is reminding us about the uninsured in

69
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:07,967
2011 which was similar to 2010 and

70
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:13,867
2009 when over the period of the early 2000s the number

71
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:18,790
of uninsured was increasing fairly dramatically.

72
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,993
And we are looking at the non elderly and

73
00:06:21,993 --> 00:06:27,723
we wanna think about why we wanna look at the non elderly population and

74
00:06:27,723 --> 00:06:31,219
it's because the elderly have Medicare,

75
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:36,389
which is essentially universal coverage for all the elderly.

76
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:42,206
And so we wanna look at what the coverage insurance coverage is for

77
00:06:42,206 --> 00:06:46,668
the non elderly, everyone under the age of 65.

78
00:06:46,668 --> 00:06:50,876
And when we look at this group of uninsured,

79
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:55,768
the 18% uninsured, we can see that it's nearly

80
00:06:55,768 --> 00:07:01,260
48 million people as of 2010, prior to the ACA.

81
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:06,247
And what the ACA did was or the framers of the ACA di

82
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:11,234
was to consider the factors that would influence

83
00:07:11,234 --> 00:07:16,588
the reasons influencing these different groups for

84
00:07:16,588 --> 00:07:20,630
having for being uninsured.

85
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:26,836
And so first to think about this, the 51% of the uninsured,

86
00:07:26,836 --> 00:07:31,403
this is about a little over 24 million people

87
00:07:31,403 --> 00:07:36,322
among these uninsured are earning or have incomes

88
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:41,270
lower than 139% of the federal poverty line.

89
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:46,042
So at this time the federal poverty line for

90
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:50,159
a family of four is $22,350.

91
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,175
That's a family of four.

92
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:57,529
And so 139% of that federal poverty line

93
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:03,480
is $31,000 per year for a family of four.

94
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,010
And so why don't these people have insurance?

95
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:14,267
So we might think first, well, why wouldn't they qualify for Medicaid?

96
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:17,933
Medicaid is the insurance program for the poor.

97
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:22,806
Why is this group of people uninsured?

98
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:25,640
Why aren't they eligible for Medicaid?

99
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,320
Well, so there are a few reasons.

100
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,169
First, some of them are above the poverty line.

101
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:40,450
Right, we're looking at 139%, and so they might not qualify for Medicaid.

102
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,057
However, of this 51% here,

103
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:48,600
almost 16 million of them are actually

104
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,700
under 100% of the federal poverty line.

105
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,740
And so why don't they have Medicaid?

106
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,645
Well, you should already be thinking and thinking about the Medicaid program and

107
00:09:01,645 --> 00:09:03,440
what we know about Medicaid.

108
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,450
So it means that for many of these people,

109
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:13,418
they might not meet one of the specific qualifying criteria.

110
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:16,158
So to be eligible for Medicaid,

111
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:21,751
it's not just your level of income being below the poverty line.

112
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:25,707
It is actually having another specific criteria,

113
00:09:25,707 --> 00:09:30,399
being a pregnant woman, being a child under the age of 17,

114
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,570
potentially being the parent of a young child under the age of six.

115
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,130
And so for people who don't have one of those other specific criteria,

116
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:45,620
they wouldn't be eligible for Medicaid, no matter how poor they are.

117
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,034
A second reason that even the very poor

118
00:09:49,034 --> 00:09:53,202
among this group do not qualify for Medicaid.

119
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:58,223
Is that their income, even at these very low levels and

120
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:03,136
even below 100% of the poverty line might not meet

121
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:07,393
the threshold of eligibility in their state,

122
00:10:07,393 --> 00:10:11,448
even when they are below the poverty level.

123
00:10:11,448 --> 00:10:17,341
Because as you will recall states define the Medicaid program.

124
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:19,731
Medicaid is our state programs.

125
00:10:19,731 --> 00:10:23,461
And so the state sets the eligibility level for

126
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:28,538
the different specific groups who are eligible for Medicaid.

127
00:10:28,538 --> 00:10:36,713
And for some states, they set that income threshold at very low levels,

128
00:10:36,713 --> 00:10:42,488
a levels of earning less than $5,000 a year.

129
00:10:42,488 --> 00:10:47,684
And so you have to be extremely poor even to quality even if you meet

130
00:10:47,684 --> 00:10:54,214
one of these specific criteria to actually qualify for Medicaid in those states.

131
00:10:54,214 --> 00:11:00,429
So thinking about this group of uninsured and the reasons why they were uninsured,

132
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:05,223
led the framers of the Affordable Care Act to consider expanding

133
00:11:05,223 --> 00:11:10,303
Medicaid eligibility to this group under the Affordable Care Act.

134
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:15,941
And providing the funds to the states to expand Medicaid for this group.

135
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:24,943
Now, if we consider the reasons for why a group of people who are earning or

136
00:11:24,943 --> 00:11:31,093
who have incomes 139-399% of the federal poverty level,

137
00:11:31,093 --> 00:11:37,830
we can think of other aspects that we then see in the Affordable Care Act.

138
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,017
So why is this group uninsured?

139
00:11:41,017 --> 00:11:45,722
The 39%, the almost 19 million people

140
00:11:45,722 --> 00:11:50,694
who are in this group in 2010, 2011.

141
00:11:50,694 --> 00:11:57,610
This group means these are people earning between in a family of four.

142
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:03,234
It means their income is between 31,000 per year,

143
00:12:03,234 --> 00:12:06,180
up to 89,000 per year.

144
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,167
So $89,000 for a family of four is

145
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:14,640
starting to be into the low moderate income.

146
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,616
And so it might seem surprising, why are these people,

147
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:20,991
some of these people uninsured?

148
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:25,842
Well, let's think about what we know about how health

149
00:12:25,842 --> 00:12:30,699
insurance operates at this time in the United States.

150
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:36,177
They are likely working in jobs that don't offer them insurance and

151
00:12:36,177 --> 00:12:38,387
they can't afford to buy or

152
00:12:38,387 --> 00:12:42,930
purchase insurance in the individual private market.

153
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,870
That's this group over here, the 5.7%.

154
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:53,764
So if you are only earning $30-$40,000 a year in a family of four and

155
00:12:53,764 --> 00:12:57,838
your employer is not offering you insurance,

156
00:12:57,838 --> 00:13:02,121
you are very unlikely to be able to afford a health

157
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:07,720
insurance premium that is likely half of your income.

158
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,772
And even people at the top of this level at the nearly at

159
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:18,614
the 399% of the federal poverty level, that price tag for

160
00:13:18,614 --> 00:13:25,151
individual private insurance is likely to be almost unaffordable.

161
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,675
Some people in this group also could have a pre existing

162
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:33,490
condition that excludes them from insurance at this time.

163
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,258
And just finally, there are few insurers for

164
00:13:37,258 --> 00:13:41,840
this group outside of employer sponsored insurance.

165
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,453
So if your employer is not offering you insurance,

166
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:52,033
there is a private, non group individual insurance market,

167
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:56,770
but very few insurers and they're very expensive.

168
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:00,101
And so thinking about this group of uninsured and

169
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:04,978
the reasons that they are uninsured, led the framers of the affordable

170
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:09,868
care Act to consider ideas like creating the insurance marketplaces.

171
00:14:09,868 --> 00:14:17,589
To encourage more plans, more insurers to offer plans to people in this group.

172
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:22,254
To think about providing subsidies to the very low income people who so

173
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:25,427
they could purchase plans, insurance plans.

174
00:14:25,427 --> 00:14:30,358
And also creating incentives for small businesses who might not be

175
00:14:30,358 --> 00:14:34,849
able to offer insurance to their employees, incentives and

176
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:39,801
requirements for small businesses to actually offer insurance.

177
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:46,341
So let's think about finally,

178
00:14:46,341 --> 00:14:51,010
this group of 10% or so,

179
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:58,400
about five million people who are earning.

180
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:04,549
Or have incomes above 400% of the federal poverty line,

181
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:09,510
so not low income, even above moderate income.

182
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,870
Why are they uninsured?

183
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,770
Well, there are still a number of reasons.

184
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:21,084
One is they work for employers who don't offer insurance and they

185
00:15:21,084 --> 00:15:27,280
either decide not to purchase insurance on the individual private market.

186
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,115
Likely because of the expense, they could afford it, but

187
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:36,174
they are choosing not to because of the expense.

188
00:15:36,174 --> 00:15:40,829
A second group could be, they don't have employer sponsored

189
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:46,112
insurance offered to them and because of a pre-existing condition,

190
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:51,770
they are excluded from even purchasing insurance in this market.

191
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:57,459
Some of them are choosing not to and just choosing not to purchase insurance

192
00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:02,438
because they might be healthy, they might be young and healthy.

193
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:05,176
And they might be thinking, well,

194
00:16:05,176 --> 00:16:11,530
I'll pay out of pocket if I have to go to the doctor, it's not that big a deal.

195
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:15,516
So thinking about this group and why they are uninsured,

196
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:20,440
the framers of the Affordable Care Act considered a number of issues.

197
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,050
First, creating the mandate that individuals must have insurance.

198
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:31,476
So, even the young and healthy in this population would buy

199
00:16:31,476 --> 00:16:36,477
insurance and be required to do so, mandated to do so.

200
00:16:36,477 --> 00:16:41,851
By outlawing pre-existing conditions, it would enable people in this

201
00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:47,940
group who wanted to purchase insurance but were excluded to be able to do so.

202
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,844
And then the provision to allow people up to the age of age 26 to stay on

203
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:54,772
their parents insurance.

204
00:16:54,772 --> 00:16:59,621
Is partly because many in this group are actually young and healthy and

205
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:04,820
are choosing not to buy their own insurance because it's very expensive.

206
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:09,537
So allowing them to stay on their parents insurance brings

207
00:17:09,537 --> 00:17:13,881
them into being insured, brings them into the pool.

208
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,070
And so, when we just think about this group, we can see that this

209
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:24,708
group by expanding Medicaid would help take care of this group and

210
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,597
allow them to have Medicaid insurance.

211
00:17:27,597 --> 00:17:29,160
I'm sorry about that.

212
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,194
This group, by providing subsidies for the marketplace and

213
00:17:34,194 --> 00:17:39,430
some of the other changes would allow them to be insured.

214
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:46,055
And finally, for this group and these top two groups, the individual mandate,

215
00:17:46,055 --> 00:17:52,097
the pre-existing conditions clause outlawing excluding insurance for

216
00:17:52,097 --> 00:17:57,667
pre-existing conditions and expansion for people up to age 26.

217
00:17:57,667 --> 00:18:03,381
All were considered by the framers of the Affordable Care Act

218
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:08,870
as ways to bring all of these people who are uninsured prior

219
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:15,330
to the Affordable Care Act under the umbrella of insurance.

220
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,794
And so, now, we'll just turn to look at some of the features of

221
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:25,611
the Affordable Care Act, officially called the 2010 Patient Protection and

222
00:18:25,611 --> 00:18:30,771
Affordable Care Act, as it was initially passed, so keep that in mind.

223
00:18:30,771 --> 00:18:36,481
This is fast, we're gonna be going through what was passed into law initially.

224
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,964
So, first we see that the individual, this mandate,

225
00:18:41,964 --> 00:18:47,341
mandated insurance coverage, all individuals in the United States

226
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:51,621
are mandated to have insurance coverage by 2014.

227
00:18:51,621 --> 00:18:58,797
And they would face tax penalties for not having insurance if they failed to do so,

228
00:18:58,797 --> 00:19:05,070
and this is sometimes referred to as the individual mandate.

229
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,561
The second key feature is the expansion of Medicaid and

230
00:19:09,561 --> 00:19:14,360
there are a number of characteristics to this expansion.

231
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,866
First, eligibility for Medicaid would be made for

232
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:23,686
everyone up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level,

233
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:28,530
with NO other specific eligibility requirements.

234
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:34,411
So for the first time, Medicaid eligibility would mean anyone and

235
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:40,501
everyone who is poor, under 138% of the Federal Poverty Level,

236
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:47,871
would be eligible for Medicaid, so, including single adults without children.

237
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,896
The expanded coverage for Medicaid in each state related to this

238
00:19:54,896 --> 00:20:00,304
change would be 100% funded by the federal government for

239
00:20:00,304 --> 00:20:08,120
the first 5 years and 90% covered by the federal government at 90% after 5 years.

240
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,136
So recall, Medicaid is a state program and so

241
00:20:13,136 --> 00:20:18,944
each state sets the budget and that budget is covered

242
00:20:18,944 --> 00:20:25,700
by the state with a federal match into the Medicaid program.

243
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,874
And what the Medicaid expansion said was that the federal

244
00:20:30,874 --> 00:20:35,835
government would cover the expanded coverage through

245
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:41,672
the Affordable Care Act at 100% initially and then 90%.

246
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:47,531
Rather than only being state funded with the federal match.

247
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:56,039
A third key feature was the establishment of Health Insurance Exchanges,

248
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:02,540
who are private insurers who offer plans for low and moderate income people.

249
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,322
And there are specific criteria that those plans have to meet and

250
00:21:06,322 --> 00:21:08,950
we'll look at those in just a moment.

251
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:13,047
And federal subsidies to people at

252
00:21:13,047 --> 00:21:18,134
the 139-399% of the FPL to buy into

253
00:21:18,134 --> 00:21:24,361
insurance plans offered in those State Exchanges.

254
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:31,921
Some more of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act as it

255
00:21:31,921 --> 00:21:33,872
was initially passed.

256
00:21:33,872 --> 00:21:38,962
Employers with 50 or more employees were now

257
00:21:38,962 --> 00:21:45,356
required to offer health insurance to their employees and

258
00:21:45,356 --> 00:21:52,080
they would be penalized for not offering insurance.

259
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,134
Low income employees would be able to receive vouchers to

260
00:21:57,134 --> 00:22:02,201
purchase if the employer was not able to offer coverage.

261
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:07,121
But they could offer vouchers to low income employees to

262
00:22:07,121 --> 00:22:11,938
purchase through those Health Insurance Exchanges,

263
00:22:11,938 --> 00:22:15,916
they would then be exempt from the penalty for

264
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:19,911
not offering an insurance plan themselves.

265
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:25,210
Some of the new rules for the health insurers,

266
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,931
all health insurers in the United States.

267
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:36,204
So this is the pre-existing condition exclusion, this first bullet,

268
00:22:36,204 --> 00:22:42,700
that insurers cannot deny coverage to anyone for a health status or any reason.

269
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:49,561
So, no pre-existing condition reason could be used to deny health insurance.

270
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:57,766
They cannot charge more and a health insurance plan based on health status,

271
00:22:57,766 --> 00:23:03,135
like a pre-existing condition or the gender of the person.

272
00:23:03,135 --> 00:23:08,976
Although, other factors can still be used to set the premium for

273
00:23:08,976 --> 00:23:13,842
health insurance, such as the number in the family,

274
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:20,990
the age of the recipient, tobacco use, the geographic area, etc.

275
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:27,039
A health insurer cannot rescind coverage in a calendar

276
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:34,360
year based on a health status change or an income change.

277
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:39,839
There are a minimum set of services and there's a slide that shows the essential

278
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,351
benefits that all health insurance plans are required to cover.

279
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:51,822
It did away with annual and lifetime limits on coverage and

280
00:23:51,822 --> 00:23:56,996
now required or enabled children to stay on their

281
00:23:56,996 --> 00:24:02,691
parents plan up to the age of 26, which is a change.

282
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,549
A few more of the provisions, as you know,

283
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:12,037
the Affordable Care Act was a very large change in policy and

284
00:24:12,037 --> 00:24:16,110
I'm not even gonna go through all of the provisions.

285
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:21,589
But some other key features of the insurance

286
00:24:21,589 --> 00:24:26,625
exchanges that would allow people to see

287
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:34,341
various health insurance plans offered and have subsidies.

288
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:38,127
So to people to purchase that insurance and for

289
00:24:38,127 --> 00:24:43,368
even people who worked in small businesses that could have plans

290
00:24:43,368 --> 00:24:49,309
offered to pools of small businesses through the insurance exchanges.

291
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:56,157
Health insurance plans as we just covered were required to meet minimum standards.

292
00:24:56,157 --> 00:25:00,676
There were catastrophic coverage plans allowed for

293
00:25:00,676 --> 00:25:05,511
some groups and subsidies for low income populations.

294
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,647
This is just a list of the ambulatory, the essential benefits for

295
00:25:10,647 --> 00:25:15,661
every health insurance plan that I'm not gonna discuss, but you can take a look at.

296
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:22,094
And then finally, so the requirement for

297
00:25:22,094 --> 00:25:29,823
having multiple types of plans offered in the insurance exchanges or

298
00:25:29,823 --> 00:25:34,754
the requirements for the types of plans were

299
00:25:34,754 --> 00:25:39,699
defined as what we called the metal levels.

300
00:25:39,699 --> 00:25:44,215
To allow for some variation in premiums versus

301
00:25:44,215 --> 00:25:49,410
out-of-pocket costs, and other benefits.

302
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:55,630
So, the lowest plan is called the bronze plans and

303
00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:00,518
those had the lowest monthly premium,

304
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:04,240
but the highest deductible.

305
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,958
So, that would mean the highest out-of-pocket

306
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:11,990
spending when you needed care,

307
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:17,511
even though the monthly premium itself would be very low.

308
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:26,797
The silver plans are the plans that anyone who received a subsidy,

309
00:26:26,797 --> 00:26:31,916
any low income person who received a subsidy

310
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:35,950
had to buy a silver or higher plan.

311
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:39,807
Silver plans had more moderate

312
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:44,850
premiums compared to bronze plans, and

313
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:50,489
they had moderate out-of-pocket costs and

314
00:26:50,489 --> 00:26:53,321
a 30% deductible.

315
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:58,678
So there would still be some out-of-pocket costs but

316
00:26:58,678 --> 00:27:04,161
somewhat lower premiums compared to the bronze plans.

317
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:11,511
The gold plans had relatively high monthly premiums, but lower deductibles.

318
00:27:11,511 --> 00:27:17,018
Which meant, lower out-of-pocket spending when you needed care,

319
00:27:17,018 --> 00:27:23,670
even though you're paying somewhat higher monthly premiums to own the insurance.

320
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:28,102
And finally, the platinum plans had the highest

321
00:27:28,102 --> 00:27:32,660
monthly premiums, but the lowest deductibles.

322
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:39,881
So, the lowest out-of-pocket spending when care was needed or at the point of care.

323
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:47,358
Finally, some more features of the Affordable Care Act is

324
00:27:47,358 --> 00:27:50,350
the Accountable Care Organizations.

325
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:56,206
We are going to get into more detail about Accountable Care Organizations

326
00:27:56,206 --> 00:28:01,882
when we discuss ways of improving quality of care and value based care.

327
00:28:01,882 --> 00:28:07,350
But for now, what accountable care organizations are is the requirement

328
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:13,613
that doctors and hospitals and other care providers joined together voluntarily,

329
00:28:13,613 --> 00:28:17,780
to deliver coordinated high quality care to patients.

330
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,804
With the goal of keeping those patients healthy and

331
00:28:21,804 --> 00:28:26,577
keeping those patients healthy of course means keeping them

332
00:28:26,577 --> 00:28:31,820
out of hospitals, and clinics, and doctors offices.

333
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:37,258
And so, in some ways, doctors providing that high quality

334
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:42,290
care means lower incomes and lower revenues for them.

335
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:46,731
And so, those savings that would be felt by the insurer,

336
00:28:46,731 --> 00:28:50,522
not having to pay the hospitals and the doctors,

337
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:55,450
those savings would be shared with the health care providers.

338
00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:00,635
So the doctor in the hospital, coordinating their care to keep patients

339
00:29:00,635 --> 00:29:06,430
healthy, which means keeping them out of the doctor's office in the hospital.

340
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:12,211
The savings that the insurer would experience would then be shared with

341
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:18,105
those doctors in hospitals, so they wouldn't be only losing revenue.

342
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:22,974
Under some later models of Accountable Care Organizations,

343
00:29:22,974 --> 00:29:27,841
not just the savings from better care that would be saved, but

344
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:31,397
when patients actually are using more care,

345
00:29:31,397 --> 00:29:37,107
especially unnecessary care, low value care, then the costs of that,

346
00:29:37,107 --> 00:29:42,257
that the insurer is paying out higher costs means the providers,

347
00:29:42,257 --> 00:29:47,688
the hospitals and the doctors would actually get paid lower levels or

348
00:29:47,688 --> 00:29:51,381
would be penalized for that lower value care.

349
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,725
Okay, so we have gone through,

350
00:29:56,725 --> 00:30:02,875
[LAUGH] The multiple key features of the law as it was passed.

351
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:07,482
But as you know, the law was or as many of you probably know.

352
00:30:07,482 --> 00:30:12,072
The law was immediately challenged as unconstitutional and

353
00:30:12,072 --> 00:30:13,786
it continues to be so.

354
00:30:13,786 --> 00:30:18,086
So let's take a look at some of what happened in the courts.

355
00:30:18,086 --> 00:30:21,424
So as you recall one of the key and

356
00:30:21,424 --> 00:30:26,623
central changes made by the Affordable Care Act.

357
00:30:26,623 --> 00:30:31,311
Established that anyone at or under 138% of

358
00:30:31,311 --> 00:30:37,295
the Federal Poverty line, would be eligible for Medicaid.

359
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:43,462
And that the everyone under that level would be eligible and

360
00:30:43,462 --> 00:30:49,013
that the federal government would be responsible for

361
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:54,207
covering the costs of this expanded population.

362
00:30:54,207 --> 00:31:00,480
In each state, 100% of the first 5 years and 90% after that.

363
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,440
Now, the first major challenge came about

364
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,988
through a number of states immediately

365
00:31:09,988 --> 00:31:14,674
challenged the Affordable Care Act over

366
00:31:14,674 --> 00:31:19,240
the expansion of Medicaid provision.

367
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,102
And so the first major change that occurred was

368
00:31:24,102 --> 00:31:28,965
the Supreme Court decision that determined,

369
00:31:28,965 --> 00:31:33,702
first the A C A overall was constitutional but

370
00:31:33,702 --> 00:31:38,459
Medicaid since Medicaid is a state program.

371
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:43,563
The expansion of Medicaid eligibility established

372
00:31:43,563 --> 00:31:48,899
in the A C A had to be up to each individual state to decide

373
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:55,288
if they wanted to participate in the expanded Medicaid program.

374
00:31:55,288 --> 00:32:00,966
And so this major change that, to expand or

375
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:06,644
not was left up to the states in part because

376
00:32:06,644 --> 00:32:14,547
of the statutory structure of Medicaid as a state program.

377
00:32:14,547 --> 00:32:19,828
Now, since the Supreme Court case and

378
00:32:19,828 --> 00:32:25,440
the passing of the affordable Care Act,

379
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:33,044
the a number of states have chosen to expand Medicaid.

380
00:32:33,044 --> 00:32:38,984
So 35 states plus Washington DC have expanded their Medicaid

381
00:32:38,984 --> 00:32:46,620
programs to follow the provisions of expanded Medicaid as defined in the A C A.

382
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:54,624
Up to this 15 states have not expanded Medicaid and they are listed there.

383
00:32:54,624 --> 00:32:59,064
3 of these 15 Missouri, Nebraska and

384
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:03,505
Oklahoma have had voter approved ballot

385
00:33:03,505 --> 00:33:07,826
initiatives that to expand Medicaid.

386
00:33:07,826 --> 00:33:13,202
But their legislatures have not followed procedures yet

387
00:33:13,202 --> 00:33:17,458
to make changes necessary to expand Medicaid

388
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:21,157
according to the Affordable Care Act.

389
00:33:21,157 --> 00:33:24,969
And so in those states we don't yet

390
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:30,227
see the expansion even though their voters have

391
00:33:30,227 --> 00:33:34,969
voted to expand Medicaid in those states.

392
00:33:34,969 --> 00:33:40,171
In the notes for the slides for this session is a link to

393
00:33:40,171 --> 00:33:45,268
some more information on the Medicaid expansions.

394
00:33:47,347 --> 00:33:52,742
And then finally the other major feature of the A C A that

395
00:33:52,742 --> 00:33:57,435
is being challenged right now is the mandate for

396
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:03,551
insurance coverage, often called the individual mandate.

397
00:34:03,551 --> 00:34:08,322
So as you recall, the A C A mandates everyone to have insurance coverage

398
00:34:08,322 --> 00:34:11,756
with tax penalties for not having that insurance.

399
00:34:14,283 --> 00:34:19,578
However, in 2017, the tax cuts and

400
00:34:19,578 --> 00:34:25,187
jobs act under the Trump administration,

401
00:34:25,187 --> 00:34:32,533
set the tax penalty for the individual mandate to $0.

402
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:36,278
So it didn't overturn the individual mandate,

403
00:34:36,278 --> 00:34:38,936
it just set the penalty to be zero.

404
00:34:38,936 --> 00:34:41,066
So no penalty.

405
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:46,524
At that point, Texas and joined by 18 other

406
00:34:46,524 --> 00:34:52,566
states sued to overturn the Affordable Care Act.

407
00:34:52,566 --> 00:34:57,864
Arguing that the entire Affordable Care Act should

408
00:34:57,864 --> 00:35:03,284
be struck down because it no longer was valid because

409
00:35:03,284 --> 00:35:09,829
the individual mandate was no longer an effective penalty.

410
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:15,061
In December 2019, the 5th Circuit of the U S Court of

411
00:35:15,061 --> 00:35:20,184
Appeals affirmed a lower court trial court's decision

412
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:28,042
that because the individual mandate is no longer has any penalty associated with it.

413
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:31,452
And is it is no longer constitutional and

414
00:35:31,452 --> 00:35:35,579
therefore the A C A is no longer constitutional.

415
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:40,098
The U S Court of Appeals approved or affirmed that

416
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:45,179
the individual mandate is no longer constitutional.

417
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:50,802
But, it referred back to the lower court a discussion or

418
00:35:50,802 --> 00:35:56,428
further consideration of whether that means the entire

419
00:35:56,428 --> 00:36:01,093
A C A should be struck down because it found that

420
00:36:01,093 --> 00:36:06,621
the individual mandate is no longer constitutional.

421
00:36:06,621 --> 00:36:12,629
The U S Supreme Court decided to take this case and

422
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:18,346
will be reviewing this case on November 10th

423
00:36:18,346 --> 00:36:23,917
2020 to decide if the Affordable Care Act

424
00:36:23,917 --> 00:36:28,329
overall is constitutional or not.

425
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:31,783
Given these findings by the lower court that

426
00:36:31,783 --> 00:36:36,083
the individual mandate is no longer constitutional.

427
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:41,090
While all of these trial court decisions have

428
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:46,489
been happening, the A C A is still in effect while

429
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:51,510
the court play the court decisions play out.

430
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:55,764
And so, just to sum up where we have been on the afford

431
00:36:55,764 --> 00:37:00,524
the changes of the Affordable Care Act in other sessions.

432
00:37:00,524 --> 00:37:07,906
You've seen this image of what our US 3rd party payer system looks like and

433
00:37:07,906 --> 00:37:12,484
so this is the system as it exists in 2020.

434
00:37:12,484 --> 00:37:17,873
And some of the key changes that you might be able to see on

435
00:37:17,873 --> 00:37:23,274
this slide are related to the fact that we have now ACOs.

436
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:28,119
And that really makes a connection here between

437
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:32,731
the pain players and the providers via ACOs.

438
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:36,826
So it's not just a relationship of submitting bills and

439
00:37:36,826 --> 00:37:40,496
submitting payments between these two parties.

440
00:37:40,496 --> 00:37:45,891
Managed care and ACOs, actually create almost like what could

441
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:51,916
be defined as a a fourth entity that we will discuss in other sessions.

442
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:56,346
But just so you have the picture now of in 2020,

443
00:37:56,346 --> 00:38:00,466
what are third party payer system looks like now

444
00:38:00,466 --> 00:38:05,118
with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.
