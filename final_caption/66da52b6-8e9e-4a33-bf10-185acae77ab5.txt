00:00:03,194 --> 00:00:07,863
Welcome in this video, I will provide an introduction to financial accounting,

2
00:00:07,863 --> 00:00:11,991
focusing on two important financial statements, the balance sheet and

3
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:16,340
the statement of operations.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,860
When we talk about accounting in the context of an organization,

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,540
we distinguish between financial accounting and managerial accounting.

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,384
Financial accounting records tracks and prepare statements on business

7
00:00:28,384 --> 00:00:32,240
transactions for outside parties following well defined rules.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,046
Manager accounting, on the other hand, conducts specialized analysis of costs and

9
00:00:37,046 --> 00:00:39,116
operations and develops budgets for

10
00:00:39,116 --> 00:00:45,240
internal managers following organization-specific guidelines.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,810
More specifically, financial accounting represents a system for providing useful

12
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,010
and relevant financial information that is generally historical in nature.

13
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,980
The main audience for financial account information are external users.

14
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:03,040
But of course, internal managers also use financial accounting information.

15
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,155
There are three distinct financial accounting activities accumulation,

16
00:01:07,155 --> 00:01:09,350
communication, and interpretation.

17
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,648
Accumulation includes recording and classifying business transactions and

18
00:01:13,648 --> 00:01:14,759
financial events.

19
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:19,559
Examples of transactions include purchasing supplies, paying employees,

20
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:23,350
providing services to a patient, and taking out a bank loan.

21
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,320
Accumulation is also referred to as the bookkeeping function.

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,170
Communication includes reporting aggregate financial information to users.

23
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,130
Most commonly,

24
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,665
financial information is reported in the so-called financial statements.

25
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:41,567
Interpretation of financial information refers to analyzing and

26
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:44,740
evaluating reported financial information.

27
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,500
For instance, a reader of financial statements might

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,200
want to evaluate how profitable an organization is or

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,540
how well the organization is positioned to take on additional debt if needed.

30
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,122
These types of analyses are done both internally by managers and

31
00:01:58,122 --> 00:02:04,940
externally by investors, creditors, and other external stakeholders.

32
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,009
Most organizations produce a standard set of financial statements.

33
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:14,037
There are five individual statements that together make up the financial statements.

34
00:02:14,037 --> 00:02:18,127
The balance sheet, the statement of operations or income statement,

35
00:02:18,127 --> 00:02:22,352
the statement of changes in net assets, the statement of cash flows, and

36
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:25,140
the notes to the financial statements.

37
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,737
In this video, I will introduce the balance sheet and

38
00:02:27,737 --> 00:02:32,540
the statement of operations and explain how these two statements are linked.

39
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,977
In developing the financial statements, accountants follow various sets of rules.

40
00:02:36,977 --> 00:02:41,226
In the United States, financial accounting is performed in accordance

41
00:02:41,226 --> 00:02:47,240
with generally accepted accounting principles also called Gap, or US Gap.

42
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,059
Generally accepted accounting principles are developed by the so-called

43
00:02:51,059 --> 00:02:53,640
Financial Accounting Standards Board.

44
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,821
This board is a private nonprofit organization designated by the SEC to

45
00:02:57,821 --> 00:03:01,097
Securities and Exchange Commission as responsible for

46
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,640
setting accounting standards.

47
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,093
In addition, healthcare accountants rely on guidance from the American Institute of

48
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:11,082
Certified Public accountants Committee on Health Care,

49
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:14,376
as well as the healthcare financial management associations,

50
00:03:14,376 --> 00:03:20,740
principles and practices for more industry-specific rules, and regulations.

51
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,840
Let's start with the balance sheet.

52
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,441
The balance sheet presents a firm's financial position at a specific point in

53
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:31,410
time, such as the last day of the firm's fiscal year.

54
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:37,640
The balance does present a snapshot of the financial position of a firm.

55
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,956
The balance sheet lists as of the end of the reporting period the assets or

56
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:46,740
resources of an organization, and the claims against those resources.

57
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,428
In other words, the balance sheet reports the assets of navigation and

58
00:03:51,428 --> 00:03:57,340
how those assets were financed either through liabilities or net assets.

59
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,499
Perhaps the most important characteristic of the balance sheet is that it must

60
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:02,300
balance.

61
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:08,440
Total assets must equal total liabilities and net assets.

62
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:16,750
This relationship is called the accounting identity or basic accounting equation.

63
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,010
The asset side of the balance sheet list the assets or

64
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,100
economic resource of the firm as recognized and measured by gap.

65
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,991
Examples include land, equipment, inventory, and cash holdings.

66
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:33,250
According to get many but not all resource of a firm are listed on the balance sheet.

67
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,639
For instance, one could argue that the most important asset of a firm is its

68
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:43,540
employees, employees, however, are not listed as an asset on the balance sheet.

69
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,694
In general, assets have broken down by liquidity into current assets and

70
00:04:47,694 --> 00:04:50,340
noncurrent or long-term assets.

71
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,013
Current assets include cash and other assets that are expected to be converted

72
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:58,782
into cash within one accounting period, so usually one year.

73
00:04:58,782 --> 00:05:03,445
Examples include short term financial investments, accounts receivables,

74
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:07,198
that is money owed to the firm by its customers, inventory, and

75
00:05:07,198 --> 00:05:11,440
prepaid expenses, such as a prepaid insurance policy.

76
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,361
Noncurrent or long-term assets include long-term financial investments,

77
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:18,100
as well as land, buildings, and equipment.

78
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,740
These are also known as fixed assets.

79
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,344
This section of the balance sheet also lists accumulated depreciation,

80
00:05:25,344 --> 00:05:29,949
which represents the total dollar amount of depreciation, that has been

81
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:34,570
recognized by the firm against the historical costs of its fixed assets.

82
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,790
Assets are important because they allow a firm to produce its goods and services.

83
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,250
Healthcare organizations, for instance, need assets to provide patient care and

84
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,940
earn patient care revenues.

85
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,062
The liabilities and

86
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:53,780
net assets side of the balance sheet lists the claims against the firm's assets.

87
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,579
In essence,

88
00:05:54,579 --> 00:06:00,040
this side reports the sources of financing used to acquire the firm's assets.

89
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,020
Liabilities represent claims against the assets of an organization that

90
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,550
are fixed by contract.

91
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,921
Examples include claims by workers for unpaid salaries and wages or

92
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:13,640
claims by a lender for a loan provided to the firm.

93
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,823
Again, gap determines which liabilities are listed on the balance sheet and

94
00:06:17,823 --> 00:06:20,440
how these liabilities are valued.

95
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,540
In general, liabilities are listed in the order in which they will be paid.

96
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,187
Current liabilities include liabilities that must be paid within the accounting

97
00:06:30,187 --> 00:06:33,140
period, so usually within the year.

98
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:38,177
Examples of accounts payable that is money owed by the firm to its suppliers and

99
00:06:38,177 --> 00:06:44,519
notes people that is money owed to banks for short term loans.

100
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:49,502
Non current or long term liabilities represent financing to the forum with

101
00:06:49,502 --> 00:06:54,270
maturity of more than one accounting period so usually several years.

102
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:59,152
Examples include long term bank loans, mortgages and bonds.

103
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:06,138
Liability are important because they allow firms to get assets and grow.

104
00:07:06,138 --> 00:07:09,925
Underneath all liabilities that balance sheet list the net assets or

105
00:07:09,925 --> 00:07:14,170
the firm's residual ownership interest in its own assets after the claims of

106
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,260
creditors against these assets are satisfied.

107
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,454
We call this ownership claim net assets when the organization has not for

108
00:07:21,454 --> 00:07:24,901
profit status, as many organizations and health care do.

109
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:26,061
For form profit firms,

110
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:29,940
the term equities commonly used to refer to the ownership claim.

111
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,549
Net assets grow when the firm makes a profit,

112
00:07:32,549 --> 00:07:35,940
not as it's decreased when the firm incurs a loss.

113
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,776
We'll talk more about this relationship towards the end of this video.

114
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:41,155
For firms that is so

115
00:07:41,155 --> 00:07:51,664
important because they allow the firm to raise additional debt.

116
00:07:51,664 --> 00:07:55,373
The statement of operations, also known as income statement,

117
00:07:55,373 --> 00:08:00,410
presents the firms operating results over a period of time, usually a year.

118
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:04,181
The statement of operations lists of firms, revenues,

119
00:08:04,181 --> 00:08:06,151
expenses and profit or loss.

120
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:08,930
Revenues are economic values earned.

121
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,231
They represent the cash received and the unpaid obligations of customers for

122
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:16,940
goods and services provided during the reporting period.

123
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,529
For healthcare organization revenues include patient care revenues,

124
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:24,771
other operating revenues and investment income.

125
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:28,010
Expenses are economic values spent or consumed.

126
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,290
They represent the cost of doing business.

127
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:35,740
Examples include salaries and wages, supplies, interest, and depreciation.

128
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,679
The difference between revenues and expenses is called the excess

129
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:46,540
of revenues over expenses or net income or, in the case of a loss net loss.

130
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,309
Let's take a closer look at the different revenues that the healthcare organization

131
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:52,740
might report on a statement of operations.

132
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,457
The most common type of revenue earned by a health care organization is patient

133
00:08:57,457 --> 00:08:58,680
services revenue.

134
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,023
Revenues are generated in the provision of routine care services,

135
00:09:03,023 --> 00:09:08,430
as well as an soy services such as, OR, lab, radiology, and pharmacy.

136
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,782
In addition to patient services revenue,

137
00:09:10,782 --> 00:09:14,650
many healthcare organizations earn also operating revenues.

138
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:18,690
These are revenues from operating activities that are not patient care.

139
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:23,579
Examples may include cafeteria sales, parking, lot fees and research or

140
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:25,840
grand revenues.

141
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,577
Finally, health care organizations, especially not for profit ones,

142
00:09:29,577 --> 00:09:31,570
may earn non operating revenues.

143
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,620
These typically represent a small proportion of total revenues, and examples

144
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,967
may include donations and gifts, as well as investment income, such as interest,

145
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:47,341
income from financial investments, and capital gains on financial investments.

146
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:51,804
While non operating revenues are often fairly small in comparison to patient care

147
00:09:51,804 --> 00:09:54,393
revenues, they are nonetheless important for

148
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:57,953
the financial viability of many healthcare organizations, and

149
00:09:57,953 --> 00:10:03,640
can mean the difference between reporting a net income or net loss.

150
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,236
This graph shows the proportion of total revenues that is learned from non

151
00:10:07,236 --> 00:10:08,840
operating activities.

152
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,340
As you can see, this percentage tends to fluctuate quite a bit.

153
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:16,282
The main reason is that donations and especially investment income,

154
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,840
fluctuate year over year.

155
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,206
When the economy does well, investment income tends to be higher than in years

156
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:29,161
when the economy does poorly, as was the case during the great recession in 2008.

157
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:35,335
This graph shows average hospital operating in total margins.

158
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:39,743
Operating margins represent profits from operations that is patient care and

159
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:44,840
other operating activities, such as cafeteria sales and research revenue.

160
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,635
Total margins represent total profits from both operations and

161
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:50,360
non operating activities.

162
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,056
As you can see in most years, non operating activities contribute

163
00:10:54,056 --> 00:10:57,940
quite significantly to hospitals' financial performance.

164
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:03,026
The exception again is during the Great Recession in 2008, where non operating

165
00:11:03,026 --> 00:11:07,472
revenues on average, were negative, mainly due to investment losses.

166
00:11:07,472 --> 00:11:12,419
Expenses are the costs of services and goods used in the production of patient

167
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:16,640
care and other operations during the accounting period.

168
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,590
Examples include labor expenses, supplies, expenses, utilities, expenses,

169
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,840
depreciation expenses and interest expenses.

170
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,157
According to gap, expenses are measured and recorded in the period in which they

171
00:11:29,157 --> 00:11:33,980
are incurred or consumed and in which the revenues they helped generate are earned.

172
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,598
This principle of financial accounting is called the matching principle.

173
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:43,538
On the statement of operations expenses can be reported in two different ways

174
00:11:43,538 --> 00:11:48,250
by organizational classification that is by division or department, or

175
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,747
by natural classification that is by type of expense.

176
00:11:51,747 --> 00:11:55,595
Reporting by natural classification is more common than reporting by

177
00:11:55,595 --> 00:11:59,450
organizational classification.

178
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:03,135
This graph shows the composition of a typical hospitals,

179
00:12:03,135 --> 00:12:08,098
expenses of no tears that almost 60 of total expenses represent salaries and

180
00:12:08,098 --> 00:12:12,985
wages providing health care and also public health services requires a lot of

181
00:12:12,985 --> 00:12:18,879
personnel, which was reflected in the composition of these firms expenses.

182
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:23,295
To conclude the session, let's understand the link between the balance sheet and

183
00:12:23,295 --> 00:12:28,040
the statement of operations.

184
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,593
The balance sheet and statement of operations are linked to

185
00:12:31,593 --> 00:12:37,040
the organization's excess of revenues over expenses or its net income or net loss.

186
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,554
Any income earned during a year, increases in organizations net assets,

187
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:46,240
any loss incurred subtracts from the organization's net assets.

188
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,588
This link between the balance sheet and

189
00:12:48,588 --> 00:12:53,296
the statement operations allows us to expand our basic accounting equation.

190
00:12:53,296 --> 00:12:58,168
And the expanded accounting equation reads as follows, assets,

191
00:12:58,168 --> 00:13:03,649
equal liabilities plus net assets plus excess of revenues over expenses,

192
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:07,440
which is defined as revenues minus expenses.

193
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,975
We will use this equation in the future to understand how accountants

194
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:23,389
record financial information.
