00:00:05,535 --> 00:00:09,790
Hello, this is Peter Jacobson continuing
our discussion of the US health care

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,060
delivery assessment.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,998
Now we're going to
conclude the session with

4
00:00:15,998 --> 00:00:19,943
a discussion of how we
regulate health care.

5
00:00:19,943 --> 00:00:23,308
First question we should
ask is why do we regulate?

6
00:00:23,308 --> 00:00:27,680
And the first reason is that
there can be market failure.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,743
An organization could build a monopoly,
such as Microsoft or AT&T.

8
00:00:33,743 --> 00:00:36,910
You can have information asymmetries,

9
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:43,010
where different segments have more
access to important information.

10
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:49,570
And to overcome the market failure,
we impose some governmental oversight.

11
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,000
Second reason is to protect
the public health and safety.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,680
That's largely a function of
the public health assessment.

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,445
And third, we might have some
redistributive goals, equity,

14
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:03,601
for instance.

15
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:08,813
We might say that health care
is unequally distributed

16
00:01:08,813 --> 00:01:13,808
because only wealth people
can afford access to it.

17
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:20,020
And we might then say government need
either step in through federally qualified

18
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,960
health centers and through governmental
insurance potentially even single

19
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:33,050
payer systems to make sure that everyone
has equal access to health care.

20
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:39,160
But there are certain reasons where
one might say we should not regulate.

21
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,020
To begin with,
where there is market failure,

22
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,490
there's also governmental failure.

23
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,180
Governments are hardly perfect.

24
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,570
We have seen major difficulties
with all governmental programs and

25
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,720
how they're implemented
with cost overruns,

26
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,210
not being able to provide
the care that was promised.

27
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:04,501
Second, there's a concern the government
might intrude on individuals or

28
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:05,996
the private sector.

29
00:02:05,996 --> 00:02:10,940
This particularly the case was regard
to public health intervention.

30
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,890
For instance, on requiring
motorcycle helmets when people

31
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,070
want to exercise their free choice.

32
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,210
The antidote to not regulating
is let the market work, and

33
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,440
it can be unduly burdensome.

34
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,960
Health care is a heavily regulated entity,
and

35
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:35,430
some argue that the regulations
are not only unduly burdensome,

36
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,600
but they're not very effective.

37
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,300
Let's think back to the start when I
mentioned the idea of competition policy,

38
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:50,000
where the government
oversees the private sector.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,640
While some entities like
the Cato Institute,

40
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:00,200
the libertarian think tank mentioned
earlier, believe in minimal government.

41
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,160
Most agree that some governmental

42
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,930
intervention is appropriate to
control the private sector.

43
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,980
The government promulgates rules and
standards.

44
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:18,111
That the market can operate by it and
monitor the economic and social system.

45
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:22,437
So then the issues of equity and
access can be addressed and

46
00:03:22,437 --> 00:03:27,297
governmental intervention can
range from coercive oversight,

47
00:03:27,297 --> 00:03:31,448
the heavy regulation of fraud and
abuse in health care,

48
00:03:31,448 --> 00:03:35,069
to providing incentives
like shared savings for

49
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:40,120
accountable care organizations
we talked about earlier.

50
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,510
So what are the goals of regulation,

51
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:48,336
given that it's designed to
oversee competition policy?

52
00:03:48,336 --> 00:03:53,590
First, we want to improved quality
of care in this regulatory process,

53
00:03:53,590 --> 00:04:00,060
to improve quality, to control costs,
to improve access to care,

54
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,360
ideally to facilitate market arrangements,
not to impede them and

55
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,540
to reduce waste, fraud and abuse.

56
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,100
Let's look first at how states
monitor they healthcare system.

57
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,150
They do so in several ways.

58
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,750
First, they license medical
care professionals.

59
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:27,540
Both physicians and nurse practitioners
must be licensed to provide care.

60
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,050
Once they're licensed,
the state sets forth scope of practice

61
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,110
regulations that determine the extent
to which they can provide care.

62
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,230
In some states, for instance,

63
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:44,140
a nurse practitioner can only
practice under physicians.

64
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:52,550
In others, NPAs and PAs have a wide scope
of practice independently of physicians.

65
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,680
Secondly, states regulate
health insurance,

66
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,460
although the federal government provides
insurance through Medicare and Medicaid.

67
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,850
And the federal government
plays no role in regulating

68
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,760
commercial insurance at the state level.

69
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,185
Instead, states regulate health
insurance in terms of the benefits

70
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:18,425
that need to be provided with
the caveat that the Affordable Care Act

71
00:05:18,425 --> 00:05:22,815
imposes minimum benefit requirements, and

72
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:29,375
states regulate the premiums
that health insurers can charge.

73
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:33,405
Third, states license hospital and
nursing homes.

74
00:05:33,405 --> 00:05:36,690
You need a license to open a hospital.

75
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:42,540
That license can be through a certificate
of need that some states impose.

76
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,910
But even if there's no certificate of
need, you still must have a license

77
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:55,090
that would regulate solvency and that they
meet certain sanitation requirements.

78
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:01,540
At the federal level,
there is considerable regulation.

79
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,440
First, the department of Health and
Human services has a number

80
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,760
of component that directly affect
how health care is provided.

81
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:19,630
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services determine a variety of aspects

82
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:25,470
for Medicare and Medicaid services.

83
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,399
Through Medicare and
Medicaid that we have the bevy of

84
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,740
regulations that healthcare
providers need to follow.

85
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,793
In particular, the fraud and
abuse regulations that run to well

86
00:06:41,793 --> 00:06:47,230
over 1,000 pages in the Federal Register.

87
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:52,220
The FDA, the Food and
Drug Administration, is responsible for

88
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,620
ensuring the safety of
pharmaceutical products.

89
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:02,570
And there's an extensive process
the pharmaceutical manufactures

90
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:08,130
must go through to demonstrate
that a drug is safe and

91
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,470
effective and
can be marketed to the public.

92
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:20,120
NIH, national institute of health is
talked about in CBC and AHRQ as well.

93
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,460
The Office of Management and
Budget plays a very important role

94
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,440
in regulating healthcare because
all proposed regulations

95
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,750
must go through the Office
of Management and

96
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:40,030
Budget before they can
be promulgated as rules.

97
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:47,230
So the process that CMS would go through,
for example, to monitor fraud and

98
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:51,796
abuse, or anti-trust regulations.

99
00:07:51,796 --> 00:07:58,360
First, the government works with
the industry to build the regulations.

100
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,430
And the government has the final say.

101
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,260
But it's often advantageous to get
input from both the government and

102
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,790
the community.

103
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:14,660
One way to do that is that the government
issues a Notice of Proposed Rule-making

104
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,620
in the Federal Register and
invites comments from the public.

105
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:25,260
For the most part, the commentary comes
through organized trade associations.

106
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:30,950
But on the other hand, the non-profit
sector, particularly healthcare advocates,

107
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:37,060
have been very effective in
consolidating a lot of public comment to

108
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:42,510
the countervailing forces in the industry
observations on the proposed rule.

109
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:48,590
So the government would issue a proposed
rule, would go out for comment.

110
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,160
After the comment, the government is

111
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,010
required to take into account
the comments, to issue a final rule.

112
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:02,060
That final rule would go to
the Office of Management and Budget

113
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,970
because the OMB as it's called,
is responsible for

114
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:13,280
ensuring that there's a cost benefit
analysis before the rule goes out.

115
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,870
So OMB would make sure
that the rule isn't overly

116
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,100
economically burdensome to the industry.

117
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:28,170
And then once the rule is
issued it's up to the CMS and

118
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,550
other parts of
the Department of Health and

119
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:36,640
Human Services to monitor progress and
to seek sanctions.

120
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,880
If the healthcare system isn't
appropriately implementing the guidelines.

121
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,540
The most onerous sanctions have been
through the fraud and abuse process.

122
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:52,902
For example,
the HCA about a decade ago paid well over

123
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:59,829
$1 billion because of allegations
of systematic fraud and abuse.

124
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:05,718
And more recently, physician's
groups in Florida and Michigan have

125
00:10:05,718 --> 00:10:12,430
been accused of criminal conduct
through the fraud and abuse regime.

126
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,160
Congress plays an important
role here also.

127
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:23,450
Congress not only oversees the federal
agencies through the Health Education,

128
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:28,160
Labor and Pension Committee,
the Health Committee Finance Committee and

129
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,760
particularly the Health Subcommittee, but
also the House of Representatives Ways and

130
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:40,710
and Means Committee, where all laws
involving tax implications originate.

131
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,664
And then the Committee on Energy and
Commerce and

132
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:46,771
the Health Subcommittee
also provide oversight.

133
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:51,602
And Congress enacts legislation,
such as the Affordable Care Act,

134
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:56,349
then holds hearings to see how
the government is implementing it and

135
00:10:56,349 --> 00:11:00,050
what other aspects need to be addressed.

136
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:05,850
So that's the basic over line
process of regulating healthcare.

137
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,830
But there are limits to
healthcare regulation.

138
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:14,650
One is that it's a rapidly changing and
competitive market so

139
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:21,530
it's very difficult For the government
to keep up and get ahead of the market.

140
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,456
In particularly,
it's very hard to regulate now near

141
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:29,463
18% gross domestic product.

142
00:11:29,463 --> 00:11:34,607
It seems to me that we need a whole
new way of thinking about regulation,

143
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:40,290
because you have ongoing tensions
between regulators and the regulated.

144
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,426
There's a sense that
the regulations are two onerous,

145
00:11:44,426 --> 00:11:46,980
too detailed, too complicated.

146
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,259
I can tell you from teaching the fraud and

147
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:54,217
abuse regulations that
is almost impossible for

148
00:11:54,217 --> 00:12:01,183
attorneys to figure out what the rules
mean, let alone healthcare administrators.

149
00:12:01,183 --> 00:12:07,634
And it's just very costly,
far too costly as it's stuctured.

150
00:12:07,634 --> 00:12:13,254
And while there's no optimal
regulatory structure,

151
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:18,506
the fact is that we can change
how we regulate to make

152
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:23,270
it easier to achieve
regulatory goals without

153
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:28,417
burdensome micromanaging
at the federal level.

154
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:32,946
One way to think about broad guidance and
parameters and

155
00:12:32,946 --> 00:12:36,991
let the market work out how
to meet those goals with

156
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:41,808
the government regulating to
make sure that the healthcare

157
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:47,760
industry isn't taking advantage
of that added flexibility.

158
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,260
But the problem is that standard
arrangements that would be acceptable

159
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,778
in the market place, that are really
favorable to patients are being blocked.

160
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:02,340
They're impeded because there's
a concern that they may be

161
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:08,020
inducing referrals which drive
up the cost of healthcare.

162
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:15,895
And finally it's difficult to block market
changes absent over owner regulations, and

163
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:21,565
we want the markets to evolve,
we want markets to be flexible and

164
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:25,983
without one onerous
regulations to impede them.

165
00:13:25,983 --> 00:13:29,242
But finding that balance is a challenge.
