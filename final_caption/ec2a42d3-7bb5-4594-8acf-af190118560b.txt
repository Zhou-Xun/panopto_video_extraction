1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:13,270
Okay. Let's start. So remember last the last two weeks, we were talking.

2
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:21,880
I mean, first about surface operation in the night and then about how to measure diet by using food frequency questionnaires.

3
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:31,479
And hopefully, I convinced you that even though the food frequency questionnaire is not ideal for large scale studies,

4
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,720
probably is the best way of measuring long term intake.

5
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:40,990
Right. Okay. So today and next week, we are going to talk about a new topic.

6
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:47,139
So we are going to see anthropometric is another measure of nutritional assessment.

7
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:53,950
I mean, clearly here we are not measuring diet, but we are kind of like measuring in a way body composition.

8
00:00:53,950 --> 00:01:00,450
And that reflects also the nutritional assessment of of people, particularly kids.

9
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:10,000
So most of you who are nutritionists, you there already know a lot about anthropometric data.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,629
So then I kind of like give a brief review for the non nutrition students and then what we are going

11
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:24,430
really to focus on this class is about how to analyze that data when usefully comes from survey data,

12
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:32,930
from complex designs. And I'm sorry about unique because this is review from what we see in a basic Z2.

13
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:40,360
So basically it is the same kind of similar class. So so for you will be a review but for the rest hopefully is new.

14
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:47,800
So this is the the outline. So we will go over the anthropometric indicators that we review.

15
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,239
We look at anthropometric in the context of obesity particular.

16
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,680
We will talk about BMI. How good or bad is BMI as a proxy of adiposity?

17
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,280
We know that it has prevalence, what is widely used by. And then very briefly,

18
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:12,579
I'll mention there that mutual support for analyzing anthropometric data that you can use and

19
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:21,130
then most of the actually class today and next week will be checking how to analyze survey data.

20
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,300
So we'll talk about the main things about complex designs,

21
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:33,040
which is understanding the difference between a stratification versus clustering, understanding, sampling weights.

22
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:38,800
And then we will use the proxy harvesting. So now you are going to learn new blocks.

23
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:47,560
You haven't used them before. How many of you have analyzed survey data using the proxy surveys before?

24
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,530
No way. Okay, that's good. I mean, everyone sees it.

25
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:02,020
Yes, I have. Then. There's no purpose in this class. Okay. And the love assignment will be embedded with in my explanations.

26
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,450
I mean, the first part, I usually will talk aloud, unfortunately.

27
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:14,840
So please feel free to stop me. And then as we move forward, then we will be way more kind of like part of the lab.

28
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:22,790
And next we probably will be a motley lab. Okay, so let's see the anthropometric measurements.

29
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,089
So these are these are super.

30
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,200
All right, so these are things that we've been measuring for centuries, right?

31
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:38,420
So the most basic things that kind of like help us to understand, in particular for kids, if they are growing well, right.

32
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,170
Is their height and their weight. Right.

33
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,719
And then you can measure other things like the mid upper conference, right?

34
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:57,830
Because that's kind of like also be an indicator of of being either my knowledge or being kind of like overweight.

35
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,530
You can measure all those conferences to make sure that they're growing well and you can measure this influence, right?

36
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:10,100
I mean, they're all sort of a skillful recipe to a lot of scapula as kind of like a proxy or self adiposity.

37
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,479
But even though you measure many of those in clinic,

38
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:24,320
I said in the NHL for epidemiological studies where you end up of measuring this height and weight and maybe waist circumference.

39
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:33,799
Right, and maybe the hips as well. So how do you measure those with very basic kind of like tools, hopefully?

40
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,190
Well, standardized, though, and calibrate it. Right. So, I mean,

41
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:45,139
you use the study ometer for their high do I mean for the baby really is recommend length you use these things

42
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:51,740
for the baby some forgot to by the way this time I go to the vet I had to pull my guts in those things.

43
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,640
And those are the this is for this game for us, right?

44
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:05,989
So, so measuring kind of like those things for adults is kind of like very clear that you.

45
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,680
Yes. Measure your weight and your height, hopefully.

46
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,870
I mean, through most of your other what you don't change your height, right,

47
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:23,359
until you reach your elder years that maybe you get a little bit shorter because of your kind of like a spine.

48
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,950
Right. But other than that, I mean, once you reach your height and we give them a check, but kids change, right?

49
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,420
Kids grow, right. So then for kids,

50
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:43,729
we kind of just measure weight and height and not take into account their age and all that since we had to put all these things in context.

51
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:48,799
Right? So there are three kind of like men and I mean the three on one.

52
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,470
Naturally, anthropometric indicators in children are those three by the weight for height.

53
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:03,079
So basically you put your weight in relation to height, which makes a lot of sense because I mean the taller you are, the higher your weight.

54
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:09,300
And that doesn't mean that you are increasing your weight in an unhealthy way, right?

55
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,090
You're just growing, right? So that will measure your body weight relative to height.

56
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:19,280
And usually this is use in as an indicator of current nutritional status.

57
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,790
How many of your weight for your high this low. Really low.

58
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:35,089
Then we say that gets as a wasted right as for height for it actually reflects the cumulative linear role how I mean how you are I mean serious gets

59
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:44,870
age they get taller and not always have the same velocity we know and you know that kind of like the the growth carbs are kind of like kind of funny,

60
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,210
like a wrong kind of like puberty. They kind of like you start kind of like going a little more.

61
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,790
And in adolescence, I mean, they have those growth spurts, right?

62
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:58,970
The suddenly they haven't been really growing necessarily, but they end up being super cool.

63
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:13,069
Right? So so this I mean, when those indicators are low, this can be an indicator of chronic malnutrition or and or chronic or frequent illness.

64
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,610
Right. Because, I mean, they're frequently illness that will impair your growth.

65
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:23,240
Right. And then we when we have a a kid with low height for age, we say that that kid is standing.

66
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,110
Right. And then finally, their third indicator indicators,

67
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,290
the one that is a little more difficult to interpret because it's a composite

68
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:34,999
measure between the other two is weight for and reflects body mass relative to age.

69
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,940
But sentence is kind of like a little more complex. But when a kid has no weight for that age, we can see that they are underweight.

70
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,220
Right. So those are the three indicators and.

71
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:55,630
They says that for kids the indicators are derived from comparison against a pupil population preferences.

72
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:03,850
Right. So we need those kind of like a standard and then we will compare that, give to those standards.

73
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:11,920
And they what are the population preferences? I mean, the population preferences are the W.H.O. standards, right?

74
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,540
Although they are also kind of like national references.

75
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,650
Like like here in this country, you have the CDC references, right?

76
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:32,590
So so this was kind of like the references were review the last time, a long time ago, actually.

77
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:40,030
And this was a humongous effort. I remember I was a bit to these children.

78
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,360
So you can think about how low was that?

79
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:51,430
He was attending the conference was a conference in Vienna and the International Nutrition Conference, whatever.

80
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,549
And then they were actually releasing the the W.H.O. child growth standards.

81
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,770
Right.

82
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:06,460
And I remember listening to my father is who was the director of the project, and someone asked, and when are you going to release the next one?

83
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,500
Kind of. I said, I don't know, because I will be kind of like doing it.

84
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,670
So she was so kind of like that added of this huge study.

85
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,000
And basically she said that, I won't see that.

86
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,719
So I'm not sure if at some point the world can try another one.

87
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,770
In theory, this one was made with kind of like the state of the art,

88
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:36,399
kind of like trying to really come up with with looking at populations in which let's see how kids should grow in ideal conditions.

89
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,340
Right, in good conditions. Not that the conditions. Right.

90
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,630
And if it's kind of like growing good conditions, that way we can use the standards like that.

91
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:50,110
And the main thing that that they the reason why they needed those new standards is because the previous

92
00:09:50,110 --> 00:10:02,710
standards were done based on populations of babies that were mostly bottle fed and not breastfed.

93
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:12,630
So then now we know that that's not the ideal way of growing and then one of its butterfat babies grow differently than breastfed babies,

94
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,510
and that that was why they needed this kind of like new thing.

95
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,520
Now that they did that, I think I think probably they wouldn't need anyone.

96
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:32,379
So one of the things that these studies show actually is that providing that you have the good conditions so that babies are,

97
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,280
well, narration they have a good environment that they don't get sick all the time.

98
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,210
All babies in the world grow the same, right?

99
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:50,290
So it's not like there are no there's no really in need of national kind of like references because all babies are humans, they grow exactly the same.

100
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,410
I mean, considering your genetics, of course, I mean,

101
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:59,820
you cannot really expect that babies coming from parents who are shot are going to be basketball players.

102
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:07,630
Right. So but they will kind of like follow their usual kind of like golf growth curve in the same way as other kids that are too.

103
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:16,480
Right. So anyway, so I'm sure that you are kind of like sick of seeing this, that both are, of course.

104
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:23,890
And this is kind of like there are many examples. This is one for looking at length for age for girls.

105
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,280
And this is only from birth to two year, right?

106
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:33,340
Because one I mean, then you will have like another part from two years about because then it changes a lot.

107
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,440
So this one is actually you seeing placentas, right?

108
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,810
So then you can see here there's a 3% time, which is nice separately and this is a 50% thing.

109
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:52,840
And then I have a funny study with the percentiles because I mean, in theory you don't want I mean, it's kind of like, sorry, this.

110
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:04,820
I have like let's say you have a girl who is 11 months and she's they're kind of like lost to us at percent.

111
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,030
So which do you feel like? Oh, she looks short for that her age.

112
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,810
Right. And that's true.

113
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:20,630
But also, I mean, I have this like anecdote from one of my friends who's a mathematician,

114
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:25,400
and her daughter was kind of like short, but she was growing.

115
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:32,210
Okay. So it's kind of like, imagine that she was born like this and then she was going this way.

116
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:38,690
Right. And she knew what she was going to be short because I'm short and her is short.

117
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:44,059
Right. So it's okay. But the pediatricians were always kind of like insistent, oh, your daughter is malnourished.

118
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,650
You're not. You have to do something.

119
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:55,490
And suddenly one day she said, you know, someone has to be in the third percentile, which is kind of like a mathematician on set.

120
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,970
I mean, yeah, 3% of the population are there.

121
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,990
Right. So then and maybe there's nothing wrong with them.

122
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,860
So then where you want to measure with this girl, which is that you are not here and then suddenly you go there, then that's wrong.

123
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:15,230
There's something wrong with your girl, right? But maybe you're just kind of like, sure, she's probably okay.

124
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:28,369
Right. Anyway, so the example we had that 11 month old girl a length, 68 centimeters, and then we can also do the same instead with percent.

125
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,690
That is actually we can use SIDS scores, right?

126
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:36,679
So we can use the standard deviation so that the percent that this the median would be zero

127
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,630
and B's would be minus two and do some reservations minus three and Thiessen variations.

128
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:47,989
And the reason that would be too kind of like cutoffs is because in theory, yeah, you want more mostly.

129
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,910
I mean, this is a normal distribution.

130
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:57,620
So 98% of people should be kind of like of kids should be around those two and minus two a standard deviation, right.

131
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,470
And they're kind of like outliers, maybe in their in their in their tails.

132
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,490
So what we do is that we calculate that this scores, right?

133
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:16,129
So basically we take the chest measurement, we subtract the population median, and then we divide by the population standard deviation.

134
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,240
And these are the standard. So this is what we would do, right?

135
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:27,229
So this is from the reference we know kind of like the girls at that age, this is the median and this is the standard deviation.

136
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:32,270
So we take that to calculate in which this girl our goal is right.

137
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:44,419
So it was 68, we subtract the 72 and divided by 2% and we get this girl -1.88, which is the loss of two minus two.

138
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,440
So that girl is not very tall. Yes, sure.

139
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,600
But maybe for her is okay or maybe not.

140
00:14:50,690 --> 00:15:02,600
Maybe she was in the 50% out there two months ago and now suddenly she's kind of like dropping because of illness or lack of nutrition anyway.

141
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:11,210
So so the indicators that we use the we use in, in the form of sit scores,

142
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:22,040
we also use those cutoffs to kind of like decide if kind of like someone is kind of like the standard or wasted or or kind of like underweight.

143
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:31,570
And I know that clearly girls like, always divide everything into which is not good, right?

144
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:37,780
Because I mean, maybe the fact that you are -1.99 doesn't mean that you're perfectly fine.

145
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:47,299
Right. The same with BMI, right? I mean, we say that someone decided that about 25 is you are overweight and you are 24.99.

146
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:57,230
You are fine. Well, maybe you should you I mean, the person on every person, but maybe some people should be a little lower to be completely fine.

147
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,680
Right? So always remember that these are continuous variables.

148
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:07,549
So they represent any spectrum, but for making decisions and for sometimes do analysis, we need to categorize them.

149
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:12,020
Right. And those are the kind of like adults that represent a jump in risk.

150
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,459
In no way. Right. But but never forget that kind of like continuity.

151
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,050
Okay. So anyway, so so I want to ask you,

152
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:28,040
I already mentioned the things that are kind of like a couple of things about the references is that

153
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:34,260
there are other population reference that have and and but they do it while widely in the past.

154
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:38,750
Right. So the less if you were paying attention,

155
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:43,729
what is the main difference between these new is not that new because he has more

156
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:48,230
than 20 years but kind of like the newest W.H.O. reference and the old one,

157
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,830
the one that was going to use I think it was from the sixties, probably.

158
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:58,950
What was the main difference? Yes.

159
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:07,110
Gender. You say it's like the French speaking versus model?

160
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,390
Yes, exactly. So they were using babies who were breastfed.

161
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:19,340
They supposedly I mean, the amount of duration that is recommended by that little.

162
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,979
Instead of using butterfly babies. So what happened is that the one that was used before was when there was this

163
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:30,200
boom of kind of like bottle fed and kind of like most babies were born of it.

164
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,389
I mean, they were breastfed for a short duration by so then that doesn't really reflect I mean,

165
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:45,350
that doesn't mean that babies kind of roll well with they're not like bottles because I mean sometimes moms of breast feed their babies.

166
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:52,390
Right. So. But but clearly the the the idea of growth is being breastfed.

167
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,860
Right. Anyway. Okay. So what do you think about having national specific references?

168
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:14,740
And I already told you this once. I think it makes sense in some instances just because of.

169
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:21,280
But populations might need each other, although immigration.

170
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,960
But how about the fact that I told you that all kids grow the same?

171
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,310
That's what they. That ritual form, right? Yeah. I mean, is is.

172
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:37,100
I mean, sometimes I mean, I don't think it's justified anymore.

173
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,310
I mean, I still use I mean, some some people still use them.

174
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:48,200
And then when I mean, there are some people who have spent their whole careers comparing what will happen if you use one reference or the other.

175
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:54,500
And then you can say that, okay, then you're overestimating overweight or you underestimate something or something.

176
00:18:54,650 --> 00:19:02,660
And it's kind of like one of those to me, academic situations that, well, maybe we should all use the same reference broad anyway.

177
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,250
Yeah, in theory, yes.

178
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:12,730
Are you saying that it's mostly not important to have national specific references for child growth because like we do have like this.

179
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,099
Yeah, we have this obviously growth.

180
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:24,110
But but in theory and kind of like you compare this, we see goals and I know that in this country they use they see this growth chance,

181
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:30,440
but in theory, they should be using that every child because that's the most universal that would make things more comparable.

182
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:37,420
Also because the moment that you don't use the same reference, then comparisons are not kind of like fair, right?

183
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:45,200
Because you are using a different reference. So it doesn't really matter in the fact that for clinical purposes, right?

184
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,129
Because I mean, what really matters is that you follow the kid with the same profession.

185
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:55,190
I don't clearly I mean you cannot really be doing is changing because then that won't really be showing how kids growth.

186
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,819
But so for political purposes, it doesn't matter, right?

187
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:06,110
I mean, it's okay. I mean, in this country, you just basically see, that's fine. But but for for research purposes, I mean,

188
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:13,100
it's a pain that you are using different references because then you can really compare different populations that is sitting right,

189
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:20,090
because clearly there are changes because of the reference, not necessarily because of the nutritional status of the population.

190
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:26,149
Right. So so again, this is debatable and can be controversial.

191
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:38,240
So I'm just kind of like throwing that name. I mean, most people probably for research purposes will will try to use the W.H.O., I think.

192
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:48,770
But. But okay, so let's move to the anthropometric context of obesity, because I want to kind of highlight what I mean.

193
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:55,410
I don't need to convince you that obviously this global health problem has been there for many, many years.

194
00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:04,700
I don't need to convince you that kind of lie. Unfortunately, we see it is related increases the risk of all those things and many more.

195
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:13,160
Right. And this is a map showing the mortality attributed to obesity through this offense.

196
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:20,629
And clearly, obesity is associated with it is with cardiovascular disease with all of these and those things,

197
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,500
I mean, eventually will increase your mortality risk.

198
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:30,220
This is a super I mean, this is something that we've known for a while.

199
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:43,700
That's why this is all. And I put it on purpose that kind of like the association between BMI and mortality risk follows like a of relationship.

200
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:51,950
So the idea is that kind of like you will increase, the risk will increase as you get higher in the BMI,

201
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,660
but you will also increase as you go a little lower.

202
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:09,260
Right. And the problem with this curve, I mean, again, this is one of those things that is there are tons of papers in the literature showing that,

203
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:18,080
well, maybe there is no kind of like because you can see that I'm not talking about people who may be malnourished,

204
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:23,900
that that could be also a kind of like a reverse causation because, for example,

205
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:29,780
people who have cancer and we don't know they have a cancer, they may start losing weight.

206
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,959
Right. And then they will, of course. I mean, the risk of mortality will increase.

207
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:40,470
So then we will be making the the reverse association, which is not causality, single causation.

208
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,239
Right. Also, one of the problems here,

209
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:58,810
and you have to be careful is that smokers have usually lower BMI because smoking nicotine and smoking is an appetite suppressant.

210
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,969
Right. So then they will have lower BMI.

211
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,450
But we know that smoking will increase your risk of mortality by so.

212
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:10,630
Then when you look at this and you have to kind of like adjust for smoking or exclude the smokers, right?

213
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,640
Because otherwise you wouldn't see a clear relationship.

214
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:19,579
And then there is another issue when you get to kind of like the I mean,

215
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:28,129
this is only up to 41 and you could continue because in kind of like the after 60 or so,

216
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:37,730
then you start to see like this sort of paradox, which it looks like being kind of like having a higher BMI is protective for the elderly.

217
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:51,070
And that's and again, there are many kind of like the papers showing that actually that may be just a bias and a cohort effect.

218
00:23:51,080 --> 00:24:00,740
Right. But again, in general and again in general, there is that prevention sheet that the height of the BMI, the higher levels.

219
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:08,600
Now, how good is body mass index of roughly reflecting to what we really want to measure because that's the problem.

220
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:19,390
Right. So how do we measure kind of like what we want to measure when we use BMI is adiposity.

221
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,170
Right. And we know that kind of like a deposit is not easy to measure.

222
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,530
Right. I mean, first we know that there are different types of adiposity, right?

223
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:27,739
I mean,

224
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:35,840
we know that it's not the same to have kind of like subcutaneous adipose tissue that then kind of like more central and abdominal adipose tissue.

225
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,110
Right. But on top of that is not easy to measure.

226
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:45,020
Ratio kind of like one goal standard will be to use subjects as confirmation of excess and you can see the object

227
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:54,440
density and then you can measure everything that you just have excess can in a large study of 300,000 people,

228
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:00,500
most likely. Now, I mean, maybe you can do it in that sort of study because it's super sensitive.

229
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:08,180
Right. And also, can you you are conducting a study that you just go to the middle of nowhere.

230
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,800
I don't know. I mean, a really remote place. Can you bring your Dexcom with you?

231
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:18,499
Most likely not. I mean, though, there are kind of like a small things, though, that that could be more manageable.

232
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,750
But still, I mean, it's not very feasible. Right.

233
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:30,890
So in the end, what we end up doing in the field, and particularly in larger scale epidemiological studies is using our anthropometric.

234
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,809
So we just use our weight and our height and then we calculate BMI and maybe

235
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:39,890
we calculate and we also measure the circumference because that's a proxy of.

236
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,850
In lousy. The worst of it ratio said that we are some measure of the stimulus.

237
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:55,489
So in the end, that's what we measure. Now we know that none of those are necessarily perfect indicators of adiposity.

238
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:01,459
Right. And even I mean, first, because they can be measured with a lot of error, like, for example,

239
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:07,760
the waist in particular, if you don't follow the correct protocol, you may not be really measuring the the waste.

240
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,510
Well, the same with the skin falls and so on.

241
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,960
So you have to follow based on their methods and all the protocols.

242
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:22,370
But even when you do that, kind of like, you end up with a variable, like, for example, BMI,

243
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:28,279
even if you follow everything to measure height powerfully and your risk scale is perfectly calibrated,

244
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,420
and then you measure the weight personally and you calculate your body mass index,

245
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,690
which you are really measuring, is the relationship between your weight divided by height.

246
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:42,980
So then you kind of like are adjusting for height.

247
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:47,810
Right. Because I mean, so is but that's not really measuring adiposity, right?

248
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:58,250
And then how will that BMI correlates with your body fat percentage?

249
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:06,200
Right. And then this is this is a study they did a long time ago, but it's a very good study that was showing that the correlation,

250
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:11,900
the conditions have not that bad, but change depending on sex and age.

251
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:18,930
So you can see that actually the correlations for for women are better.

252
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:23,420
I mean, you look at these are not correlations are squares, but it's kind of like more of the same.

253
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:30,020
So you can see that for men that who are below 60, the highest score is point 46,

254
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:36,110
which means that your BMI represents 46% of the variation in in in body fat.

255
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:42,230
And you can see that. Yeah. I mean, there's like a university, but there's still kind of like error, right?

256
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,510
It's not like everyone is in their line, right?

257
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:53,840
If you go to men who are going to lie about 60 years, they are just going to go 2.57, which is much lower.

258
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:59,570
Women are a little higher when 73 goes for older socially.

259
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:08,420
Yes. Does that have to do with the fact that men generally have higher we most likely.

260
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:15,140
Yeah. Yeah, women, as I say. But like women, it's like 20%.

261
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:19,430
Yeah. Women are supposed to do have more fat. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

262
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,950
Yeah. Yeah. That's a biological difference. Yeah.

263
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:34,580
So but then if you look at that, this actually translates into this that that let's think of an example of all.

264
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:42,860
We are looking at men and women differently. But of all the men and women with a BMI of 25 kilograms by middle split.

265
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:52,520
And then let's look at their body fat percentage. And what happened is that within that body, within that BMI, everyone here has a BMI of 25.

266
00:28:52,910 --> 00:29:01,400
But look at the gap. Most people would have this kind of like 25% to 25 or more of of body fat.

267
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:06,410
But there are some people who have even higher five and there are some people who have lower fat.

268
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,370
And they seem the same for women. For women, they see even more viability.

269
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:18,320
So then basically you are think about this graph because it's very kind of like visually the way that this is ever.

270
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,950
Right. So you are misclassifying all kind of like this.

271
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,580
There's I mean, maybe these people are, well, classified, the people who are in their middle, which is the majority.

272
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,190
And that's why you have reasonably good correlations.

273
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:37,370
But those people, those bills are misclassified misclassifying people, because you're kind of like telling them,

274
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:45,859
oh, you should be in the kind of like 25 BMI people, but actually your body fat is much lower.

275
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:50,150
So you're probably perfectly fine, right? Because your body fat is not that high.

276
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:57,410
Or these people, it's even more dangerous because it's kind of like you are telling them, I'm in your 25, that's okay.

277
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:03,680
But actually your body fat is reflecting a much higher risk than your 25 BMI is telling you.

278
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,600
Right. So then you have to be very careful about that and you have to be very kind of

279
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:16,520
like cautious and kind of like think about that when you kind of like your BMI,

280
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:21,229
as everyone and I have this kind of like I always put it, this is very old,

281
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:26,150
but it's very good because this was a letter to the Lancet of this to physicians.

282
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:32,569
And this is great because shows the paradox. They call it the white way paradox because their names were unique.

283
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:40,250
And you would get with we want, right. So so the thing is that you look at these two to a physician.

284
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:47,620
And they received the the VMA, sadly the same 22.3, which is defined by some normal BMI.

285
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:59,920
But when they look at the MAX scans, you see that this guy on the left has a nine 1.5% body fat, like pretty low.

286
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:09,220
But this guy on the right has a 21.2% body fat, which is not extremely high but is way much higher, and then get one.

287
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:15,160
So then this is one of those examples of these distribution. They had the same BMI, but they don't have the same body fat.

288
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:23,110
Right. So so what is what was funny about this article is that what do you think is the difference between these two guys?

289
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,450
Why one has much higher body fat on the other?

290
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:39,659
Not. Yeah, actually.

291
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:46,320
So I mean, there were articles, I mean, I got probably you to resolve this alone and this really funny,

292
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:53,970
which is the difference is that this guy runs marathons and this guy only tries to take the elevator to the hospital.

293
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:02,240
So that's what they used to say. So yeah. So clearly one one, this guy probably has a lot of lean muscle, right?

294
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,910
Because this is an athlete and this guy doesn't have any because they didn't have.

295
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:13,110
That is not doing. I mean, it's not that that is I mean, he has a normal BMI, but clearly it is not doing a lot of exercise.

296
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,479
So yeah, so exercise a limb and limb muscle clearly is going to make a problem.

297
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:25,590
And we know that when particularly for bodybuilders and people like that who has a lot of muscle, I mean,

298
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:31,979
they their BMI are going to be very high because they're heavy, but their body fat is low anyway.

299
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:35,220
Right. So so BMI doesn't work in those situations, right?

300
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:40,200
It doesn't work either for the elderly because they lose a lot of limb mass and

301
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,059
then maybe and one wonder really reflecting that their core right body fat.

302
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:50,400
So BMI has kind of like a lot of problems in that way.

303
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:56,790
So which is okay. It's the same as I told you last week with a year old has problems but as long as you are aware of those,

304
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:01,020
you will be able to kind of like draw conclusions.

305
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:04,650
Well, right. I mean, you just need to know the limitations, right?

306
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:08,670
So so what are the controls that we are using for BMI?

307
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,870
So these are that you look at the history of BMI cutters.

308
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:13,530
They have change.

309
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:21,000
They crazy, you know, I mean, the first kind of like people who were using their weight for high tables were actually the the insurance companies.

310
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:31,680
Right. Because they knew that having kind of like a high weight in respect to your height was associated with a higher risk of mortality.

311
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:37,530
And they wanted to kind of like estimate, I mean, the insurance, the life insurance, right?

312
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:47,370
So so they came up with different tables and they have been kind of like, you know, evolving over the years.

313
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:52,290
And they finally we are right to the the more kind of like the one that we use now,

314
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:57,060
which is kind of like a people type of 25 is the normal range in theory,

315
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:02,340
25 to 29.9 is supposed to be overweight or more than 30 is supposed to be okay.

316
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:10,080
So these are the ones that you're more find me that way but should those a make up of the universal.

317
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:18,090
Well I mean in the last two decades we have realized that actually they don't work that well for all populations.

318
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:27,779
Right. And this is one of those things that those BMI cutoffs were built for European or I mean, populations from European origin.

319
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:35,520
Right. But when we look at Asians, then what happened is actually that at lower BMI,

320
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:41,400
they are really have a higher increase of diabetes and cardiovascular disease and chronic disease in general.

321
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:48,270
So then if we are using their cutoffs, kind of like paying attention to what's going on,

322
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:52,560
then probably we should decrease them for the US population, right?

323
00:34:52,860 --> 00:35:02,600
So this is just one example of how we kind of like we should consider stunting low way for Asian populations at different levels.

324
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:06,629
Right? There are other populations that actually is the other way around.

325
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:13,320
Like for example, Polynesians actually they can because they are going to maybe have a big frame and they are big people.

326
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:18,209
They can I mean, they don't have a higher risk until they reach certain kind of like BMI.

327
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:22,230
So then they can actually be more, right. So that's, that's perfectly fine.

328
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:35,760
But bottom line again is that and this is kind of like the the conclusion that W choice but consultation came up in report is that BMI

329
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:44,040
continues right able to rise so then you cannot really they say that once you reach this kind in your body and before you get you know,

330
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,070
it's a continuum. So then I need to continue that overlap.

331
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:55,280
So then kind of like you have to think about that your population is in this range, maybe low to moderate risk of disease.

332
00:35:55,620 --> 00:36:01,469
In most of these kind of event, you go into the moderate to the high risk and then it goes to these.

333
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,110
Then thirdly, you are going into the high to very high risk.

334
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:10,170
So things are more flexible and more kind of like overlapping and then you have to interpret things in that way.

335
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:14,819
Okay. Okay. So what about kids?

336
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:20,700
Because I mean, I've been talking about BMI for a lot. Well, for kids, you can also calculate BMI.

337
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,209
You can use actually the W.H.O. standards.

338
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:36,960
They have a BMI for that. Or you can use the they IATA and cut off points that what they did actually is that they say, okay, if we take the 25.

339
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:48,320
And 30 got us for adults in in in kind of like groups around people who are more or less not gifts anymore but adults like 1820.

340
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:53,790
And they we try to kind of like extrapolate backwards, right?

341
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,750
So that's what they do. So then they created this kind of life.

342
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:02,810
Course work is the same as we have cause for, for, for the other indicators that we mentioned at the beginning.

343
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,880
Right. So you can, you can use again one, one is standard of the other.

344
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:16,010
And that's again, you just want to really you get different results, but it doesn't matter as long as you know the limitations of a follow up.

345
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:28,100
Okay. So I don't know if I'm going to continue because it's kind of like a little early.

346
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:38,149
So then that way. That way I'll give you the break that so that was for kind of like the basics

347
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:42,890
of anthropometric indicators that probably you were familiar with most of it.

348
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:50,600
But now what we are really going to talk about is these that are usually at the population level,

349
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,820
usually comes from complex this size because usually this comes from national service, right?

350
00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:03,379
So when you go to that national service, you want them to be representative for your population, right?

351
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:10,490
Because you want to know what's going on in the US or what's going on in Michigan or what's going on in Tanzania, what's going on in China.

352
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:24,790
Right. So so when you do that, clearly you cannot just go and say, okay, a half and a half million of people are in the U.S. like 360.

353
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:35,870
I love my ignorance, but now a lot, right? Unless I mean, I'm going to recruit a sample of 3000 people out of the many millions that I have here.

354
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:43,069
And I'm going just to take kind of like the census and then flip a coin on a random number and then I will take the 3000.

355
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:48,320
Right. So what happened to you do that? That means that you're going to do your survey going of right.

356
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:55,670
I mean, across the whole country, going to the small village in the middle of nowhere and going to the cities and everywhere.

357
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:58,160
And that wouldn't be feasible, right?

358
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:05,060
I mean, you going to really conduct national surveys that way because you're going to do sample random sampling is not feasible.

359
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:11,389
Right. So what do you do? I mean, you use what we call complex sampling design.

360
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:20,780
I mean, we use a methodology to make sure that we conduct our survey in an visible and easy way,

361
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:27,440
but at the same time still being representative of the of the study population.

362
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,560
We want the study of the nation or the region or whatever.

363
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:37,490
Right? So so before going into that, I forgot that I have to tell you this.

364
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:45,350
This probably should be there is this and you can share that later in the in the lab when you have some time,

365
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:52,030
there is this WTO anthro survey analyzer where you can kind of like calculate your site.

366
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:55,610
I mean, you have weight and height for your kids in a survey.

367
00:39:55,610 --> 00:40:00,670
You can go there and then it will calculate the this is course based on the standards of the future.

368
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,690
So that's that's pretty kind of useful.

369
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:11,070
I'm not sure if I go here if you just kind of like I'm not going to show you because you wouldn't need to kind of like and

370
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:21,979
that I'm you have you can do it online you can there are also macros for size for our for data to calculate those scores.

371
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:27,620
So there are plenty of of options to kind of like calculate your cost today in the lab.

372
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:31,250
You are going to be given this it's called so you don't have to have to calculate them.

373
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:34,700
But I'm giving you this piece of information because in the future,

374
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:43,459
maybe you just get some data with weight and height and age and then you are asked to analyze it.

375
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:52,010
Then the first thing you have to do is to get those scores using one reference, and I encourage you to use the WTO reference.

376
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,780
Okay. Okay. Anyway, so let's go back to how to analyze everything.

377
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:03,260
Okay. So the idea is that and this is kind of like important because so far,

378
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:11,650
probably all the statistical analysis that you have been doing, you've been working with Independent there, right?

379
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:15,319
So you have kind of like reservation service or whatever.

380
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:19,010
You already reducing the analysis. They were all independent of each other.

381
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:24,169
Right. And we were taking that for granted based on the nature of the study.

382
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:30,860
We say like, for example, a case control study of myocardial infarction conducted in Costa Rica a long time ago,

383
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:36,190
that you will see some data or data, some examples that people are completely independent.

384
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:42,469
Of cases of myocardial infarction that were just kind of like coming to the hospital in severe cases and in contrast,

385
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:46,520
were match population based controls matched by age sex and vessels.

386
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:50,210
So one of completely independent of the other.

387
00:41:51,080 --> 00:42:01,090
Now if you start working with survey data, you are going to work with correlated data and what is correlated accurately.

388
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:09,500
There are all examples done so that for example, you can have longitudinal data with repeated measures.

389
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:18,380
Right? So if I take this class and I follow you for one year and every one for one semester because that's what I would be with you.

390
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:25,280
And then every semester, every week, I measure your blood pressure, for example.

391
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:32,230
I mean, clearly the blood pressure that I measure this week will be correlated with the blood pressure that I measure next week.

392
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,350
Right. I mean, your blood pressure is not completely random from one week to the other.

393
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:40,610
I mean, it follows like I'm more or less supposed to be in homeostasis.

394
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:45,170
If I say something will be high, something will be low, but clearly is going to be correlated.

395
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:51,050
Right? So that's for you. That's always correlated with the measured coming from the same individual.

396
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,630
Right. Another type of correlated event as well.

397
00:42:54,650 --> 00:43:00,800
And you have family data. I mean, family data is correlated because families share many things.

398
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:04,280
I mean, they share usually genetic background.

399
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:08,569
Right. But also kind of like a lot of environmental exposures.

400
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:11,930
Right. Because they usually tend to eat the same or they used to I mean,

401
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:17,530
they live in the same place and they aren't going to lie exposed to the same environmental contaminants or things like that.

402
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:23,380
Right. So you can see that that's correlated. So it's not kind of like the people are not completely independent of each other.

403
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:30,890
They have some correlated right. Or the one that I always put the sample because I like that one.

404
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:36,680
Is that the situation. So a unit belonging to the same entity, which is my, my example of the,

405
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:42,599
of the mouse the many, many years ago when I was was working with with a physician,

406
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:53,929
he was a not orthopedic surgeon who was doing a study on something with the legs of the I don't remember.

407
00:43:53,930 --> 00:44:01,430
But he was breaking the legs of the poor mice. But anyway, so so then I was going to like trying to the hemo you.

408
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:06,860
The problem is that you have a very small sample size because you only have, I don't know, ten mice say.

409
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,830
And he told me, no, I have 40 because I have four legs of which I was going to let alone.

410
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:21,379
Yeah. But I mean, it's true that you have a high sample size, but those four legs are probably correlated because they belong to the same entity.

411
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,850
So they are not going to give you the same information.

412
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:30,760
Then two legs independent. Right. It still I mean, it's true that you have a higher sample size.

413
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:37,489
You can use the four legs. I mean, but because they are a little redundant, they are giving you less information.

414
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:43,280
And that is the issue with correlated data is giving you less information because it's a little redundant.

415
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,970
It doesn't have to be powerfully correlated.

416
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:52,370
Of course when we talk about correlated we mean that that is a little redundant and sometimes it will be more redundant.

417
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:59,480
But but I still is giving you information, but not as much as if all the observations are completely independent.

418
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:11,120
Okay. Okay. So all those examples have this into account and these that you have to take into account that correlation between the summation.

419
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,390
Right. And the traditional methods that you have learned so far.

420
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:17,660
Everything you have learned so far doesn't work. Sorry.

421
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:26,090
Because you have to. I mean, you'll have you can use the same methods, but you have to tweak them a little bit.

422
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:29,860
Okay. So the worry and that what I'm going to teach you today, right.

423
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:36,980
So. So the traditional methods will still calculate the point estimation by point estimates.

424
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:42,140
I mean the bad estimate your regression model is what the odds ratios they will calculate them correctly.

425
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:47,090
That will be okay so that that's not bad but the standard errors are going to

426
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:52,549
be wrong always because it doesn't take that uncertainty of the correlation,

427
00:45:52,550 --> 00:46:07,550
that kind of low redundancy, you know, way. Okay. So taking that into consideration, I mean, let's start with surviving because that's the I mean,

428
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:15,379
this everything I told you so far is good for any type of correlated area longitudinal data for military or whatever.

429
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:22,790
But now we are going to look at survey and now we are going to try to understand what is that complex design and how that affect.

430
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:25,610
Those are standard errors and and the point estimates.

431
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:35,299
Okay, so, so when, when our sampling design is not simple random sampling, which is the thing that we are used to, right?

432
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:44,620
I mean, people run this. Glenn, if I take all of you and just take five people randomly, then I don't have to do anything.

433
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:49,220
They're going to still analyze the data from the right people using the traditional methods that you know.

434
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:57,610
Right. Because that that is that random sample and is perfectly representative of all of you.

435
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,030
Right.

436
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:11,740
But but when you do this complex design in surveys and remember that surveys need to be feasible, then you do sometimes you do two types of things.

437
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:17,200
Not not always. Sometimes you do only one of them. But one thing is that you make a stratify.

438
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:24,429
And then where you live with this stratification is that you divide the population in groups that are different from each other,

439
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:27,490
such as sex or age or something like that. Right?

440
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:40,480
And then within this thread that you will randomly sample from each group, that's an example of an estate if I sample and randomly sample.

441
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,010
And the other thing that you can do is clustering.

442
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:49,300
So lessening what is going to do is to divide the population in comparable groups.

443
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,710
Right, such as thousands, neighborhoods, schools.

444
00:47:54,040 --> 00:48:02,200
So kind of like people who live in kind of like neighborhoods tend to be more similar in one neighborhood than in other neighborhoods.

445
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:07,990
So kind of like they are more similar. And then what will you do is you actually cluster.

446
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:15,040
Sorry, sorry. You select clusters, right? You don't kind of like so that people within the cluster you select clusters.

447
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:20,140
So so you have like let's say five clusters.

448
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:26,650
I'm going to randomly sample only two. And this is one of the main things that you do in survey design.

449
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:38,829
I mean, for example, you take in this country and Haines is is a cluster kind of stealthy cluster sample you take first kind of like

450
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:47,409
the the the I think I remember they all they all the stages from the top of my head that kind of like the

451
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:53,770
the I think probably start with the states and kind of like you go up to the kind of like neighborhood level

452
00:48:53,770 --> 00:49:01,180
or the census level and then you choose kind of like in each in each state you just kind of like a few,

453
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:05,560
a few clusters and then within those clusters just shows a few clusters and so on.

454
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:09,160
Right? And this is what we had menacingly for.

455
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:17,080
But then know I had to remember because it was in this, in this like location that actually this one is just sample counties, right?

456
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:21,190
So you take from all the countries in the country to take a few.

457
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:30,640
And then when you go to those countries in the research to you sampling segments and in those ones you go to step three,

458
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:37,780
you actually sample and house ones. And then finally in the in the search for your sample individuals within each household.

459
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:46,380
Right. So you have you can see that you have actually for a stage which you have been doing clustering, right?

460
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:52,120
So then you have clusters of countries and your sample countries that have some simple segments,

461
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:56,700
clusters of households, and you solve the household and finally you go to the individual level, right?

462
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:07,959
So when you have this type of multi-stage probability sampling mission and this is

463
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:11,680
not a convenience sample that you just think for whoever is convenient for you.

464
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:17,590
I mean, this is the liberal elite, the sample. I mean, you can calculate the probability of selection of everyone, right?

465
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:24,760
The issue is that most likely the probability selection won't be the same for everyone.

466
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,000
And that's the main difference with simple random sampling, right?

467
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:38,590
When I choose, kind of like there are 15 people in this class and I decided to kind of like just throw random numbers to select five.

468
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:43,630
All of you have the same probability of being selected will be five over 15.

469
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:53,710
Right. But if I decide that, no, I'm going to take this first cluster of people, the ones that are seated on the first row.

470
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,400
And then the second question is going to be the other votes.

471
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:03,940
And then in this cluster, I'm going to select two people and then in that cluster able to connect two people.

472
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:08,740
So what happened? Everyone has a single obviously been selected.

473
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:15,730
No, I mean, here you have a person from how many people have before you and know by that I don't know how many of you left,

474
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:19,600
but you would need to also be in theory, right? So you have a much lower probability.

475
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:25,630
So do you have this is what we'll see now. This is what we covered with the sampling weights.

476
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:36,190
Right. So so there are two things I don't want to kind of like advance much, but there are a few questions that you always have to.

477
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:41,350
Ask when you have this type of complex, multistage probability sampling this time.

478
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:46,670
The first thing is, is the sample selected in a single stage or multiple stages?

479
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,980
Because then you only have a few clusters and you select one cluster and that's it.

480
00:51:50,980 --> 00:52:00,550
But sometimes you have multiple stages, like a case that has four stages, but then is blasting off of lemon juice of one of my final stages.

481
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:04,479
Is this ratification employed of the one or more simplistic issue,

482
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:11,910
you need to know what things are used in every stage if some is stratification or glossary.

483
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:20,920
Right. And finally, you have to ask, are elements selected with equal probabilities and most of the times they want,

484
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:28,150
there are ways of doing complex design in which still everyone will have the same probability of selecting.

485
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:35,500
So there are statistical ways of doing that. But most of the times in most of the surveys that you will see, that's not the case.

486
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:38,560
Most people will have different probabilities of selection. Okay.

487
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:49,940
So why is it important to know the probability selection? I mean.

488
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:54,550
I mean, who cares if they have 100% probability of be selecting?

489
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:59,570
Yes, 2%. Why is that important?

490
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:05,520
Yeah. Like selection bias. Exactly.

491
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:12,120
Because I mean, then your sample is not representative for your the large population that came from.

492
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:19,260
Because imagine that. I don't know. Imagine that in this class either.

493
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:26,500
In this class, everyone is relatively young. But imagine that you have two classmates here, well over 50.

494
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:29,640
I don't know. I'm the rest of them. Right.

495
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:33,929
So then if might choose them, the two of them over 50.

496
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:41,909
I'm kind of like, you know, overestimating the percentage of them in my sample who have two people over 50 and the rest and have maybe two other.

497
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:47,430
Yeah. So they will be like, oh, 50% are over 50 and that's, that's not what the population is.

498
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:51,180
I mean, you don't really have to go over 50, right?

499
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:54,729
They're not 50%. Right. So 50%. Sorry. So.

500
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:58,950
So, yeah. So kind of like you had to be very careful because you have selection bias.

501
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:04,890
So then but they some way it's a selection bias that is not really selection bias and this is that.

502
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:11,550
And you can, you can correct that applying the correct probability of selection.

503
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:15,750
Okay. So then it's not like the sample would still be representative.

504
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:20,550
You apply the correct way of analyzing and this is the sampling rate.

505
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:27,630
So the sampling weights are usually the reciprocal of the selection probabilities.

506
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:33,930
So the idea that if I have one submission that is selected with a probability of one over ten, the way it is going to be.

507
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,360
So it's kind of like the reciprocal right?

508
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:44,579
And that's because kind of like the lower your probability of being selected, the higher you'll be waiting in the sample.

509
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:48,180
So then your characteristics are represented appropriately.

510
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:52,650
Right. And the higher your probability of being selected, the lower your weight should be.

511
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:58,740
So then your your categories are not overrepresented. Right now, this is kind of like the useful thing.

512
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:07,139
But in practice, actually, most of the studies and sampling, which also include other things like no response to death,

513
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:11,790
means poor sampling stratification or regression adjustments using supplemental information.

514
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:19,169
So sometimes the statisticians work with all the things to make this actually sample more representative because of those things.

515
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:25,020
So the sampling was will incorporate something else than the and then the then the priority.

516
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:34,230
Okay. So now it's time for a break because nice. So I mean, we're almost half way through and then we're going to switch to the to the example.

517
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:38,400
So let's take 5 minutes break and then we'll be back.

518
00:55:40,070 --> 00:56:35,760
I want to. Just.

519
00:57:15,880 --> 00:58:06,140
This. No, you don't have to.

520
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:17,880
You. Which is.

521
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,060
So what you're saying.

522
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:36,970
With a blowtorch all the way down into.

523
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:51,590
Oh, I grew up all over my dad's.

524
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:59,870
You know, you have such.

525
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:14,120
Here's what she and I.

526
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:20,290
Who? To.

527
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:33,470
You look down on your watch.

528
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:52,350
Oh, yeah. You official say former central.

529
00:59:55,850 --> 01:00:01,290
Oh, oh, oh. What time do you so much?

530
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,490
Always have your head out on the project.

531
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:11,450
What? Philosophers are working hard to put a slow down for students?

532
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:35,850
What's going to happen when you try to go to sleep in training, you know?

533
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:44,910
Situation Room, hotel room.

534
01:00:55,240 --> 01:01:04,810
You think you're old enough to.

535
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:41,080
When you go home, I will try to tell you how sorry I am.

536
01:01:44,550 --> 01:02:01,000
I thought that he was really, really.

537
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:18,629
Okay. Let's go back to business. So now what we are going to do is to learn how to analyze the data.

538
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:24,800
And we're going to use two examples, both coming from the same country, but in different time points.

539
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:33,680
So the one that I'm showing in this life is the one that actually is close to my heart, because these are data that I collected myself long time ago.

540
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:40,140
And the other one, a colleague collected years later.

541
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:43,340
So then that's the one that you're going to use for the for the lab.

542
01:02:44,570 --> 01:02:48,950
But it is the same country. So for the example on this list,

543
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:53,929
we are going to look at the risk of our weight and we are going to consider that one

544
01:02:53,930 --> 01:03:00,020
standard deviation of the weight to high score among children less than five years old.

545
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:09,049
And we're going to just look at predictors of risk of overweight, which will be sociodemographic and health variables that we collected.

546
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:13,340
And this is the design was a multistage cluster sampling.

547
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:21,979
So there was only clustering in this sample. Don't get confused because the one that you will use in the lab uses both is stratification.

548
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:29,500
And lastly, but I think I put that really emphasize that to make sure that they do distinguish those.

549
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:33,049
So. So let me give you some background over the country.

550
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:41,330
I always ask if anyone knows the country you need, you know, because I get very and if you're good in geography,

551
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:44,540
I'm terrible angiography, so then I'm not expecting you to know it.

552
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:57,150
But is that tiny country here? And I think this is coming to an end.

553
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:05,910
This is. No, it's okay.

554
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:09,730
I mean, there's always someone. Yeah, I know.

555
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:14,530
It was unexpected. You know, they gone to such a tiny country. So this is Equatorial Guinea.

556
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:22,419
So? So this is a Danish state, and it has kind of like five inhabited islands and I mean, named portion of jungle,

557
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:28,410
basically, and it's one of the smallest in Africa is growing out of the population's higher.

558
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:33,100
That was a big deal like a few years ago. So but still, I mean, you can see it's a small country.

559
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:39,250
So. So it was one of those colonies in Africa.

560
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:45,700
And this was the only one that it's been has so and that that was the connection why I

561
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:51,129
ended up doing kind of like some work there because as most countries are having colonies,

562
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:56,890
they keep like a love hate relationship with the colonizer.

563
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:03,760
I don't know. It's sometimes well, but anyway, in 1979, nine years after independence from Spain.

564
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:12,969
So that was kind of like in 1970 president they would all be in India and mass power and and was they I lost track of

565
01:05:12,970 --> 01:05:19,690
the politics now I'm not sure if you still there but for many many years we're still kind of like a dictatorship.

566
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:24,340
So this is a I'm giving you some political background because, I mean,

567
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:29,049
you would expect that a small country with that many resources we had to achieve,

568
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:34,840
I mean, theory is a poor country that kind of like the U.S. sped the health of their kids being.

569
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:40,690
Right. Right. But in 1986, actually, they found.

570
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:49,090
All right. So so you would expect that a country that suddenly becomes rich.

571
01:05:49,360 --> 01:06:02,139
Right. Because of the revenue and you would expect that that then see San reflection in the in their half of the population particularly the kids.

572
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:08,170
Right and that was kind of like that was in 1996 1987.

573
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:18,400
That's me. I had a right to the country with that desk of conducted a national survey.

574
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:27,730
And that was one of the reasons I say that this is kind of like really in my heart because this was my first kind of job as an epidemiologist.

575
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:38,170
Right. So so it was a long time ago. Right. I was very young and and I had a I mean, I learned a lot and I, I had great colleagues.

576
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:46,410
I learned a lot from everyone. And and it was it was a great experience for me, kind of like enriching.

577
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:52,989
It was a little sad looking at the results as I will show you but by the hospitals was was very nice so

578
01:06:52,990 --> 01:07:01,360
then then I'm showing you now they Instagram where they have Instagram them by then there's my Instagram.

579
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:11,100
So we travel by car and by boat. I mean, there was a whole team of mostly local people because really you want to do anything, you know,

580
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:15,310
in a country you had to work with, with the local people or you won't be able to do anything.

581
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:30,100
We measure the children, right? We interview the care providers at home and we didn't see any impact of all revenue in the country on infrastructure.

582
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:36,879
So clearly they and the country was very poor or in the child skills.

583
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:42,100
I mean, actually, when we analyzed the the anthropometric data from the children,

584
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:48,100
we saw that actually a huge percentage of them what is standing clearly showing chronic

585
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:54,150
malnutrition because of not proper nutrition and most likely produce a lot of illness.

586
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:58,510
Right. So you say, okay, yeah.

587
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:02,379
But you are right in 1987 and they they found oil in 1986.

588
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:06,280
Only one year may not be enough to see kind of changes.

589
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:14,709
Which is true. Is true. Right. But 70 years later, which is probably more than enough.

590
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:22,300
Another colleague arrived to the country in 2004, took on that more was this same type of survey.

591
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:27,010
I mean, their design is a little different, but it's kind of like also representative, national representative.

592
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:32,259
And what you can see here is that these are kind of like this is just a stunted.

593
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:36,880
I mean, we have all the integrated budget let's look at for the sun and this is of the

594
01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:44,200
1987 to 2004 and we have total and then it's below two years and three years.

595
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:47,980
And we also have this certification by rural and urban in case things are different.

596
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:56,350
But if you look at kind of like overall actually, I mean, there are no huge changes, right?

597
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:02,380
So it's kind of like you can see that the percentages of free standing were really high and then they kind of.

598
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:08,299
I mean, they decrease a little bit in some aspects, but not not terribly.

599
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:11,410
Right. So that was obviously going to lie disappointing.

600
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:15,260
Hopefully, almost 20 years later, things have changed.

601
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:19,370
But I don't know. I lost track of what happened in that country.

602
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:24,590
But anyway, so so let's go back to the example and to the data.

603
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:30,890
So so the sample I will show you is based on that 1987 survey.

604
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:35,610
And then we're going to look at our outcome is going to be overweight using this scores there more

605
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:42,740
more that we have dichotomous divide and all of this is us over one standard deviation or below.

606
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:49,100
And then we will look at different sociodemographic and have five.

607
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:56,929
So the first thing that has to tell us how we selected that sample.

608
01:09:56,930 --> 01:10:05,509
Right. In terms of I mean, I told you how it has that aspect enhanced is a huge kind of like a study, a national study conducted here in the US.

609
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:09,230
Right. And this was like a tiny country and we didn't have much money there.

610
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:19,050
Right. So. So what we need is that we kind of like follow WTO advice to do these complex samples.

611
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:25,610
It uses the 30 by 30 rule of thumb that comes from the statisticians.

612
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:30,710
That is like the magic number to have enough people to be a representative, apparently.

613
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:42,440
So then we were going to kind of like select 30 villages and or neighborhoods and 30 households within each village and neighborhood.

614
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:50,420
Right? And then within every household we will want to just recruit all children below five years.

615
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:57,420
Right. So. So let me see.

616
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:04,020
Yeah. So one thing that I can tell you is that. How do you do that?

617
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:12,269
Yeah. I mean, when you are here in the U.S. and then you have a whole sense of powerfully, you know, I don't know.

618
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:15,290
What is the coverage of this census like?

619
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:18,820
Close to 100%. Pretty high, right?

620
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:27,360
So that's great here. The last census that we had was from 1979.

621
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:32,099
And it was really also it was like 27 years old and it was probably not complete.

622
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:39,380
So we couldn't really use that. So what we need is that let's do our own census in that way.

623
01:11:39,470 --> 01:11:43,650
Right. So I mean, we knew all the villages that at least.

624
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:48,089
So then let's randomly pick the villages.

625
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:56,490
And then as you go to the villages, you know, first trip and then less kind of like select randomly 30 houses in its village.

626
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:05,040
Right. And, and then we arrive to the villages.

627
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:09,209
And then one of the things that they would recommend, I mean,

628
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:17,670
they give you kind of like paints to do seen this type of things in places where you don't have like a list of houses and things like that.

629
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:23,810
So they tell you, go to the center of the village and then kind of like flip a coin and then go to the right and so on, right.

630
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:29,870
So that gives you kind of like some pseudo random procedures to select the the households, right?

631
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:38,340
And say, okay, we will do that, no problem. So the first village we arrive, they're saying, let's go to the center of the village.

632
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:43,829
And then they told me, well, the religious scholar in the kind of like I mean,

633
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:51,180
we were in the middle of the jungle and then there were like one house here and maybe another house over there and then another house.

634
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:54,659
I mean, it was not really a village. I mean, there were some of them like that.

635
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,910
But the first one that we have was not like that.

636
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:04,400
IT okay, so how do I go to the, to the center of the village if there's not really kind of like a clear cluster of village, right?

637
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:09,240
So then in those situations, you need to be kind of like creative.

638
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:13,889
So then where they said, okay, let's do a census of the, of the household of the village.

639
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:23,370
So we had to ask for permission. So anyway, so you had to kind of like go to, to the, to the elders and then ask for permission to do the, the study.

640
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:26,490
So then while we were asking for permission, we were telling them,

641
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:30,510
can you give us kind of like those were very small villages, so there were only a few houses.

642
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:33,780
So then they gave us like a whole list of all the houses,

643
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:41,370
and then we chose randomly from those so that that wasn't our way of kind of like overcoming the obstacle.

644
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:48,000
Anyway, in the end, we, I look like those and all the woman kind of like, you know,

645
01:13:48,780 --> 01:14:00,210
my they said we're doing things like like the liberals and but but anyway so we collected the data and then let's look at the data, how it looks like.

646
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:04,829
Right. So if you these are kind of like the first then of the ratios and then you see

647
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:12,809
that you have one variable called cluster and this is this is the first cluster.

648
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:16,230
So this will be the cluster representing the villages.

649
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:21,470
And this is called in, in, in this survey sampling kind of like well,

650
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:25,980
this is called the primary sampling unit because it's the first the first thing that you sample,

651
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:34,889
the first thing the first kind of like cluster that you sample. Remember in this in this study, there are three stages.

652
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:43,770
One where you sample villages, the second where you sample households, and the third one where you sample all kids below five years old.

653
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:48,929
So the first stage is the primary sampling unit, right? So the clusters are the primary something unit.

654
01:14:48,930 --> 01:14:53,010
And this is the most important one because this is the only one that says, well, us actually.

655
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:57,540
And then we have something called weights, which is the sampling weights.

656
01:14:57,540 --> 01:15:00,960
It's not this is not this another way. So that gives us a big sampling rate.

657
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:06,600
And then we have our kind of like you can see our this is our variable.

658
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:08,900
This is called right.

659
01:15:08,970 --> 01:15:17,190
The weight for heights is called and this is the binary variable that we created that will be zero that kids are below one standard deviation.

660
01:15:17,190 --> 01:15:20,220
I would be one of them is above one is standard deviation.

661
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:24,209
Okay. And these are potential predictors that we are going to use.

662
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:29,190
This is the age of the kids sex. If they were body fat, they were sick.

663
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:35,069
The last week they teacher the mother age of the head of the household, the sex of the head of the household.

664
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:41,309
And and if they had electricity at the house, there were many more variables,

665
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:46,350
of course, but I'm just picking those few so that you you can work with us.

666
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:54,780
Okay. So SAS has a family of survey procedures, so they are all start like sorry, something.

667
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:59,200
So they have block servicer led blocks that reflect pressure.

668
01:15:59,210 --> 01:16:02,820
That means proposed direct pressure. The logistical blocks are pitch brick.

669
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:06,600
So we are not going to look at service alert because that's too hard.

670
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:11,959
You will be saying that's too hard. You selected the sample that's already then we are not going to look at proposal

671
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:16,190
will be accurate because that's to the cops mothers that we are going to go here.

672
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:20,990
Right. So we are going to focus on the free main logistic.

673
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:30,640
And the thing is that these four blocks are very similar to the normal corresponding blocks to the normal block freak.

674
01:16:30,650 --> 01:16:34,610
That on my block means the normal progression and then on my proper logistic.

675
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:40,610
So you're familiar with those blocks then you should be fine in terms of interpreting the output and things like that.

676
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:42,660
They are not exactly the same.

677
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:48,800
They have some peculiarities and the output has some peculiarities and we are going over those precisely because of that.

678
01:16:48,830 --> 01:16:52,160
But in general, you are more or less doing this.

679
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:59,380
Okay. So the first question that we are going to do is we are going to use proxy traffic

680
01:16:59,390 --> 01:17:04,790
and we are going to kind of like ask what is the prevalence of our weighting,

681
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:07,980
the population ratio, this is our outcome. So we need to know the prevalence.

682
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:16,969
Remember, this is a service application I study, so we ask about the prevalence and then we are going to ask is being born of being associated,

683
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:22,190
is modified associate is being modified associated with overweight?

684
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:28,220
Right. So those are that will be able value analysis to look at body fat and overweight.

685
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:40,340
Right. So if we had simple random sampling, you would use appropriate right on the other way variable and that will be it.

686
01:17:40,570 --> 01:17:44,720
Right. But with traffic, we will have two problems.

687
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:53,480
One is that if you are not applying the sampling weight, then you will be getting the incorrect prevalence.

688
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:58,040
Because remember that not every kid has the same probability of being selected.

689
01:17:58,250 --> 01:18:03,070
So some kids are overrepresented and some kids are underrepresented.

690
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:07,590
So then with the sampling weights, do even them all of that, right?

691
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:16,420
So then you have to apply the sampling weights. That shouldn't be a huge problem with traffic because actually all the blocks in SAS usually, I mean,

692
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:25,340
you can either way the statements or you could do that, but still you wouldn't be able to overcome the problem of the clustering.

693
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:30,650
So you have clustering because you have two stages. Remember the villages and the households.

694
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:39,350
So your data is a little redundant. It's not kind of like the the kids coming from the same neighborhood or coming from the same high school.

695
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:41,960
They are more similar, right? So then this correlation.

696
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:49,720
So then your standard errors be from profit will be incorrect, will be actually to narrow that.

697
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:54,770
So then when you calculate your 95% confidence interval, it will be wrong.

698
01:18:55,610 --> 01:19:00,009
So that's why we use Brooks. Terrific. So then we have Brooks.

699
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:06,829
So we think that looks very similar to preprint in the sense that this path is the same with your data here.

700
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:10,730
And this path is a change of use of table 16, right of replacement.

701
01:19:11,090 --> 01:19:18,070
Now you have two new things, right? You had the two new things that you are including because of the complex design.

702
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:22,940
You have to tell us about the cluster. What is the cluster?

703
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:32,690
And then you had to tell us about the way I know that. I think I chose a bad name for the variables because you may be confused.

704
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:36,530
These are the violent pieces of the statement,

705
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:46,830
and I just call the violence in much the same name by the school we cluster very so with something which basically whatever name can be something.

706
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:50,030
So don't get confused because I'm calling it the same. Right.

707
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:58,670
So your cluster variable is your first cluster, the my sampling unit and your weights are the sampling with.

708
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:03,229
Right. So then now what you can do is go to SAS.

709
01:20:03,230 --> 01:20:08,390
And now I, I was told today that all the SAS licenses have been renewed.

710
01:20:08,450 --> 01:20:12,530
So then and, and try to run this by your staff.

711
01:20:13,070 --> 01:20:16,160
So remember here there are two databases in canvas.

712
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:21,410
One is for the lab and the other one is for this part of the lesson.

713
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:26,090
So this one is the overweight 97. The other one is one.

714
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:34,220
So. So four. Okay, so so let's let's let's try to see if you can you can run that back.

715
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:41,450
I'm giving you a couple of minutes to open source and.

716
01:24:09,150 --> 01:24:18,140
Okay. Were you able to run it? Okay. So you should have I mean, as you saw, size will give you a lot of information.

717
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:26,790
And in this situation, I mean, this is the most important thing on movies, only giving you this information.

718
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,940
But you can see that the subway flag is going to your son.

719
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:33,900
Summary of the data. What it is telling you that you have 30 clusters.

720
01:24:34,230 --> 01:24:39,670
Right. Because that's your primary sampling unit. I mean, within the 30, you have another 30, right.

721
01:24:39,670 --> 01:24:42,840
But kind of like it's only it's only counting the first one.

722
01:24:43,530 --> 01:24:49,470
Then you have 400 observations and then the some of which you can ignore it because it's not giving you information.

723
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:57,060
Now, this is the table that is similar to your parabolic table, but it has a few things, right?

724
01:24:57,630 --> 01:25:01,950
The first thing is that, I mean, you have your variable that is overweight zero one, right?

725
01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:11,630
And then this is the row frequency. So you have 311 gates who are not overweight and 89 kids who are overweight out of their 400.

726
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:16,350
Right. And then SAS will calculate a weighted frequency.

727
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:21,030
Right. Because remember, you have to include the sampling weights to get the correct prevalence.

728
01:25:21,870 --> 01:25:29,160
So then with that corrected frequency, that way, the frequency is going to calculate that percentage.

729
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:37,690
So now you have that your prevalence is this 20.5, 20.6% as the weighted pronouns.

730
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:42,570
So you have 20.6% of overweight in this case, right?

731
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:52,860
Note that if you don't kind of like weigh the sample, your prevalence will be 89 over 400 will be 22.3.

732
01:25:53,370 --> 01:26:00,029
So it's not that really different in this situation, which is telling you that maybe the sampling ways are not that important.

733
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:05,010
So they don't know that different, but clearly is different. So this is wrong and this is correct.

734
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:15,900
Okay. You also had some standard error, so then you could calculate confidence interval for that weighted prevalence.

735
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:26,540
Okay. What if you have also straight up because your lab is going to have a stranger, so then you will have to.

736
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:37,400
I know that kind of like a statement with a set out with your the variable or variables that that I for your strength I am putting up here hypothetic.

737
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:44,990
I say that because this particular study doesn't have Strider but for the lab, for the evaluation, for this assignment, the homework you will have.

738
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:48,080
So you will have to add that the statements of don't forget,

739
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:59,210
I'm telling you now so then you don't forget that in their in the homework you have to use the three statements, the strata that listed on the weight.

740
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:03,290
Okay. There is one thing that you need to know,

741
01:27:03,290 --> 01:27:11,510
but kind of like the reason why you only use the first cluster and not the others is because size by default

742
01:27:11,570 --> 01:27:17,149
uses this Taylor series that only they can talk on the primary sampling unit and no further clusters.

743
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:23,510
But that way you only need to put the villages cluster and you will need to put the household cluster.

744
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:32,209
Okay, so now let's moving to kind of like yesterday what we just learned,

745
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:35,900
I know this is going to be a little kind of like crazy to move from one to the other.

746
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:42,170
But now let's look at the question, one of the homework, right, of the thing.

747
01:27:42,650 --> 01:27:51,080
So now the lab uses another that I said this is easy to search for because this was this survey another colleague conducted in 2004.

748
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:56,390
And this is a little different. I mean, to start with, I mean, it only contains 300 children.

749
01:27:56,420 --> 01:28:01,280
I mean, it's still all the children are less than five years. Also, they are comparable in a way.

750
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:06,799
And this is, again, a national survey conducted in the same country. But seven years later.

751
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:13,400
Right. And the goal of your lab is not looking at all ways, but you're going to look at standing.

752
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:19,720
So now you have to look at another indicator and kind of like create another viable.

753
01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:23,270
You will you will actually create the values for the three indicators anyway.

754
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:29,420
But but the main goal is to look at to see if child stunting is associated with maternal education,

755
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:33,109
which is something that maybe you go to spec, right?

756
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:38,629
Because I mean, in theory, maternal education is associated with the health of the kids.

757
01:28:38,630 --> 01:28:44,780
Right? So now this is not the same that I said that we have used so far.

758
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:48,620
So that that I said that was from the 1987, this is the 2004.

759
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:53,990
And this design is slightly different because on top of clustering it has this stratification.

760
01:28:54,830 --> 01:29:02,720
So now go to the to the, to the assignment.

761
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:08,540
And, and you can work in pairs for this question because this is part of your of your lab.

762
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:12,830
And when you open the the assignment in in canvas.

763
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:17,950
So see if I can find.

764
01:29:33,610 --> 01:29:44,020
So here it is. So note that the first question you have to first create binary outcomes and report the prevalence of the outcomes.

765
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:49,450
So, so I'm giving you here the three indicators.

766
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:54,230
The, the high for age, the weight for age, and they work for high.

767
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:57,400
The cutoff is less than minus two. Okay.

768
01:29:57,850 --> 01:30:01,239
So don't get confused with that. That's not a arrow.

769
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:06,390
That's less than minus two. So you use that less than minus two, no less or equal less than most.

770
01:30:06,910 --> 01:30:13,330
Okay. And then you are below minus two, you're stunting, you are below minus two.

771
01:30:13,690 --> 01:30:17,590
For this other indicator, you're underweight for their weight, for high your waist.

772
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:23,680
Okay. And now you have to first grade those variables and now you had to report the prevalence

773
01:30:23,890 --> 01:30:30,940
of standing and their weight and wasting with a corresponding 95% confidence interval.

774
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:35,350
Assuming this data comes from a complex sampling, they say, okay.

775
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:49,830
Fauci, I want you to report the prevalence of stunting and their weight and wasting with a corresponding 95% confidence interval.

776
01:30:50,490 --> 01:30:53,490
Assuming now you are assuming something that is not true,

777
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:59,040
but I'm asking you to assume that that with this data would come from a simple random sampling.

778
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:05,520
Okay. So we are going to do like a thought experiment to see when it comes to an accomplished design.

779
01:31:05,550 --> 01:31:09,000
Now let's see what happened, if it was coming from a random sample.

780
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:17,670
Right. So which means that you can still use blocks that reflect, but you have to get rid of the clustering straight away.

781
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:23,729
The statement. Okay. And then I'm asking you,

782
01:31:23,730 --> 01:31:33,629
are there any differences in the prevalence estimates using the different assumptions and why and are there any difference differences in the 95%

783
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:46,410
confidence intervals and why and I'm copying here do the criteria for success copy your versus code and relevance less output to support your answers.

784
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:52,830
Pay attention to the assumption about the sample in the same questions to be answered with and answer all the questions.

785
01:31:53,970 --> 01:32:01,650
So start working in pairs and then I'll give you right now over which dataset are we working with?

786
01:32:02,010 --> 01:32:12,360
2004. So now is 2004. So now we are switching to the to the lab that we will look, I know we are going back and forth, but I'll tell you what.

787
01:32:37,830 --> 01:32:42,810
Are the names still is it still strong? A cluster like the variable names.

788
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:46,590
Yeah, they are. Everything is displayed in the in the document.

789
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:49,830
So there is a lot of kind of like here.

790
01:32:50,670 --> 01:32:58,649
So. So the 300 children were selected using a complex design in which first read I will consider Ireland or one

791
01:32:58,650 --> 01:33:05,300
island continent or one and continent program and with Mr. Read before villages that are requested were selected.

792
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:14,220
This is the primary something unique. And then finally, within the last hour, some households were selected and then all the children below five.

793
01:33:14,580 --> 01:33:22,049
So then in the I'm here in them you have two variables in that that I said that indicated four different strata.

794
01:33:22,050 --> 01:33:26,820
And are those the island contour on there who they say are two.

795
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:32,100
So then you have two. Basically, this is the instead of their statement, you get this just copy and paste.

796
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:33,360
So then don't get confused.

797
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:42,510
You also have one variable for the primary sampling unit, which is this plastic thing, and then you have a available for the weight.

798
01:33:42,690 --> 01:33:48,960
So then you basically have to take into account these three things so that plastic and weight.

799
01:33:49,410 --> 01:34:23,410
Okay. And you feel that something is not working.

800
01:34:23,410 --> 01:35:19,580
Well, just let me know. I'm here watching you. People.

801
01:39:03,790 --> 01:39:17,570
Is. Is.

802
01:39:27,590 --> 01:39:36,060
Me look like I just came from the floor of the.

803
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:50,040
So you put some. You should, literally.

804
01:39:58,820 --> 01:40:02,130
This took three years.

805
01:40:02,860 --> 01:40:06,580
So. Oh.

806
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:15,050
That doesn't happen if we live in a management.

807
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:23,220
Who's doing the show anyway.

808
01:40:23,950 --> 01:40:28,370
Yeah. So. So, I mean, there are too many.

809
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:32,680
Yes. I think you can say.

810
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:41,400
Okay. Just to give you the one you gave.

811
01:40:42,510 --> 01:40:48,530
And then the first one is. No.

812
01:40:48,550 --> 01:40:52,890
You have to find something.

813
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:58,110
Scratch. So. So have to overcome this or.

814
01:41:07,770 --> 01:41:31,160
I know, I said, because. Do you have anything you can do that you have to take?

815
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:34,510
Because I do have to. Okay.

816
01:41:41,850 --> 01:41:55,260
But it. What? You know.

817
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:08,100
You can feel it here. I think if I have to put. So you can think those three.

818
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:22,080
Your people do not know that you're going to have to destroy your business.

819
01:42:24,830 --> 01:42:30,180
You know, that tends to.

820
01:42:32,930 --> 01:42:37,580
These are all things that are important.

821
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:49,890
And this bill would people the same as potentially one of these things going on.

822
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:57,040
So after he says he has created I want to show you something.

823
01:43:01,010 --> 01:43:05,240
They say, how are you going to do something about this?

824
01:43:07,870 --> 01:43:18,380
It was very interesting. When you age, they change the way you connect.

825
01:43:24,150 --> 01:43:38,790
My. So this is the way that he's going to find a way to use this big here.

826
01:43:39,550 --> 01:43:48,520
I mean, here is the truth. I mean, for that's something you can do is divide and conquer.

827
01:43:49,510 --> 01:43:55,770
You're competing. Stephanie. That's fine.

828
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:09,140
I know you can do. We have to tell you.

829
01:44:09,220 --> 01:44:21,880
Get out of here. And you know, it's.

830
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:34,190
Joining me on the. Yes.

831
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:40,160
Oh, yes. Yes, but.

832
01:44:44,370 --> 01:44:51,790
Like you have to do to be a viable option, go to the administration to have a meeting.

833
01:44:52,300 --> 01:45:05,810
So this is you have to be at least a decade, maybe less than they do in which they have even more than 70 of things.

834
01:45:11,570 --> 01:45:20,380
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah.

835
01:45:20,710 --> 01:45:23,410
Lose that and very.

836
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:35,610
Or because we have to change that, because this is a new aggressive and this will make it so you have to wait for the attorney general to go.

837
01:45:36,990 --> 01:45:41,460
Yeah. Okay. So this is all behind us.

838
01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:52,820
This is dealing with 1101.

839
01:45:53,050 --> 01:45:58,290
Okay. So now I think what I think.

840
01:46:01,450 --> 01:46:08,890
So that's what I was doing. So so in the data, they don't usually clarify.

841
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:14,910
You get one piece in every season.

842
01:46:16,470 --> 01:46:22,400
We believe in that principle and with. Yeah, I know.

843
01:46:22,410 --> 01:46:27,630
This is the first time you've run that issue.

844
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:36,650
Yeah. Know. Oh.

845
01:46:41,820 --> 01:46:47,540
Yeah. So you. So now a user.

846
01:46:47,550 --> 01:46:52,970
Can you do what you can do?

847
01:46:53,590 --> 01:47:01,660
Yeah, well, very.

848
01:47:07,490 --> 01:47:20,630
Yeah. No.

849
01:47:33,940 --> 01:47:42,200
The oldest. And.

850
01:47:56,270 --> 01:48:04,090
I'm not home right now, but I've been there.

851
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:09,970
Yes, if you.

852
01:48:17,790 --> 01:48:25,380
Okay. How are you doing? Anyone's having problems creating havoc in parts of Northern Virginia.

853
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,560
Have to wait for the cardigans and the variable.

854
01:48:32,710 --> 01:48:53,760
So let's. No, because the president is a business that has to be done making sure that everything is going to survive this alternate reality.

855
01:48:55,110 --> 01:49:05,320
Yes. Oh, no.

856
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:16,050
I feel. It's good for the people who.

857
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:22,750
Okay. Thank you for having me. Can't wait.

858
01:50:09,130 --> 01:50:15,320
No. What is it?

859
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:22,220
Oh. No, no, no.

860
01:50:23,030 --> 01:50:27,370
You have to put it up in the next day because it.

861
01:50:40,470 --> 01:50:46,300
But isn't it time to wait until we remember what happened when we was here

862
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:52,610
that will working with the city and I think that allows us to cope with this.

863
01:50:54,390 --> 01:50:58,060
So there is something.

864
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:31,200
What did you. Okay.

865
01:51:31,220 --> 01:51:38,510
So now. Yeah.

866
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:48,020
Yeah. And. Are you ready?

867
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:56,310
Isn't. You go to the.

868
01:52:00,220 --> 01:52:05,630
41 year.

869
01:52:09,610 --> 01:52:16,760
It's tempting to behave like it should be impossible to get away with it.

870
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:25,790
Okay. So now we know you can make sure you have.

871
01:52:28,950 --> 01:52:39,850
I'm not going to You'll be able to see. In 19 oh.

872
01:52:43,780 --> 01:52:47,180
What do you have?

873
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:10,070
She? The whole country.

874
01:53:18,030 --> 01:53:28,400
They feel that they should be using of.

875
01:53:31,770 --> 01:53:39,410
And this is his work. Maybe there's something you should make sure I have a percentage.

876
01:53:39,670 --> 01:53:45,460
Right. And then we. Do you ever seen anything like that in your life?

877
01:53:46,300 --> 01:53:50,560
And you have to go for it and.

878
01:53:51,950 --> 01:54:05,060
Yes, so. I do think they're scientifically accurate.

879
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:10,390
Well, it's not like.

880
01:54:24,390 --> 01:54:27,950
This is. Yeah, I hope so.

881
01:54:29,940 --> 01:54:36,060
Bigger than two is. Yeah, it's a bit bigger.

882
01:54:36,390 --> 01:54:39,720
Below minus two, three and four.

883
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:47,930
It's why the best time so.

884
01:54:48,070 --> 01:54:52,380
So then you know. You know. You know we go back to school.

885
01:54:52,470 --> 01:54:56,240
Why is my daughter beginning to look for something to do once? Oh.

886
01:54:57,650 --> 01:55:01,240
Oh, here I don't like.

887
01:55:01,850 --> 01:55:09,380
If it's -2.5 degrees, I know that you may have to be a little drunk and it's not.

888
01:55:14,620 --> 01:55:20,440
He did not.

889
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:30,670
Now, now you're running for office.

890
01:55:30,670 --> 01:55:39,790
And this should be clear what's going on here. It actually was Watergate, and as long as it was the majority of you, what were you doing?

891
01:55:42,190 --> 01:55:45,670
And if my nephew is truly be the one we can count on.

892
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:52,089
Generally, like reams of variables.

893
01:55:52,090 --> 01:55:55,780
Like how? Graduate high.

894
01:55:59,030 --> 01:56:04,560
To convince people of.

895
01:56:08,680 --> 01:56:19,340
Right. And you can do it as it is whenever you have the benefit of it.

896
01:56:21,470 --> 01:56:26,480
And then I go to the Grove and never have those.

897
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:33,800
Now, go back to everything you did.

898
01:56:34,150 --> 01:56:37,930
Oh, yes. I mean, I think this is.

899
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:44,900
And I think.

900
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:53,480
Okay. So both. We need to. It's almost three.

901
01:56:53,480 --> 01:56:56,629
I need to go, but we will continue next week.

902
01:56:56,630 --> 01:57:03,370
Okay. And next week will be mostly everything that you have questions during the week.

903
01:57:03,390 --> 01:57:04,670
Let me know where you may look.
