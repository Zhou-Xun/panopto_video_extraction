1
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:10,500
So the final data collection method
we'll talk about are observations.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,311
Observations allow us to witness
people in their natural environments,

3
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:17,023
they are useful when we want
to focus on the context.

4
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:23,910
And observations allow us to access
the everyday activities of people.

5
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,230
I find observations to be especially
helpful when I want to start exploring

6
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,430
a new topic or research question.

7
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,340
And I need to think more about where
to start, whom to include in a sample,

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,990
and learn about about the social and
cultural context of a topic.

9
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,180
Observations are also useful in
shedding light on actual behaviors.

10
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,020
Sometimes people don't want to
report what they actually do.

11
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,730
It is not always the case that they're
hiding something, but they may not even

12
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,190
know what to report on, or forget
about some of the important details.

13
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,870
Observations can provide a lot
of details about a setting.

14
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,240
Sometimes I will conduct
observations of locations or

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,630
events that my interview participants
tell me about so that I can see and

16
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,890
experience the setting
with my own eyes and ears.

17
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,077
Observations are also useful in a study
when you want to look at the process, and

18
00:01:09,077 --> 00:01:13,426
then we can watch the event
unfold from beginning to end.

19
00:01:13,426 --> 00:01:18,340
Thinking about what you want to observe
as you plan an observational study but

20
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,981
sometimes the observation is
centered around an event.

21
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:25,990
You observe what is occurring or
a sequence of activities.

22
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,882
Other times the observation is centred
around a situation where you observe

23
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,416
the physical surroundings.

24
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:34,620
And sometimes the observation
is centered around people.

25
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,580
And you observe the characteristics of
the participants, the interactions of

26
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:43,530
the participants and also the nonverbal
behavior of the participants.

27
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,310
Observations can be structured,
or unstructured.

28
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,280
So for structured observations,

29
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,420
usually have a checklist
of what you're looking for.

30
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,335
Usually this includes
the frequencies of an activity or

31
00:01:54,335 --> 00:01:59,012
appearance of people entering
into the situation, for example.

32
00:01:59,012 --> 00:02:02,780
Unstructured observations on the other
hand are when you don't have anything

33
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,870
specific, but maybe just a research
question guiding the observation.

34
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,710
In these cases, you conduct a thorough and
complete description of the setting, or

35
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,060
an event you are observing.

36
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,510
You take detailed field notes
that read like a journal or

37
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,180
a narrative account of what you observed.

38
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,546
Field notes include the physical
as well as the social environment,

39
00:02:23,546 --> 00:02:28,741
they are highly detailed and
very descriptive.

40
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:33,038
So in summary, observations can be
used to learn about the context.

41
00:02:33,038 --> 00:02:37,387
Observations are good when you want
to focus on the naturally occurring

42
00:02:37,387 --> 00:02:38,191
behaviors.

43
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,624
Structured observations provide
frequencies and counts,

44
00:02:41,624 --> 00:02:47,968
while unstructured observations provide
detailed narrative descriptions.
