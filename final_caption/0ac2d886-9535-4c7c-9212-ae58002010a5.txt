Hello there. Welcome to the changing climate changing reservations,

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:13,790
a podcast about climate change and its effect on Native American and Alaska Native communities throughout the United States.

3
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:23,550
I'm your host, Andrew Leamon. Thank you for joining us. In this first episode, we're going to lay out some definitions regarding climate change.

4
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:31,610
And we'll let you know the facts about both our changing climate as well as modern Native American reservations will briefly discuss the

5
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:41,200
history behind environmental injustice on Native American land as well to give you some context moving forward into our second episode.

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,160
Climate change is a word that many people hear tossed around.

7
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,640
However, the definition can be somewhat nebulous.

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,330
Essentially, what climate changes is, it's kind of a long term shift in weather patterns and temperatures.

9
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:04,240
Now this can occur naturally, but is largely being driven by greenhouse gas emissions or kind of industrial byproducts,

10
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:10,410
if you will, from developed nations in the Western societies.

11
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:15,360
When people hear climate change, they sometimes think it's synonymous with global warming and certainly warmer

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,780
temperatures and droughts are seen in some regions due to climate change.

13
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:25,260
However, climate change can also cause more intense temperature fluctuations in colder weather in some cases.

14
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,610
Additionally, it can cause things like intense storms, melting of ice caps,

15
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:37,870
rising sea levels and ultimately can lead to things like changes in biodiversity or the animals and species that live in an area.

16
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,190
One of the biggest ironies of climate change is that although it's driven by industry,

17
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:47,260
that industry typically happens in places that don't reap the full effects of climate change,

18
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:53,020
and those full effects are often punted off to marginalized in rural communities who are hit the hardest.

19
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:59,650
Even though they actually tend to have minimal effect on greenhouse gas emissions themselves.

20
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,830
When it comes to Native American populations within our country,

21
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:11,200
there's been a very long history of both political injustice as well as environmental injustice, and a lot of this stems from land issues.

22
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,780
Colonizers came to the United States and took communal land from Native American populations,

23
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:22,270
allotting parcels back to individuals, often giving them less desirable pieces of land.

24
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:27,790
Often, tribes were uprooted from one region of the country and taken to other regions of the country,

25
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,560
and then given the land, they're leaving their ancestral land behind.

26
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:41,140
Once they had established land and were given sovereign status, there continued to be environmental injustices such as uranium mining or Navajo wind,

27
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,840
causing considerable pollution and health effects,

28
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:52,420
as well as other things like radiation exposure after atomic bomb testing due to the downwind location of multiple Native American reservations.

29
00:02:52,420 --> 00:03:01,610
Even today in the modern world, Native American lands face a disproportionate amount of air pollution when compared to other regions of the country.

30
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:09,350
Moving into our next episodes, two of the key topics that we're going to be talking about will be environmental justice, as well as resiliency.

31
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:16,370
Environmental justice is defined by the EPA as fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of race, color,

32
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:24,650
national origin or income, with respect to the development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and policies.

33
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,280
And this is incredibly important for these marginalized Native American communities.

34
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,940
Additionally, resilience is defined as the ability to cope with crisis,

35
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,190
and this is something that Native Americans are unfortunately very well versed in due to their history,

36
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,320
and they're showing a lot of resilience today with the current environmental issues they're facing.

37
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,860
Keep those two principles in mind as we move forward into our next episode,

38
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:53,520
we'll discuss the current state of environmental injustice on a variety of Native American reservations and what they're doing about it.

39
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,349
Hope to see you there.
