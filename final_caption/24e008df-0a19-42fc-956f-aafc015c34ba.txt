00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:20,620
Variance analysis is an examination and interpretation of what was expected to happen as specified in the budget with what actually happened.

2
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:31,720
Variance analysis allows managers to answer questions such as Why was our department's actual profit less than what we budgeted?

3
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,830
Why did our department earn larger revenues than we budgeted?

4
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,790
Why did our department incur higher costs than we budgeted?

5
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,410
Variance analysis is an essential part of the budgeting process.

6
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:50,020
Its primary goal is not to assign blame for unfavorable results.

7
00:00:50,920 --> 00:01:00,820
Rather, variance analysis aims to uncover the causes of operational problems so that they can be avoided or at least minimized in the future.

8
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:07,030
Actions taken by managers in response to variance analysis have the potential to

9
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,920
dramatically improve the operations and financial performance of an organization.

10
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:20,050
Variance analysis involves comparing to amounts an actual or realized value and a budgeted value.

11
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,360
The difference between these two values is what financial managers call the variance.

12
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,410
Let's use the following example to conduct simple variance analysis for a community health center.

13
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:40,390
Let's start by computing the profit variance, since profit is the most important single line on the operating budget.

14
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,420
The profit variance is computed as the difference between actual profit and budgeted profit.

15
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:53,650
In general, variances are calculated so that positive amounts signify good or desirable results,

16
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,910
while negative amounts are bad or undesirable results.

17
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:08,950
In this example, the profit variance equals $585 -$600, which is equal to -$15.

18
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:17,200
This means that the center's profit was $15 lower than expected, which is a bad or undesirable result.

19
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,990
Let's conduct additional analysis to determine what caused this lower than expected profit.

20
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,580
What's the cause of revenue shortfall, cost overruns, or both?

21
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:37,960
Let's take a closer look at the revenue side. The revenue variance is defined as the difference between actual revenues and budgeted revenues.

22
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:48,250
In this example, $2,535 -$2,400 equals $135.

23
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,220
This means that the center's revenues were $135 greater than budgeted.

24
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:02,680
Now, let's take a look at the expense side. The expense variance is defined as budgeted expenses minus actual expenses.

25
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,930
Note that we had to reverse the calculation here to show that higher than

26
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:13,690
budgeted expenses are bad or undesirable and hence create a negative variance.

27
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:22,840
In this example, $1,800 -$1,950 equals -$150.

28
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,750
This means that the center's expenses were $150 greater than budgeted.

29
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,090
By breaking down the Center's profit variance into the revenue and the expense variance,

30
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:42,700
it is readily apparent that the major cause of the center's poor financial performance was that costs were too high.
