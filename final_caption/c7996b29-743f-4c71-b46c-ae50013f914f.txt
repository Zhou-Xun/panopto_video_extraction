Hi there, today I'm going to be talking about Puerto Rico in the context of climate change and environmental justice and injustice.

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:15,120
So Puerto Rico has a very protracted history of fighting for environmental justice starting in the 1960s,

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,590
with the opposition to a huge mining project in the central mountainous range.

4
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,060
Socialist leader of the 1970s one Antonio even declared that independence

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,080
movement had to oppose the mines because this would make Puerto Rico unlivable.

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:39,570
And this ethos of livability in hospital ability in response to U.S. hegemony and colonialism has emanated throughout climate justice movements today.

7
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,090
So independence and environmental justice have gone hand-in-hand in Puerto Rico since the 20th century.

8
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,970
There was even a strong movement movement against post-colonial US, called the 2020 project.

9
00:00:50,970 --> 00:01:00,180
You can see here protest against this 2020 plan, which would subject Puerto Ricans to 63 percent of land ownership by the U.S.,

10
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,810
including these emissions producing mines and factories.

11
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:11,100
This 2020 plan was dubbed Genocidal for Puerto Rico and not ethos again of living in a built livability

12
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,640
has emanated throughout climate change and environmental justice movements leading up to today.

13
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,760
So climate scientists have stated that global climate change will increase the intensity of major storms such as hurricanes.

14
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:30,480
And as you can see on this chart, it's about frequency of these storms, which is rapidly increasing,

15
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,860
as well as the strength of these storms, which is again rapidly increasing.

16
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:43,500
Hurricanes in a warming world are going to intensify in frequency, duration and strength due to warmer air holding more moisture for rainfall.

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,080
Warmer oceans increasing hurricane power. And rising seas increasing storm surges.

18
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:57,900
So for Puerto Rico, a very coastal and environmentally vulnerable, ecologically tenuous area.

19
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:04,530
Hurricanes are going to become already are and are becoming even worse in a in terms of strength and frequency.

20
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,680
In fact, the 2017 Hurricane Maria was the most devastating hurricane in 85 years in Puerto Rico,

21
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,390
leaving no communication and power in some areas for almost a year.

22
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,740
As you can see in this image, there's just devastation. Buildings collapsed.

23
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,520
Huge floods just an environmental travesty.

24
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,180
So the U.S. response to Hurricane Maria is deeply shaped by environmental racism, colonialism and injustice.

25
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:37,230
The U.S. response has been woefully inadequate compared to response to other disasters in the contiguous states.

26
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,270
So in one study from 2019,

27
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:45,990
it showed that the federal government responded on a much larger scale and much more quickly across measures of federal money.

28
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,510
Staffing resources.

29
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:57,420
Storm mortality counts in comparison to hurricanes Harvey and Irma in Texas and Florida, compared with Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.

30
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:03,780
The variation in response was not commensurate with storm severity and need after the landfall in the case of Puerto Rico.

31
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:13,110
So you can see in this chart Hurricane Maria received the least amount of federal funding in comparison to those three mentioned storms.

32
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,790
So young activists in Puerto Rico have demanded what they've called a declaration for the

33
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:23,760
climate crisis and more sovereign approach a decolonial approach to climate justice,

34
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,000
which includes a comprehensive public policy and climate change transformation toward sustainable economies.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,120
Land planning with the climate crisis in mind and overall, a detachment from colonial structures of the United States.

36
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,312
I hope this gives you some perspective on the impacts of environmental injustice in Puerto Rico.
