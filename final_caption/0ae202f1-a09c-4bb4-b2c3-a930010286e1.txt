1
00:00:05,444 --> 00:00:10,084
As professionals, we are all
experts in our topical knowledge.

2
00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:13,546
Which means that we always have
lots to say about the science or

3
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:18,630
the messages we want to communicate to
our audiences, but there's a problem.

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,704
See, people can only absorb
one thing at a time.

5
00:00:22,704 --> 00:00:29,530
And therefore, as communicators, we need
to pick our one message very carefully.

6
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,460
I learned this best from Chip and

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:37,300
Dan Heath's book, Made to Stick, which
was a best seller back in the late 2000s.

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,750
They looked at which messages stick
with us and which are forgotten.

9
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,460
They talk about being simple.

10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,970
Not simple as in short or dumbed down,
but simple as in finding the core,

11
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:56,810
finding that key single idea,
that most important thing to communicate.

12
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,280
So how do you do that?

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,930
Well, they tell a story that I wanna
tell you called, The Commander's Intent.

14
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,530
And The Commander's Intent idea

15
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,485
is a really simple idea that comes
from the military and the problems

16
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:15,770
the military faces in making sure that
their communications actually work.

17
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:21,135
So the problem is when generals and
admirals and officers write orders,

18
00:01:21,135 --> 00:01:27,080
by the time the orders arrive to wherever
it is they needed to be acted upon,

19
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,810
sometimes the situation changes.

20
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,400
The orders don't make sense,
because the battlefield has shifted or

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,900
because the objectives have changed.

22
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,380
And therefore, the officers need to
write orders that are adaptable.

23
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,320
That will be able to be
used by the officers,

24
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,220
by the soldiers, in the field,
in ways to accomplish the larger goals.

25
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,300
So how do you do that?

26
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,340
Well, the solution is you train officers
to write the commander's intent.

27
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:01,282
Which is one sentence summary
of the intent of the order.

28
00:02:01,282 --> 00:02:05,660
For example, if the order is to take,
let's make this up,

29
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:11,000
hill 300 to protect the flank of
these tanks that are crossing a river

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,180
at the bridge so that they can travel
to the city and join their artillery.

31
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,546
The hill is not the point.

32
00:02:17,546 --> 00:02:19,681
The bridge might get blown up.

33
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:23,440
The artillery might leave the city and
go some place else.

34
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,430
But the people receiving the orders
know that they better be doing something

35
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,460
to help the tanks get across the river and

36
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,150
meet up with the artillery
wherever they're going.

37
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:39,670
And that clarity of the central
message helps those officers

38
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,560
know what they need to do regardless
of how the situation changes.

39
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,620
The same idea apply to
us as communicators.

40
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,247
We the communicators of science and
health information, are the generals and

41
00:02:53,247 --> 00:02:55,370
the admirals in the story.

42
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:01,810
We need to make sure that our
audience learns our central message.

43
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,560
So the single most important thing
you can do to be a more effective

44
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,570
communicator is to know what
your commander's intent is.

45
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,920
So what needs to happen?

46
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,730
What do you want the audience to think,
to feel, or

47
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:24,950
to do immediately after hearing or
reading your message?

48
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:32,470
What do you want them to remember
maybe weeks or months later?

49
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:37,140
What do they need to take away from
this communication in order for

50
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,940
you to define it as a success?

51
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,830
When you ask these questions,

52
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,000
you get a sense as to what
your commander's intent is.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,430
So there's two steps to making your
ideas memorable to your audience.

54
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,400
Step one, find that core.

55
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,026
Find the commander's intent.

56
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,120
Step two, everything else.

57
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,770
Seriously, if you know what your core is,
that dictates everything else that you

58
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,030
need to do in order to make your message
clear, in order to make it memorable,

59
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:12,050
in order to make it something
that will impact your audience.

60
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:17,140
So what does finding the core mean
when we're trying to communicate

61
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,640
scientific or health data?

62
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,650
How does this play out in public health or
science data communication situations?

63
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,000
Let me explain.

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,240
See, we often hear this phrase of, well,
I'm gonna let the data speak for itself.

65
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,190
Data don't speak, we speak.

66
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,370
So we need to know what it is
we are trying to communicate.

67
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,370
What do you want people to understand
from the data, the table, or

68
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,650
the graphic that you're giving them?

69
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,490
What is the core idea that
you're trying to communicate?

70
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:54,230
And notice the core idea is different
than the scientific result.

71
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:58,330
It's different than the answer
to the research question or

72
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,790
the finding of the study.

73
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,300
It may be related to that, but
sometimes the core idea is more about

74
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,560
its application or
its generalizability or the method.

75
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,900
What is the core idea that
you want to get across?

76
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,360
And usually that's related
to this last question.

77
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,530
Why should your audience care about
whatever it is you're telling them?

78
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,710
If you know that,
then you can shape how you present it, so

79
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,500
that they will care about it,
and that's what we all want.

80
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,060
This is time well spent.

81
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,350
When you know what matters, everything
else falls into place as a communicator.

82
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,310
And I'll give you a concrete
example of this, when I or

83
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,620
my faculty colleagues work on big grants
that may be worth millions of dollars.

84
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,350
We often spend months,
literally, months on one page,

85
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,930
the first page,
the specific aims page of the grant.

86
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,910
Refining it, shaping it,
making sure it captures

87
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,490
the core idea of why this
grant is worth funding.

88
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,410
What it will accomplish,
how it will change the world.

89
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,360
And then we spend much less
time on the rest of the grant,

90
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,180
which might be 15 or 20 pages long.

91
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,180
Why?
Because if we get that specific aims page

92
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,740
right, everything else becomes
a whole lot more clear.

93
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,440
Message prioritization is the key
step to good communication.

94
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,060
So it's worth your time to work on it

95
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,359
even more than anything else you do
to become a better communicator.
