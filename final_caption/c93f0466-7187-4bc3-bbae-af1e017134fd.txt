1
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:15,770
For me, looking at how disease and risk factors track over time and space is one of the most fun parts of my job.

2
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:23,630
In part, it's what got me into this field to start with and thinking about how disparities in health exist and why.

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:32,600
In this video, I'll walk you through some examples of how disease, frequency and risk factors can vary by place and time.

4
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:39,110
We'll also begin to put on our epidemiology thinking caps to consider why those trends might

5
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:44,960
exist and whether or not differences might be real or due to some other non causal factors.

6
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:55,190
So let's start with a map of life expectancy across the United States using data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

7
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:02,360
We know that on average, the life expectancy in the United States in 2014 was 79 years.

8
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:12,320
Now that's a very nice, long life. But here's the thing life expectancy is not the same everywhere as can be seen on this map.

9
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,900
In fact, where you live can dramatically change your expected age of death.

10
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,660
So how much do you think the death rates change or life expectancy changes by place?

11
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,900
Do you think it's five years? Ten years?

12
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:35,870
In reality, the difference between the counties with the highest and the lowest life expectancies are 20 years.

13
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,570
Clearly, we have some work left to do as a nation to improve the health of all of our residents.

14
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,820
Looking at the relative causes of death over time can also be quite fascinating.

15
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:55,440
Here I've plotted the mortality rates for children and adolescents from different causes between 1998 and 2016.

16
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:04,980
What you can see here is that the number one and number two causes of mortality among children are motor vehicle crashes and firearm related injuries,

17
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,730
respectively.

18
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:15,690
Importantly, in spite of substantial improvements to the safety of motor vehicles, we've seen very little improvement for any other cause.

19
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:23,640
And it appears as if there may even be a slight increase in recent years from firearm related mortality in our children.

20
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:31,700
Now, knowing how things vary over time and place in population is not just fascinating.

21
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:37,790
Although for me, it is that too. But it's actually very important from a population health perspective.

22
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,440
If we know where or among who is suffering the most,

23
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:50,280
then we can do our best to understand why and intervene in those areas, of course, in order for interventions to work.

24
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:55,250
However, the trends that we observe are differences we observe must be causal.

25
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,160
So how do we know if that's the case?

26
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:06,050
Well, we're going to spend a lot of time talking about this throughout the course, as it's really the core question of epidemiology.

27
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,739
Is something causal or not? Therefore,

28
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:14,660
I thought it might be fun to get us started by thinking about this question from a

29
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:20,870
conceptual place early on in the semester in order to set the stage for what comes next.

30
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,680
So let's start by thinking about trends that we believe are real.

31
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,620
In this example, I'm showing you data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,

32
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:38,130
or NHANES, when they collected blood lead levels on repeated samples of the population over time.

33
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,380
What you can see in this figure is that the distribution of blood lead levels have been steadily declining over time,

34
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:55,380
shifting from means that are at the current action level of ten microgram per deciliter in the 1976 to 1980 time frame,

35
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,050
all the way down to less than one in the 2011 to 2016 survey.

36
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,250
So why was that? Well, in the 1960s,

37
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,670
the United States and nations around the world realized that lead was an

38
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,900
important environmental toxicant that was leading to lowered IQ in our children,

39
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:21,540
among other outcomes. As a result, the government began to phase out leaded gasoline and remove lead from paint products.

40
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:28,470
And in one of our major wins for public health, lead levels declined precipitously in the population.

41
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,079
Now let's take another example here.

42
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:39,740
We have some trend data that was plotted by researchers using data from a large health insurer, Kaiser Permanente.

43
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:45,920
What they found was a strange rapid increase in the prevalence of chronic renal failure.

44
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,600
Unlike with the lead results, this finding was unexpected,

45
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:59,780
especially in the context of no dramatic increases in prevalence for other chronic conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes.

46
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:08,000
Upon further investigation, the researchers learned that the same phenomenon was observed in other medical records data,

47
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:16,250
this time from Medicare and Medicaid. It made them wonder whether or not there might be non causal influences at play.

48
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,449
The first hypothesis that they had for the increases was that it was artificial

49
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:26,410
and due to a change in the diagnostic coding for chronic kidney disease.

50
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:39,070
This was because in 2005 and again in 2007 through 2009, there was added detail that was put in on the codes for chronic kidney disease.

51
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:45,510
Now, while the data didn't look entirely consistent with a shift in reporting in 2005,

52
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:55,050
the 2007 to 2009 change may actually be a possibility for why there were increases observed in the prevalence of this outcome.

53
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,570
To investigate how much diagnostic coding might have caused the shift.

54
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:08,040
They obtained data from enhanced on chronic kidney disease and plotted that data over the same time period.

55
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,729
Now this was of interest to them because PN hands use laboratory tests rather than medical

56
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:22,620
diagnostic codes to look at chronic kidney disease because they saw no trends over time.

57
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:32,570
The authors thought that this evidence was suggestive that diagnostic coding changes may have been the cause for the appearance of the trend.

58
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:41,930
Now, one final possible explanation that the authors considered was the way in which commercial laboratories reported their

59
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:51,050
serum creatinine tests over time per recommendations from the National Kidney Disease Education Program in 2007.

60
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:57,770
Laboratories began reporting EGFR for every serum creatinine level.

61
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:05,179
Now, authors hypothesized that this change in reporting from the laboratories may have caused increased

62
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:12,710
kidney disease diagnosis because abnormal EGFR values became more visible to clinicians.

63
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:19,220
Collectively, this data suggested to the authors that these increases were not real,

64
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:27,410
and they cautioned other people who are using information about chronic kidney disease to be careful when using medical records.

65
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:37,010
Hopefully this video has highlighted for you the types of questions that we might ask when we're looking at trends or patterns in disease frequency.

66
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:47,790
Examples of causal relationships for time trends might be factors such as policy changes, emergence of new pathogens, or changes in treatment.

67
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:57,350
Whereas differences across space might be explained causally by variations in access to health resources or differences in risk factors by place.

68
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,500
Non causal reasons for associations might include things like administrative record changes,

69
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,210
laboratory test changes, or differences in diagnostic patterns.
