1
00:00:05,828 --> 00:00:10,592
So now I'd like to take what we've learned
about message prioritization and focus on

2
00:00:10,592 --> 00:00:16,320
using it in writing, cuz you're gonna do a
lot of writing in whatever your career is.

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,060
There's two keys to clear paragraphs
that I wanna talk about and

4
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,140
show you why they matter.

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:30,300
The first is a paragraph is supposed to be
about one point not a whole ton of points,

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,760
one singular idea.

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,340
And the second key that is a really simple
idea that doesn't get used as much as

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,180
it ought to be is something called
the inverted triangle structure.

9
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,320
So let me explain.

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,592
I know this sounds like maybe high school
or even elementary school writing.

11
00:00:45,592 --> 00:00:50,405
Do I really mean that we as professionals
need to be thinking about this stuff?

12
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:53,170
Yes, I really mean it.

13
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:58,239
Because the problem here is that many
scientists, many health communicators,

14
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,309
many educators don't follow these basic
rules of designing their paragraphs,

15
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:04,960
of writing in clear ways.

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,541
And they don't even realize that they're
writing in unnecessarily complex ways.

17
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,950
Therefore, we're gonna practice it.

18
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,846
I'm gonna show you why this matters and

19
00:01:14,846 --> 00:01:18,455
why it makes whatever
you're writing clearer.

20
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:21,930
Now, let’s talk about why we do this.

21
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,718
Why is it that academics and health
professionals often write so confusingly?

22
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:28,179
Cuz it’s not coming from nowhere.

23
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:31,390
The fact is most of the time
the reason is this.

24
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,101
Whoever's writing, the speaker,
the writer, the educator,

25
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:39,621
they don't know what
there central message is.

26
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:43,256
It's really hard to write
a paragraph with a clear point,

27
00:01:43,256 --> 00:01:46,260
if you don't know what that point is.

28
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,966
What you end of doing is that you write
lots of stuff that doesn't actually make

29
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:51,550
a point.

30
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,670
What happens is that people write
a series of true statements.

31
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,095
This is true and this is true and
this is true and they're all true, but

32
00:01:59,095 --> 00:02:02,350
they don't actually relate to each other.

33
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,208
They don't have a point.

34
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,892
So when you try to put them together,

35
00:02:06,892 --> 00:02:11,402
the goal is to think about how do
you want them to put together.

36
00:02:11,402 --> 00:02:16,500
How do you want to use a structure to make
the point that you're trying to make?

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,691
Better academic writers use often
what's called the academic triangle.

38
00:02:20,691 --> 00:02:22,170
Let me show you this.

39
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,417
The Academic triangle starts up top.

40
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:30,820
You introduce the topic and then you bring
in some evidence to back up your argument.

41
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,373
And the more evidence you have,
the stronger your argument is and

42
00:02:34,373 --> 00:02:36,323
then you get to a concluding point.

43
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,410
Maybe, cuz let's be honest.

44
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,787
Sometimes, academics
don't get to that point.

45
00:02:39,787 --> 00:02:42,260
They just give you the evidence and
the argument.

46
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,588
They don't get to the point.

47
00:02:43,588 --> 00:02:48,382
The problem with the academic triangle
from the reader's standpoint is that

48
00:02:48,382 --> 00:02:51,418
it makes you wait to figure
out what the point is.

49
00:02:51,418 --> 00:02:56,386
You have to get through all the other
stuff before you figure out the point that

50
00:02:56,386 --> 00:02:58,830
the writer is trying to make.

51
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,510
That makes it harder to read.

52
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,548
The solution is the inverted triangle.

53
00:03:03,548 --> 00:03:07,220
The inverted triangle, you start right
at the top with the central message.

54
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:14,676
The most important thing you want to get
across that organizes all the information,

55
00:03:14,676 --> 00:03:18,570
then you bring supporting points or facts.

56
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,460
The evidence and each piece of
those supporting points connects

57
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,896
directly to that central message and
then you might wrap up

58
00:03:27,896 --> 00:03:33,070
the paragraph with other supporting
points or facts, or details.

59
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,602
Again, connecting each one of them
back up to that central message.

60
00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:40,026
Notice two things about
the inverted triangle structure.

61
00:03:40,026 --> 00:03:43,050
First of all, it makes one point.

62
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:47,691
Because everything has to connect
up to that central message.

63
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:52,320
You can't make two distinct points and
still fit the structure.

64
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,190
If you have another point to make, that's
a clue you need to start a new paragraph.

65
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,536
And by the way, speaking as an editor,

66
00:03:59,536 --> 00:04:03,959
there is nothing wrong with short
paragraphs even in academic writings.

67
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,053
If you need to start a new paragraph
to start a new point, do it.

68
00:04:07,053 --> 00:04:10,190
Because that will make
your writing clearer.

69
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,796
Second, it forces you to figure
out how each and every sentence or

70
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,746
idea in the paragraph relates
to that central message.

71
00:04:18,746 --> 00:04:22,606
And if it doesn't connect
directly to that first sentence,

72
00:04:22,606 --> 00:04:27,390
then that's a clue that it probably
doesn't belong in that paragraph.

73
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,839
Maybe it belongs in somewhere else
you're writing, but not there.

74
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,170
Am I serious about this?

75
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,160
Really.

76
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,779
Yes, I really am.

77
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:41,400
I note this stuff every time I edit
a journal article or a dissertation.

78
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,110
Every time I'm writing,
regardless of whether I'm writing for

79
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,270
a scientific audience or
a public audience.

80
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,289
I think consciously about using
this structure in my writing and

81
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:53,337
you should too.

82
00:04:53,337 --> 00:04:56,920
For example, and
I'll give you a very concrete example.

83
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,127
Grant proposals or frankly any
other kind of proposal document.

84
00:05:01,127 --> 00:05:02,700
Who read this stuff?

85
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,580
Review committees.

86
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,556
They have to read tons of them,

87
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:10,740
which means that they're not
always reading every single word.

88
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,290
They're gonna skim it.

89
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:18,380
They're gonna go through really fast and
I need to write it in order for

90
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:24,588
them to get that audience to get
the major points as easily as possible.

91
00:05:24,588 --> 00:05:28,410
Inverted triangle paragraphs
make that really easy.

92
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,996
The first sentence of each paragraph tells
the whole story that I'm trying to get

93
00:05:32,996 --> 00:05:37,381
across and the body of each paragraph
is just providing supportive points for

94
00:05:37,381 --> 00:05:38,807
each point I'm making.

95
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:40,530
So here's an example.

96
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,449
Now you can't read this in detail,
so I'll pull this out.

97
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:48,110
At the top of section,
there's three sections there.

98
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,017
There's one sentence that I've bolded.

99
00:05:52,017 --> 00:05:53,650
Now, you probably can't read that either.

100
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,164
So let me show those to you
in really clear, bigger font.

101
00:05:57,164 --> 00:06:03,440
My three points that I wanted to make in
that introduction to my grant was this.

102
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,505
One, patient access to medical
test results in increasing.

103
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:12,507
Two, patients have many good reasons to
want direct access to their test results.

104
00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:17,355
Three, yet, simply providing patients
with access to medical test results might

105
00:06:17,355 --> 00:06:19,372
not result in improved outcomes.

106
00:06:19,372 --> 00:06:23,240
And those three sentences by
themselves tells the story of what I

107
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,467
wanted to communicate, which is to
lay the foundation of why I believe

108
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:32,140
that we need to improve how
test results are communicated.

109
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,690
All the extra text is just
supporting information.

110
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:41,460
And if somebody were to skim through and
just read those three bolded sentences,

111
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:47,110
they still get the whole point
which makes it really easy for

112
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,280
the reader to understand why
they should care about this.

113
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,400
And I have to say it worked,
I did get that grant.

114
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,453
See, by putting the main point
of each paragraph first,

115
00:06:57,453 --> 00:06:59,910
it's really easy to find the key.

116
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,584
Find the core central messages that
you're trying to get across and

117
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:07,334
this is a really valuable approach
to clear science communication.

118
00:07:07,334 --> 00:07:11,772
So I hope as you move forward,
you'll be more conscious about using this

119
00:07:11,772 --> 00:07:17,904
inverted triangle structure to organize
each of the paragraphs that you write.
