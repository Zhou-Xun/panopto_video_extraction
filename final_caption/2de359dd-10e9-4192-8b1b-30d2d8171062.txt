1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,033
In this session,

2
00:00:01,033 --> 00:00:05,950
we'll talk about some of the basics of the principles of cost effectiveness analysis.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,025
So on recap some things you may already know, but

4
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:13,300
we'll talk about the perspective, what costs, effectiveness,

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:19,050
the quadrants and the cost effectiveness plane and the cost effectiveness ratio.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,740
And finally, we'll talk about types of analysis that can be done.

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,001
So the perspective we often take is the societal perspective.

8
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:29,069
So that's taking a new account.

9
00:00:29,069 --> 00:00:33,703
Insurance companies, health, hospitals, health systems,

10
00:00:33,703 --> 00:00:38,360
patients, governments, all of them and what their costs are.

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,514
Another perspective that sometimes taken is the health system perspective and

12
00:00:42,514 --> 00:00:46,178
it still involves all these players, but just the health care costs.

13
00:00:46,178 --> 00:00:46,829
Anyway, but the societal perspective takes into account all of these things including

14
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:47,427
things like patients time to come into a doctor's visit, potentially criminal

15
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:52,800
justice, system costs. If you can avert drug use,

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,730
for example, they might

17
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:02,661
have health benefits and

18
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:08,790
also criminal justice costs.

19
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,676
Those would all be societal cost and that's generally what we want to take in

20
00:01:12,676 --> 00:01:17,112
these analyses, although sometimes people also take a health system perspective and

21
00:01:17,112 --> 00:01:20,540
just count the costs to the health care system.

22
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,850
When we say costs, what do you mean?

23
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,140
What we really need is the net costs?

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,530
So that's the cost of the intervention, the cost of the disease.

25
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,668
We wanna look over a long term periods.

26
00:01:31,668 --> 00:01:34,627
We wanna look not only in the short term during the intervention, but

27
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:38,190
over the lifetime, and look at all the impacts that the intervention might have.

28
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,251
And we wanna look at costs to everyone infected.

29
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:45,827
So the cost of the provider and the patient and their time, and

30
00:01:45,827 --> 00:01:49,524
any others that are paying for the intervention or

31
00:01:49,524 --> 00:01:56,040
the resulting impacts on health that might be affected.

32
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,371
The only thing about effectiveness, we're thinking about both the length of life and

33
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:02,960
the quality of life, so morbidity and mortality.

34
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,841
We can think about this in two dimensions.

35
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:08,140
Here, we have quality of life on the vertical axis and time or

36
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,840
quantity of life on the horizontal axis.

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,220
And the total effectiveness is the area under this curve here.

38
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,080
Both the quality and the quantity of life.

39
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,440
We'll talk about this in a few more weeks in more detail.

40
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,074
And then finally we put this all together in several quadrants here and

41
00:02:28,074 --> 00:02:30,480
we can think of two axes here.

42
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,370
The health benefits on one axis, the costs on one axis and

43
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,841
here notices they're labeled incremental costs and benefits.

44
00:02:38,841 --> 00:02:42,390
So keep in mind these are relative to some other intervention.

45
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,130
So how does one intervention look relative to the other one?

46
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,612
And so we think about maybe one intervention being here at the center of

47
00:02:49,612 --> 00:02:52,993
this, and the other intervention might be one of these quadrants.

48
00:02:52,993 --> 00:02:56,480
Some quadrants are clearly better than others.

49
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,430
So we like being in this quadrant in the lower right hand corner.

50
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,840
We don't like being in the quadrant in the upper left hand corner.

51
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,867
Oftentimes though, new interventions are in this upper right hand quadrant where

52
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:14,040
they have better health outcomes than the other ones but also have increased costs.

53
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,233
So what do we do in that quadrant while we calculate something called an incremental

54
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:24,650
cost effectiveness ratio, which is looking at kind of the relative costs and benefits

55
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,831
compared to the other interventions that we have available to us.

56
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:31,342
So it's the additional cost you're paying for

57
00:03:31,342 --> 00:03:35,380
that new intervention versus what you would have gotten with the other one.

58
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,862
And then what's the additional health benefits you get from the new one versus

59
00:03:38,862 --> 00:03:39,740
the old one.

60
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:44,059
Keep in mind high ratios are bad because you're paying more money it costs and

61
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:47,940
the numerator and low ratios are good.

62
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,240
Finally, I want to talk about different types of analyses that you might do.

63
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,397
There's cost effectiveness analysis which is in general,

64
00:03:56,397 --> 00:04:02,500
we're looking at costs and some sort of health outcomes.

65
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,120
Then cost utility analysis is a subset of cost effectiveness analysis.

66
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,936
But the health outcome is measured in terms of something called the quality

67
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:11,440
adjusted life here.

68
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,791
There's a cost benefit analysis where monetizing the health outcomes.

69
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:20,129
There's cost minimization where if you assume the outcome, the interventions

70
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:24,040
have equal health outcomes that all you care about is minimizing costs.

71
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,112
And there are burden of disease analyses where we're

72
00:04:27,112 --> 00:04:32,440
just looking at the burden of disease but not comparing it to something else.

73
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,133
So just to put these all together in a little table here,

74
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:41,727
a cost effectiveness analysis, monetary, costs are measured in monetary units.

75
00:04:41,727 --> 00:04:45,832
Measurements of health is any kind of natural units that might be a number of

76
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:48,254
infections, might be years of life lived.

77
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:52,418
Cost utility analysis also has cost measured in monetary units, but

78
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:56,040
the health outcome is a very specific health outcome.

79
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,932
This quality adjusted life year,

80
00:04:57,932 --> 00:05:02,060
which we'll get into more detail in a few weeks or a few sessions, I guess.

81
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,887
Then it cost benefit analysis, both the costs and

82
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,940
the health outcomes are measured in monetary units.

83
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,539
Cost minimization analysis assumes the health outcomes are equivalent, so

84
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:16,520
they're not even measured and you're just looking at the costs.

85
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,440
And then finally, a burden of disease analysis is not comparative.

86
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,957
Just measuring how bad is the disease and health outcomes can be measured in

87
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:30,271
different ways and actually sometimes costs can be measured here too.

88
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:35,087
So what's the cost of, let's say, malaria in a certain setting?

89
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:37,874
And so we'll talk more about these different types of analyses later in

90
00:05:37,874 --> 00:05:38,391
the course.

91
00:05:38,391 --> 00:05:41,881
But I just want to keep in mind here that the focus of this course for

92
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:46,196
the rest of the semester is really gonna be on the cost effectiveness analysis and

93
00:05:46,196 --> 00:05:50,766
really probably more cost utility analysis where those health outcomes are measured

94
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:51,669
and qualities.

95
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:54,407
And we'll talk a little bit more later in the semester,

96
00:05:54,407 --> 00:05:57,540
why that's probably a good way to look at things.

97
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,050
So that's it.

98
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,321
Thank you very much.
