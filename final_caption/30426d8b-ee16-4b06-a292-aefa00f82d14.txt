1
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,510
Today? I don't know.

2
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,479
Were you here last night? No. Okay. I'm going to his recording of class last week.

3
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,650
Right now. So, like he says, recording right now.

4
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,760
So is it online? It must be virtual.

5
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:55,780
Oh. You just up your bike.

6
00:01:17,210 --> 00:02:19,450
It's. It's the virtual.

7
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,580
No, I'm listening to his last lecture from last Thursday.

8
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:32,050
Right. Not to see it.

9
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,870
Check my email to help the time I decided I'm class.

10
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:43,330
Right? In no class I actually questions about homework, but I did too.

11
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,800
So that's why I was like, Oh, I'll just come. I appreciate you. I don't want to wait till Thursday's office hours.

12
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,950
Do you study with anyone when you do the homework?

13
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:58,430
Loaner, which is probably not good because I'm not getting everything you write in the homework as a result of that.

14
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:21,670
It's a good thing. I And the same way I've been a loner this semester, if you like it.

15
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,590
Ask a textbook friends and see what they say. If you have those, I don't.

16
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,200
Huh? So you have those? I don't know. Actually, I don't really have friends.

17
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,620
Our program. All my friends are outside my program.

18
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:50,020
Oh. And it just happened that way.

19
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,540
Nothing against people in our class are people in our class are amazing.

20
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:01,230
Yeah. So for sure, anyone I've ever worked with, and because we do plenty of good projects, has just been fantastic.

21
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:08,720
Yeah. And I just I'm. When I moved here, I got like into a friend group and then it just kind of stuck.

22
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:29,360
Exactly. Right here.

23
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,710
He just said it. There's not going to be a class on Tuesday. Oh, no.

24
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:41,090
Oh, he's going to be out of the country for a conference.

25
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,650
But there will be class on Thursday. He's.

26
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:57,120
Yes. Would every extra hour. I just got over it.

27
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,360
I want to go sleep. Sleep. I know.

28
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,450
Because we're in the same class with Dr. Dodson.

29
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:08,370
Yeah. I lost my voice over the weekend. I hear that. Great job on your presentation yesterday.

30
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,790
Oh, thank you. Yeah, that game was a little bit.

31
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,200
I get very into football, like, very into football. Yeah, maybe it's just a soccer to me.

32
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,980
Maybe it's that I grew up watching football all the time when I was, like, screaming part of my lungs.

33
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,950
So thankfully, the loss of your voice is not like illness related.

34
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,430
Yes, this is this is the plus. That is the plus.

35
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,960
Well, then. Well, then, do you want to grab brunch early?

36
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,290
Sure. Let's do it. Might as well.

37
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,409
Okay. Fine. Yeah. I don't think we ever gonna hang out.

38
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:55,330
So we have a leave. I know you're doing your Ph.D. here, so I really don't know.

39
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:59,290
Oh, you don't know. Okay, fine. Here. You'll get in. I have no doubt.

40
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:06,960
See? We'll see. I'm staying here for another two years.

41
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,570
Beginning. I'm doing my fellowship at Michigan Med. Okay, great.

42
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,050
So you automatically took the fellowship? Yeah.

43
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:20,560
I decided to go that way instead of getting a job. Honestly, it's a great experience.

44
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,520
I think so too. I'm also the youngest of my cohort. That's nice.

45
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:35,530
So I was like, I probably need it anyways. So are you gonna go for lunch?

46
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:40,479
I don't have to do anything right. You go. You pick a place that goes well.

47
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,559
Any brunch place will be fully empty. Try anything.

48
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,280
We're cool. Well, have you been here? Ideas? No.

49
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,300
What's your angel? Angelo's okay. Angelo's is the closest.

50
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,220
Aventura is downtown.

51
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,300
The bus takes you there. I've been ed up. Okay, that's good.

52
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:05,840
So since I haven't been Angela so stupid, let's answer it.

53
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,820
And I would've been straight. Yeah, yeah, I've been hands good, too.

54
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,780
Yeah. Angela's is more like a diner. Oh, that's really cool.

55
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:19,030
Are you so cool? And it's got, like, this strange hand, like, ridiculously busy.

56
00:07:19,120 --> 00:13:40,240
Oh, my gosh. This is like, I can't get it. Yeah.

57
00:28:03,570 --> 01:19:04,020
You. You.

58
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:13,090
In way. It's one.

59
01:22:35,170 --> 01:23:46,680
What? Hey.

60
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:03,220
Yeah. Yeah.

61
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:12,139
So I'm like, Oh, is this like my writing or not?

62
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:20,180
So I think it's I think it's all about I know I can't really do all those things we haven't.

63
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:24,800
So I'm trying to get my, my other people, like how to turn it in all weekend.

64
01:24:25,490 --> 01:24:38,020
And I, I think, I think it was Yeah.

65
01:24:38,610 --> 01:24:51,050
Long ago when I was like, I have like I guess in my mind's eye, like, oh gosh, that's going to be like the lot.

66
01:24:51,530 --> 01:24:58,643
Yeah. And of course, before that comes was like, yeah, let's just color on any like major issues with.
