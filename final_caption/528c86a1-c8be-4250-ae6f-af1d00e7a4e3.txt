1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,030
Of the pee pee pee pee eggs.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,410
Oh, yeah. It's like eight times different. Yeah.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,920
I mean, once you're at the store, it doesn't matter, but it just must be a cleaner.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,400
So we're not going to print until we do this new thing? Yeah.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,680
Then I can reverse some of my mistakes. All right.

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:28,050
Okay. So spread the word, but also the announcement out soon. I'm just trying to save for I made my day.

7
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,180
I think I'm the most distressed or, you know, what have you. All right.

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,970
So today we're going to talk about scholarship of teaching and learning as a field of research.

9
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:49,319
When we're done talking about this, we will actually jump into some in-class work to help prepare for next week.

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:57,900
You're going to do your first presentation next week. You're going to come up with your own sort of vision of a solo project.

11
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,300
And then after that, we will talk about teaching demonstrations.

12
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:11,760
And that's why you had you actually bring in a draft of your syllabus today is I wanted you to map out some of your class sessions

13
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:20,430
and be able to see envision a class session that you could actually do your teaching demonstration on and start lesson planning.

14
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:29,639
And I have an example of when I first created this course, I actually lesson plan for every day typically don't do that for this course.

15
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,090
For whatever reason. It was really helpful just to fan out. You know what I was doing each day, the amount of time,

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:42,240
what sort of activities and sort of mapped those on to like, you know, the objectives for each session.

17
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:49,709
Okay. So it's not about teaching and learning, it's also non abbreviated as well.

18
00:01:49,710 --> 00:02:02,250
So I might say sort of throughout this present, ah, this session is a field of research for teaching practices and learning outcomes for students.

19
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,129
And so I just like to present this data that actually comes from the participants where you

20
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:16,200
have on faculty and that basically the same survey was given once in 96 months in 2010.

21
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,380
I should see if there's an updated version of this. I don't think there is,

22
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:30,389
but basically it was just asking them how much percent of their time that they spend between the three activities that faculty are involved in,

23
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:42,270
which is teaching, research and service. And you can see what I've boxed out for both of years is that no matter the rank of the professor, assistant,

24
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:49,920
associate or full, they are all spending the most of their time on teaching or advising students or mentoring students.

25
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,500
So spending a lot of their time doing that.

26
00:02:53,580 --> 00:03:00,299
And then I put this up because, you know, every time we're in front of a classroom, we're sort of doing a natural experiment, right?

27
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,670
We're trying new things. We are trying to get we're writing interventions for students.

28
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:11,040
We're trying to get the best learning outcomes, but we don't really ever think think about that.

29
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,919
Right. And I had this realization as a Ph.D. student that, oh, you know, you can actually do research.

30
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,600
You can actually evaluate how your teaching practices work.

31
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:32,710
Right. And so a lot of credit goes to this guy, Ernest Boyer.

32
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:39,940
You know, if you're teaching in conferences, you know, would are nerdy and say, you know, what would Boyer do?

33
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,580
But a lot of credit goes to this guy for sort of starting this field of solo.

34
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:53,169
And he was just faculty at SUNY University in New York and just in his travels as a professor,

35
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,810
a faculty member at different campuses and things like that,

36
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:09,610
he wanted to start observing or asking students and faculty about their teaching experiences and what they found from what he found from students.

37
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,530
You know, some of the main themes that came up was that they needed more engagement.

38
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:21,210
There's a lack of engagement in terms of learning, and they wanted more transparency.

39
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,880
Right. This concept of transparency coming up over and over again.

40
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,430
They want to know why they're learning, what they're learning and why they're doing things they're doing.

41
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:41,010
And faculty, basically what came up was they're you know, they're not rewarded for excellent teaching.

42
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,150
So if they don't get rewarded for it, you know what's why prioritize that.

43
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:58,920
And so this is sort of the overarching question in terms of the sort of feel the sort of the

44
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:04,350
framework for it is how do we improve the quality of teaching and if faculty are not rewarded?

45
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,100
And so sort of in other terms or like switching that, you know,

46
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:16,890
if we challenged the priorities around teaching and we could eventually lead it to improvements of teaching practices,

47
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,740
and that trickles down to learning outcomes and student satisfaction overall.

48
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:37,309
Okay. So so this sort of led to the field of solo and led to movements in actually changing the reward system for teaching.

49
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:49,010
And so it is really valuable value. Now in terms of your merit, you know, your yearly reviews of the promotion, you know,

50
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:55,879
being innovative in the classroom and trying new things is actually is actually seen

51
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,960
as a very good thing in terms of when you're looking at your overall portfolio.

52
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,590
Okay. And so there are official definitions of soda.

53
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,200
And this is just one I think it comes from the American Association of Higher Education.

54
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:23,159
But if you look at it, it's really just like any other field of research, right?

55
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,250
You have to identify an issue, a problem, a gap.

56
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:33,750
You have to develop an intervention and you have to measure the success of the intervention.

57
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:39,959
And then also to make it actual scholarship.

58
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,900
Right. It has to go through a peer review process. Okay.

59
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:54,760
So being in graduate school, I just want to ask you guys, you know, what is the importance of the peer review process?

60
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,190
You guys have actually all done it sort of informally, all done peer evaluation in class.

61
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:05,800
But thinking beyond that, thinking in research. You know, what is what's the importance?

62
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,320
Of that stuff. Yep.

63
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,760
Irish and learn from each other.

64
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,250
I see this whole different. Do you want me to catch?

65
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,599
But I missed. Absolutely. So learning. Learning from each other.

66
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,920
Learning from other experts or your peers. Peer review. Right in the field.

67
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,670
You're one person, even if you're working with 1 to 3 other people, right?

68
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:43,580
You're in your own mindset. So broadening the perspectives and learning what you might have missed and what you could do better.

69
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:55,400
Anything else? Sure.

70
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:05,960
I would like to. Our team usually like to him and talking about Rubin's dreams from places that I've never heard before.

71
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,760
Synergy is really it. Making the project more fun too.

72
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:17,930
Yes. I'm not sure that happens much in peer review.

73
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,590
Usually it makes you more tense, but I can see.

74
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:28,580
Yeah. In terms of helping each other out. In more of an informal sense, it can be more fun.

75
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:36,770
More connection? No, I can add to sort of the the, you know, development or innovation of something,

76
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:42,740
but that you have to sort of, you know, peer review is usually blinded and no more.

77
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,130
Yeah. Versus like working. Collaborating together. I see.

78
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:54,590
So just in terms of this, just to add on to this, right, it sort of it makes a legit field of research.

79
00:08:54,590 --> 00:09:05,200
Right. Giving faculty credibility for having some more scholarship in their in their work also.

80
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,250
Right. It's something you can. You can publish this for.

81
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,170
There's so many values in terms of publishing and presenting.

82
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:20,960
And, you know, faculty instructors, having these publications or presentations is always a very good thing.

83
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,459
And it can help faculty feel motivated to do to do more work.

84
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:36,860
Again, it sort of goes with like you're sort of adding to your portfolio and sort of the scope of of what you can do and be more evidence based.

85
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:45,770
And so at least your mind just put it, you know, comes from private to community properties to help others learn in terms of teaching.

86
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,520
Okay. So I really like this figure.

87
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,010
So scholarly teaching, right?

88
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:05,819
This is sort of like you understand what sort of the best practices are read about and learn about and then practice of teaching,

89
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:12,360
right is actually like implementing those through course developments and things like that.

90
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,319
Curricular design sharing about teaching can be more informal.

91
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:28,710
It's what typically happens in informal settings like hallway talks, you know, discussions, just talking to different, different instructors.

92
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:36,660
And often times syllabi are available, you know, for others to view like on the faculty website or things like that.

93
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:41,700
And then scholarship of teaching and learning is where you sort of bring it up a level in

94
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,520
terms of where you're actually innovating in the field and sharing it to a broader audience.

95
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:55,740
And so that's where we would see like the peer evaluation, our peer peer review come into place and things like that.

96
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,830
We'll talk more about this. So just like this, this broad question, right?

97
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:08,670
Scholarship of learning and teaching as a students, why is this field needed?

98
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:32,390
It is maybe someone who just one way, and that's not necessarily the best everybody has.

99
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:40,720
A teacher of an ability that brought in broaden the way that they're providing information so people could learn better.

100
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:48,640
Yeah, absolutely. There's there's really simple ways to move from sort of passive learning to more active, engaged learning.

101
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:55,570
And so really in general should be applicable to many types of classrooms.

102
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,960
I think it's just important to.

103
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,400
This can potentially make or break a student's trajectory.

104
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:23,020
They come in school. They may be passionate about it, but in the learning environment, it's just not.

105
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:31,720
And then to some, perhaps they could potentially be a star.

106
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:38,040
Because of the lack. Emphasis on teaching and mentoring.

107
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,240
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

108
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,640
Student support and how to support each and every student.

109
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,930
Really? The outcome is the outcome of the student. Right.

110
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,990
So having those those types of environment and understanding what is effective and what is not.

111
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,950
Yeah. Like a unified teacher, like effectively teach the class or any of this.

112
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,130
He also allows them to make those improvements that otherwise may not have been made.

113
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,540
And it may not make a huge difference from. Start to finish, but.

114
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,059
Any improvement is better. Yeah, no, I really like that.

115
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:24,640
And actually it'll go off of, I think, what we talk about next. There's always room for improvement, though, right?

116
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:35,410
Even if things are working well, reflecting back and doing some evaluation is always important, especially in this day and age.

117
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:41,620
In terms of higher ed education in general, things are just that are changing so fast and we need to keep up.

118
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:50,350
Thank you guys for your thoughts on that. This is a survey.

119
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,650
Survey results from a survey held by Castle Castle.

120
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:09,969
And basically the respondents were instructors who have engaged in so and so, just some random questions in terms of how it affected their teaching.

121
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,690
So other teachers at my institution have been influenced by my work.

122
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:22,540
So if you're trying something new or innovative or even just taking time to evaluate students,

123
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:28,929
other instructors see that and they will want to come to you and ask you about it.

124
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:36,610
And it gives actually gives them more confidence to try new things, pivot a little bit in their teaching.

125
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:44,040
Our students have achieved higher standards, changed course design and involvement with Soto.

126
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,730
I think that's a given. And then adding to the excitement of teaching, right.

127
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:53,830
So even if you sort of been teaching for a while and it's effective trying.

128
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,600
Soto or incorporating it can really make it can make it more fun.

129
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:04,990
Great teaching is hard. So when you can make it exciting, all the better.

130
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:16,870
Okay. And just, you know, again, just like any other other sort of field, you just want to start by identifying an issue,

131
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:23,050
a gap, and stating this in terms of a research question that you're going to strive to answer.

132
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:29,660
And these are really general examples, but they're really legit, right?

133
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:37,450
So the questions that instructors have, right, our students accomplishing the intended goals of the course.

134
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,800
Does a certain teaching method result in critical thinking skills?

135
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:47,500
Right. Again, they're very simple, but these are things we need to ask when we are teaching.

136
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:56,710
And this is just an example that was implemented in the School of Dentistry.

137
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:05,240
A few years ago. And this in this example, what they wanted to do.

138
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,709
What they did actually was incorporate a couple of things that we've been talking about.

139
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:12,910
So active learning technique and Bloom's taxonomy.

140
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,880
So those different cognitive levels of learning.

141
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:31,000
And so basically what happened was in this in this a year, the experimental year, students were asked to generate the exam questions.

142
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:31,740
Right.

143
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:47,049
And so the control then what were the multiple choice questions for the exam that the instructors had developed previous years and so blinded scores.

144
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,290
I was actually one of the blended scores came in.

145
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:55,990
We were trained, but we came in and we scored the exam questions according to Bloom's taxonomy,

146
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:02,140
right from the lowest cognitive level like recall to the more applied levels.

147
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:10,270
And so we just wanted to compare, you know, the cognitive levels of these student generated exam questions versus instructor.

148
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:15,390
And so basically what we found was students and this is what we hypothesize students

149
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:21,100
about higher cognitive level questions and there were some incentives around this,

150
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:26,050
right? Like they they were trained on, you know, superbloom taxonomy and what that means.

151
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,850
They were actually given extra credit for the higher cognitive level questions they created.

152
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:39,730
But what also came along here was that they actually scored better on their exams overall,

153
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:46,839
you know, controlling for the ones that they they developed, but they they scored better.

154
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:56,200
So in the process of developing these questions, they were able to critically think and write about the material more so than

155
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,670
in previous years when they were just taking the instructor generated exam.

156
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:05,020
Okay. So this is just one example.

157
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:11,139
These are these are different categories of work.

158
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,340
I'm just going to run through them.

159
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:21,640
When you get into your in-class work on this, I do ask the question to come back and say what type of category this is.

160
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,030
So just just come back to this slide.

161
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:34,060
But general thoughts on class. So this is just looking at things like evaluations of quantitative scores, open ended questions as well.

162
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:39,910
You know, how you know, how do students like certain aspects of the course?

163
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:46,869
Number two is more anecdotal. So reflections on several years of teaching experience.

164
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:54,879
Of course, this can be important, especially thinking of how we sort of disseminate our work through different venues now,

165
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:05,709
like blogs and things like that. To also associate it with some sort of evidence based literature helps these things.

166
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:13,460
But this can also be useful when we're thinking of things like commentaries and things like that, when we're sort of calling for action on,

167
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:22,330
you know, some sort of teaching practice or something like that, comparisons of courses and students across time.

168
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,260
So this is this is probably the most ideal and what you will see the most.

169
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:34,450
So this is this is just when maybe you're trying something new, you can compare it to a previous year.

170
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:40,810
You just want to see changes from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, things like that.

171
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:46,930
Say there's two different sections, two different classes, implement different teaching practices,

172
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:50,920
you know, what are the comparisons of the outcomes like that?

173
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,950
And then synthesis of current work. So this is systematic reviews.

174
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:09,100
There'll be reviews, whatever, whatever is needed to sort of find where gaps are in the literature on certain aspects of teaching the market.

175
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:12,960
Okay.

176
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:20,990
And then the last category, which we won't get into, but this is more of like, you know, what is actually happening in the brain, like brain scans.

177
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,580
This is more psychology based. There's a lot out there on that.

178
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:34,640
Okay. And I know we're all different levels in terms of research, but just in terms of quantitative and qualitative data,

179
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,829
thinking of different things that we could use, mixed methods is big.

180
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:44,570
And so it all really important having some quantitative aspect and qualitative aspect.

181
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:49,640
I'm trying to triangulate the two together. You know what? How do they align to each other?

182
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:55,420
They're just different examples. Hey.

183
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:59,620
And then there are so many ways to disseminate this type of data these days.

184
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,530
In typical manuscripts, different types of presentations,

185
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:15,880
different societies in different fields all have like a special interest group that is education focused and then more informal or internal rounds,

186
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:25,280
faculty meetings, you know, doing talking about different teaching practices or something you do learning communities.

187
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:32,350
I was just in over the summer, I was in a anti-racist pedagogy, learning community.

188
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,250
We met twice a month. It was great.

189
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:44,740
Those are really popular and they're really effective. More distribution, a little more broadly, like across the school.

190
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,250
Problems meeting some more internal dissemination.

191
00:21:51,050 --> 00:22:00,440
And then I just want to again point out, when I didn't look at the campus page, that's going to double check.

192
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:11,810
I do actually have an updated list of pedagogy journals and I posted it's a it's a link to a website, so I'll post that.

193
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,610
But like every field has a education focused journal.

194
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:24,469
Public health unfortunately only has one, and it is supersaturated, but it's called pedagogy and health promotion.

195
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:32,660
The editor is in public health and her focus really is public health, health science focused.

196
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:39,920
But like nursing has so many education journals in medicine and then the other health sciences as well.

197
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:46,580
Yeah, yeah. I think I already mentioned the different societies have different special interest groups.

198
00:22:47,310 --> 00:23:00,260
Oh, and I know we're all familiar mostly with like Mad, but Eric is a database that has a lot of education, compiles articles from education journals.

199
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:08,080
Okay. Any questions? I've been talking to the one. I haven't seen you question.

200
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:25,190
So is it. Do you believe that he's informed? Concept?

201
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:30,800
Yes. Do you mean the presentation for next week? Yes.

202
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:35,510
We'll get to that right now. But yes, definitely.

203
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:45,830
You can look into the literature. It's actually not really a necessity for or a requirement for this,

204
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:54,140
but it would definitely help just to read one or two articles that are solely sort of focused.

205
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,760
But let's let's actually just jump into this now.

206
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:08,030
So next week, you guys are going to be doing your first oral presentation and you're basically going to let me pass those.

207
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,570
You're going to you can either work by yourself or you can work in up here.

208
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:26,300
Okay. It's up to you guys. But I just might give you that option for this first this first go around in terms of presenting and doing this case study.

209
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,120
So on the top of that page,

210
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:47,270
and this is what you're going to do today or right now for the next like 15 minutes or so is just for a few some of those potential scenarios.

211
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:55,310
And I want you to pick one of them, or you can come up with your own scenario.

212
00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:00,590
It doesn't matter. I like to look positive. I don't care if you come up with your answer, choose one of those,

213
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:12,040
and then you are basically going to going to just work through a series of questions that I have right below them.

214
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:18,920
And this work is going to help you prepare as mainly the requirements for the presentation next week.

215
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:23,890
These are the guidelines. But just coming up with a research question, you know,

216
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:32,480
why why are you doing this project trying to come up with some methods and then why the findings from a project like this would be significant?

217
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:39,680
It's a really short presentation. 5 minutes. I'm really strict on the five minute rule.

218
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:47,630
I want you to be able to synthesize and share this information briefly and concisely,

219
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:52,700
and then if you are working with a partner just for 50% of the product.

220
00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:02,410
Okay. Any questions on this? Okay.

221
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:06,750
I want to give you guys some time just to start generating thoughts around this,

222
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:14,580
probably actually make some headway in just like 15 minutes or so and just let me know if you have any questions.

223
00:26:25,380 --> 00:27:03,180
And again, remember, if you want to work with a partner. Researchers.

224
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:41,120
And. That's.

225
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:54,180
Based on. That's.

226
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:36,930
Yeah. So perhaps.

227
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:47,450
So she said that she was. Is.

228
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,370
This. Developing news this. Here are.

229
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,060
Increases the potential. So of course.

230
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:10,810
But that. So you can imagine how this.

231
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,710
Questions, but it seems that the question is serious.

232
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:25,440
So there's still so there's still a question.

233
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:36,870
So I'm doing this. And then developing the mechanism which.

234
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:50,420
You know these students. Yeah.

235
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,700
So there's some sort. Well, I'm sure.

236
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:02,950
What's that mean? I just keep you posted to Kentucky.

237
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:08,800
Oh, yeah. Okay, so the categorized question is really not that important to me.

238
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,790
I should probably just take it off the assignment. But these are the categories.

239
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:16,300
Again, most of you are probably do one or three.

240
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:32,450
I would just cross that bridge now. Okay. Don't worry about. Okay.

241
00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:02,620
First. Yeah.

242
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:10,979
Yeah. It's not required, but I think having some sort of slides would be useful.

243
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:26,950
Just had a reference. So I said to.

244
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:36,300
The system is designed to measure how.

245
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:46,010
Me. Just one piece of.

246
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:58,350
But. This plan is.

247
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,680
Yeah. Especially something.

248
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:17,870
Yeah. Right.

249
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:31,130
It's. Okay.

250
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:42,920
Okay. The.

251
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:56,030
I had. Just an alternative solution.

252
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:15,460
Okay. In January.

253
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:26,730
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

254
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:36,500
Well, that particular issue, which we just talked about.

255
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:48,110
So I. Yeah.

256
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:56,420
Also. Just.

257
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:21,600
So I just. And you sort of go, I have 300 channels and.

258
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:41,390
Also. Yes.

259
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,450
So. Yes.

260
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:52,150
She has a certain way to go about it.

261
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:57,540
Yes. One.

262
00:37:22,310 --> 00:38:33,360
Just. Shoot.

263
00:38:51,440 --> 00:39:12,230
Just. Yes.

264
00:39:55,630 --> 00:40:11,460
No. That's something.

265
00:40:55,720 --> 00:44:38,130
Yeah. All right, everyone.

266
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,200
Any any general questions before we move on?

267
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:53,100
Yeah. Um, and how would you disseminate the results of that?

268
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:58,360
What Avenue Lynch used. Is that this information?

269
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:06,570
Yeah. Yeah. So, like, would you want to try to present it at a conference, like a poster presentation?

270
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:11,500
Do you just want to share it with colleagues at, like, the meeting? Do you want to publish it?

271
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:17,470
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. All right.

272
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:26,390
Yep. So next week we'll start off and we'll just run through the presentations and that'll be the bulk of next week.

273
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:34,780
Then we'll also talk about this at the end, but next week we'll also spend just a little bit of time talking about work life balance.

274
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:41,020
It's just like a meant to be like a conversation. Always important to think about, especially in teaching.

275
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,940
But these presentations will be the. Okay.

276
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:51,850
So I want to end today and just talk a little bit about teaching demonstrations and then give you

277
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:57,730
guys a little bit of time to just look over the draft of the syllabus you have created thus far.

278
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:06,880
And within this schedule sessions that you've you've mapped out what session might be the one you want to

279
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,650
choose for your teaching demonstration at the end of the semester and start planning it out a little bit.

280
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:19,210
First, I want to talk about them. I might have asked this already, but has anyone done a teaching demonstration for like an interview or.

281
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:27,850
Yes, I have. You have failed miserably for like an interview or interview and then mean I lost a contract.

282
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:35,980
Okay, well, you learn from it, and then I'll be myself, but have to be who they want me to be.

283
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:37,480
That will be difficult for me.

284
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:46,750
And I know all the people, competitors that got the contract, they were just speaking to feed to their needs like they were looking at history,

285
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:50,620
but I was just doing my thing, you know, appreciate is doing my thing famous.

286
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:57,570
All right. Well, it's a different set of patterns.

287
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:03,069
Okay. All right. So I. I just want to put this up here.

288
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:11,800
This is looking at different for those of you who know different is higher ed institutes are categorized in different ways.

289
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:17,710
Bachelor focus is more like liberal arts colleges, community colleges.

290
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:26,829
And then we get just in terms basically of like research funds that faculty can bring in to the university as master's,

291
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:29,320
doctoral intensive, doctoral, extensive.

292
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:39,430
And so University of Michigan is more of the, you know, a lot of research funds really focused on or doctoral extensive, also known as an R one.

293
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:49,870
You might have heard that term. But in terms of interviewing, thinking about bringing in faculty in the hiring process and what they're focused on,

294
00:47:50,290 --> 00:48:01,749
you can see teaching ability is really highly valued across all, of course, more so at a bachelor's focus and then potential as a researcher.

295
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:04,540
Right. We see sort of that balance shift.

296
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:15,610
But I do have to say, I sat through enough research, talks and discussion with faculty in terms of hiring process, even our research stuff,

297
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:25,810
we're really trying to infer teaching skills through that in case, you know, a teaching demonstration is not required during that process.

298
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:35,950
So that is a that is a place where faculty interviewers are just observers and in terms of the hiring process, are looking for teaching skills.

299
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:46,990
Okay. So just thinking about an interview for a teaching position, how might teaching be assessed during an interview process?

300
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:56,180
Yeah. Like clarity. Clarity?

301
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,980
Yes. I guess maybe I should reframe the question.

302
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,670
How how are different?

303
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:09,730
What are different? Like products or methods?

304
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,850
How are they? How is teaching assessed in an interview?

305
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:17,710
30 is definitely part of it though, in terms of those actions.

306
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:24,540
Lindsay. How much engagement ring between the two? Yes.

307
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:27,850
So I guess the question is not coming across. Right.

308
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:32,590
That is also another aspect that you would be looking for.

309
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:41,530
But so in what ways could an interview, a candidate demonstrate their teaching abilities?

310
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:51,840
Different products, activities that they might have to engage in to engage in.

311
00:49:52,710 --> 00:50:00,870
This is not a trick question here. Are they prepared with a presentation that they can show?

312
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:05,550
A presentation that has sections that. The teacher is talking and.

313
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:22,120
Sections that it's asking students to answer some questions so that it's that interactive between the two that is.

314
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:27,150
Yeah. So in what, let's just say your resumé or CV.

315
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,610
Yeah. I'm just trying to think of like solid products.

316
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:35,740
So through a resumé, a CV, you can display your teaching activities.

317
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:43,060
I don't want to dismiss what you're saying, but I just want to see if someone can like click add to it.

318
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:49,180
Yes. About like teaching valuation. Yeah, absolutely.

319
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:52,899
Teaching evaluations. You can bring in examples of that.

320
00:50:52,900 --> 00:51:01,630
Some people now even on their severe well put like little bar graphs and each year of their teaching evaluations,

321
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:09,729
if it's something nice to display, like if there's growth or something like that when they teach you for teaching philosophy.

322
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:13,600
Absolutely. I'm describing in teaching practices through that.

323
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:31,259
Okay. Sorry, I just couldn't ask the question in the right way, but we got there and just know what you were saying,

324
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:36,330
I think could be displayed in a teaching demonstration, right? Like what we're talking about today.

325
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:43,079
Or like a teaching portfolio? Yeah, it's an E portfolio.

326
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:48,719
You could put an example of a of a recorded lecture, for example,

327
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:56,520
and that could demonstrate how you teach, but also active portions of your lecture and things.

328
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:03,120
We've already talked about evaluations, philosophies and from the if you're only doing a research talk,

329
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:07,680
trying to bring in some of your teaching abilities there.

330
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:12,420
But what we're focusing on is the teaching demonstration.

331
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:19,820
Right. And so the teaching demonstration,

332
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:27,920
there is not one single format and it can vary across institutions and units and just what they're trying to get out of you.

333
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:35,930
On this slide, I have sort of like the assessors or the observers, different types.

334
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:43,610
So you could be asked to just come in and teach a class so the existing class and you just have to come in and teach a session.

335
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:50,720
And beyond the students that take the step could be faculty observers sort of sprinkled throughout.

336
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:54,950
It could just be given a presentation time.

337
00:52:54,950 --> 00:53:00,859
And you you do the teaching demonstration to a group of students and faculty sort of a mix,

338
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:04,550
or it could just be faculty who are sort of acting as students.

339
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:13,400
Then the topic varies as well. So you might be given a topic or you might have to come up with your own.

340
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:19,220
It really does vary. Okay.

341
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:23,990
Another reflective question here.

342
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:35,780
How could you present or teach an outstanding demonstration versus just the adequate teaching demonstration?

343
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:46,600
I guess when preparing things outside of just. Slides.

344
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:51,030
Prepare an activity to hand to your interviewers?

345
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:55,000
Absolutely. Including active learning.

346
00:53:55,300 --> 00:54:02,620
And now we're doing it. But one simple one or two simple active learning activities.

347
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:24,990
Right. For the audience to engage in. Okay.

348
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:35,050
We'll talk through more. But just like simple things, being prepared, staying on time, demonstrating your knowledge of the subjects,

349
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:48,100
being able to pivot right if you are engaging in an activity or there's welcome some discussion, being able to being able to keep on top of that.

350
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:55,750
Right, having goals and making sure your activities are aligned to your goals that session.

351
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:08,829
Okay. And so these are five things I'm just going to talk through with you guys, just in terms of the teaching,

352
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:15,970
the demonstration, things to think about as we move forward with this versus the situational factors.

353
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:23,770
So these are things that are pretty much out of your control, but you have to consider in terms of making it successful.

354
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:35,620
So again, just thinking about your audience, if they're students thinking about jargon and things like that, for example, how many students, right?

355
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:41,410
How many people are going to be in the audience that can dictate what you want to do successfully or effectively?

356
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,629
And the education level. Right.

357
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:49,480
You don't want to if you have to choose your topic, you don't want to come in with something that's too advanced for an undergraduate audience.

358
00:55:51,370 --> 00:55:56,319
Even though it might seem really, you know, excellent.

359
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:03,550
But you just need to keep that in mind. The time is so important when you are in this interview process.

360
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,810
Following the directions is just so important.

361
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:14,710
It shows your organizational skills, your ability to follow directions, respectful of people's time.

362
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:19,570
It's like that. And then the room set up.

363
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:24,609
So things like technology and your activity that you want to do involves technology.

364
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:30,790
You have to be aware of that thinking about group work.

365
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:38,860
Right. If you're in an auditorium style seating, it's going to be hard to get up and form a group or things like that.

366
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,390
And I will say this a little bit.

367
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:55,719
But as you are preparing for something like this, if any of you are going to apply for teaching positions or faculty positions,

368
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:03,820
whatever they are, before you have to go into the in-person interview, you can ask as many questions as you need.

369
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:11,620
You can ask, What is my room going to be like? Can I go see the room and just be in it for five or 10 minutes beforehand?

370
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:22,299
If you or if you have if you are given a topic, as you know, is there a syllabus of someone who's taught this topic before?

371
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:27,430
Can I look at it? So just like, do not be afraid to ask questions.

372
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:37,330
Okay. What do you want the students to learn? So again, the topic, whether it's pre assigned to you or you are given it,

373
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:45,070
you really have to think through like what are your what are the objectives of this and thinking of backwards design, right?

374
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:52,330
And during the presentation right away, you can say, you know, this is what I want your chair to achieve by the end of this session.

375
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,680
This is what we're going to do during this session, and this is why we're going to do it.

376
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:04,120
And, you know, just keeping keeping them on task can be really effective and really important.

377
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:12,690
This is where, you know, show. Show your engagement with the audience, with the students.

378
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:19,560
Incorporate one really effective, concise learning activity.

379
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:24,900
Don't spend too much time on it, but get the audience engaged.

380
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:29,190
Right. And just make sure they align with the situational factors,

381
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:34,380
the learning goals of that session, and being able to tie it back to your teaching philosophy.

382
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:39,839
Maybe you presented an example of a learning activity that you really value in your teaching philosophy.

383
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:49,470
This is the time to use it, to do it. This kind of goes with number three.

384
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:55,740
The activity can really you can build in an assessment and can be through that learning activity.

385
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:00,390
But just showing that you're considering the student outcomes.

386
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:05,000
Student learning in always allow time.

387
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:13,980
You may just feel like you have to get through it, but every few minutes stop and ask, you know, does anyone have any questions?

388
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:23,240
And a lot of time at the end for questions. Okay.

389
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:28,370
Yep. And then just being prepared, right? Making sure you're really comfortable with what you're presenting.

390
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:41,030
Plan for the positive. Understanding your audience. Anybody want to share what they do to prepare for any sort of oral presentation?

391
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:45,260
Teaching public. Speaking of any sort. Any tips?

392
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,610
In front of my own mates. Anyone who would listen.

393
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:58,280
Yeah, I think that's great. Yeah. Practicing it out loud to someone else.

394
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,940
Phrases so helpful versus practicing that in your head.

395
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:05,930
And then they can also just give you some informal feedback as well.

396
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:12,770
Was it when I was a PhD student and we had this really great cohort and we were so dedicated to each other

397
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:19,460
going to I probably heard their presentations because you can get the same spiel over and over again.

398
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:25,730
Probably heard them at least like five times, but it was so nice to have that group to be able to be there.

399
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:30,200
Get out of your comfort zone and. And feel like you're prepared.

400
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:36,170
Anything else? Mm hmm.

401
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,440
I do a recording myself. Yeah.

402
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:44,540
After what I was, she said to practice and how to do recording.

403
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:52,100
And so I do, uh, you know, I have to period at the moment as you're making fun of me.

404
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:56,520
No, that's great. Yes, recording is very good.

405
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:00,350
Sometimes every once in a while, I guess more in the zoom days,

406
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:08,089
I would just I would just look at everything while I watch one of my teacher, you know, and be like, you know, just just see what I do.

407
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:11,749
But I say a lot. It's just it's something I always have to work on.

408
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:15,800
And some days I go into class and I'm like, okay, in my head, I'm not going to say.

409
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:21,200
And that helps, but it kind of comes back. It's just a it's a habit.

410
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,480
So what else other?

411
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:39,420
Okay. I think, you know, that's those are typical things.

412
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:48,960
I think just just, you know, especially for something like this, doing it out loud at least three times.

413
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:55,140
Right. Is sort of that magic number in terms of feeling really prepared and comfortable.

414
01:01:57,590 --> 01:02:03,250
All right. So if you you know, you really want to go into teaching and you're a graduate student,

415
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:10,790
there's things you can do to practice, obviously, beyond like GSI positions or teaching assistant positions.

416
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:14,420
You can ask if you're a faculty member you're comfortable with,

417
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:19,820
ask them to give a lecture in one of their classes if it's a topic you feel comfortable on.

418
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:25,190
I, I guarantee you they, they're going to be more open to it than anything.

419
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:28,900
Right. I actually did that when I was a Ph.D. student.

420
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:32,240
I think I gave guest lectures into in two classes.

421
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:39,559
And all I did was ask, how can I do this for practice areas of this?

422
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:43,460
But during the interview process, just ask questions. They're humans just like you.

423
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:46,850
They would want to know, you know, if they were in your position.

424
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:53,780
They if you are asked to come to an in-person interview and give a teaching demonstration, they want you just as much as you want that position.

425
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:57,320
So they're just waiting out, you know, top candidates at that point.

426
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:03,260
So they will be more than happy to oblige to questions that you were asking.

427
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:10,080
Okay. Any question?

428
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:25,270
Just trying to think if I missed anything. All right, so this is time again.

429
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:33,260
I'll probably just check in in like 15 minutes or so, but just some dedicated time to look at the draft of the syllabus.

430
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:39,850
That you have. And I just have some guiding questions here.

431
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:48,340
I have an example of the first day of class in this class, the agenda that I wrote out, just for an example.

432
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:54,880
And just some time to go through some of these guiding questions and start thinking about your teaching demonstration.

433
01:03:54,910 --> 01:04:00,760
I know we're you know, it's towards the end of the class, but it's always good to start thinking about these things.

434
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:13,890
Especially as we start to flesh out. Good morning. So just let me know if you have questions.

435
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:40,280
I'll check in. Yeah, I'm like 15 minutes. Oh, I'm sorry.

436
01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:24,610
You know, people ask this question, is it working somebody?

437
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:32,960
In the same piece. 12 to 14 minutes of the lecture.

438
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:37,970
I thought. Okay.

439
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:59,550
It could be. Could just.

440
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:04,510
Oh, you want to with.

441
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:13,390
This is quite old. Yeah. You know, just thought about know, but I think.

442
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:17,930
Okay. Yeah. Mm hmm.

443
01:09:18,540 --> 01:22:27,170
Okay. Yeah. Okay, everyone.

444
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:35,090
This is all I have for you guys today. So I just wanna ask you, do you guys have any questions before we part ways?

445
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:49,220
Just let me know if you do before next week. So next week again, we'll focus on the presentations and then just have a short discussion on work.

446
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:57,280
Nice time to reflect and talk about it. Thank you, Bill.
