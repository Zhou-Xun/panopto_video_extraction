1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:06,010
All right. Good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:17,450
Okay. So just a few announcements at the top of your quiz that was due Sunday.

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,690
I just pushed it to be due Wednesday. So that quiz is now due Wednesday.

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:29,800
In case we don't get through everything today, I don't want to rush and just like throw a bunch of information at you.

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:36,340
So in case we need to wrap up that on Tuesday, then you have until Wednesday to do your quiz.

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,670
And then Tuesday we will be here in person.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,240
Thursday's lecture will be fully remote, so you don't need to show up here on Thursday.

8
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:54,159
The Zoom link is already in the canvas. Dr. Herr Stein will be joining us from Switzerland, where she currently lives,

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:02,170
talking about her professional and in her professional experiences working for the National Emergency Training Center and Pathogens.

10
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,080
And then she does some contract work with the W.H.O.,

11
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:12,340
and she and I still work heavily together on the infectious disease mitigation and management stuff.

12
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,750
So I think that should be a pretty cool guest lecture. I think that's all the announcements I have for now.

13
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:30,370
And then after your quiz for your your the topic for your commentary is do so now I hope you start to think about that.

14
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,600
Okay. Did I turn okay. I did it and I looked at it.

15
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:47,320
All right. So to pick up where we left off on Tuesday, we this week, we started getting more into, you know,

16
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:55,239
what you can do in terms of implementing protections for yourself and in the event that you're in an emergency

17
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:01,540
situation or that you're providing emergency response or even some education and guidance for others.

18
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:12,580
So with vaccines and vaccine preventable diseases, I just want to recall that these are the readily available vaccines that are out there.

19
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,530
Chicken pox, diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough are all one shot.

20
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:30,970
Usually that's DTaP or it's Tdap. If you're a child, MMR, polio, have A and B, tetanus, rabies, HPV, meningitis, shingles, seasonal flu, COVID.

21
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:37,000
And then if you go abroad, depending on where you go abroad, you might get cholera, yellow fever or typhoid.

22
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,750
We've talked before about the cost effectiveness of vaccines, for example.

23
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:51,430
You know, there was that kid who got tetanus a couple of years ago and his mom was anti-vax.

24
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:59,530
So he ended up requiring several weeks of hospital treatment that ended up costing nearly $800,000.

25
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:08,980
And just because his mom opted out of him getting the shot, which would have probably been like, you know, 50 bucks or something like that.

26
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,930
So just a brief history of vaccines, the beginnings.

27
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:22,840
There is a really cool website that is like I think if you Google like history of vaccines, it's very interactive,

28
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,090
which is where I got some of this information from and it's much more detailed from this than this.

29
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,350
But I wanted to hit you with the highlights.

30
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:41,860
So in the year 900, they already began identifying measles and smallpox as two separate diseases,

31
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:49,659
which is quite interesting because both are kind of demarcated with red marks on your body or a characteristic rash,

32
00:03:49,660 --> 00:04:00,010
but they were getting to start distinguishing with you. And then in the year 1000, you have again essentially early inoculation practices in China.

33
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:11,710
So even before the nine hundreds, we're talking like very ancient geographically what we consider today, the Middle East and then South Asia.

34
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:22,300
You had folks essentially kind of piecing together in a very rudimentary, you know, this is how pathology works kind of way,

35
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:31,930
realizing that if a person got a disease and then they didn't die from it, if they got sick from it again, they didn't get as sick as before.

36
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,650
So they started doing things like ether.

37
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:43,120
So if a person just they had smallpox and they recovered from smallpox and then they might become infected again,

38
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:53,830
they would take that person's scabs, peel the scab off and then crush it into a fine powder, and then people would inhale it.

39
00:04:53,830 --> 00:05:01,270
Other people who weren't immune when inhale it in order to essentially like dose themselves with immunity to it.

40
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,980
And then or they would like, you know, have like an open.

41
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:13,510
Wound or cut. And then you try to do like either indirect or direct contact with the pathogen that way.

42
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,280
I mean, that's like they weren't verbalizing that, but that's what they were practicing.

43
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:23,850
So an early 1000 in China, they started doing inoculation as well.

44
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:32,910
And by 1661, the royal is the dynasty's, they're ruling started to publicly support inoculation.

45
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:40,230
Then in 1684, there was an English doctor who attempted to treat smallpox.

46
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,650
This was not Jenner yet.

47
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,469
Jenner comes about 100 years later. And then Africa, they start using Variolation.

48
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,700
And then the same in Turkey. And then the say. And then in England.

49
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,760
They also begin using Variolation a couple of years later, which is a very rudimentary version of vaccines.

50
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:06,030
And then in 1757, they discovered the infectious nature of measles.

51
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:20,250
1770, they started to realize and then they started to realize that milkmaids essentially weren't getting infected by cowpox,

52
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:27,840
like other populations who weren't regularly working with cows just because of your constant contact, essentially with them.

53
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:36,900
And then in 1768, the whole royal family in Russia successfully inoculated themselves and started doing this publicly.

54
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:43,770
So then you kind of have like royal figures or political figures starting to advocate essentially for inoculation.

55
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:50,070
1776 What was going on in 1776.

56
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,000
In America. That's the revolution.

57
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,020
First time we see some bioterrorism where they start.

58
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,650
Well, also with indigenous populations.

59
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:13,640
But in specifically in a war, not as a genocide, which they also did, but they're starting to use smallpox as a weapon of war,

60
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:22,820
where they would send essentially infected blankets to opposing camps and then knock out their soldiers that way.

61
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,139
And then in 96, this is when we have Edward Jenner,

62
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:32,170
who creates a breakthrough for the smallpox vaccine after observing the milkmaids

63
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:37,580
and then testing out a very primitive version of the vaccine on a young boy.

64
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:46,940
Then, you know, here are some major breakthroughs in 1800 Waterhouse,

65
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:52,940
which is in Massachusetts, starts to encourage public vaccination in the United States.

66
00:07:53,180 --> 00:08:03,440
And in 1805, the state of Massachusetts made its first attempt at requiring the vaccine for all citizens, the smallpox vaccine.

67
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:10,940
Then in the U.K., we have military vaccination of smallpox by the 1850s.

68
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:18,380
Then John Snow has his breakthrough with cholera, the handle water pump situation.

69
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,790
I knew it was going to be Burnley. I love.

70
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:35,600
Oh, sorry. And then. Then, 1855, they finally passed a law, the first U.S. law mandating vaccines for children, specifically, not just adults.

71
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,600
By 1885, we have the rabies vaccine used in humans.

72
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:44,360
Yay! 79, we. Oh, sorry. 79.

73
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,260
We did a lab produced vaccine for pastoral a multi-site.

74
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:58,160
Then we had a landmark anthrax study where we realized that sheep and certain livestock carry anthrax naturally.

75
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,580
So this is our first attempt at making an attenuated virus.

76
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:10,790
So not necessarily a fully dead virus, but a weaker dose of it to essentially train the immune system to create those antibodies.

77
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:18,110
But then a year later, anti-vaccination arguments began to spread.

78
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:27,860
So you can see in very early U.S. newspapers in print, they have anti-vaccination leagues and like advertisements for meetings,

79
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:33,170
in particular for folks to, like, come together to discuss anti-vaccination.

80
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,620
And then we have the beginnings.

81
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:45,980
And then they've even, like, burned people's houses down, like scientists houses down during that time just because of the anti-vaccination arguments.

82
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,449
By 96, we get some typhoid. And then finally,

83
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:57,379
it's not until 1905 that the U.S. Supreme Court addresses vaccination and

84
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:03,890
allows states essentially to make up to their discretion certain vaccinations,

85
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:12,400
compulsory. We'll see how things go in the next few years with this Supreme Court.

86
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,580
So I just want to highlight a few vaccine preventable diseases.

87
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:23,889
So pertussis or whooping cough in particular, it's named because of the distinctive woop noise.

88
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,920
And it's not like, well, you know, like, look, there it is.

89
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:36,140
But it's like a I can't do it, but it's like a like a echoey, like chesty cough.

90
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:43,210
And your kids usually get whopping cough, but it's caused by the bacteria bordered dela pertussis.

91
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:52,750
Now, interestingly, I feel like I lived in Indiana, like when there is that hep C, HIV Coinfection outbreak, opioids, all these things.

92
00:10:53,170 --> 00:11:01,330
So I'm sitting at my desk in 2017, kind of like I'm nobody was a faculty member, but I was on my tenure track or anything.

93
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,630
And I got an email from this lady from the New York Times and because they kind of like,

94
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't know how they pick who they contact to get like pull quotes from.

95
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,400
But somehow she just contacted me and not like someone at Berkeley or Hopkins or whatever.

96
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:29,980
And she said, Would you be willing to talk to me to comment on that abnormal large whooping cough outbreak that is happening right now in Indiana?

97
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,550
I was super nervous and so I ended up doing the interview.

98
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:42,880
We talked for about half an hour. There's probably only like two sentences in the actual article.

99
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:50,710
But the reason for this outbreak that was happening in Indiana was not only low vaccine compliance of the initial,

100
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,040
but low vaccine compliance of the booster.

101
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:03,160
So with whooping cough in particular, the booster, based on the schedule that the CDC recommends you to get the Tdap booster.

102
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:16,060
Now, it shows that by the time you get the booster, the efficacy of, you know, your immune response to that may only really be like 30 to 40% left.

103
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:24,640
So they are kind of you know, some of urologists were like, okay, so should people get the booster more frequently then due to waning efficacy?

104
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,900
Kind of like the same argument that's going now with the COVID boosters, right.

105
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:36,790
But generally, whooping cough is, you know, not super fatal.

106
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,989
Generally, if you do have like cold like symptoms.

107
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,889
And then this one here, though, is through the inhalation of droplets.

108
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:50,620
And it does have an attack rate of 70 to 100% for those who are susceptible.

109
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,310
So it can cause a chronic cough for an extended period of time.

110
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,809
Incubation period of 7 to 10 days in the range, 6 to 20.

111
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:03,040
But the infectious dose is unknown, but that is a really high attack rate.

112
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:15,850
Now, Kendra Gordon and Elden Ring studied pertussis in the 1930s, and they developed and ran the first large scale study in the U.S. for a vaccine.

113
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,340
And you can see here that chemists were manufacturing it in here in Detroit.

114
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,630
So now it's administered as a joint vaccine.

115
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:33,430
And worldwide, to this day, there's still about 24 million cases per year of pertussis,

116
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,540
160,000 deaths, mostly in, you know, areas with lower medical resources.

117
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:50,330
But the vaccine has resulted in a 96.6% reduction in cases, 99.7% reduction in deaths.

118
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,730
So you can see you're going from cases to deaths.

119
00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:03,370
So 1534 to 22 per million and then 38 30.8 to 0.09 deaths per million.

120
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,450
I would say this is a huge public health feat, right.

121
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:16,510
People are very not into vaccines these days. The next one I want to highlight is human papillomavirus or HPV.

122
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:24,550
This is the most common sexually transmitted infection and it can lead to cancer or genital warts,

123
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,170
and it's caused by a virus in the papillomavirus family.

124
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:37,690
Sometimes you may get general genital warts, but a lot of times a lot of folks are completely asymptomatic.

125
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:45,610
There's over 100 types of HPV, and 25 strains in particular are known to be human carcinogens.

126
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,380
Now, the tricky, sneaky with HPV is that HPV can be detected in women.

127
00:14:53,770 --> 00:15:03,070
But to this day, they don't have a diagnostic test that can test HPV presence in men, but men also carry HPV.

128
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,270
Now, with women in particular, if you have.

129
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,090
One of these strains of HPV that can lead to cancer, they tend to monitor that.

130
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:22,249
So, you know, I think now once you're 21, you get your, you know, gynecological exam every three years,

131
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:27,800
as recommended by the American Obstetrics and Gynecology Board, they do a pap smear.

132
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,850
And if they notice cells that seem to be of concerning strains, they will either, number one,

133
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:45,260
monitor that to see the next year to see if this if it has grown like the number of concerning strains and what count of cells has grown,

134
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,730
or if it's extra concerning, they'll do something called the colposcopy,

135
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:59,150
which is essentially taking a biopsy from your uterus, where they essentially snip the lining of your uterus out for biopsy.

136
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:08,540
I haven't got it done. Personally, I went with a friend who has a very high pain tolerance and I went to hold her hand while she had it done.

137
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:13,520
She cried. So that's super painful, like joys of being a woman.

138
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:21,950
But the mode of transmission in particular for this is it is transmitted through direct virus to cell contact.

139
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:29,270
So sometimes skin to skin sexual activity or prolonged exposure to contaminated clothing.

140
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:33,530
But vertical transmission, meaning mother to fetus, is very rare.

141
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:43,459
Now, in terms of the survivability for this, don't worry about things like using public restrooms or whatever toilet seats.

142
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,960
It is mostly through prolonged skin to skin or sexual contact.

143
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:55,160
But at the same time, you know, that's why for various reasons, like if you're trying on clothing like bathing suits or something like that,

144
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:02,630
you want you want to like either have like extra protection or, you know, wash all garments before you wear them.

145
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,489
The incubation period for this can be anywhere between three weeks to eight

146
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:13,969
months and warts if you even get them developed 2 to 3 months after infection.

147
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:20,240
But again, most cases will never show symptoms. And the infectious disease for this infectious dose is unknown.

148
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:31,249
Now, this vaccine was first developed in Australia at the University of Queensland and its final form came here to the

149
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:40,250
United States with the University of Rochester and National Cancer Institute by Frazier and Zhao FDA approved in 2006.

150
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:51,979
So the papillomavirus itself is a hollow like virus created from sorry, it's the vaccine itself is created from hollow virus like particles.

151
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:58,670
So it's mimicking essentially the code proteins of this recombinant HPV.

152
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,440
But this is been a highly controversial vaccine.

153
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:12,469
Yes. Because, you know, ideally boys and girls aged, you know, 11 and above, you have to you can get it.

154
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,620
It's three doses that are timed out.

155
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:21,830
Right. And they say, ideally, you get it before you're like 22, 23, 24.

156
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:26,990
I didn't get my three doses until I was 26, and that's perfectly okay.

157
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:34,730
But the arguments against HPV vaccine come from folks who think if people get the HPV vaccine,

158
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:42,120
it encourages sexual activity or sexual promiscuity and that like, yeah,

159
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:49,280
I don't know if you're just rubbing your eyes, Abby, or you're like, Oh my gosh. But yes, I mean, have you have you all heard this this rhetoric?

160
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:58,879
Yeah. So they're concerned that by giving these preventative measures, it's essentially giving like youth, like a carte blanche to,

161
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:09,290
like, go just have sexual activities rather than understanding the potential risk for cancers, in particular cervical cancer.

162
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,850
But, you know, if you have cervical cancer, you know, the female reproductive system is very, very complicated.

163
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:26,450
So that can lead to potential things like if you don't, but the HPV, if you have endometriosis, for example, could exacerbate those things.

164
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:37,640
And this preventative vaccine protects against the two strains of HPV that causes 70% of the cervical cancers worldwide.

165
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:43,790
So that's type 16 and 18. So from this time, the vaccine was rolled out.

166
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:59,540
It had declined from 52.7% of people who have Type 16 or 18 getting cervical cancer in 28 to 44.1% in 2014.

167
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:07,040
So, I mean, obviously not as a drastic drop as pertussis, but still a notable decrease.

168
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,650
And according to this study that Jim and Singh did, based on modeling,

169
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:18,640
if they lowered the age to the age of nine, four one, you could start getting the HPV vaccine series.

170
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:25,360
They estimated it could save an additional 1.2 to 1.8 million lives.

171
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:35,530
I did not concentrate in epidemiology, but a lot of my really good friends in my master's program did it at the University of Nebraska.

172
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:41,200
They had the CS program, which stands for Cancer Epidemiology,

173
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:49,930
something in special populations, but only a couple of universities have it as a partnership.

174
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:59,150
So essentially, like as their capstone, they went abroad to a cancer center in another country and then did their capstone there.

175
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:07,479
So three of my really good friends went to Tanzania that summer to the major capital, but then also to a rural area.

176
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:17,020
And there were two cancer centers where they're still dealing with paper records, essentially high rates of cervical cancer in Tanzania,

177
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:23,230
just because of the lack of access to care, a lack of access to gynecological services,

178
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,960
but also stigma around like getting pap smears and screenings and things like that.

179
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:39,219
So not only were they sorting through their files and then trying to estimate get a better picture of prevalence and incidence rates in particular,

180
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:47,080
but also trying to come up with working with the hospital staff to come up with preventative materials.

181
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:55,060
So not just a USPS problem. Now, what about vaccine hesitancy?

182
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:05,590
So this comes this quote from Dr. Maya Goldenberg says Vaccine hesitancy has less to do with

183
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:13,750
misunderstanding science and more to do with a general mistrust of scientific institutions and government.

184
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:24,760
And we see those who have been historically oppressed by institutions, whether they are real or they're perceived, are more likely to resist vaccines.

185
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:33,940
So this is a recurring historical and not just in the U.S., but globally around vaccine hesitancy.

186
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:43,660
So what are some of the themes that emerge? There is perceptions by critics that they cause more harm than the diseases they are intended to prevent.

187
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,650
So, for example, with the COVID vaccine, we heard a lot.

188
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:51,490
You don't know what's in it, right? You don't know what's in it.

189
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:55,840
What are the side effects five years from now? Ten years from now?

190
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:08,410
Right. I mean, also, do we know that for a lot of things, like what if I eat hot Cheetos every day and drink diet Mountain Dew, Diet Mountain Dew.

191
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:19,419
And I only cooked all my stuff on Teflon and then I have a bunch of air fresheners on my house, just phthalates everywhere.

192
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:27,760
Right? So there's this tendency to fixate on what harms we want to focus on.

193
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:35,590
Right. And then the closeness between the promotion of vaccines and the mandatory vaccine compliance.

194
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,940
How how from the time that you're, like doing your campaign,

195
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:45,850
that's like you should get vaccinated and the time of you have to get vaccinated

196
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:51,910
depending on how far you space those out that can affect has intensity as well.

197
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:57,670
People also have anxiety about unnatural substances in the body.

198
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,200
We talked earlier in the semester about like that raw water movement and people

199
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:09,430
are anti fluoride now and tie anything that is not natural from nature.

200
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,760
They're worried that vaccines may be used as government surveillance or weapons.

201
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,690
We heard the microchip argument for the COVID vaccine.

202
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:25,600
I was like, totally forgot about that. But the government's monitoring you anyway.

203
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:33,010
Hello, FBI agent. So, you know, people worry about personal liberty violations.

204
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,540
My my body, my choice depending on the circumstance.

205
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,470
Right? Parental autonomy. Some parents are like school districts.

206
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:50,649
The state should not be telling me how I should be like what health care or what medicine or what treatments my child is getting.

207
00:24:50,650 --> 00:25:00,850
That's totally up to me. There's also faith based objections and there's concerns about fertility, disability and again, or disease.

208
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,210
So for myself, I would say I had a friend, one of my best friend.

209
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:14,410
Actually, we stopped talking for about six months during the pandemic because she has an epidemiology.

210
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:24,820
Right. Works for a health care system. I do infectious disease mitigation and management and then all of a sudden became very anti-vax.

211
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:31,050
Her family's always been conservative. Right. But she moved to Montana and seemed to like back then,

212
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:40,389
and she was like texting things to the group tax where the rest of us were pretty pro-vaccination like so-and-so got the call,

213
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:43,760
her vaccine and now her period's messed up or like.

214
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:50,020
And she was pregnant at the time. Right? And this is a person who's had two open heart surgeries.

215
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,830
So already had cardiovascular issues.

216
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,250
So I would say they were like an elevated risk, did not want to get the vaccine, was pregnant,

217
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:06,909
ended up getting COVID the third trimester and then started just saying like texting

218
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:12,280
me like I so like our family friend is in the hospital because he had COVID like,

219
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,840
and now he has sepsis. Like, I don't even understand, like, how you had sepsis.

220
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,460
And I was like, well, it isn't just attack the lungs. This is like a body y thing.

221
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:31,510
And every time we'd have an interaction, like it was just like I was trying to present her with information and facts and some empathy,

222
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:36,430
and she just was finding like ways to put it down.

223
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:44,290
And I was already working on code response. Like at this point I was like working with the Michigan Department of Labor, with Governor Whitmer,

224
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:52,090
and like scoring the industries to like reopen the state and like telling people like don't spray bleach in your mouth or whatever.

225
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:57,790
So I was like exhausted. So I was like, I can't, I just have to, like, disengage right now.

226
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:01,930
This is too much for me. So we didn't talk for like six months.

227
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,260
She kind of called me out about it. We had a phone conversation. It's fine now.

228
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:14,379
But she said that she realizes at the time, like, she was very defensive because she did have a lot of people giving her their opinion about like,

229
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,680
you're pregnant, this is what you should do, this is what you shouldn't do.

230
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:24,070
She was very confused. Her brother, also anti-vax, was like, I don't know what you know, I'm putting in my body,

231
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:27,940
you know, like I smoke weed every day and like drinks, monsters, whatever.

232
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:37,809
And then she also thought when I was presenting her information because I was like, you know, I she knows I work here at the university.

233
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:43,420
I was like, I'm happy to like send you journal articles that you don't have access to from

234
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:48,760
like AMA on like specific studies on clinical trials with pregnant women,

235
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:54,040
if you like to read them. And then and then later when we were talking, she was like,

236
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:59,260
You don't get to act like you're better than me just because you have a Ph.D. And that is not what I was trying to do.

237
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:03,000
I feel like we're protecting a little bit, you, one of us, from therapy.

238
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:08,770
Okay. But, you know, it was a it was a challenging time.

239
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:15,100
I do feel for her in that the complicated situation that she was in.

240
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:20,980
But all of us were like, dude, like you are high risk, like you should be getting this vaccine.

241
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:30,340
But again, she did have concerns about fertility, birth outcomes, unnatural substances in the body.

242
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,540
Right. And studies have come up. Yes.

243
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,950
So I don't want to like. No, no, no, no, you're wrong.

244
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:44,890
On the previous slide, it says that like those who have historically been oppressed by institutions are the ones most likely to resist vaccines.

245
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:55,030
And I'm not sure if I agree with that because you one, you're talking about if you look at like newspaper articles from the 1800s.

246
00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:01,450
I don't think that if black people were like, well, we don't have to get this vaccine, it would be in the newspaper.

247
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,270
And then also, like you were talking about the raw water. Yes.

248
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:13,030
Like, I feel like a lot of the people were very vocal about like the anti-vax community are are not not people of color.

249
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:23,820
I just am wondering if there is anything to substantiate that claim because, yes, there's a lot of vaccine hesitancy among that community.

250
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:28,240
But I don't it's like they're the most likely to resist.

251
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:36,249
I sometimes I feel like a lot of especially in the United States, people are very much about like my body,

252
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:40,250
my choices, like personal autonomy and liberty or whatever might be more likely to.

253
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:46,870
So. Just curious if you have. Yes. This is just a poor quote from her.

254
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:52,899
But I do want to focus on I wouldn't say that. I mean, to some part there is truth of that.

255
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,400
So I do agree with you, but I think that thank you for bringing us back to this.

256
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:05,680
I do think we have to think about it critically. So I, I am the one that put in there real or perceived oppression.

257
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:11,710
So I don't know if you got that in you did you go to the guest speaker lecture yesterday?

258
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,270
So that was in the back door. But I know it's hard to miss if you're not engage us.

259
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:25,750
So. Dr. Devin Payne Sturgis is a black environmental justice, racial justice policy scholar at the University of Maryland.

260
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:38,550
And she was talking about the book called the some of us assumed some of us where can really get into some uncomfy areas right now.

261
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:45,490
Right. Talking about in particular the way how the United States is structured,

262
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:53,560
trying to capitalize to a certain extent on people's fears and in particular, white fragility.

263
00:30:53,890 --> 00:31:03,070
For those of lower asks where they feel like they are, they are entitled to certain privileges because they are white.

264
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:08,530
Whether that is an explicit thought or like an inherent feeling.

265
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:16,540
And then when they aren't getting what they feel like they deserve, they start to feel oppressed.

266
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:23,830
And this has been a tool that they have used, like if you've read the new Jim Crow, for example,

267
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:38,229
separating community and what I call solidarity between low asks people of color and low cis white folks where it's like an us versus them,

268
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:47,530
not all of us together, even among people of color, like the model minority Asian thing,

269
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:57,070
that is a construct made up by white people essentially to pit Asians against other minorities.

270
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:01,180
Right? Saying like, why aren't you other minorities like the Asians?

271
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:07,750
So that there's infighting between, you know, folks of color, but also within our own ethnic group.

272
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:15,340
And so, again, it is sometimes it is real, very much real,

273
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:21,250
like the stuff that happened with Tuskegee and that the father of modern gynecology like we talked about.

274
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:27,160
But the perception of being oppressed drives a lot of the population as well.

275
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,940
It's helpful to have the person. Yes, yes, yes.

276
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,999
Thank you for asking that because yeah.

277
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,780
You see the people who are being most vocal about it, unlike Twitter or like Instagram, historically,

278
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:49,390
pre-COVID, the most anti-vaxx population actually used to be liberal, college educated white women.

279
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:54,000
Mm hmm. Interesting. You said that's the most anti-gay. Yeah, pretty.

280
00:32:54,020 --> 00:33:02,319
Pretty. Prior to COVID. Like living in Colorado. In California are a lot of where the MMR stuff kind of cropped up.

281
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,510
And like Jenny McCarthy, I think she's on Messenger now.

282
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:13,180
I can't believe she still has a job, but she did a huge anti-vaxx movement.

283
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:18,240
She had a PBS documentary. That was the time when she was like dating Jim Carrey and stuff like that.

284
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:22,149
And she was like popular from like when she did singled out and MTV.

285
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,370
This was like maybe before some of your time.

286
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:34,870
But she did have a platform and she said, you know, she was very vocal, like my son got autism from the MMR vaccine.

287
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:42,970
She campaigned on this. A lot of people followed her, all this rhetoric picked up and then she kind of like went away for a while.

288
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:55,750
And then finally. Like years later, she was like, JK The vaccine didn't cause well, she didn't say the vaccine didn't cause autism.

289
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:05,200
She said she cured her son's autism by putting him on a ketogenic diet, ketogenic diet, dietary, generally used for children with epilepsy.

290
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:13,660
But now people use that as like a weight loss solution, essentially to put your body into like ketoacidosis of shock.

291
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:19,170
But she was like, oh yeah, yeah. So all that stuff that might help.

292
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,420
He's fine now. So now she's on the singer.

293
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:29,590
Yes. Okay. So when you use the term vaccine hesitancy, does that only move like.

294
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:34,659
Groups that potentially would be open to getting vaccinated.

295
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:38,230
So that's just like fears and misconceptions about it.

296
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:41,590
Or like does it include that group and in some.

297
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:47,559
I would say it includes both groups, but we have different scales of hesitancy.

298
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:58,990
Some people on the hesitancy scale, they're kind of like 0 to 10 with zero being not hesitant at all and then ten being like, No, absolutely not.

299
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:07,600
You have people anywhere between like a one to a two where they might need a little bit more convincing, a little bit more time to suss things out,

300
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:14,440
think about it, see other people get it, see other people do it, have the barriers to access, reduce for them.

301
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:18,909
Okay, fine. Or like here at the University of Michigan, all employees have to get it.

302
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:27,910
Or you, like, lose your job. Right. And then you have folks who are so hesitant that they'll just never even consider it.

303
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:35,790
Yeah. Yeah. So like I mentioned, hesitancy through time.

304
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:43,680
The vaccination attitudes predate any vaccinations in terms of this unnatural substances in the body.

305
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:47,850
And then the eight and then 1800s, you get to see the resistance.

306
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:55,800
This 1982, that documentary called T the Vaccine Roulette.

307
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:00,990
This was shown on smiling. Do not like the name vaccine roulette.

308
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,030
I like it. Okay, let's catch even more context of where we left.

309
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:15,810
But with the game roulette, they put broadcast this on national television and it started like kind of questioning the

310
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:21,990
diphtheria vaccine and then that Wakefield's fraudulent study on MMR that was falsified.

311
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:27,240
And then 2000s and 20 tens, we see social media and biased documentaries.

312
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:33,750
Now, I do want to focus on racism in particular and how these two connect.

313
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:44,790
So there's this a study by Bajaj and Stanford that came out last year that is called Beyond Tuskegee Vaccine Distrust in Everyday Racism.

314
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:51,420
So in this article, they talk about historical trauma and bioethical atrocities that we talked about before.

315
00:36:51,960 --> 00:37:02,310
So in November of 2020, they did a survey through the NAACP where only 14% of black survey respondents trusted the vaccine's safety,

316
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,850
and only 18% said that they would get vaccinated.

317
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:16,020
But it states that not every black person knows the history of Henrietta Lacks gave Marion Sims Tuskegee, for example.

318
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:27,990
But they do know what their own personal challenges have been in navigating health care and the experiences you have with health care providers.

319
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:33,030
Right. We've all had our very different experiences with health care providers.

320
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:38,129
I have a friend right now, my very good friend. She's been sick for the last month and they cannot figure out what it is.

321
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:46,860
But she lives in Oklahoma and this is like her physician is the same one that's like, you know, you're too old to still need ADHD medication.

322
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:53,250
You should have grown out of this by now. Type of like real like multiple conversations that she's had.

323
00:37:54,060 --> 00:38:03,780
You know, she has endometriosis. So dismissing her pain as a female, she is biracial but also like a woman.

324
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:12,950
Right. But each of us has our own respective experiences with how our pain and our issues have been addressed by health care.

325
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:20,430
Health care providers, whether or not accepted like as a real thing or dismissed or they, like, make assumptions about you.

326
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:27,179
So a quote from this study in particular Daily subtle mental assaults are more

327
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:33,419
salient in explaining the lack of trust in medical institutions and by extension,

328
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:45,749
COVID vaccines. So we did see some rhetoric going on early in the pandemic about how, okay, it's like we're not reaching herd immunity,

329
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:51,870
population immunity, because it's all these minority people who don't want to get vaccines.

330
00:38:52,110 --> 00:39:01,800
But later, as the data went on, they started seeing it was actually like, yes, there is hesitancy in these areas, but for very legitimate reasons.

331
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:08,250
Whereas a lot of that people who weren't complying at all lived in rural white areas.

332
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:13,709
Continuing in the study, they talked about how trust is critical to health.

333
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:23,580
And many instances of trust have been broken throughout time in the U.S., not just so starkly, but everyday racism and disrespect.

334
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,060
So this is another quote from the study We ascribe the current black health experience to past racism,

335
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:37,800
rooting our present in immovable historical occurrences and undermining efforts to combat mistrust.

336
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:43,140
Everyday racism, by contrast, can be tackled in the present.

337
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:49,709
So this is just some food for thought. I don't have answers.

338
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:54,990
Right. And if you want to pull up the study to to read it further, these these are scholars of color themselves.

339
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:06,050
But just thinking more about how things aren't necessarily like am I as black and white, like figuratively and literally as you think it is?

340
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:13,560
So I think like I was, I mentioned like the conversation I had with the utilities worker about Ypsilanti Community Utilities Authority,

341
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:16,170
about why he didn't want to get vaccinated. Right.

342
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:23,729
You know, as a black man and then, you know, kind of talking to him to understand, like how his immune system has adapted,

343
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:30,450
essentially working in like sewage and waste management, kind of hearing his thoughts out, you know, versus.

344
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:38,870
People who are very different. They might just think the government is surveilling them, for example, or they don't trust Biden or whatever.

345
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:46,610
Very different scales of understanding. So not to say that there should be blanket statements made,

346
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:56,390
but acknowledgments about where some of the hesitancy comes from and how certain hesitancy is are related to racism and then certain race.

347
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:07,730
Certain hesitancy are totally unrelated to that. But again, this perceived oppression gets put up to have there been any like continuing study?

348
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:12,500
This is all stuff that I'm familiar with from my own experience working research.

349
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:23,300
But just quickly looking up what the vaccination rates are between different places and it's pretty similar.

350
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:29,230
Yeah, across the US so non-Hispanic black is from the CDC, it's 78.2% Hispanic,

351
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:39,310
it's 81.3 Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander is 75.7 and non-Hispanic white is 78.7.

352
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:46,640
So I'm wondering if anything we've done. Two because the rates being so similar.

353
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,390
Sure. And this seem very at odds with one another.

354
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:55,880
Or is this like was there sampling to figuring out with the vaccination rates?

355
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:59,810
Not like I don't know. I'm not looking. Is it across all ages?

356
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:08,059
Is it fair to look at it just as COVID 19 Vaccination Coverage by Race and Ethnicity.

357
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:14,750
National Immunization Survey Adults of COVID 19. United States December 2020 to November 20.

358
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:25,690
Yeah. That's I would say. Let me just like quickly looking at yea yea yea yea.

359
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:31,000
I don't know any studies off of the top of my head, but just from me reading that to me,

360
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:41,379
December 2020 is super early in the pandemic and I feel like the only I wasn't able to get my vaccine until February almost a year,

361
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:45,070
December 2020 to November 2021. Okay. Okay. November 2021.

362
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:54,010
So it's almost a year. So I would say I'm wondering if that is also representing people who are what we consider like early

363
00:42:54,010 --> 00:43:01,419
adopters in terms of like folks who would have gotten the vaccine regardless of what anybody said from,

364
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:05,050
you know, each racial and ethnic group we have folks representing.

365
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,719
And then we start to see and then there's also a huge population of elderly

366
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:16,330
people and immunocompromised people like 55 and above pushing those numbers up.

367
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:26,170
Because I remember following the CDC vaccination that very early on and then I kind of like gave up on that where 55 like the the seniors were like,

368
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,890
yeah, they're doing good. They were like, I want to live. Right.

369
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:38,940
And then after a while, then you started to see mandates from workplaces in particular.

370
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,950
But is that a national sample? Did it say in the caption?

371
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:55,880
It don't like in the summary. There's no abstract and I've been saying with this very closely.

372
00:43:56,130 --> 00:44:03,600
Okay. First thing is talking about is about racial and ethnic minority groups have been disproportionately affected by the COVID 19 pandemic.

373
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:11,579
Sure. And so is talking about equitable vaccine administration can reduce COVID 19 related disparities,

374
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:20,280
but I don't know at this point what the sampling methodology is like putting in Google like US vaccination rates for COVID virus.

375
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:28,409
Yeah, yeah. Let me let me look into this more after class and then if I buy something for you,

376
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:34,350
I'll put it in announcement because I feel like recently I just I was listening to something and they

377
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:43,530
said that the U.S. vaccination rate across the country was only like a little bit like close to 60%.

378
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:48,090
So that seems really high. I will look into that. But it does seem at odds with this.

379
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:54,750
But this is again was a qualitative study. So that also, I believe, is like the reality.

380
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,990
Yes. Yes, that's right. Yeah. Yeah.

381
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:03,300
You also did I tell you all the CDC recently decided to stop publishing COVID death rates?

382
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,750
Oh, yes. I did tell you, I think you were at your conference.

383
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:12,870
So they recently decided to stop publishing COVID death rates because they were like, whatever.

384
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:17,010
So I take that with a grain of salt, but I'll look it up.

385
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:21,000
I'll I'll look into some things after class. Yes, Bernie.

386
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:24,390
So I'm a little stuck on if we do a few slides.

387
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:28,500
Oops. Are to the to the two quotes where you talked about the real or perceived.

388
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:36,209
Yes, yes. So let me go back just to the quote above.

389
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:40,320
It is talking about how some people might understand the science.

390
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,610
They just don't trust the government.

391
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:50,190
And I feel like there's this trend where like the more access to information we have through like I don't know any means to Wikipedia,

392
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:55,350
the Internet, people get the information, but then they don't have like really the framework.

393
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:03,240
People haven't taken an infectious disease class, right? So they can't understand what happens in this bacteria or like my contact with it.

394
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:06,510
So I'm just sorry. Computers lagging. Yeah.

395
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:11,610
So just the quote above, that's where it's it's less about the misunderstanding of the science and.

396
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:16,950
Oh, yes, yes. This is just a bunch of big institutions because I feel like I'm stuck on my hunches.

397
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:24,809
Like if we just had the best infographics, you know, the best scenes, maybe people would get the best info, infographics, science, communication.

398
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:30,460
Maybe if I just put a bunch of money into science communication. But that was done during COVID.

399
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,770
Like, there wasn't a lot about here. It is what it is.

400
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:37,829
And yeah, here's how you can touch it and I can invite you.

401
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:42,270
And so, I don't know, I, yeah, I guess I'm saying the two contradictory things.

402
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:47,760
I feel like maybe people is it that people I think people don't understand the science.

403
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:52,170
They don't. Right. Yeah. Everybody's become an armchair expert.

404
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:57,780
And how do you all just armchair public health expert, armchair monkeypox expert?

405
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:04,710
I think I mentioned to you when we talked about monkeypox, like, you know,

406
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:11,190
there is a there is a sleep doctor who was saying you should bleach all your waste before

407
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:14,580
you flush it down the toilet because that monkeypox will spread through the sewer system.

408
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:24,570
So even folks in health care were becoming like who never done infectious diseases in their life were like, I need to get my voice and hair right.

409
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:29,550
But you have to also think about like where people receive their news sources.

410
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:38,309
If they trust it, they don't care whether or not it is scientifically backed because they trust that source.

411
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:45,719
So just say, for example, like if you only watch Fox News or if you only listen to Joe Rogan or on the flip,

412
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:55,020
and if you only watch MSNBC, for example, I mean, every news source, for the most part, has its its lean or perspective on things.

413
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:55,410
Right?

414
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:04,810
And so to the person receiving that information, they will take it as fact, even if it's not fact, just because like or like, you know, whatever.

415
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:10,290
I feel like all of us know, like we have like some middle aged family members or something who get all their

416
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:14,009
information off of Facebook headlines and don't even click on the article.

417
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:19,230
They just read the headlines and then read the comments of like people arguing and then formulate their own opinion,

418
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:25,890
which through like cognitive dissonance or like how they interpret things, take it as fact, or like this friend,

419
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:31,830
for example, who I didn't talk to for six months rather than looking at like news sources,

420
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:40,880
she was just collecting anecdotal information from people she knew in Montana and Nebraska and Iowa and making that aspect fact.

421
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:45,990
I would also say like this is the reason why added the policy degree.

422
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:53,530
To that degree, it's important to think about like behavioral science as well.

423
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:59,740
So a lot of times people will think, if I give you the facts and you can understand the facts, your behavior.

424
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:04,030
But that's not most people aren't rational in that way.

425
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:07,180
Yeah, it's easy to tell. Yeah.

426
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:10,839
We're like, we're going to give the most comprehensive infographics about that.

427
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:16,899
And it's like, this isn't actually how you communicate on public health information effectively.

428
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:22,750
And that's where I think it fell short. And that's why I think the general mistrust of scientific institutions and government comes into play,

429
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:28,220
because if they didn't understand, that doesn't matter what infographics like.

430
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:34,029
Yeah, it wasn't the most comprehensive. Well, they were honest with it.

431
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:36,219
It doesn't it doesn't matter at that point.

432
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:44,500
And I think that the government really failed to understand like that, especially with like partizan politics in the US in particular.

433
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:52,239
Because if you look at other countries, which is why the two reports that I shared with Dr. Lot earlier in the semester,

434
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,470
you can see that other countries, people didn't respond that way.

435
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:59,560
I like the government institutions presenting facts and stuff and then.

436
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,500
So I think it's really that's a very useful context.

437
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:08,519
Yeah, I think I think you have to. So I think that's a huge piece.

438
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,800
And I think everyone should take a pause. Yes. In MP.

439
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:15,299
But I'm the only one and it's it's not the best one.

440
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:18,390
But I love Dr. Rubin.

441
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:23,290
I really liked it. But it's specifically about health care systems and not so much about the quality of.

442
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:30,410
You know, addressing some type of a public health issue, whether it is an emergent one or not.

443
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:35,270
Right. And I'm kind of thinking Hood and I'm kind of an odd bird in that.

444
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:39,649
I think I told you all like I do this world, right. But this is through my professional practice.

445
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:49,130
But my doctorate is actually health behavior. So I know you think that people are facts and what people know is no smoking is bad for you.

446
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:56,450
Still do it right? Why? Because with hot behavior, the only way people change is number one is a fun.

447
00:50:56,930 --> 00:51:03,620
Does it feel good? Right. That's why people engage in things that are contrary to what they should be doing.

448
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:08,869
So, yeah, the CDC totally fumbled the ball as a public health professional.

449
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:16,790
I will say that at the very beginning of the pandemic, Bury the CDC is supposed to be a politically neutral organization.

450
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:21,830
And as Dr. BIDDINGER mentioned in his guests lecture at the beginning of class, there's always this,

451
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:29,720
like be right or be timely battle where it's like, do we wait to say something until we absolutely have all the facts?

452
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:35,749
Which is very hard to do with an emerging pathogen where you're still collecting epidemiological data,

453
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,639
like you don't even know what the case rates are,

454
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:45,470
you don't know what the infectious doses, you don't know even what the are not is right or do we want to address this and like nip it in the bud?

455
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:51,380
CDC historically has always been on the bright side rather than the B timely side.

456
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:55,450
And they kept like changing their messaging about masks.

457
00:51:55,460 --> 00:52:05,720
Is it airborne? Isn't it airborne, etc.? You had like the COVID officials, Dr. Fauci, that are the lady who always wear scarves whose name I forgot,

458
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:13,820
but she kind of like pieced out in the beginning after that press session that President Trump had about the like injecting yourself with bleach.

459
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:16,580
Can we do that conference?

460
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:29,570
And then like leaders of our country very openly, like disparaging people like Dr. Fauci, it was just, yes, highly bipartisan.

461
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:36,890
And we haven't done like essentially a century's worth of trust now in public health institutions.

462
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:42,469
I'll I'll do later this semester one lecture on public health communications.

463
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:52,100
But I would say, like, I know it's for some of you it's like your last year, but Dr. Zit Zit Zygmunt Fisher I was like cancer a Zimmermann,

464
00:52:52,310 --> 00:53:00,530
Dr. Zygmunt Fisher and Bianchi, he teaches a class on risk communication and his whole gym is is that a residency class?

465
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:03,799
Is that an online class? Because I feel like there's love right now.

466
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,190
It's online. It used to be residential, but it was last year.

467
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:13,100
Yeah, it was last year and the year before. But his, his main research area is vaccine hesitancy.

468
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:20,780
So he's definitely an expert on that. I definitely know as public health professionals in my entire master's and doctoral program,

469
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:29,450
I never took a class on public health communications, never know what the guy had one lecture on it and then everything else.

470
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:32,930
They were kind of just like, figure it out, right?

471
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:39,350
So we need to get some marketing and comms people in here.

472
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:44,900
I don't know, like that. The girl who runs the Duolingo TikTok account or like, you know,

473
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:50,839
or like a company that has I'm trying to think of a company off the top of my

474
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:56,959
head that was like has done really bad and is now like a darling in the public.

475
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,520
I get the press team for the country of Japan.

476
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:12,799
Right. Because they have they have had a lot of war atrocities, colonization, war, rape, attack on other Asian nations.

477
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:18,020
And it seems to just like fade from people's mind because they're like anime and cute.

478
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:22,130
Hello Kitty and stuff. Get their press team. I don't know what the solution is,

479
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:28,880
but we will talk a little bit more about public health communications to the extent in which I can help you a little bit later.

480
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:36,410
Okay. Before we move on to this next part, any concluding thoughts, questions about that stuff?

481
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:43,900
Yes, certainly. I guess to the point, you having a similar delay our time, which I.

482
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:54,170
Like how quickly should you act? You know, like the CDC wanted to have certainty or answers before you act right to the public.

483
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:57,980
That looks like, oh, you're you're delaying, right? You must be something wrong.

484
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:08,510
Right. So it's interesting that, like, as your scientific certainty increases, then the public's perceived certainty decreases, you know?

485
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:10,610
But then if the CDC acts really quickly,

486
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:17,510
then we may not know the total story and there might be more uncertainty then the public perceives that as like,

487
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:20,560
Oh, you acted really fast, you must know what's going on, right?

488
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:24,889
So I feel like I don't know where the, the winning spot is.

489
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:27,020
Like, where is the happy medium?

490
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:36,709
I was kind of talking to about this at the Lauren Cook discussion a couple weeks ago about this like push and pull between like B,

491
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:42,560
right, or b b b fast. And I think there's a couple in my opinion,

492
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:47,120
a couple of fundamental things missing was just that like the CDC wasn't in

493
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:52,519
lockstep in terms of like what their communication and messaging was among them.

494
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:57,470
And the American Medical Association, the American Pediatric Association and I age,

495
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:01,670
like everybody was saying, a little something like a little bit differently.

496
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,559
And that's very confusing to the general public. Very confusing.

497
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:10,640
And like we have terminal we have 100 degrees and that's confusing for me.

498
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:20,989
Right. But another thing in particular is not conveying very basic principles of transmission like we've talked about in this class,

499
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:26,330
about why when there is a novel emerging emerging pathogen,

500
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:33,140
why you may not have all this information, and how as we get more information and that will evolve,

501
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:41,780
they attempted to do that like in bits and pieces, but people didn't graphs the full understanding.

502
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:51,139
So I feel like when folks have that understanding, there's more patience and empathy and forgiveness in terms of that,

503
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:58,850
like you would see in New Zealand, for example, right where their prime minister was like, we'll talk more later.

504
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:07,459
Or other countries that are different in our society but also politically, like in East Asia, Southeast Asia,

505
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:15,050
we talked about where they generally have trust in their public health systems, but also the messaging and communication was not conflicting.

506
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:21,560
Yes, I think part of it is like the CDC not saying like we messed up.

507
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:25,430
Yes. I think they're not taking accountability.

508
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:29,300
Yeah. And also just like perpetuating things. Yeah.

509
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:35,090
Because there was like some interim director. And then Rochelle Walensky took over.

510
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:41,180
Who Dr. BIDDINGER said he knows because she came from the same hospital she he works for.

511
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:52,070
And I understand, like, the perception of, like saying, like, I'm sorry, like we were wrong or like, I'm sorry we didn't handle this well.

512
00:57:52,070 --> 00:58:01,070
And I feel like the status quo or, you know, the M.O. here in the U.S. is, rather than acknowledging mistakes and shortcomings,

513
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:09,500
is either like just move on and like we're just going to like pick this under the rug or just can pretend like none of this stuff happened.

514
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:15,410
People still remember. Right. So that's not helping the situation.

515
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:21,530
It is. It is very complicated. It's very complicated.

516
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:24,830
Right. Because it's like it's different than like.

517
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:34,020
I don't know that try guy cheating on his wife and being like, I'm sorry, but it's mainly he's sorry he got caught.

518
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:37,069
Right. But this isn't like that situation.

519
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:44,540
It's like we're sorry we didn't handle this communication properly and we're doing the best with what we knew at the time.

520
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:48,440
But that never that that accountability never happened. Yeah.

521
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,240
Other thoughts and comments before we move to this part.

522
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:59,470
Okay, great combos.

523
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:03,440
So community response to infectious diseases.

524
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:12,640
What can we do as a community? Obviously, we want to do all these things we talked about before, but that doesn't necessarily happen.

525
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:20,950
So in the communities, it's important to recognize that no two emergencies are actually the same.

526
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:25,719
So it's important to have flexible yet comprehensive plans.

527
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:30,610
And then drawing back to the conversation we just had about acknowledging challenges.

528
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:34,630
Many community based organizations, or CBOs for short,

529
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:45,460
don't have the capacity to manage a lot of personnel or volunteers like we talked about in previous weeks in Puerto Rico as one of our case studies.

530
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:52,870
With Hurricane Maria, it's not like they didn't have a shortage of mutual aid coming in.

531
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,260
It was they had a shortage of people, personnel, volunteers,

532
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:04,450
organizing and knowing what was going on because you had pallets being delivered that were full of food and perishable goods.

533
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:10,720
But nobody was organizing in such a way that they were getting to it in time and distributing it.

534
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:18,879
And then in your particular community, in, you know, identifying who the local partners are.

535
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,190
Right.

536
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:29,740
Like, I feel like every time there is a new issue, people's favorite thing to do is to form a task group or a working group or a steering committee.

537
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:34,839
Sometimes the resources already exist. Building a team through.

538
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,719
So that should be council meetings or periodic meetings.

539
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:45,580
So individuals who can be committed to serving in leadership roles, roles, and then establishing concrete goals.

540
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:53,740
So smart goals, which we talked about in public health, smart, measurable, attainable, realistic and time bound.

541
01:00:54,550 --> 01:01:01,850
So we're not saying a goal like we're going to stop all fighting in the community.

542
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:04,599
That's not a personal thing sometimes. Right?

543
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:16,240
So a smart goal will be in the next year, we will increase our capacity, our personnel capacity to address emergency flooding by 50%,

544
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:22,240
something like that, and then learn about the hazards most likely to affect your community.

545
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:26,590
Something that's happening here in Ann Arbor is not the same.

546
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:32,470
That's even something happening in Midland. Right. And then actually deploying the plans.

547
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:42,700
So what are these community resources? First, might be a local health department, so they will help with prevention, control,

548
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:48,880
immunization delivery, infectious disease surveillance response screening and treatment care.

549
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:55,750
This example came from when I was living in Bloomington, Indiana.

550
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:03,750
There was a hepatitis A outbreak from a local restaurant.

551
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:08,849
And now a lot of people have gotten severe food poisoning.

552
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,880
Hep A is generally transmitted from the fecal oral route.

553
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:21,930
But this restaurant in particular was understaffed, underfunded, and so they were just like throwing orders together as a local diner.

554
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:28,020
But the health department was also understaffed and underfunded.

555
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:38,610
And a lot of folks who went to this diner were in like a transitory period or persons experiencing housing instability.

556
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:46,230
So it was very difficult to track them down, to get them vaccinated prophylaxis.

557
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:50,430
Because the incubation period for this can blow out to 12 weeks.

558
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:58,980
There was also about a month later, another hepatitis A outbreak at a large chain restaurant in town.

559
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:10,110
Shameful, wild swings. And they were able to track down the days the patrons went there that were exposed to have.

560
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:15,870
And then the health department actually managed to, like, put in the newspaper online on the radio,

561
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:21,810
hep A clinics come back to this restaurant in the parking lot.

562
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:26,700
We will get you. You're have a vaccine because in Indiana, you don't have to have hepatitis to go to school.

563
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:32,610
Now, what about primary care providers and clinics?

564
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:38,310
Sometimes these are the best options because they already have trust and connections with people in communities.

565
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:43,380
So generally well respected source of medical and scientific information.

566
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:50,640
And they can connect to the local health department for epidemiological data, but they have the ability.

567
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:58,890
These providers themselves have powerful influence on the health outcomes of the community, both positive and negative.

568
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:04,440
So they can either serve as like models and beacons for disease control,

569
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:11,070
or they can proliferate issues like getting kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies and prescribing a bunch of opioids,

570
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:17,220
for example, or causing a surge in antibiotic resistance because they are overprescribing antibiotics.

571
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:21,480
But again, this is a challenge with primary care deficits and medical deserts.

572
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:25,620
Have another good friend from the same graduate cohort when she was done,

573
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:31,800
ended up going to school and she lives in Creighton, Nebraska, which is like a super rural area.

574
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:38,730
And she is the physician assistant, but essentially the only primary care provider for that entire area.

575
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:46,260
And everybody in the surrounding area knows her, loves her, thankfully, very pro-vaccine advocate.

576
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:56,160
Right. Very was very vocal about it. So she was able to stimulate a support in her community and get those folks vaccinated as well.

577
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:11,580
Now, interestingly, the YMCA, gymnasiums, community centers, rec centers, the why let's not talk about the religious background of it,

578
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:18,630
but it is not just for athletic facilities, but they also promote some humanitarian work.

579
01:05:18,990 --> 01:05:25,559
So these existing facilities are large physical spaces that can serve as vaccine centers,

580
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:31,350
medical distribution, a place to distribute medical supplies and necessary essentials.

581
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:36,690
And then in times of evacuation, just like stadiums as well as we saw in Katrina,

582
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:42,390
providing shelter either medium or large scale in organized and temporary accommodations,

583
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:50,520
and the benefit of having a place like the Y, which is a gym, they already have some degree of sanitary infrastructure, meaning they have showers.

584
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:54,330
Right. They have lots of toilets. Where is a convention center?

585
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:57,270
Why would they have showers there? Right. Why would they?

586
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:01,790
I mean, they have a ton of toilets, but they don't necessarily have that sanitary infrastructure.

587
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:07,860
And because there's already athletic facilities going on, they have decontamination equipment,

588
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:18,059
potentially a lot of first aid materials in case somebody gets injured and then ys are generally dispersed geographically throughout a community.

589
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:25,530
There isn't just one. So they make great stand up centers now.

590
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:30,929
Religious organizations. Pros and cons. They can provide a sense of community.

591
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:38,399
And depending on the organization or institution that you go to provide messaging related to public health issues.

592
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,720
I know a lot of religious organizations got into this during COVID,

593
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:51,660
but there's also challenges as well with them potentially spreading misinformation or having conflicting messages with science and public health.

594
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:58,170
So some in some churches that I know my friends were going to were very like pro getting the.

595
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:03,389
Seen while others were very like, this is a natural substance.

596
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:08,820
This is interfering with your relationship with God in the natural course of life.

597
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:15,000
So it really depends on even which establishment you go to.

598
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:21,870
But they also, like we mentioned before, do provide mutual aid in terms of like organizing,

599
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:28,110
handing out goods in terms of emergency response or infectious disease response.

600
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:31,500
Other community organizations that can play a critical role.

601
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:38,610
Local restaurants, grocery stores, markets, beauty salons, economic development such as business associations,

602
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:46,450
libraries are such an important safety net and community, local causes, fire departments and more.

603
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:52,470
So when I was living in Bloomington, we had this place, this fancy restaurant called Cardinal Spirits,

604
01:07:52,470 --> 01:08:01,020
where they made their own spirits like vodka, like Bramble Berry and things like Coors and stuff like that.

605
01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:05,010
And they had to close at the start of the pandemic, but they still had their distillery.

606
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:14,490
So they made a ton of hand sanitizer, like a ton of time, and just handed out like large jugs essentially to all the local restaurants.

607
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:23,280
And you would see like hand sanitizer, like cardinal spirits and a lot of other restaurants got into that to that business as well.

608
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:32,549
So kind of shifting the needs there. Our libraries, when I was living there, also served as a point of that for vaccination clinics.

609
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:35,790
They did pop up vaccination clinics at the library, which was great.

610
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:43,710
Okay. Yes, I think I have time for this case study and then we can pass.

611
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:55,500
Okay. So in terms of community preparedness, looking a specific example of community preparedness in the Great Lakes region, so context,

612
01:08:56,250 --> 01:09:04,440
Asian-Americans in the United States, there's more than 30 different types of nationalities and ethnicities of Asian-Americans.

613
01:09:05,490 --> 01:09:09,960
Frequently, tree were treated as a monolith, right. Just the same.

614
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:17,250
But there's varying levels of mean income, educational attainment, socioeconomic status among each group.

615
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:25,080
So if we look here, just that a breakdown, a raisin, a Henry district, just stretching.

616
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:33,930
Okay. So of the ethnicity, six Asian origin groups in the U.S. had populations of at least 1 million people.

617
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:44,790
So if we look here, this is by the thousands Chinese, Indian, Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, Pakistani, Thai, Cambodian.

618
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:54,990
We're going to focus on the Hmong population here. So the largest Asian population in the United States is Chinese, followed by Indian,

619
01:09:55,110 --> 01:10:02,100
Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese and everybody else just makes up the 16%.

620
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,680
But again, all lumped in together.

621
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:13,649
Chinese does include those who identify as Taiwanese, but just know that if you talk to a Taiwanese person and you refer to them as Chinese,

622
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:18,390
they probably will correct you just because of the historical context there.

623
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:26,190
But this is what Pew did. Okay. 54% of U.S. Asians have a bachelor's degree or more.

624
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:34,559
Right. Again, they think of us as a model minority. But if you look at the breakdown by ethnicity for bachelor's degrees, the top,

625
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:40,110
we have 75% of Indian-Americans and then Malaysians, all Asians average.

626
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:48,239
They're in the middle. And then we start to get to Southeast Asians like myself, Vietnamese, 32% Hmong and Burmese, 23%.

627
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:54,750
Laotian 18%. Bhutanese 15%. What about median household income?

628
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:58,620
This also widely varies depending on ethnic group.

629
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:10,770
So again, at the top, you have Indian Americans like from India, not American Indians, $119,000, all Asians, if you look at it, 86,000.

630
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:20,100
But if we look at again, Southeast Asians, Vietnamese, Hmong, Nepalese, Burmese, lower than the mean.

631
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:26,010
What about those who live in poverty? Okay.

632
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:32,190
Across the United States, the mean poverty rate falls between 9 to 10%.

633
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,620
All Asians is 10%.

634
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:44,489
But if you look at the breakdown of who are the more affluent ethnicities versus who are the ones more likely living in poverty Pakistani,

635
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:48,210
Nepalese, Bangladeshi, Burmese and Mongolian.

636
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:58,170
So very, very, very different. I'm one of those people in particular who was on a a hiring workshop because I'm on our high.

637
01:11:58,270 --> 01:12:02,110
In committee where they kind of talk to faculty or on search committees.

638
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:06,660
They were like, You can't ask. Make sure you don't ask candidates questions like I do.

639
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:11,719
Putting out babies and stuff. Like, Yeah, obviously these people, we still have faculty.

640
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:14,170
You ask people those questions, okay, so this is why it has to be said.

641
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:20,349
But they kept talking about how like they are too many Asians, not too many Asians,

642
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:27,429
but they said there's an overrepresentation of white people and Asian people in academia versus other people of color.

643
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:40,150
And I was like, you need to disaggregate that data is me, Aurora and someone like Dr. Shi are very different, very different types of Asians.

644
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:47,860
Okay, I'm Asian-American, but it just drives me crazy because they just want to smash us all the way.

645
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:59,980
If we look at the gender gap, women overall earnings ratio, white non-Hispanic men, 82%, $0.82 for the dollar.

646
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:06,370
Asian American Pacific Islander women overall, though, are making $0.85 to the dollar.

647
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:12,820
Now, Taiwanese, Indian and Malaysian women are actually making more than the dollar, which is really nice.

648
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:19,810
But if we look at some people like down below, where again we're focusing on the Hmong population here,

649
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:26,980
$0.60 on the dollar, Vietnamese women who mostly work in nail salons with the work I do, $0.63 on the dollar.

650
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:33,870
Okay. So. Who are the Hmong people?

651
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:46,200
They are an ethnic group, primarily in southern China, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Myanmar, which is also sometimes referred to as Burma.

652
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:54,740
They don't have an actual country, so they are part of the unrepresented nations and peoples organizations.

653
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:59,430
So like if you say I'm Vietnamese, okay, obviously, like my parents are from Vietnam.

654
01:13:59,490 --> 01:14:02,570
Right. Okay. Or like I'm Chinese. Okay.

655
01:14:02,590 --> 01:14:07,890
My parents probably in China. But if you're if you identify as mom and your family does.

656
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:10,690
You could be from any of these regions.

657
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:23,580
Realistically, there's a total population of 9 to 11 million people, Hmong people living in the worldwide, and then 327,000 in the United States.

658
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:38,549
Now, their English proficiency is amongst those who are foreign born, is only 43% compared to the English proficiency of all other Asians.

659
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:46,270
And that top states that Hmong folks reside in are Minnesota, California, Wisconsin, North Carolina.

660
01:14:46,290 --> 01:14:50,960
And actually, I was a little surprised, Michigan, growing up in California.

661
01:14:50,970 --> 01:14:55,860
I'm from Sacramento. A lot of the Hmong population live in Sacramento and Fresno.

662
01:14:56,670 --> 01:15:01,379
I went to high school mostly only knowing other Southeast Asians.

663
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:04,830
I probably knew like one Korean person and that was it.

664
01:15:05,490 --> 01:15:09,960
So I'm very familiar with the Hmong community.

665
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:15,390
How many of you have heard about them before college?

666
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:19,950
Okay. Like a handful. Well, you're from California.

667
01:15:20,190 --> 01:15:23,820
How about, um, I read a book about. Oh, you wrote a book about them.

668
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:29,190
So, yeah. Yeah. So there. There. There's a big community in Detroit.

669
01:15:29,610 --> 01:15:33,440
So growing up, I heard. Yeah.

670
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:39,630
Yeah. Of beautiful culture. They?

671
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:46,290
Yes. And they live a lot in Minnesota. The Olympian, Suni Lee.

672
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:52,140
She's Hmong. So they were very happy about the representation during the Olympics.

673
01:15:52,530 --> 01:16:01,650
So with that context, I will stop there for today and we'll get into this specific case study next week.

674
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:05,190
She's like, Oh, my gosh, class is already over.

675
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:10,530
I heard the fog is supposed to be like just dissolved by ten.

676
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:14,290
They said, Right.
