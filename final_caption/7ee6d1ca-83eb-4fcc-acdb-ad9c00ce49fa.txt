1
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,840
All right, I hope everyone enjoyed a little bit of extra weekend,

2
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,210
it's kind of awkward that we get that right at the beginning of the semester and now I think we're on for like a solid five weeks or so.

3
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:33,690
Right, without any breaks till we get to our whole break. With that said, we'll pick up where we left off with last time.

4
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,630
We kind of went through an introduction to exposure science.

5
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:45,570
Some of the key terms and definitions today will launch into pathways and routes of exposure before I get going on some of the lecture material.

6
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:55,470
Any questions from anything we covered last week or anything on the canvass site going forward?

7
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:05,280
All right, sounds good. So today we're going to be focusing on pathways of exposure and around of exposure and just from those terms,

8
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:14,580
they might sound really similar, but we're going to very easily and quickly go through and delineate what the differences are between them.

9
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:23,310
And then we'll finish the class period by going through our exposure science in the news exercise.

10
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,920
All right, so if you recall, we're going to be going back to this model throughout the course,

11
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,970
we've we have sources of different exposure's sources of contaminants they build up into some

12
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:43,710
sort of concentration or intensity in a community or in a microenvironment or in a workplace.

13
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:50,460
And then we get around us coming into contact with these agents or stressors.

14
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,300
And this is where exposure might take place.

15
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:04,320
So today we're going to be talking about, again, those pathways of exposure, how contaminants might actually reach us where we are.

16
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,250
And part of it is related to our our time, activity and behavior.

17
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:18,840
And then also the roots of exposure, which is getting at how do those stressors or agents actually enter into our body.

18
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:27,510
All right, so the really quick overview, we'll go through each of these, but there are basically four routes of exposure,

19
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:40,450
how an agent can actually enter our body there through ingestion, inhalation, skin contact and skin absorption.

20
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:49,180
So skin exposure and absorption is pretty much what you what you kind of see in the little schematics.

21
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:59,570
So exposure, Dermody, is contact of a chemical or another physical or biological agent or substance with that outer boundary of our body.

22
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:15,670
Right. And then dermal absorption is a step beyond that where the agent is able to actually cross that boundary and be retained within our bodies.

23
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,410
When we talk about ingestion, for the most part, these are purposeful, right?

24
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:26,410
It's through liquids that we drink, food that we eat.

25
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,850
We did go through the example last week of how sometimes it's unintentional.

26
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,170
Right? Especially with with children as they spend time on the floor.

27
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:45,610
So house dust soil outdoors are also possible opportunities for ingestion of contaminants.

28
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:55,390
Inhalation, this is a really important one, especially in workplace settings, when we talk about routes of exposure within workplaces,

29
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:04,690
inhalation is by far the dominant and largest route of concern for exposures within occupational settings.

30
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:13,600
This is important for both ambient kind of outdoor community level exposure to pollutants or contaminants,

31
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:27,700
as well as indoor work like right here in the classroom. So shifting from those routes of exposure to pathways of exposure, what are the distinctions?

32
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,710
OK, so this this next schematic is a little bit busier, so we'll kind of walk through it.

33
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,940
Over here on the right, we have our roots of exposure that we just went through.

34
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:46,840
Right. We've got installation ingestion, dermal absorption or exposure through contact.

35
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,660
But then if we go back a few steps,

36
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:58,280
we're worried those contaminants are stressors before they came into contact with us to the point where exposure was even possible.

37
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,640
Right. And I think we'll step through this in a few minutes and more detail.

38
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:10,420
But this particular schematic is looking at a source being a chemical disposal site

39
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:19,150
and how perhaps chemicals as part of this operation might evaporate into the air.

40
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,500
So now the atmosphere becomes a possible exposure pathway.

41
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:29,110
It's basically a medium for that chemical to be transported.

42
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:35,600
It might leach into the ground, into surface waters.

43
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:45,880
Right. So in this example, water might actually serve as an exposure pathway, a river, a stream groundwater, right.

44
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:55,090
Where we might later ingest that water. It might absorb into the soil the chemicals from the disposal site so the soil could end

45
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:01,510
up being or the aquatic or terrestrial ecosystem could end up being an exposure pathway.

46
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:15,230
So a way in which from source, it can build up that into a concentration and environmental intensity and potentially lead to downstream and exposure.

47
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:22,850
And sometimes it's complicated, right? But those examples kind of looked at them all independently, individually.

48
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:33,710
This is an example of try hello methane's which are formed through common like municipal disinfection of water,

49
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:46,010
silica, municipal drinking water system. And we can have multiple exposure pathways that can also lead to multiple exposure roots.

50
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:55,430
So we need to consider them all when we look at a particular agent or a stressor and try to help them, that they are really good example of why.

51
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:01,610
So what kind of step through some of these. So drinking tap water, right.

52
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:10,160
Ingesting tap water is one way of being exposed to try Halimah things we might be showering or

53
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:17,210
bathing where we might get a little bit of water into our mouths or whatever as we're showering,

54
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:23,030
but then very purposely. Right. That that water is coming into contact with our skin.

55
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:30,590
So dermal absorption might be an exposure route from Tricolore Methane's.

56
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:36,470
We could be swimming, we could be doing kitchen chores, washing dishes.

57
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,790
But this one is a little bit gross. We're stepping through the exposure routes.

58
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:49,370
We can be ingested through multiple exposure pathways. We can absorb, try things on our skin, your multiple exposure pathways.

59
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:54,140
We can also inhale. Right. So these are trialing methods can be volatile.

60
00:07:54,140 --> 00:08:00,410
So even though it's coming out of the shower, it's going into the air so we can actually breathe it while we're showering.

61
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,960
We can breathe it while we're swimming.

62
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:12,200
And then the ones where the toilet is here, it may be a very silver lining of wearing our masks to use the bathroom,

63
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:19,100
especially in like a public building like this. And you flush the toilet and you get that look like industrial flushing,

64
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,850
you know, and there's water sheeting all over there actually are our aerosols,

65
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:30,860
you know, going into the the air and that immediate microenvironment, along with the volatile component of the tricolore methane's.

66
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:41,630
So here's an exposure out of inhalation where maybe your mask is providing a little bit of protection these days.

67
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,410
So anyway, this is kind of a simple example. But to illustrate that,

68
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:55,580
it never lines up where here comes a stressor or an agent always follows this exposure pathway and always follows this route of exposure.

69
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:02,920
We need to kind of consider them all as part of exposure assessment.

70
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,290
Kind of continuing along those lines.

71
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:15,400
Let's take a few minutes and go through an example a little bit more specifically, and you know me, I've already given you fair warning.

72
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:24,820
My background in interest is an air quality issue. So I'm going to lean on air quality whenever I can for providing some of those examples.

73
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:32,350
So in this case, let's go ahead and take characterize our our type of agent.

74
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:40,870
In this case, it's going to be a physical agent in particulate matter that's in the air.

75
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:47,590
It can also be very easily quantified as a chemical agent or a biological agent.

76
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:51,750
If we start to analyze, well, what what are those particles composed of?

77
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:57,550
Right. But for this exercise will basically consider it a physical agent or a physical ear.

78
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:07,530
Your agent will look specifically at particulate matter that's synthetic in origin or anthropogenic in nature.

79
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:19,240
Right. So it could be coming from sulfur dioxide, from coal combustion, could be coming from fuels, from automobiles that are burned.

80
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:26,590
Right. For transportation. And then we'll look specifically at at a community setting.

81
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:34,320
Right. So ambient, primarily outdoor particulate pollution.

82
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:42,510
So let's go ahead and take a step back. We are going to talk about him very specifically a little bit later in the

83
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:49,900
semester when we have a whole lecture allocated to air quality and health issues.

84
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:55,080
And when we get to that point, we'll actually illustrate why PM is such a big deal.

85
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,930
It's very, very high on the global burden of disease hierarchy.

86
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:06,810
I think one of those exposure science in the news articles that I listed as an example last week.

87
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:13,230
Right. We've got somewhere on the on the order of seven or eight million people each year.

88
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,950
They die early from exposure specifically to particulate matter.

89
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:24,450
So what what is it exactly? So these are literally just particles in the air when they're really big.

90
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,950
We can see them for the most part. They're small enough where we can't.

91
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:37,440
And there's a bill on the top of this graphic here. On the scale of the size of particles, there are some common references.

92
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:44,940
So when we are at something that's 100 microns in diameter, it's about the width of a human hair.

93
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:51,960
Once we go down to 50 microns, which is especially for people with less than ideal eyesight like mine,

94
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,250
it's about our limit of vision, like the very tip of a pen we might be able to see.

95
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,670
Beyond that are things we can't really see. For the most part.

96
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:06,030
You know, an individual pollen particle is floating in the air somewhere around 30 microns.

97
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:12,570
Once we get to individual cells, we're now less than 10 microns in diameter.

98
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:18,900
Red blood cells about five microns, bacteria around one micron.

99
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,520
Viruses get down to about two point one microns.

100
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,990
And then molecules, you know, something on the order of zero point zero one microns.

101
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:34,290
So how does this how does this translate to how we characterize particles in the air and pollution and contaminants?

102
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:40,530
So you see a couple of graph images down here below the scale.

103
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:44,940
And we have PPM 10, we have PPM two point five.

104
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,900
There are standards for both. These are considered criteria pollutants.

105
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:54,420
There are US ambient air quality standards for both of these pollutants,

106
00:12:54,420 --> 00:13:05,700
the 10 after the Pentagon or the two point five to 10 after PPM and the ten point five after PPM described the size of the particles.

107
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:14,340
So PPM 2.5 is particles, less than two and a half microns an aerodynamic diameter.

108
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:18,030
Similarly, four p.m. 10 fleshman 10 microns.

109
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:30,830
The reason that there are standards independently for each is that the health literature over time has actually documented independent impacts,

110
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:37,830
adverse impacts on health from particles of these two different sizes down here at the bottom.

111
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:45,480
Once we get down below, point one is something that the the air pollution community refers to as ultra

112
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:52,590
fine particles that are more commonly known in greater media as nano particles.

113
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:59,620
They're basically the same thing, roughly defined as being one microns or less.

114
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:06,930
However, we don't know enough about them, how to measure them, how to control them, how to regulate them,

115
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,530
their impacts on health for there to be standards in place that there aren't currently

116
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:19,260
standards in place from a from an air quality perspective around ultrafine or nano particles.

117
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,450
All right. So what's the problem with these these particles and what's the deal with the, you know, the different sizes?

118
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:32,310
And why isn't there and we have a PM 2.5 and a PM 10. Why isn't there a PM one hundred air quality standard or why isn't that a concern?

119
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:38,340
So a little bit of basics on our respiratory systems.

120
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:47,280
So our upper airways end up being pretty effective at filtering out large particles, our noses,

121
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:55,540
our nasal cavity or throats and all of the mucous membranes that line them end up doing a really good job here.

122
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,140
The little hairs inside our nose.

123
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:07,900
So larger particles tend to get filtered out in our upper airways, which is important because then they can't get into our lower airways right now.

124
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:15,780
There's also a couple of opportunities for removal of these particles through swallowing or coughing.

125
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,980
Right. So we might actually get them back out. We might swallow them.

126
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,740
Now they're going into our gastrointestinal system, right?

127
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:32,880
There might be an ingestion component, but for the most part, the mass of particles is not very great from an ingestion perspective.

128
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,710
It's just that our lungs weren't designed to have small, small particles in them,

129
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:43,380
and so all it takes is a very small mass to get into our lower airways to actually cause cause problems.

130
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,140
I have this kind of nasty story,

131
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:58,140
but it's my best example of illustrating this upper airway removal process when I'm at home and I sweep out my garage,

132
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:04,440
which is really not often enough. The garage is always a mess, but whenever I do it, like, it takes up a lot of dust.

133
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:11,460
Right. And although since the pandemic started, each time I've done it, I've always had a mask on.

134
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,420
But before that, I usually didn't want, I don't know, exposure scientist.

135
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:24,090
All right. Anyway. And then eventually a few minutes into the process or when I'm done, I have a tissue.

136
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:30,540
Right. Most of them are white. I blow my nose and you would see all this black stuff right in the tissue.

137
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:38,280
So that's basically what's happened is my upper airway has done a pretty good job of filtering out those large particles, which you can see.

138
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,600
Right. You sweep and you kind of see the dust getting kicked up and I'm blowing them out,

139
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,650
which I guess is good, but they're not getting into our lower airways.

140
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:53,220
The problem comes when we have particles that are less than 10 microns in aerodynamic diameter.

141
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,030
And this is the reason for why we have a pen.

142
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:04,530
Standard standards for particles even less than 10 is that these can actually easily get through our upper airways,

143
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:12,270
that filtering system, and get deeper into our lower airways. And this is where grief can be caused.

144
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:19,080
So physical impaction of these very small particles in our bronchial tubes and

145
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:24,780
lung tissue and even absorption of those particles into our bloodstream there,

146
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:33,160
that small. All right, so we we gave this example last week, and it was in relation to time,

147
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,860
activity and behavior, but just illustrating that there's, you know, spatial variability.

148
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:44,050
Right, of pollutants. This was in Southern California, kind of in the Los Angeles area.

149
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:52,630
I'm going to shift gears and give a different example, continuing along this example of particulate matter as a physical stressor.

150
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,680
But bring in some of my own research over the years.

151
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:20,380
So I'm going to highlight some work that's done quite locally in the Detroit area and Michigan to get support of right here.

152
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:29,920
For those of you not familiar with some of the local geography in Detroit,

153
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:39,910
the blue here is the Detroit River leading to the south that opens up into Lake Erie, leading to the north that opens up into Lake St. Clair.

154
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:46,630
The city of Detroit kind of lies north and west of this water boarding this river

155
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:51,250
and everything south and east of it is actually different countries of Canada.

156
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:56,860
This is the city of Windsor in Canada, on the south side of the river.

157
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,700
And so we started going back over 20 years ago.

158
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:06,490
Now a series of projects looking at air quality issues.

159
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:16,150
An impact on health in the original hypothesis was looking at these issues in three different communities that were chosen very purposely.

160
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:26,560
One was in the northwest part of the city. One was a community on the east side of the city, and one was down here in southwest Detroit.

161
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:36,970
And the hypothesis was that we were going to see higher exposures to air pollutants in areas that were in closer proximity to emission sources.

162
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:44,740
Right. Pretty basic. And so when you look at where are the likely emission sources of pollutants in the city of Detroit,

163
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,450
it kind of focuses you in this southwest part of the city for a couple of reasons.

164
00:19:49,450 --> 00:20:03,160
There's a lot of long time historical heavy industry along the riverfront here, coal-fired power plants, chemical production, the automotive industry.

165
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:11,470
So steel production quite a bit consolidated in this in this area.

166
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:20,410
There's also the largest and only actually oil refinery in Michigan has doubled in size over the last decade or so,

167
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,780
is right here within this community.

168
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:33,220
And also proximate is is the Ambassador Bridge, which happens to be the largest commercial border crossing between the U.S. and Canada.

169
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:41,530
So there is a huge number of diesel trucks that are basically traversing this community to cross into Canada or that

170
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:47,230
are coming from Canada into the U.S. and are traversing this community before they go on to their destination.

171
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,730
And because it's a border crossing, there's a lot of lines of trucks.

172
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:59,700
Right. And idling trucks for customs purposes and so forth.

173
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,390
These are some photos of the area.

174
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:08,850
I don't think it actually you might be able to see it.

175
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:13,680
Maybe not. Can can folks see, like, some colored stuff coming out of these smokestacks?

176
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:29,520
OK, some head nods. Yes. So this one this photo, this image by the top is the city of Detroit's wastewater treatment and sewage sludge incinerator.

177
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,730
So the I guess you go back to the map here.

178
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:41,400
So not just for the city of Detroit, but for greater metropolitan Detroit,

179
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:50,520
upwards of maybe four million people or so municipalities are tied into this wastewater system.

180
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:57,870
So every time someone turns on the faucet and the water drains, every time someone flushes the toilet right in the water drains,

181
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:05,250
it all finds its way down to this single water treatment facility in southwest Detroit.

182
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:11,640
And the way that that waste is treated is that the solids are removed from the liquid,

183
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,900
the liquid is treated and it's discharged into the very nearby Detroit River.

184
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:22,980
The solids are dried as much as possible and then they're incinerated.

185
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:29,730
So this is actually the declaration that you see coming out is the incineration of

186
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:35,490
all of the solids for basically metropolitan Detroit and this facility runs 24/7.

187
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:41,280
A couple of images here. This is the ambassador bridge in the background.

188
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,900
And you can see the diesel trucks kind of winding to and fro.

189
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:54,030
It's actually appropriate to discuss where a lot of activities around the 20th anniversary of 9/11.

190
00:22:54,030 --> 00:23:02,760
Right. And terrorist attacks and so forth. And with the additional border security,

191
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:10,410
it took an exposure problem in this part of the city that already existed and made it worse because now there's so many more

192
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:19,320
hoops and steps and processes that trucks transporting goods need to go through in order to traverse that international border.

193
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:26,790
And, you know, interestingly, these are my own photos and was part of a children's asthma study that we were doing at the time.

194
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:31,200
And we were working with the individual schools, elementary schools primarily.

195
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,440
And I'm actually standing on the school property right here. I've been taking these these photos.

196
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:44,850
So this is just kind of gives you a little bit of a visual of how close these exposure scenarios are for folks in these communities,

197
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:47,580
particularly in southwest Detroit.

198
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:59,910
This is an image taken from Windsor looking across the river back to Detroit and again, that kind of southwest riverfront.

199
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:04,440
This is a particularly industrial area on this island.

200
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:13,560
It's this very small island here. And it's its only purpose and its entire entity is industrial activity.

201
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:25,800
And this is looking at the same activity and excuse me, from the land sides are from one of the major roadways looking towards the river.

202
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:31,580
But those those same facilities.

203
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:42,140
All right, so over the course of that initial project, this is, I think, represents three years of continuous data looking at pollution levels,

204
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:51,590
again, focusing on particulate matter and in this case, PPM 2.5 in different communities by the time of the day.

205
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:55,940
So the gosh, I'm terrible with colors.

206
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:02,120
This greenish color kind of in the middle is on the east side of Detroit.

207
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:12,900
And you can see the trees over the course of the day. This orange color represents the monitor we had running in the southwest Detroit community.

208
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:23,450
Then this bluish color represents a specific component of particulate matter that we labeled as black carbon or soot.

209
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:32,060
And within urban areas especially, it ends up being a very good indicator of diesel particulate.

210
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:41,930
And so you can see these traces that we were monitoring at these at these community sites over the course of three years, its hourly data.

211
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:49,320
You take that data and say, OK, what's the average concentration over three years at midnight?

212
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,110
The average concentration at 1:00 a.m., 2:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m. and so forth.

213
00:25:54,110 --> 00:26:04,520
And so this is what this is the time scale on the bottom going from midnight through to the morning into the afternoon and then into the late evening.

214
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:09,830
And you can see what the average concentrations are. So a couple of observations.

215
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:15,500
The Southwest Detroit site on average is higher, right?

216
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:22,940
So that kind of that general hypothesis that we had as we're designing which communities to focus on where to make exposure,

217
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,430
suppose assessment measurements,

218
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:32,570
is that in the communities that are in closer proximity to local emission sources, that does those exposures would be higher.

219
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:38,330
Right. And so this kind of makes sense. And we see that in the data.

220
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:45,740
The black carbon, like you said, is indicative of this of this diesel soot exposure.

221
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:49,550
And so there's you see the magnitude BHEL.

222
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:55,790
So some pretty specific exposure profiles over the course of the day.

223
00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:03,560
So, you know, from, I don't know, maybe six a.m. until about 10:00 a.m., you know,

224
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:15,790
you see this on average gradual increase and then decrease and two point both on the Southwest community and then on the east side.

225
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:20,060
In addition, the black carbon component in the southwest community.

226
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:35,130
So why would there be, you know, a pretty pronounced increase between that roughly six to 10 a.m. time period each day on average?

227
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:42,490
So does OK, so that's two great observations.

228
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:50,870
So, Josh, as you know, perhaps it's because of diesel trucks and maybe there are patterns in the community during this time period.

229
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:58,060
Yes, the sun rises and. Wow, that's an awesome answer.

230
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:04,840
You're like a month and a half ahead and the material, we're going to cover that and go into great detail on it.

231
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:12,070
But yes, you're absolutely right. But just from a source perspective. So let's go back to what Josh is thinking of.

232
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:19,180
We started with the source. We have a physical source particulate matter that's coming from a synthetic or anthropogenic.

233
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:35,840
Why do we have this? Why is there a peak during a particular time of day in relation to the source?

234
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:42,270
Last night was wastebasket. Word of the Day starts around 6:00 a.m.

235
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:53,310
Juror. Absolutely. So maybe in contrast, just to some of the stationary sources, power plants are running 24/7 to generate electricity, right.

236
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:59,400
So there's smoke coming out of those smokestacks or particles coming out of those smokestacks, you know, pretty much around the clock.

237
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,180
But with vehicle traffic, right. In transportation, yes.

238
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,990
There's a rush. Kids going to school, people going to work.

239
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:15,660
And so it makes sense that, you know, there's this this pronounced increase in the concentrations during this morning time.

240
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:22,140
Right. All right. So now I'm going to ask which which was meant to be a little bit of a trick question.

241
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:32,390
But you've you've come out a little bit in advance. I'm going to go ahead and ask, why don't we see that same peak later in the afternoon, right.

242
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:36,900
To all of those people that went to work, come home eventually. Right. The schools come.

243
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:43,660
The kids come home from school. Go ahead and give your answer now.

244
00:29:43,660 --> 00:30:00,280
Yeah, so we'll discuss why this actually occurs, but very typically, the amount of er volume that pollutants can mix into early in the morning,

245
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:05,770
either before sunrise or right as the sun is rising, is actually quite low.

246
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:12,670
So there's an effective cap within the lower part of the atmosphere so that as pollutants are being emitted at the surface,

247
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:21,490
whether they're from a power plant or a stationary source or motor vehicles, it allows that concentration to build up quite high locally.

248
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:26,290
Whereas by the time you get later in the day, the sun has come out,

249
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:36,610
it actually much of the sun's rays are absorbed by the earth's surface and that's given off of as infrared energy.

250
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:40,720
And so you have a lot of vertical mixing within the atmosphere during the course of the day.

251
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:48,460
So by the time you get to the afternoon when it is time for everybody to get back in their cars, get back on the bus and go home.

252
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:54,040
There's now a much taller or higher effective carbon in the atmosphere.

253
00:30:54,040 --> 00:31:01,540
So even though it's perhaps the same amount of pollution being emitted, it has a greater volume to to kind of makes it into two.

254
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:06,940
And that's the reason why we don't see this same sort of peak later in the day.

255
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:12,010
And that doesn't make perfect sense. That was like a very brief overview.

256
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:17,780
We'll go into quite a bit of detail in our lecture that focuses on air quality and help a little bit later in the course.

257
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:22,720
But thank you for that. It's awesome. Answer any any questions.

258
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,480
Yes. Way the another. So you.

259
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,110
So we talked about these particles are so small, right.

260
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:38,290
That you can't see them. They're beyond our limited vision when you have enough of them together.

261
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:43,180
Right. You can actually see them. You can see a smog layer.

262
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:48,190
And this is very often when you see this right. It's early in the morning.

263
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:51,880
You can see like blue sky up above and then just a little bit further down.

264
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:59,290
Yeah, it's kind of dark. And also is the reason why we have some maybe some pretty sunrises or some pretty sunsets.

265
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:03,700
Right. That that kind of purply orangey, whatever color you get,

266
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:12,290
is from the particles that are in that lower layer of the atmosphere that are reflecting and reflecting, reflecting the light from the sun.

267
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:20,880
But yes, you're absolutely right. Any other questions or comments?

268
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:29,670
All right. And again, like I mentioned, many of these concepts and principles will we'll come back to you as the semester goes along,

269
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:36,750
continuing along our example now, bringing in that time activity and behavior component.

270
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:46,500
So we did actually gauge within this study of children with asthma what it is that they were actually doing.

271
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:52,170
So each hour of the day, we they were keeping a diary of their activities.

272
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:59,130
This plot is compiling it, distilling it down to some very basic information.

273
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:02,730
But it's distinguishing between how much time they spent at home.

274
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:08,910
This is in kind of the aqua blue color, how much time they were in school and the yellow color,

275
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:18,870
how much time they spent outdoors in this orangish color. And then the darker blue or purple kind of represents another indoor environment.

276
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:26,520
OK, so as you can see, based on basic observations, they spent about two thirds of their time at home.

277
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,020
They spent about the same amount of time at school.

278
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:36,540
This is breaking it down by season during the winter, spring and fall.

279
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:42,660
Less time at school in the summer. This makes sense, although there are kids that actually went to summer school.

280
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:49,020
So that's why we still have a significant contribution here during the summer.

281
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:57,090
Similarly, the kids spend more time outdoors in the summer late than they're doing in the winter.

282
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:08,130
The spring in the fall. So so why is it important to have this type of information on the kids from an exposure assessment perspective?

283
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:14,700
I see we're spending time with. Absolutely.

284
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:25,760
Absolutely. So if we know that there's a huge peak, right, on average between six and 10 a.m. and we say, wow,

285
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,640
we should be really worried about the kids with asthma in this community, especially during six to 10 a.m.

286
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,160
That's the obvious question as well. Well, where are they? What are they doing?

287
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,370
How what is their risk for exposure during this time period?

288
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:48,290
And so, yes, that's where this information becomes really useful to have, is that you need to take into account their time, activity and behavior.

289
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,590
This helps inform how we actually assess exposures. Right.

290
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,510
Who we're taking this information.

291
00:34:53,510 --> 00:35:00,080
If we know that they're sleeping in their bedroom with the windows closed in an air filtration system going in their bedroom,

292
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:08,990
even though the concentration is high outdoors. Right. We're not really assigning a very large amount of exposure to them during that time period.

293
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:14,570
Similarly, so this whole example has focused on an outdoors.

294
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:23,870
But, you know, we started with with this plot showing us that, like, OK, they spend two thirds of their time indoors at home.

295
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:29,570
So clearly their indoor environment is really important from an exposure assessment perspective.

296
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:39,560
And so looking at data from indoors, there are indoor sources of particles cooking in the kitchen.

297
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:46,910
Anyone that that smokes cigarets, right. Or anything else indoors, candles, fireplaces, all of these things,

298
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:54,980
even though individually they may be a relatively small amount of exposure within a close confines microenvironment like a bedroom,

299
00:35:54,980 --> 00:36:02,450
a living room or kitchen, there are opportunities for for quite high levels of exposure.

300
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:09,690
Uh, any questions about this kind of example that we've that we've talked to?

301
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:16,470
Yeah, just guess that is the largest source of cocaine in this particular example.

302
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:23,880
Yes, this one is focused around around sources within the kitchen, what the levels are within the kitchen.

303
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:29,250
And then also in this particular case, can they affect other rooms within the house?

304
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:33,090
And so this is in the kitchen itself.

305
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:39,380
And then this is measurements in a nearby living room where the smoke is still able to kind of like walked into.

306
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:51,000
And it's kind of like, well, it can be numerous things, gas, stoves, any any source of combustion, high temperature, generally speaking.

307
00:36:51,000 --> 00:37:00,880
Yes. Yeah. Any other questions or comments?

308
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:09,700
OK, so we're doing great on time. Yeah, it's a first and second week of classes.

309
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:17,680
All right. So we have an opportunity to explore our exposure to science in the news, this assignment.

310
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:27,370
Right. I'm going to get things going by sharing an example, an old example and multiple ways.

311
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:37,360
This is actually a paper that was published almost 40 years ago and the New England Journal of Medicine by one of my colleagues,

312
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:43,720
one of our emeritus faculty here at Environmental Health Sciences, Jerome Noriega,

313
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:50,710
where he postulated that lead poisoning contributed to the fall of the Roman Empire.

314
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:57,040
And I think I gave a very brief example last week around how some contaminants and lead was on

315
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:07,300
the on the schematic tend to be associated with communities with lower socioeconomic status.

316
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:12,160
Right. And that being exposed to higher levels of waste.

317
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,010
In this case, it's actually the opposite.

318
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:23,860
Or at least what professor argued found in his analysis is that it was the aristocrats that were that had all the luxuries,

319
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:35,710
that had the fine wines and the fine foods. One of the great things about the Roman civilization was its aqueducts.

320
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:42,490
And it was really kind of the first civilization for that had, you know, indoor plumbing and routing water.

321
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:46,780
And they used solid lead plates to do all of this.

322
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:55,690
And so the people, the people higher up on the socioeconomic status had access to this water,

323
00:38:55,690 --> 00:39:03,580
to that water was also used to to grow the grapes, to make the wines grow the food and so forth.

324
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:12,670
And so they were actually exposed to considerably higher levels of lead in relation to those lower socioeconomic status.

325
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:21,760
So anyway, Professor Nagu postulated that perhaps lead poisoning led to over time the fall of the Roman Empire.

326
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:28,240
That's my quick little exposure. Science in the news. Very old news to share with you.

327
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,920
But let's go ahead and launch into this exercise.

328
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:38,560
So hopefully each of you have brought with you an article that you found and

329
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:44,980
we're going to kind of build on this concept over the course of the semester. We have this exercise four times over the course of the semester.

330
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:54,700
This one, we're kind of starting like bare bones, simple stuff as we get more into exposure, assessment and exposure science in the processes.

331
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,460
I'm going to ask you to, yes. Find an article,

332
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:06,310
but now start to go into detail about all of the things kind of apply what you're learning class to the specific example article that you found.

333
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,450
All right.

334
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:18,770
So logistically, I'm going to ask you to break into groups and each student is going to have like five minutes to share your article with your group.

335
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:24,460
I'll kind of keep track of time and prompt you to go ahead and move to the next student in your group.

336
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:32,330
And then once we're once we're done, once everyone in your group has had a chance to to discuss what kind of reconvene,

337
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:41,500
and then I'll ask each group to kind of highlight what was maybe the most interesting article that was presented within your group.

338
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:51,430
It's not a contest. For the most part. You'll reach a consensus about which one you thought was most interesting or so let's go ahead and do that.

339
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:57,850
And I'm looking around the room and I'm trying to follow like a kind of covid exposure rules.

340
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:05,190
So we've got four, six and. Hmm, that's tough.

341
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:21,920
Loving. So maybe the four of you here, maybe the three of you kind of in the middle and before you over here,

342
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,380
feel free to make noise, but do whatever you need to do to be able to hear each other.

343
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,890
So if you do need to rearrange a little bit, you know, I'm OK with it.

344
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:38,930
But to the extent that you can try to keep a little bit of space in between, go ahead and get yourself situated.

345
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:46,850
Somebody can volunteer to kind of go first in your group and then I'll prompt you in about five minutes or so for when to shift to the network.

346
00:41:46,850 --> 00:42:04,960
Ready, set. Go. Yeah.

347
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:19,370
Some say.

348
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:51,270
Yeah. Yes. I'm not so sure that I don't know.

349
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:55,285
Steve. Not so.

350
00:42:56,461 --> 00:43:03,501
And so there's a city called Flat Rock and they were like smelling this weird chemical stench.

351
00:43:03,501 --> 00:43:12,741
And it was traced back to a fuel spill at Ford's assembly plant and thought they had contained it.

352
00:43:12,741 --> 00:43:18,081
But the gas had gone into the sewer and sanitary system through the city.

353
00:43:18,081 --> 00:43:24,621
And so the benzene vapors were coming up through the manholes and into people's homes.

354
00:43:24,621 --> 00:43:27,591
And some of the houses, it was like detected a chemical level.

355
00:43:27,591 --> 00:43:36,471
So they evacuated a certain zone and then kind of established a second one where they're investigating.

356
00:43:36,471 --> 00:43:42,501
Benzene is a potential carcinogen and then the short term.

357
00:43:42,501 --> 00:43:56,321
An irritant like. Today. Absolutely excellent.

358
00:43:56,321 --> 00:43:57,371
Oh, thank you.

359
00:43:57,371 --> 00:44:07,601
So, yeah, so this is I mean, locally here in Michigan, this is the the Flatrock assembly plant, which is part of Ford Motor Company, this huge,

360
00:44:07,601 --> 00:44:15,761
long, long running operation, like, I don't know how many hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of cars on produce there over the years.

361
00:44:15,761 --> 00:44:20,171
But this local community, it's affected some to just kind of picking up.

362
00:44:20,171 --> 00:44:27,251
And we'll do this with each group on what we covered today with regard to routes of exposure and exposure pathways.

363
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:28,391
And thank you for sharing it.

364
00:44:28,391 --> 00:44:38,241
But I'll open the question to anyone to answer what what would be the the route of exposure of concern for this particular example?

365
00:44:38,241 --> 00:44:46,081
Yes. So that would be a awesome answer for the exposure pathway.

366
00:44:46,081 --> 00:44:58,951
So when we pull back this slide, because I want to make sure that we're getting this across when I'm explaining it correctly.

367
00:44:58,951 --> 00:45:06,631
So when we're talking about the roots of exposure, right. This is actually how can it come into contact with us and get into our bodies?

368
00:45:06,631 --> 00:45:18,421
So the four primary options would be inhalation ingestion, skin absorption or just skin contact.

369
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:25,771
When we talk about the exposure pathways, yes, absolutely. The atmosphere in this case and I was going to be my next question.

370
00:45:25,771 --> 00:45:29,431
So you're already one step ahead. Thank you. With it.

371
00:45:29,431 --> 00:45:37,951
With benzene being a volatile chemical right through the air is really our our exposure pathway of concern.

372
00:45:37,951 --> 00:45:41,611
So back to back to route of exposure,

373
00:45:41,611 --> 00:45:51,751
what would we be concerned with with regards to the benzene as one of many actual chemicals within, you know, perhaps gasoline?

374
00:45:51,751 --> 00:45:59,911
Complete annihilation would probably be an obvious one, right, especially considering its its volatile nature as a chemical.

375
00:45:59,911 --> 00:46:04,021
Are there any others that would be, in this particular case, a concern?

376
00:46:04,021 --> 00:46:16,821
Any other routes of exposure? Yeah. Sure, so surface run off, right, this could be actually another exposure pathway and then perhaps,

377
00:46:16,821 --> 00:46:23,061
you know, one of these opportunities that could be ingested as part of the consumption of water.

378
00:46:23,061 --> 00:46:26,721
Excellent. OK, cool. Thank you so much for sharing that example.

379
00:46:26,721 --> 00:46:34,071
Let's go ahead and move to the group here in the center of the classroom that is actually worldwide.

380
00:46:34,071 --> 00:46:45,111
So it's about two more submarines from Russia and they were three accidents at one of the drafters.

381
00:46:45,111 --> 00:46:52,371
They like when it was like so high, that radiation you can see and some getting left in there.

382
00:46:52,371 --> 00:46:56,631
No one was in the middle of transport between boards and broke.

383
00:46:56,631 --> 00:47:07,881
And then I was out there as well as the radiation. Supposedly submarines are in our D.C., one of our background radiation from the steam.

384
00:47:07,881 --> 00:47:12,491
So and so it was a little.

385
00:47:12,491 --> 00:47:23,741
But a lot of scientists are worried that one day they won't just have, you know, your actors will stop and start seeing much, much more radiation.

386
00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:30,441
So what they're really worried about is more of life because they're like really so in that area.

387
00:47:30,441 --> 00:47:37,811
So by the police investigation taking that in and then they're saying, like The Hobbit is not,

388
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:46,481
for example, an article about 10 times more radioactive than we have now.

389
00:47:46,481 --> 00:47:53,191
So they are kind of just mitigating and seeing how we can transport it, reads it out to about 200 feet down.

390
00:47:53,191 --> 00:48:01,481
And so they're really worried about how do we do that as well as the radiation is contained.

391
00:48:01,481 --> 00:48:09,691
So right now, there's are not really any risk, but they're worried in the next 10, 30 years that we really need to start looking to.

392
00:48:09,691 --> 00:48:21,321
State has raised. Interesting note, thank you so much for sharing, not so nice contrast, right, the first example was a chemical agent.

393
00:48:21,321 --> 00:48:27,891
And so now this is an example of a physical agent, right, in the form of a radiation.

394
00:48:27,891 --> 00:48:30,591
So let's let's go through those two questions.

395
00:48:30,591 --> 00:48:37,851
And with apologies, maybe the correct order is to ask about exposure pathways first for this particular example,

396
00:48:37,851 --> 00:48:41,941
what would be the exposure pathways of concern for this radiation?

397
00:48:41,941 --> 00:48:48,241
Yeah, water is a concern, is there?

398
00:48:48,241 --> 00:48:55,261
And there the options can be, you know, in this particular example, they're very broad, right?

399
00:48:55,261 --> 00:48:59,501
The atmosphere, aquatic water bodies and so forth.

400
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:06,511
If you recall this one where we looked at the trial on methane's, you know, showering as in as an example of an exposure pathway.

401
00:49:06,511 --> 00:49:09,901
So they can be pretty well, pretty well defined. Yeah.

402
00:49:09,901 --> 00:49:13,921
So some water, right? I mean, just based on the location of these.

403
00:49:13,921 --> 00:49:20,551
But where are you going to where are you going to go further with that. Well you know what.

404
00:49:20,551 --> 00:49:30,391
Sure. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. It's.

405
00:49:30,391 --> 00:49:37,751
So, like, if you have the sediment, which is basically the soil below the water, actually.

406
00:49:37,751 --> 00:49:42,851
And the others and then what about those routes of exposure?

407
00:49:42,851 --> 00:49:57,761
What would be the ones of concern for this particular case? Remotely, they hear anything.

408
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:10,241
Main area for sure. So the combination of the water coming into contact with it and then also with the biota and bioaccumulation,

409
00:50:10,241 --> 00:50:16,691
certainly anyone who's eating that right ingestion would be a lot of exposure of concern as well.

410
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:21,081
Cool. Thank you again very much for sharing. Let's go ahead and move to the mystery.

411
00:50:21,081 --> 00:50:26,091
What did you all come up with? I guess so.

412
00:50:26,091 --> 00:50:35,091
I got a picture of the mysterious like in twenty, eighteen or seventeen years, bringing the news one out to the hallway.

413
00:50:35,091 --> 00:50:39,351
Five, six and seven have been thrown.

414
00:50:39,351 --> 00:50:45,381
But I'm sorry, this January sounds like a follow up process.

415
00:50:45,381 --> 00:50:56,611
I have a history with one letter you gave me on the news on this issue, and it's obviously about the media and their part to get on the down and over.

416
00:50:56,611 --> 00:51:03,311
And so was electroplating sort of building the factory and dangerous stuff?

417
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:11,371
Well, they put all their release into crazy and so it got under water on top of it all,

418
00:51:11,371 --> 00:51:21,371
which and grandma then also got stuck on the highway and probably also the.

419
00:51:21,371 --> 00:51:30,951
And so on and on and on from here on trichloroethylene, we lost our problems because of chromium and prostate cancer.

420
00:51:30,951 --> 00:51:41,311
They only had one device per year, but they found thirty one thousand micrograms per liter of water.

421
00:51:41,311 --> 00:51:48,351
And when they started playing it up and belted out trichloroethylene, which one is it?

422
00:51:48,351 --> 00:52:01,651
Five ago we had this. Interestingly enough, water the used as an did not give us the that will be lost,

423
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:15,391
you say there are some cities that are to on for and just say afterwards it was time for I didn't think I was going well.

424
00:52:15,391 --> 00:52:20,881
But there are other articles that kind saying that the investigators have money

425
00:52:20,881 --> 00:52:24,691
to do any further cleanup actually doing for the past they have been without.

426
00:52:24,691 --> 00:52:37,111
And so why I decided it's so toxic to put it in planes that are surrounded by water should be buried in front of the plane by the.

427
00:52:37,111 --> 00:52:45,481
Thanks very much for sharing, Josh, so yeah, and that actually so hexavalent chromium, this is the name is escaping me.

428
00:52:45,481 --> 00:52:50,101
The movie with Julia Roberts. With Erin Brockovich, right?

429
00:52:50,101 --> 00:52:56,671
Yep. So this is the containment of cancer in that movie, but very unfortunately, similar incidents.

430
00:52:56,671 --> 00:53:13,111
So what would be the exposure pathways likely of concern in this case?

431
00:53:13,111 --> 00:53:24,731
Yes, got water, so contamination of groundwater, right, with it being buried into the ground.

432
00:53:24,731 --> 00:53:33,161
Anything else? Yeah, soil for kind of obvious reasons right there, very close proximity.

433
00:53:33,161 --> 00:53:40,181
Any other thoughts on the as an actors in this stage of the campaign?

434
00:53:40,181 --> 00:53:45,771
Sure, yeah, absolutely. For anybody who's continuing to work at this at this location.

435
00:53:45,771 --> 00:53:53,861
Absolutely. Shifting now to those the roots of exposure, what we would be concerned about with these particular contaminants.

436
00:53:53,861 --> 00:54:03,861
Again, for the most part, these are chemical agents of concern. Yeah, and inhalation could be one.

437
00:54:03,861 --> 00:54:10,851
Absolutely. But my understanding and the hexavalent chromium is more of a of a contact or ingestion issue,

438
00:54:10,851 --> 00:54:18,201
but the TCE is absolutely something of concern in the air.

439
00:54:18,201 --> 00:54:28,081
What else might we be? Yeah, I think you water water may be people like my dad water.

440
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:35,551
Sure. Right, so anything else that's coming into contact, right, so maybe growing like gardens or whatever,

441
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:45,841
right in the vicinity of this area, this is really an area.

442
00:54:45,841 --> 00:54:56,491
Sure. So I guess more from an occupational setting or any worker who's kind of like assigned to to some sort of cleanup activity involved in it,

443
00:54:56,491 --> 00:55:04,411
maybe even someone who's collecting samples to to assess, you know, the spread of the of the contaminants in this area.

444
00:55:04,411 --> 00:55:08,941
All right. Thanks very much for your for your engagement and for your work on this.

445
00:55:08,941 --> 00:55:12,921
Hopefully, you know, the goal is not for this to be like a heavy load for you.

446
00:55:12,921 --> 00:55:18,201
You know, hopefully it'll give you a little bit of freedom to kind of pursue. Things are maybe more of interest to you.

447
00:55:18,201 --> 00:55:24,121
But like I mentioned, we'll do this a few more times over the course of this semester.

448
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:29,551
Any questions before we break class? Yes, I have a question for you, actually.

449
00:55:29,551 --> 00:55:37,051
Did they do anything like that? Well, I think so.

450
00:55:37,051 --> 00:55:38,241
In relation to this,

451
00:55:38,241 --> 00:55:52,411
there's a difference between the the that they were able to have that there is billions and billions of gallons of water out there.

452
00:55:52,411 --> 00:56:04,701
That is to. I don't know if they addressed it and what you read.

453
00:56:04,701 --> 00:56:19,111
Just curious because that just seems so outrageous. Yeah, they ought to be able to get them across three of our.

454
00:56:19,111 --> 00:56:27,521
Excellent question and thanks. Thanks again, Josh. Any other questions?

455
00:56:27,521 --> 00:56:31,511
All right. Hey, well, we're ahead of schedule. Let's enjoy it.

456
00:56:31,511 --> 00:56:39,681
It doesn't happen very often. I hope you guys have a great day and I'll see you again on Thursday.

457
00:56:39,681 --> 00:56:44,617
Thank you. Thank you.
