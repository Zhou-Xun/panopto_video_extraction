1
00:00:00,043 --> 00:00:04,748
When you talked about this a little bit and should okay.

2
00:00:04,748 --> 00:00:07,248
Just reflecting on you know, where we are today.

3
00:00:07,248 --> 00:00:11,952
What do you think biggest successes?

4
00:00:11,952 --> 00:00:14,251
>> Sure.

5
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:16,182
So I guess there's the technology and

6
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,025
then there's the policy is related to the technology.

7
00:00:19,025 --> 00:00:23,640
And I think high tech is in unqualified success in driving adoption of E HRS

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,955
particularly on the hospital side.

9
00:00:25,955 --> 00:00:29,821
I think with physician practises it's not done quite as well and

10
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,480
there's a whole bunch of reasons for that.

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,669
But I think, I mean the goal of the programme was to incentivise adoption and

12
00:00:37,669 --> 00:00:39,103
I think it did that.

13
00:00:39,103 --> 00:00:43,734
I think in terms of quality outcomes that the most robust evidence

14
00:00:43,734 --> 00:00:46,018
really is in the safety domain.

15
00:00:46,018 --> 00:00:50,670
And it's a challenge because it's not an area where we have good national data.

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,387
And so we haven't been able to study it in the same way as we can effectiveness

17
00:00:55,387 --> 00:00:56,505
process it here.

18
00:00:56,505 --> 00:01:00,291
And some of these other outcomes where we have better national data available but

19
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,301
we have and now have.

20
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:05,953
So many studies that show I think pretty consistently that the medication

21
00:01:05,953 --> 00:01:07,312
safety is improved.

22
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:09,410
That's it's an important domain.

23
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,183
So I don't think it's nothing but

24
00:01:11,183 --> 00:01:14,374
it's I think it falls far short of what we had hoped health IT.

25
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:18,020
Would do, which would be to really transform all domains and quality and

26
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,706
I don't think we've seen that.

27
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:25,178
>> And so you also mentioned in the lecture there

28
00:01:25,178 --> 00:01:31,084
were projections for you know the HRS health IT.

29
00:01:31,084 --> 00:01:33,000
To save lots of money saved billions.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,752
Right?

31
00:01:33,752 --> 00:01:39,723
And actually that same brand group a couple of years ago did a postmortem.

32
00:01:39,723 --> 00:01:40,736
Right?

33
00:01:40,736 --> 00:01:46,510
And they said, well, we came up with these estimates and we were wrong.

34
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:52,840
What are some of the reasons why those kind of efficiency benefits,

35
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,072
how they haven't materialised?

36
00:01:56,072 --> 00:01:59,982
>> Yeah, I think there's perhaps two primary reasons.

37
00:01:59,982 --> 00:02:05,211
I mean I think one is that all of these big projections assume the best case

38
00:02:05,211 --> 00:02:10,801
scenario in which everyone had adopted and was sort of using IT effectively.

39
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:14,684
And I think that we haven't, first of all, we haven't reached nationwide adoption and

40
00:02:14,684 --> 00:02:18,260
particularly when you think about the information exchange piece which is really

41
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,320
a network technology.

42
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,018
If you have a lot of nodes that are not yet on the network,

43
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:24,154
you can't sort of realise those benefits.

44
00:02:24,154 --> 00:02:28,638
And so I think that's we just haven't gotten to the level of

45
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:31,069
adoption that they projected.

46
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:38,099
And I think the second piece is that the technology itself is not that great.

47
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:43,019
One of the criticisms of high tech was that it sort of incentivised relatively

48
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,053
adoption of relatively immature technology.

49
00:02:46,053 --> 00:02:48,159
Right? If you go into most hospitals didn't look

50
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,035
at their electronic health record, you do not think that it looks from a sort of

51
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:55,464
usability perspective anything like your iphone or anything else.

52
00:02:55,464 --> 00:02:58,671
That's really been designed, you know in a in a you know,

53
00:02:58,671 --> 00:03:03,199
considered human factors and all these other sort of best practises that we know.

54
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,185
But the money was available, we bought the systems that were on the market at

55
00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:09,502
that point in time which were not fabulous.

56
00:03:09,502 --> 00:03:13,470
And so I think part of the reason we also haven't seen the benefits is because

57
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,071
the systems themselves sort of aren't 21st century technology.

58
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:20,335
So I think there's a real and that's frankly another reason that people have

59
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:22,557
really argued for pulling back on meaningful uses.

60
00:03:22,557 --> 00:03:27,193
Because for both vendors and providers it takes a certain amount of resources to

61
00:03:27,193 --> 00:03:29,973
just adhere to all the standards and criteria.

62
00:03:29,973 --> 00:03:33,495
And I think the question is if we pull back on those, would it create some

63
00:03:33,495 --> 00:03:37,682
bandwidth to really improve the systems themselves and the workflows around them?

64
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:40,532
That I think could be a second really key piece.

65
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:43,311
And most of those model based projections like didn't even,

66
00:03:43,311 --> 00:03:46,625
I don't even think usability was like factored in [LAUGH] as something that

67
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,237
could really impact the benefits.

68
00:03:48,237 --> 00:03:51,366
But bad technology is not gonna be.

69
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:52,853
>> Right.

70
00:03:52,853 --> 00:03:57,517
So let me ask you about standardisation because this is a major issue with

71
00:03:57,517 --> 00:03:58,291
health I T.

72
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:03,339
Write that for interoperability is what we want

73
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:11,295
technology to be able to communicate across setting across modes of care.

74
00:04:11,295 --> 00:04:15,872
So this has really been like one of those areas that has

75
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:18,422
fallen short in a lot of ways.

76
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:20,029
It could have been predicted, right?

77
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:25,257
Because we haven't had the regular standards that other countries for

78
00:04:25,257 --> 00:04:27,094
instance have adopted.

79
00:04:27,094 --> 00:04:30,826
So I guess my question to you is,

80
00:04:30,826 --> 00:04:36,091
what do you see this problem being resolved?

81
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:37,387
Yeah.

82
00:04:37,387 --> 00:04:43,043
And if not at a kind of national level, are there viable workarounds

83
00:04:43,043 --> 00:04:49,110
that are being developed to deal with these kind of standards problems?

84
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,640
>> Sure.

85
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,142
So I think that the one mistake we made was assuming

86
00:04:55,142 --> 00:05:00,910
that interoperability could follow HRS adoption.

87
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,579
That we could start with adopting HRS and

88
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:07,593
then essentially bolt on interoperability after the fact.

89
00:05:07,593 --> 00:05:12,566
And I think that did not really appreciate the, it's not just the complexity but

90
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:16,825
it's the precision that's needed to get interoperability right.

91
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:18,957
Right. Like if you're dealing in a world

92
00:05:18,957 --> 00:05:23,726
of standards and it's not just standards in the sense of like do standards exist.

93
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:28,854
Its standards in the sense that they have to be implemented with 100% perfection,

94
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:29,354
right?

95
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:31,066
Like one decimal places off.

96
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:33,103
And like the computers like I don't know what to do with this [LAUGH] information.

97
00:05:33,103 --> 00:05:33,972
Right.

98
00:05:33,972 --> 00:05:38,450
And so that's really where we've seen the biggest challenge is not lack of

99
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:43,156
standards that sort of lack of ability to consistently implement standards.

100
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:48,034
And then that's I think it's one of the reasons why interoperability was always

101
00:05:48,034 --> 00:05:49,119
going to be hard.

102
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:53,743
But to now have that was frankly thousands of different systems that are out there

103
00:05:53,743 --> 00:05:56,536
that each have captured data in a different way.

104
00:05:56,536 --> 00:05:58,995
And then try to bolt on that perfection and

105
00:05:58,995 --> 00:06:03,009
execution of standards is like is where we're really struggling.

106
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:04,666
So I think that's a fixable problem.

107
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,562
It's just gonna take time.

108
00:06:06,562 --> 00:06:10,040
I mean, and I think the standards community, from what I can tell, it's like

109
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,679
really committed to helping figure out where there are these inconsistencies and

110
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:15,803
how standards are implemented and solve them.

111
00:06:15,803 --> 00:06:20,052
So I mean that is a technical problem that I think can will be solved over time.

112
00:06:20,052 --> 00:06:23,724
But I think there's a much broader issue around like what does good

113
00:06:23,724 --> 00:06:25,441
interoperability look like?

114
00:06:25,441 --> 00:06:30,641
Is it everyone sharing everything with everyone or is it a more narrow set of,

115
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:34,166
problems, medications, medication allergies.

116
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,365
I think one of the challenges is like we've never really been clear on

117
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:38,035
the end goal.

118
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:41,178
Like how do we know when we can say, victory [LAUGH] achieved and

119
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:44,213
we have interoperability and so there's a lot of efforts.

120
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:48,773
I mean, everyone agrees that we have to get interoperability better,

121
00:06:48,773 --> 00:06:52,117
but there's not a lot of coordinated action because

122
00:06:52,117 --> 00:06:55,765
there's no goal that we're all trying to work towards.

123
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:58,595
[LAUGH] I think the other problem related to that

124
00:06:58,595 --> 00:07:01,435
though is also the quality of the data itself.

125
00:07:01,435 --> 00:07:03,359
Right? And so now we're seeing a lot of

126
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:07,341
interoperability in certain pockets of the health care system.

127
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:09,670
But they're saying, well I get this information and

128
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,921
it's just not usable to me.

129
00:07:10,921 --> 00:07:14,719
And so again that we haven't really solved the problem that the information is moving

130
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:15,729
but it's not usable.

131
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:18,525
So there's like a lot of different challenges that have to be addressed

132
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:19,700
again, interoperability.

133
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,577
Right? >> And you've also done some work recently

134
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:27,539
about how vendors themselves might their own

135
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:31,512
interests might be an arduous inter Africa.

136
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:34,929
>> Yeah, I think there's always been questions about financial incentives and

137
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:35,870
interoperability.

138
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,229
We haven't been really clear on.

139
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:40,531
Is are the incentives perverse or are they just weak?

140
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:42,550
Right. So perverse incentives mean that vendors

141
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,004
and providers actually want to actively interfere with interoperability and

142
00:07:46,004 --> 00:07:48,424
weak incentives just means that we're working on it.

143
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:50,281
It's just not at the top of our list.

144
00:07:50,281 --> 00:07:54,295
And until I think we're really clear on which incentive and again it's probably

145
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:58,489
not blanket like for some PHR vendors they may actually have perverse incentives and

146
00:07:58,489 --> 00:08:00,635
others, they just have weak incentives.

147
00:08:00,635 --> 00:08:04,651
And so I think there's been a lot of uncertainty around what the incentive

148
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,507
situation is.

149
00:08:05,507 --> 00:08:06,007
I think it's clear no one has really strong incentives to make interoperability

150
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:10,517
happen. But I think a lot of the key players at

151
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:14,575
least have weak incentives. And

152
00:08:14,575 --> 00:08:19,867
that's what we're frankly trying to fix with health reform and

153
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:22,229
more risk based payment. But

154
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:26,655
it's also a problem that not an individual A C O is not gonna fix our ability for

155
00:08:26,655 --> 00:08:29,254
the nation, right? It's this network that gets back to this

156
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:31,778
network technology piece. And so I think a lot of a C O S.

157
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,103
Are like we would love it if the

158
00:08:33,103 --> 00:08:37,970
probability worked but it's not working. And so we're gonna just work around it and

159
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,716
try to do the best we can. And that's where like you see them

160
00:08:41,716 --> 00:08:46,040
investing in ABT notification. Like it's sort of a simple clean piece of

161
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,994
interoperability that solves a real pain point.

162
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:50,719
But no one feels like that's like all of

163
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:54,581
interoperability, right? That's just one piece of information

164
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:57,879
that's really quite simple to exchange. And so

165
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,767
we see that taking off. So again,

166
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:00,657
that's [LAUGH] a good thing. But

167
00:09:00,657 --> 00:09:03,567
it's not everything. >> Yeah.

168
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:04,159
And but

169
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,798
it also gets to your point about what is what do we need and

170
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:13,162
what is the ultimate level. Not everyone needs to see everything.

171
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:15,879
And maybe the system is gonna end up

172
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:20,104
focusing on those things that really are essential.

173
00:09:20,104 --> 00:09:22,613
And we'll figure out interoperability for

174
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:26,493
those things. Some of the other things that harder and

175
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:29,947
lower yields won't get fixed in their term.

176
00:09:29,947 --> 00:09:31,775
And maybe we can live with that, right?

177
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:34,057
>> But I think about policy perspective it

178
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:38,895
would really help to be clear on these are the near term priorities with probability

179
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:41,256
and like let's work towards those. And

180
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:46,134
I do think it's been a real challenge that sort of the policy framework, a meaningful

181
00:09:46,134 --> 00:09:50,354
use hasn't at least help focused what we're all trying to work towards.
