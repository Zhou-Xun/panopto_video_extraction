1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:07,210
Okay. So good morning. I had a good weekend.

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,330
So we're kind of like after today, three lectures away from Exam three.

3
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:23,969
I know you guys had the cancer lecture to watch last week, so let me know if you have any questions.

4
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,830
And we can maybe go over some brief point, make some teaching.

5
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,760
So maybe on 1129, when we go over that,

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:44,980
the genetics part I did to give back the exam to act two and it was should should have been open all of yesterday for you.

7
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:53,030
Look at the comments and the correct answers. So also let me know if you have questions or you want to talk through some parts.

8
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,420
Let me see. So today we have Dr. Jennifer Smith here.

9
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,579
So to talk to us about gene gene interactions and gene interactions.

10
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,370
So that's Gene was my advisor and my mentor.

11
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,399
Now is my hope as a postdoc. She usually teaches this class.

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,670
So we're grateful for her to take the time to come here and talk to us about this topic.

13
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:32,309
So and she's going to be coming again next week to talk to us about some kind of maybe high level summary, Applied Genomics and Multi-omics.

14
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:42,240
So so I'm going to turn to her and it's great.

15
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:53,430
Hey, guys, it's good to be here. As for outside, Dr. Evans said, I'm on sabbatical this year, so it means I don't have to teach.

16
00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:01,649
But yeah, this is the course I think I've taught really eight or nine years before this year.

17
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:11,610
And it's been really cool to watch, watch my my postdoc for I pick this up, but I love teaching and so it's fun to be back just for this day.

18
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,919
So someone to talk to me about gene environment interactions.

19
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,239
I know you guys have learned a lot about genetics at this point, right?

20
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:28,920
So you you you understand that there is this genetic basis of disease, there's disease susceptibility.

21
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,620
You've learned about gwas, which is always a favorite thing that I like to talk about,

22
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,180
and we'll probably come back around in some shape or form in next week's lecture.

23
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:48,780
I love that because we can identify genetic mutations or also that have an effect on disease

24
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,940
susceptibility and sometimes other things like disease progression or other traits.

25
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,640
But then, you know, it's just one piece of the puzzle, right?

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,270
So genetics, we thought we had all these hopes and dreams about genetics and how it was just kind of like revolutionize medicine and, you know,

27
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:18,299
give us all these clues into biology, which it it's done a lot of that, but it's not always the greatest in terms of like prediction, right?

28
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:26,070
Like who's going to get disease and things like that. And a lot of that has to do with the stuff we're going to talk about today.

29
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,650
It's like understanding genetics in context of of of how it's operating.

30
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:40,379
And so today we're going to specifically talk about gene environment interactions and then briefly touch on changing interactions,

31
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:45,000
which you can kind of apply a lot of the concepts that we're talking about energy.

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,300
BI To the gene gene scenario as well.

33
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:57,120
So I kind of like to think about it going back to this basic question, you may have heard of this before, nature versus nurture, right?

34
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:02,070
Like is it our genes that predispose us to disease is our environment?

35
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,220
And how do they how do they play together?

36
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:16,770
One of my favorite things to really to say about disease and human traits is actually it's not an either or question.

37
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:25,290
So almost everything you can think of has some genetic basis and some environmental basis, and it's kind of a spectrum, right?

38
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,810
So like. You can think about.

39
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,659
We'll come back to this example later.

40
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:37,750
And I know you've heard a ton about this already, but like if you think about something like PKU, right, we think about that like a genetic disease.

41
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,820
It's a mutation, you know, it's a homozygous mutations.

42
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,319
It's purely genetic. But that's not actually true. Right?

43
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,719
Like you can have the genotype, but if you don't ingest phenylalanine, it actually has.

44
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,300
No. Like there's no bad outcome.

45
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:02,150
Right. So it's actually genetic and environmental. And then you kind of think like the other extreme.

46
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,790
It's like, okay, so this is this is a story for you.

47
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,910
This is not a disease. But here's the example.

48
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:20,720
So one time it was probably like four or five years ago it had been snowing and there was ice everywhere.

49
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:30,140
And like the back door at asp hsh2 there there's there was like this runoff where it had caused this huge ice slick.

50
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:38,390
So me being the person that I am, like I'm reading a paper or something like trying to walk out to my car and I slipped and fell and hit my head.

51
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:45,139
And this is this is a thing where you're like, oh, like, that's totally environmental, right?

52
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,760
Like, okay, injury. It's environmental.

53
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:57,450
Well, it's also partially probably genetic because my personality is that or my like the way that I think is I don't notice things in front of me,

54
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,889
but I'm really smart in some ways, but I'm completely non observant.

55
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,310
So that I feel like is probably more like an innate trait, right?

56
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,430
That caused or potentially like led to this injury.

57
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:12,319
So that's we can kind of think of this spectrum right where everything is on this

58
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:23,990
continuum and this became like more of a way that people started looking at things,

59
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:31,700
I think around like maybe 30 years ago when the CDC started, maybe 20 to 30 years ago,

60
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,120
when the CDC really started to, you know, focus on this gene environment interaction thing.

61
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:50,420
Right. And so this is the little picture that they did where they're kind of talking about, you know, we've got this sort of triangle or this.

62
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:58,610
It's also almost like these things are all interacting together where you've got the genetics, you've got environment.

63
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:07,069
And this is like a very like a very specific kind of environment or you're talking about like pollution, you know,

64
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:13,850
air pollution, hazardous waste, smoking, like things that you really think of as like a like toxic environment.

65
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:19,219
But when we think about environment generally, we can think about that very broadly.

66
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:26,060
And actually as a geneticist, a lot of times when we say environment, we mean anything that's not genetic, right?

67
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:34,280
So it could be social factors or it could be like your biochemistry, like, for example, your cholesterol levels.

68
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,560
It could be many, many, many different things, right? Stress, it could be a lot of things.

69
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:46,309
And that those are kind of interacting together in all the different diseases that we can think about.

70
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:54,830
And I like this picture in a way because it shows like both a newborn and someone who is not a newborn who's been around a long time.

71
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:59,810
And it's kind of that life course idea, right? Like these things are operating across a life course.

72
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,049
And so, you know, I kind of like to think about it in this way.

73
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,640
It's like, well, what do we know about biological systems?

74
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:17,390
Like, let's bring it back to the basic biology. We know that they're multi-level, right?

75
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,809
We know that they're dynamic. They don't stay static over time.

76
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:26,570
They're always changing. We know that they're relationship based and redundant and sensitive to context.

77
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:35,629
Right. So, for example, we can look at this side of this picture here and here we've got like the

78
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,350
population in the individual and those are always interacting with each other.

79
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:43,129
So I think you guys are going to talk a little bit next week about epigenetics and

80
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:48,080
some of the social factors and stressors that happen at the population level,

81
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,180
like, for example, structural racism, right? Like that's absorbed by the individual.

82
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:58,070
And then the individual also contributes to those population level things, right?

83
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,359
And within the individual you have, you know,

84
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:10,070
sort of like this hierarchical system where you've got the organ and tissue and under that like they all have their own physiology.

85
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:17,240
And then we think about genetics and also biochemistry is sort of mind below that.

86
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:25,729
And the reason that I sort of bring this up is because we've got this system where you've got the genes and we've studied so much,

87
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:34,639
these genes sequences, right? And the sequences are going to they're going to be important for the transcription

88
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,060
of those genes and they're going to be important for the function of the proteins.

89
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:46,580
Right. And so you have like how much the genes are expressed, you have how well the proteins work.

90
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,960
And then over here you've got this whole metabolism thing going on, like the biochemistry, like genetics is how you know.

91
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,280
How fast reactions are happening, for example.

92
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,860
And ultimately, this is all happening within cells.

93
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,570
Right? So down here, this is a cell when you've got the nucleus.

94
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,680
And, you know, we have here on the outside,

95
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:21,499
like nutrients can trigger a can trigger underlying changes or downstream changes in the expression of genes.

96
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,360
Right. So genes are only expressed when they have a trigger, right?

97
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,279
So you can have all the changes in the DNA sequence in the world,

98
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:34,040
but those aren't going to come to fruition until you get this signal to like sort of transcribe them, right?

99
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:40,880
So so even within the cells, there's these complex systems where you've got like all these different signals coming in.

100
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:48,110
And then how does that translate into transcription factors, which are what actually causes the genes to be expressed, right?

101
00:10:48,890 --> 00:11:00,470
So it's like, ah, us in our communities, like our organs and tissues within our body and then our cells are all these super complex systems, right?

102
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:07,610
And with even within those systems there is our redundancy, right?

103
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:16,040
So if you have, for example, like you've already learned that if you have a heterozygous heterozygous phenotype,

104
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:25,549
a lot of times your body functions just fine. And there is because there's another copy there, another copy to actually fill that gap.

105
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:35,240
And then what we'll see later is I just give a brief example of bacteria and how a lot of times they have redundant genes.

106
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,760
So if one gene gets knocked out, they have something else that can then come in and take its place.

107
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,079
Or you can also think about things like Shunt Pathways that you might have learned about.

108
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:54,090
I think you talked about that with PKU, right? If that if if you're not able to process well, in one way it gets sent somewhere else, right?

109
00:11:54,110 --> 00:12:03,499
So there's all this redundancy. So my point here is that it's really important to incorporate that redundancy.

110
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:09,829
So study and collections of agents that are related to each other studying from the core screen.

111
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:18,500
So like the big 10,000 foot view to like the ground level view to the fine grain and to systematically study context.

112
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,090
And so this is an example from.

113
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,570
Sorry. I'm just a little not quite used to being awake this early.

114
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:43,480
This is an example from sort of model organism genetics and it was from now 110 years ago, so really a long time ago.

115
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:50,350
And this was a demonstration, one of the first demonstrations of what we call a norm of reaction.

116
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,460
And this is the basis of how we think about gene environment interaction.

117
00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:01,270
So there was this guy, I think he was a monk, actually, and he's studying worms, some kind of worm.

118
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:08,140
And what he was interested in is like how worms respond to their environment.

119
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:18,129
Okay. And so he had different species of worm or actually, I don't know if it was different species.

120
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:23,920
It was three different genetic strains, I guess probably the same species of worm, but like a different genetic background.

121
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:35,320
And he was really interested in looking at when you put these different genetic background worms in different levels of food availability,

122
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,140
for example, did they react differently?

123
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:47,440
And so here you can see they for the A, B and C, genetic backgrounds of worms, when he put them in a low food environment,

124
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:54,240
they all kind of responded the same way in the phenotype here that they're looking at as head size relative to body size.

125
00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:01,690
So how much energy is the animal devoting to, you know, like growing its head, its brain versus its body?

126
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:08,199
And in the low environment, it was always about 30% of of the body for all these worms.

127
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,300
But then when you move to the minimal amount of food or an average amount of food,

128
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:20,720
one of the strains of Worm actually responded to that by growing a head that was bigger, a much bigger.

129
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,820
So it's like 70% of the size of the body.

130
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:31,090
Right. And so this one had a different reaction than the other two.

131
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:37,930
And then if you put it in a high food availability, the and B, strains look similar and the C looks different.

132
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:45,160
Right. The C doesn't ever really respond by growing its head bigger or it does just a little bit.

133
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:52,380
But the other two have things like threshold effects almost where they just are like, Oh, we got to we got to get our head big now.

134
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,780
So you can see this is kind of the basis of gene environment.

135
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:01,780
Interaction is like depending on your genetic background, you're going to do something different when you're in a specific environment.

136
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:14,020
And we can think about this idea of like the normal reaction or like what is the path of reaction to all these different environments.

137
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,940
And we can think about it as sort of like this sensitivity level.

138
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:27,129
Right. And so, for example, we can characterize these reaction times, you know,

139
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:37,870
very generally by thinking about plasticity or how malleable is your expression of a trait based on your environment.

140
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:47,739
And so one way is that you might be completely malleable right now on plastic.

141
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:55,780
So you're basically fixed. It doesn't matter what your environment is for this genotype group, they're not going to respond to anything.

142
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:04,360
Right. And then there's another kind of possible path, which could be a plastic path, but a linear response.

143
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:13,060
Right. So like a dose response. So at each level of the environment, we get a stronger response or a stronger change in the trait value.

144
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,560
And then, of course, in reality, these norms of reaction can have basically any shape.

145
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:26,079
I mean, so here's another example of a plastic response.

146
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,650
So it's changeable, but it's nonlinear, right?

147
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:37,180
So for a while, as the environment increases, you get a rise in the level of trait, but then at some point it completely levels off.

148
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:42,420
Right. That's just an example. But you could you could imagine a U-shaped reaction.

149
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,940
You could imagine a threshold of fact where it's no change.

150
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,550
Then all of a sudden it's a high change or something like that.

151
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:55,480
And so so this concept is going to form our basis of, you know, gene environment interaction.

152
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:08,050
So I really like this picture because I think it shows a lot of different pieces and one kind of nice conceptual diagram.

153
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:13,629
So what's going on here is you have two different genotype groups.

154
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:25,690
So imagine, let's imagine that this is at birth and this is sort of like over time in space, what's happening to these?

155
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:37,239
People in their trajectory. And the phenotype we're looking at is something like, I don't know, let's say it's hypertension.

156
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,250
And if you this could be like their distribution of blood pressure.

157
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:48,430
And here's the threshold for where we say, okay, this person is sick or they're hypertensive,

158
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:52,450
and then these people have various blood pressures, but they're healthy.

159
00:17:53,290 --> 00:18:01,030
So when you start on this time space continuum, there might be some differential susceptibility, right?

160
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,300
So you might have a, you know,

161
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:12,220
a genetic factor that predisposes you to have higher blood pressure regardless of anything that's happening in the environment.

162
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,960
And you can see that here,

163
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:25,480
this small a small group or person is starting like location in terms of like where their blood pressure is probably going to end up.

164
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,450
Right. So this one, we do gwas or something like that.

165
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:33,340
We're looking for this sort of baseline susceptibility when we don't even think about environments.

166
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:47,559
And that's the difference here. And then if you imagine over time, maybe they have, you know, environments that make them sicker.

167
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:52,330
So these are two different people who are big a, big A, and as they move through their life,

168
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:58,240
maybe they're doing things that make them like more risky, like they're not exercising or whatever.

169
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,860
And so and then this person maybe is like has a really good environment.

170
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:08,680
So they're eating healthy and they're exercising. And then you kind of get to like some space and time.

171
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:17,200
And if you look at these two people now, this cone is representing possible trajectories, right?

172
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:27,780
So this guy on the top, like there comes a point where pretty much whatever he does, he's probably going to have hypertension, right?

173
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:35,829
Like so our possible norm of reaction and where we end up on the sicker,

174
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:42,070
healthy space is a function of both where we start and like what's happening over time, right?

175
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:50,320
So at this point, this person could end up anywhere along this continuum depending on like if they change their environment or not.

176
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:56,380
Whereas this person who has the same genotype, even if they now start living a really unhealthy lifestyle,

177
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,590
they're probably never going to get hypertension, let's just say. Right.

178
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:07,960
And you also see how for these big people, this cone is actually bigger than this small, small.

179
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:15,639
Right. And so that's kind of indicating that this genotype group is more responsive to the environment in general.

180
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:26,320
Right. They have a bigger space to move because of their environment, whereas the smaller, smaller, you know, they're not quite as plastic.

181
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,460
And so I feel like this is kind of the important concept.

182
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:40,030
And the other thing that I feel like that comes up here that's really important is, you know, we're talking about genetics.

183
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:48,770
We're here in the context of genetics, genetics, genetics. But what actually is the change agent here is the environment, right?

184
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:51,820
Like we don't change people's genetics generally.

185
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:59,890
Right. You probably heard a little bit about gene therapy and stuff, but like that's that's kind of the exception rather than the rule.

186
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,770
Like, we don't change genetics, we change the environment.

187
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:07,780
And we want to understand how people of different Jewish types will respond to different environments.

188
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:17,200
Right? So when we kind of unpack this a little bit, this is just one example really,

189
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:24,220
or like maybe I'll say like the two main categories of how we expect people to maybe respond to an environment.

190
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:31,930
So this is more from the like psychology, the psychology way of thinking about it,

191
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:39,370
where they call them differential susceptibility, which is here on the left hand side.

192
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:47,190
And that's sort of more the super plasticity model versus this idea of the dialysis stress model.

193
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,230
So if we're talking about something like a stressful environment,

194
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:58,670
we can look down here and this is the environment or the experience can be negative or positive.

195
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:07,210
So for example, when we get to the cast paper, you know, they talked about stressful life events like for example,

196
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,770
like abuse in childhood and let's just say so that's a negative experience.

197
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,169
But then you could imagine like the opposite of that, which is more positive experience,

198
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:21,730
like parents who are super, super supportive or like really understood their kids.

199
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:33,340
All right. So then you have you have those two different potential environmental experiences or it could be a spectrum, right?

200
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,699
And then the outcome could be either negative or positive.

201
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:45,339
So drawing from cast B again like the negative could be developing depression in the positive could be, I don't know,

202
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:54,940
like having a super great outlook on life where you every day post affirmations to Facebook or whatever I probably just showed my age,

203
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,149
guys, I don't know if you use Facebook, so only social media.

204
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:07,390
I have. Okay. All right. So, you know, so this idea is sort of like, all right, the differential susceptibility,

205
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:14,260
you see the response in different genotype groups, both in the negative and the positive environment.

206
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,780
Right? So there's one genotype group which is more fixed or nonresponsive.

207
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:27,580
It doesn't matter what environment they're in, they're always going to have the same probability of developing depression or eternal cheerfulness.

208
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:35,230
And then then you have a malleable or a plastic individual that responds to the environment, even the positive environment.

209
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:41,770
And the guy this is stress model. The way that we think about it is a little bit different.

210
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:49,389
So you have a resilient individual who is the same as the sort of fixed individual, like they just but if you notice, it's a little bit higher up.

211
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:54,820
Like they're always pretty good. The resilient individual is always doing good no matter what environment they're in.

212
00:23:55,390 --> 00:24:01,360
And the vulnerable individual is sensitive to this negative environment and they'll do worse.

213
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,299
But they're resilient. Individual will be okay. Right.

214
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:12,910
And so it's kind of like, well, which of these things are operating depends a little bit on, you know,

215
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,890
depends a lot on like what outcome you're looking at and how you're characterizing the environment.

216
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:25,540
But the one of the important things here is like you see that there's this like crossover pattern that happens here,

217
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:32,310
whereas on this one it's almost like a fan shape or like a like a triangle shape, right?

218
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,660
They're kind of medium, medium in this spot of the outcome in fine.

219
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:43,630
Right. So those are two different ways that we can think about or investigate.

220
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,520
Do you environment interactions?

221
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:59,160
So so this was just you know, this is we can go through this quick, an example of coronary artery disease from a complex systems perspective.

222
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,680
I got to ask a question, actually. There's like three different clocks in here.

223
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,790
Which one is right? This one. This one? No, I'm all right.

224
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:11,820
It's nine. It's 850. Okay. And it goes until ten.

225
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,780
915. Okay. Because this one says 923.

226
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,620
And I was like, really? That slow? All right.

227
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:27,810
So then this is the thinking about the risk of something called coronary artery disease.

228
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:33,360
So this is like what actually happens before you have a heart attack, right?

229
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:45,360
So you're you have atherosclerosis that builds up in your arteries and like what actually changes risk of of coronary artery disease?

230
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:52,680
Well, there's a lot of things going on, right. So we know that the genome these are supposed to be a little chromosomes here.

231
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:57,800
The genome is going to contribute to that in a lot of ways.

232
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:04,950
Right. And we know this from gwas of coronary artery disease and we know this from like animal studies and other studies.

233
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:10,590
Right. So the genome can influence the metabolism of sugars or carbohydrates.

234
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:21,480
It can influence hemostasis or like the regulation of like the fluids moving in and out,

235
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:30,420
the regulation of blood pressure itself and lipid metabolism, which is like your cholesterol and things like that.

236
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:34,210
So there's all these different things that your genome can contribute to.

237
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:40,709
And then in addition to that, you've got your environment which is interacting with all of these different pieces.

238
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:48,780
And sometimes these themselves can act as the environment on on the genetic effects.

239
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:56,910
Right? And so so this idea is exactly what I just already said with the, with the plasticity model.

240
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:04,950
It it's just drawn a little bit differently. So you've got on this axis, like how much your arteries are kind of clogged.

241
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:10,200
Right. The beginning of atherosclerosis as it happens.

242
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:16,739
And here's where you are at high risk for heart attack on this axis, which is kind of like the Z axis.

243
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,940
Here you have the environment is kind of go in a cross this way.

244
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:27,780
So like bad environment to good environment. And then you have what's happening over time, like a person's age.

245
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:38,760
And this is like kind of an extension of the idea that we showed before where now we're thinking about a reaction surface for an individual person.

246
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:43,530
Right. So it's it's happening over time. It's happening across environment.

247
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:50,519
And that plane of like where you end up changes across both of those pieces of time and space.

248
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:58,919
And the important thing here is like you, you can have all these different environmental things.

249
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:08,160
And so they're showing somebody here in red who started out at a young age with like a healthy environment, like they're sleeping or exercising.

250
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:11,249
Then it kind of got worse, like they're eating hamburgers.

251
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:16,500
So there's a lot of stress, but like sometimes they're doing their leisure activities and playing golf or whatever.

252
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:21,630
And then here they're smoking and they're, you know, eating poorly.

253
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:30,370
So you can watch on that reaction surface. The person is kind of like climbing in the bad environment side.

254
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:36,360
Right? And they're more they're, you know, at greater risk for heart attack.

255
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:43,790
But then here are like you can imagine these environmental interventions and how that trajectory might look different.

256
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:52,170
Right. They can move along the reaction surface if we intervene early enough where they still have a chance of being healthy.

257
00:28:52,170 --> 00:29:00,989
And so I think this is, you know, just to reiterate how how how the interventions and the genetics work together.

258
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,260
And in public health, we're almost always intervening on the environment.

259
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:12,540
All right. So then how do we start to kind of look at this?

260
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:23,670
And what does it mean? So if we have genetics and environment and together they influence the phenotype,

261
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:30,180
like how are they interacting and how can we actually account for and analyze both of these facts?

262
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:37,649
The other thing, too, is that we have to keep in mind, because I'm going to tell you a little bit.

263
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:41,430
Oh, never mind. I'll tell you the minute. All right.

264
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,180
So there is some different ways that we can actually.

265
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:52,799
Different different ways that we can think about how genetics and the environment

266
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,390
interact in different ways that they actually are operating in reality.

267
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:01,680
Right. So I gave you this example already. So there's like four different models.

268
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:09,419
And this first example is where you have the situation where you don't get the disease

269
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:14,700
unless you have both the genetic risk factor and the environmental risk factor.

270
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,180
Right. So for PKU, you have to have the genetic risk factor.

271
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:25,080
Otherwise phenyl alanine doesn't influence your cognition at all.

272
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:34,230
Right. And if you have the genetic risk factor, you're actually still fine until you also have phenyl alanine.

273
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:41,909
Right. So you have the genetics, you have the environment, and neither one of them alone is going to increase risk of a negative outcome.

274
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:45,810
But you put them together and then that triggers the disease.

275
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:56,430
A second model is that you have already a risk factor that's environmental, and then the genetics makes it worse.

276
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,340
So for example, you know, if you stay in the sun too long, you could get skin cancer, right?

277
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,880
Everybody knows that sun exposure is a risk for melanoma.

278
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:11,190
And so the environment is a risk factor on its own.

279
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:25,760
But if you have a homozygous genetic mutations in your nucleotide excision, repair gene and air, this is an enzyme that actually repairs DNA.

280
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:33,569
Right? So when you have UV light, it can cause like thymine dimers where you get to tears that stick together or things like that.

281
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:39,660
And this NTR protein will actually identify those and help excise that and repair it.

282
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:45,749
Right. But if you're missing that enzyme, you're at much, much greater risk for skin cancer.

283
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,410
And actually,

284
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:55,530
people who have this genetic condition can't ever go in the sun at all because they can never repair their DNA from the damage that happens.

285
00:31:55,530 --> 00:32:04,680
So they are very high risk of cancers. And then you can imagine the other situation, which does also happen in reality,

286
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:12,660
where you actually have a genetic variant that increases risk of the disease, but then the environment can trigger it or make it worse.

287
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:22,379
So there's a gene called glucose, six phosphate dehydrogenase in people who have some different mutations.

288
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:28,980
And this gene actually will get hemolytic anemia so their red blood cells will actually burst.

289
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:33,720
And so they can get anemia, which is, you know,

290
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:37,860
you don't have enough iron in your red blood cells or you don't have enough red blood cells circulating.

291
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,670
And they can get that no matter what they do.

292
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:46,620
But for whatever reason, I feel like I've looked this up before and I knew the answer at one point, but now I forgot.

293
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:51,000
If you eat fava beans, that actually can exacerbate that process.

294
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:54,900
So there's something in there that actually interacts,

295
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:05,820
something in there that causes your red blood cells to be more susceptible to the action of glucose, six phosphate dehydrogenase.

296
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:10,590
And it can exacerbate the condition, right? So that's where you have a genetic risk factor.

297
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:14,940
And then the environment by itself doesn't do anything. But you combine them and it does.

298
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:25,709
And then probably you you probably guess this the last model is when you have risk factors both on the genetic side and the environment side,

299
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:29,070
and then you put them together and it causes bad things to happen.

300
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:36,630
So we all know that smoking is a risk factor for a lot of different lung diseases, and one of them is emphysema.

301
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:45,750
And when you when you smoke, that is in itself a risk factor.

302
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:50,910
An Alpha one antitrypsin deficiency is also a risk factor for emphysema.

303
00:33:50,910 --> 00:34:05,040
So that Alpha one antitrypsin actually is protective of your lung tissue and it protects it against enzymes that will actually eat the heat,

304
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:11,040
that will degrade the elastic, basically the elastin that's in your in your lungs.

305
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:20,010
And so if you have a deficiency in that, your lungs are at risk because the elasticity will will be eroding over time.

306
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:26,340
Right. So that also is a risk factor by itself. But then you put them together and that's a bad, bad, bad seed.

307
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,240
Right. That increases risk a lot more than either one of them by themselves.

308
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:40,110
So we can study gene environment interaction in a lot of different ways, using a lot of different study designs.

309
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:48,540
So with case control studies, you have a set of people who have disease and the studies are people who don't have disease.

310
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:57,720
And you can look at their environmental and genetic differences and see whether you can find an interaction or that kind of effect.

311
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:06,450
That's more than you'd expect by either risk factor alone in terms of who actually developed the disease.

312
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:11,960
Cohort studies are when you follow a group of people over time and look at who develops disease so

313
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:16,110
you can measure the environment at baseline and then look over time and see who gets the disease.

314
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:26,550
Case only studies or case parental control studies are mostly used for things like like taking people who already have disease and looking

315
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:36,870
at disease progression or things that make the disease better or worse over time and then affected relative pairs or twin studies.

316
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:45,000
People use those a lot to kind of disentangle the effects of genetics and environment in families.

317
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:54,250
Right. So if you have. Diseases that are pretty rare and have a genetic basis, you're probably going to find them mostly in families.

318
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,290
And so you can use those kind of designs.

319
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:06,580
So I'm going to talk to you just a little bit about one way to statistically model gene environment interaction.

320
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:17,740
But I want to be really clear that even if you find a statistical interaction, it may not have a biological basis.

321
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:24,930
Right. So if I find that. Oh, no, I think it's something.

322
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:31,580
I don't know. I can't think of any great example off the top of my head.

323
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:36,259
If I find a statistical okay, here's here's an example.

324
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:44,480
This is for gene gene interaction. If I find a statistical interaction between having a mutation in gene one and having a mutation in gene two,

325
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:48,050
that has some effect on the disease outcome,

326
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:56,900
statistically, I found that there's something there in people who have mutations in both of those genes might be at higher risk for disease.

327
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:02,010
It doesn't mean that those gene products interact with each other in the cell biologically, right?

328
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:07,999
They could be in two different systems ones. And so, for example, this is a good example.

329
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:16,010
So for example, we know a lot about the genetics of obesity, but I could I could find a person, for example,

330
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:23,089
who has mutations in some brain related protein that controls appetite and then also some,

331
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:28,159
like processing protein in their adipocytes that actually causes them to retain fat.

332
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:34,340
Right. So having both of those mutations might put them at risk for higher BMI, but they don't interact biologically.

333
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:42,080
So that just trying to disentangle in your head statistical interaction in biological interaction are not always the same thing.

334
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:51,860
So here I don't think you'll probably need to know this in great detail.

335
00:37:51,890 --> 00:38:00,200
Like I'm hearing say I'm guessing exams, but if you're statistically minded and you've taken a linear regression class,

336
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,889
then then you can kind of understand what we're doing here.

337
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:08,540
So basically what we're doing is we're creating a model where we've got our outcome of interest,

338
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,440
which is like our disease phenotype or our trait that we're interested in studying.

339
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:18,560
And we're seeing it's a function of the gene, it's a function of the environment.

340
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:22,310
And there's this component of gene environment interaction, right?

341
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:32,540
And so, so in the model we have both the genetic and environment by itself, and we have a term that shows the interaction.

342
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:41,570
All right. So then we should break this down into more precise pieces that correspond to the data.

343
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:46,640
So when we say, gee, are Gene, what are we really talking about?

344
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:55,650
So if you have if you have a typical two alarm system where you could have like, you know,

345
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:02,599
the sort of the abstract version like big and small A and you have two copies of it.

346
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,030
You could be big A Big A genotype big a small a small a small eight.

347
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:13,490
Right. So how do we operationalize that? One way to do it is by using the true genome type model,

348
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:22,670
which I think you studied in G was where we actually aren't making a lot of assumptions about how those genotypes relate to each other.

349
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:34,760
Right. Because if we use an additive model or a dose response genotype model to study interactions, it really limits the interaction space a lot.

350
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:42,740
So it usually works okay as an approximation for things like you ask, but where do you even start to like now interacting with things?

351
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:53,020
It's. It's harder to detect interactions and it's kind of a stronger assumption to assume not just an additive main effect,

352
00:39:53,020 --> 00:40:01,329
but also an additive interaction. So a lot of times for interaction studies, we'll use the two genotype model or the three genotype model.

353
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:06,459
Sorry. So one way to do that is we can create these dummy variables.

354
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:13,980
So I'm going to call them like X to show that it's like a variable big a, big A.

355
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:20,290
So that will be one. If a person has, you know, type and zero otherwise.

356
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,780
So that's one dummy variable and then a dummy variable for if the person is big a smiley.

357
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,020
So one if they're in that and zero otherwise.

358
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:33,760
And so what will both of these variables be if the person is small, a smiley.

359
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:45,110
Yeah. It'll just be zero. Both of them will be zero. So we just need two dummy variables to represent three genotypes.

360
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:57,909
And then we can put that we can represent that in a regression model by putting in both of these genotype variables.

361
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:09,880
And so if you've done some modeling, you know that there's an intercept which is basically the value of the outcome when all of this stuff is zero.

362
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,150
And then you have these beta coefficients,

363
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:22,190
which is the change from the intercept either up and down of the outcome when you have all these different variables.

364
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:31,190
So for example, we can take this model which has the genotype groups are two dummy variables for genotype.

365
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:37,729
It has our environment and it has the interaction between the environment and each of the genotype groups.

366
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:47,520
Right. Those are all the terms in the model. And we can obtain estimates for each of these coefficients right in the model.

367
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:55,100
And then to really understand each of the genotype groups and how they're responding to the environment,

368
00:41:55,430 --> 00:42:01,280
we just need to plug in values for these for these genotypes.

369
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:12,920
So, for example, if we have this equation and we think about people who are big a big guy, then our variable X big a big eight equals one.

370
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:20,660
So we're going to have the outcome is a function of the intercept plus beta one because this is a one, right?

371
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:25,810
This one is going to be zero because if they're big and they're not big a small way.

372
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:36,120
You're going to have the effect of the environment. This will be beta four times the environment, times one.

373
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:42,460
And this will go away because this big a smaller it will be a zero rate.

374
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:45,850
So for people who have the big, big, you know, type group.

375
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:59,540
It's going to be a function of the intercept plus beta one plus beta three times the environment plus beta four times the environment.

376
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:04,370
Right. Because this is going to be a one and this is going to be a one. So you can actually group terms together.

377
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:16,340
And eventually, if you combine the regular intercept, plus this is actually the main effect of the AA genotype.

378
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:24,200
So you can combine it with the group average and this is your intercept for the big, big eight people.

379
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:30,920
Now this Alpha Big A Big A is the combination of these two terms.

380
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:34,760
And then the environment, you've got beta three times the environment,

381
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:42,350
which is the average effect of the environment for all the genotype groups and then the specific effect of the environment for the big people.

382
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:54,919
So you can combine those. So you can actually estimate these intercepts and the the slope with respect to environment for all of the different groups.

383
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:00,770
Right. So you can do it for big a small and then small a small.

384
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:09,739
Actually, the intercept is going to be actually the I'm sorry, I said it was the mean of all of that,

385
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:15,350
but it's actually the smallest small intercept and the effect of the environment.

386
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:26,390
So for that genotype group and so you can actually get all of these all of these specific genotype specific intercepts and slopes,

387
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:35,090
and then you can do something like this. So here this is looking at I don't know if you guys have really talked about this.

388
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:38,960
Did you talk about like abo e at all or do you know what that is?

389
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:45,700
No. Okay. So April, April, it's actually called Apolipoprotein E.

390
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,549
This is one of the proteins that is involved in sort of lipid metabolism.

391
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:59,590
So the apolipoprotein are they actually ride around on the lipids that are in your bloodstream.

392
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:09,040
And when they when when those lipids come close to cells, there can be receptors on the cell.

393
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,470
So there's an APOE receptor and the lipids will be transferred into the cell.

394
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:20,380
So it's just this way of like shuttling cholesterol and other lipids in and out of cells.

395
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:31,180
So Apple is actually a really famous gene because it has first of all, it's the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.

396
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:37,870
There's a bit of variant that is can be up to.

397
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:45,639
It's about somebody who has one copy of it is about three or four times more likely to have Alzheimer's disease.

398
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:51,520
It's called the Apo Epsilon four variant. It's represented by this little epsilon.

399
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:57,250
And then it also is related to heart disease.

400
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:07,180
So it's related to having high LDL. And then the Apo Epsilon three variant is kind of like the normal.

401
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:19,719
And then the Apo Epsilon two is can also be a risk factor for issues with heart disease, but it actually is more related to early onset heart disease.

402
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:24,100
And it has it has to do with having higher triglycerides, actually.

403
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:30,720
So your LDL is fine, but your triglycerides are high. So there's three different variants, four, eight,

404
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:43,000
the E and here this is looking at total cholesterol level and the estimated probability of developing coronary artery calcification.

405
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:47,950
It's a very specific phenotype related to coronary artery disease.

406
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:52,990
And so here we've got three different genotypes.

407
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:58,930
So these are this is your homozygous epsilon three, Epsilon three.

408
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:02,290
So I have two copies of the E three alone.

409
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:11,259
This genotype is actually having an E two and an E three and this one is having an E four and then E three.

410
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:19,270
So sometimes in this system we fix the person having one copy of E three so

411
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:25,329
that we can look at the effects of E2 and E for just having one copy of them.

412
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:32,860
And we don't have to worry about like now we have to look at homozygous effects, like what if you're E2, E2 or E 44, right?

413
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:37,600
So sometimes we can look at this system by fixing one of the wheels in people.

414
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:43,420
And so here you can see that they each have their own intercept.

415
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:49,030
So if you kind of, you know, extend these lines, the intercept is going to be somewhere on this line.

416
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:54,460
But it's different for all the genotype groups. But you can see they also have different slopes.

417
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:58,060
Right. And the slopes are the betas or their response to the environment.

418
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:02,260
So as you get higher and higher cholesterol,

419
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:11,110
the probability of coronary artery calcification actually is the worst for the Epsilon two genotype group.

420
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:16,059
And that slide for Epsilon three does.

421
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:24,459
Okay. And the Epsilon three, three, this is kind of like we would what we would consider like a normal response.

422
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:35,890
And then you can see the deviation for each of those other two genotype groups and look at the crossover pattern that happens, right?

423
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:48,520
So when you're like in this range of cholesterol under about 150, E4 is more the risk group here.

424
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:55,540
And this leads me to just another important thing to say about you.

425
00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:07,690
Environment interaction is when you look at these plots, it's really easy to be like, yes, E3 E2 is like pretty much the risk all the time.

426
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:18,580
But then if you actually think about the population, most people's cholesterol level really is about here like 200 total cholesterol is high, right?

427
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:26,800
So actually from a population perspective, E4 is almost acting more like a risk, the risk LDL.

428
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:34,450
Right? So like these are different ways that you can think about gene environment interaction and you should always in papers.

429
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:40,480
Always understand where the majority of the population is following.

430
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:45,880
Right. Because down here is actually where it mostly matters.

431
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:56,110
But up here is where we might identify high risk people and and try to do specific interventions.

432
00:49:56,110 --> 00:50:00,760
And, you know, we could probably be able to predict better about people's genotypes when they're up here.

433
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:09,010
Right. All right. So I'm going to very quickly go through this example.

434
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:14,019
It was from like 20 years ago, but the concepts haven't changed at all.

435
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:17,169
And I feel like it's a it's a good example for that reason.

436
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:25,450
So this is very specific to pharmacogenetics and what we now call really precision medicine,

437
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:33,370
where we're trying to get the right drugs to the right people and we can use genetics to help with that.

438
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:37,690
So Farai and I work on a study.

439
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:49,900
A lot of a lot of our work is on the study, Genoa, which is the genetics of the genetic epidemiology network of arterial apathy.

440
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:55,810
So we have a sample of self-reported non-Hispanic whites from Rochester, Minnesota,

441
00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:00,310
and a sample of self-reported African-Americans from Jackson, Mississippi.

442
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:03,370
And this work I'm going to show you is for the white sample.

443
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:13,450
And basically what they did was they looked at, oh, I forgot to tell you, it's a hypertensive snapshot study.

444
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:20,440
So we looked at people who have at least two siblings that have hypertension before the age of 60.

445
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:23,800
So they're probably at a high genetic risk for hypertension.

446
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:35,650
It's probably something in their family, especially the white sample, which tends to be healthier and have less hypertension overall at those ages.

447
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:45,069
So we looked at people who were hypertensive in that cohort and we looked at people like what?

448
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:49,090
What drugs were they prescribed so they could have no drug therapy.

449
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:53,230
So they're basically untreated, hypertensive, they could have one drug.

450
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:58,780
And so that the most popular ones, at least at that time, may have changed a little bit now,

451
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:04,930
but they still have beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and diuretics.

452
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:08,319
And then there are some other ones that brass inhibitors.

453
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,450
And so these are kind of the four main categories.

454
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:17,430
And then they could also be on a combination therapy because when you're on antihypertensives and they're not working,

455
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,830
basically people like to keep adding stuff.

456
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:30,970
The reason why this is really important is because it's actually pretty hard to find the right drug to treat your hypertension.

457
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:35,020
So there are these major drug categories and people react very differently to

458
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:39,280
them and sometimes they just don't work and sometimes there are adverse events.

459
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:46,950
And so the people who are down here that had the combination therapy, they've already been on a bunch of monotherapy probably, and it wasn't working.

460
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,460
So so these are probably the tougher to treat group.

461
00:52:53,470 --> 00:53:02,890
This is just showing like what percentage of the people in our sample were using each kind of drug.

462
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:06,490
And often that was like, how well was it controlled?

463
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:10,209
So the beta blockers, for example, in females,

464
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:16,390
about 33% of people were on beta blockers and about two thirds of those people had their hypertension controlled.

465
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:20,830
Right. Because you can be on a drug, but you can still be hypertensive if it's not working.

466
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:29,500
The calcium channel blockers, we only had 11% of females on that and only a third, a third of them had their hypertension under control.

467
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:36,040
So this is like beta blockers are usually like the first line, sometimes diuretics.

468
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,660
Diuretics also do really well.

469
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:45,760
So we also saw like 70% control in diabetics, but calcium channel blockers and RAAS inhibitors are kind of like if the first one didn't work,

470
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,510
they could try those, but they may not have as strong a response rates either.

471
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:54,490
So we kind of looked at that. You can look at it by combination therapy.

472
00:53:55,540 --> 00:54:00,969
This is like super, super small text and histograms.

473
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:05,040
But but what it's showing is. You know, you've got these waves.

474
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:10,350
These are the this is the blood pressure distribution for people who have no therapy.

475
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:14,550
And here's, for example, the distribution of people who are on beta blockers.

476
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:23,309
So if you just kind of look at these two graphics that are lined up on top of each other, you can see that people who have no therapy,

477
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:28,620
actually, their their blood pressure tends to be higher than people who are on beta blockers.

478
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:34,200
Right. So that's showing like if we kind of just look at the population level there, they're doing better.

479
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:42,230
And the calcium channel blocker group is actually doing a little a little bit worse than the beta blocker group.

480
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:48,510
So it's kind of looking at it that way. This is a map of the dose into Gene.

481
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:54,440
So this is the gene that they were looking at. Up here, you can see the exons.

482
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:58,290
And then down here are the introns and the length of the Enrons.

483
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,770
And these were all the genetic mutations they looked at.

484
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:11,669
And they were interested in this gene because it has a lot of different isoforms with alternative splicing.

485
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:15,150
And it was associated with blood pressure in animal models like rats.

486
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:20,760
And it does a function that could be related to hypertension.

487
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:25,590
So it regulates sodium absorption, which is important for fluid volume.

488
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:31,980
And that's really important for hypertension because if you have high fluid volume, you have higher blood pressure.

489
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:36,900
And then it was also under a linkage peak in channel. So I know you've heard a little bit about linkage.

490
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,270
So it like a positional candidate, Gene.

491
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:51,510
And what's interesting about it is so this is just one snippet that they looked at and the appeals are just kind of coded one and two.

492
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:55,680
So you can think about it as one who was, I guess, grouped the other one and then the headlines I go.

493
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:00,899
And what's kind of interesting here is you can look at the different genotype groups

494
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:05,610
and how they look in these different environments or in different drug treatments.

495
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:16,410
So if we kind of just zoom in, this is that same same set of groups and no treatment versus beta blockers.

496
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:22,050
So if we're looking at no treatment, actually here, the one one genotype group is doing the worst.

497
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:33,450
Right. But when we look at people and how they respond to beta blockers, they actually respond potentially better than some of these other groups.

498
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:39,660
So the two two groups, they're not that bad without treatment.

499
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:43,470
But then when we treat them, they don't get as good as the one group.

500
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:53,940
So this could potentially be an example of the one one group having like more plastic response to the beta blockers.

501
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,440
Right, than the two to group.

502
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:06,060
And then if you look at the diuretic, actually, the one one group is doing pretty poorly compared to the other two groups.

503
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:13,140
Right. So if you genotype somebody and there are one one, you probably want to try them on a beta blocker rather than a diuretic.

504
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:19,040
Right. But then these other two maybe hard to know.

505
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:24,200
And then it's this is a combination therapy also.

506
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:28,520
And we kind of see that same pattern where the one one is doing better when they have the beta blocker.

507
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:32,900
And then this is another a different snap.

508
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:45,200
Okay. And here what I think I see here is that the heterozygous and the two two genotype actually don't have much of a response change like they do.

509
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:56,210
Okay, on all these different drugs. But if you're one one for this particular snip, we should not put you on a calcium channel blocker for sure.

510
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:01,250
Right. We should put you on a beta blocker or maybe a diuretic, but definitely not a calcium channel blocker.

511
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:06,950
So I mean, I think this is a nice story about clinical relevance.

512
00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:17,900
Obviously, you want to do these like large scale studies to verify everything and make sure that that makes sense and that we see it across groups.

513
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:30,250
And, you know, these are the pharmacokinetic properties of these mutations also can help us identify targets for development of drug therapies.

514
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:42,350
So for example, like we, we found, for example, a G was had for obesity that they now make a drug based on.

515
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:51,080
So like PCSK9 is the gene and they were able to do drug development based on that.

516
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:56,720
Right. So I think these are relevant for a few different reasons.

517
00:58:57,350 --> 00:59:04,670
And here I just wanted to show you that actually it's not just pharmaceuticals, but also different interventions.

518
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:10,670
So for hypertension, this was a study that looked at sodium intervention and weight reduction.

519
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:17,960
And if you're somebody who has a GD genotype, like maybe sodium intervention isn't the best way to go,

520
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:22,640
but a weight reduction could be helpful or at least isn't harmful.

521
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:30,469
Whereas if you're a G or ag genotype, you probably want to do more of a sodium intervention and a weight reduction rate.

522
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:39,770
So this is simplistic. It's only one study, but we actually have found examples where where there are robust associations across.

523
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:50,930
Okay. So then to switch gears just a little bit, I'm just wondering how many of you had a chance to read this paper?

524
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:55,940
And you can be honest. It's okay if you didn't. Okay.

525
00:59:56,090 --> 01:00:03,799
So a couple people. So three people. How do you three people feel about having a discussion on the KASKY paper?

526
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:10,100
A little little bit in discussion, just so that you don't get tired of me talking too much.

527
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:14,960
So maybe I'll just ask you.

528
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:24,130
What would you say is sort of the research question that was being investigated in the Crosby paper?

529
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:46,380
Yeah. I think they're looking at like the 5hi have to finish h t t jun and how it's either, um, I think they said the short version,

530
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:59,910
the homozygous short individuals were more influenced by negative life events to be or they hypothesized that and then as compared to the long,

531
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:10,379
long or long short. And so they took a bunch of people's genotypes and their depressed depressive like life events

532
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:18,240
between 21 and 26 and the saw whether the genotype was associated with worse outcomes.

533
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:20,190
Yeah, that's perfect.

534
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:34,620
So their question was, is there a gene environment interaction between stressful life events and depression or suicide in later ages?

535
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:45,260
Right. And does anybody remember, like, why they picked that gene or does anybody know what that is and what it does and why it's important today?

536
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:53,969
What do we really know about this, gene? Does anybody know? All right.

537
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:57,900
Let me rephrase this.

538
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:01,590
Gene is the serotonin transporter gene.

539
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:05,580
Has anybody ever heard of SSRI antidepressants?

540
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,990
Yeah. Because they're the most common form of antidepressants.

541
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:19,150
They're actually SSRI stands for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and it's actually.

542
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:26,600
Mimicking sort of what the HTP gene does.

543
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:34,399
And it actually that the HTP I'm going to skip to here, the gene is a serotonin transporter.

544
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:43,310
And what the what the relevance of that is, is that serotonin is a neurotransmitter.

545
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:48,499
Right? And you want to be stimulated by serotonin.

546
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:52,760
It makes you feel good. Okay. So it's just like, you know, like dopamine.

547
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,980
It's like the reward center. Serotonin is kind of similar to that, right?

548
01:02:56,690 --> 01:03:07,340
So what's happening is like you have a presynaptic cell and the the neurotransmitter is released into this cellular space.

549
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:15,620
The it's like the synapse between this axon and like a responder cell, essentially.

550
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:26,780
So when the serotonin is released, the serotonin receptors on that cell are going to get that signal and they're going to,

551
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:31,129
like relay a response to the rest of the nervous system.

552
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:34,400
That's like, oh, we feel good, we feel good, we feel good, we feel happy, right?

553
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:43,129
So we want this to be triggered. But there's a re uptake then of this neurotransmitter.

554
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:48,530
So like once it's secreted, then the body starts like the cell starts pulling it back in.

555
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:59,660
Right. And so the serotonin transporter is part of the system that's actually transporting that neurotransmitter back into the original cell.

556
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:07,790
So if it works too well, the neurotransmitter can't be in that synaptic cleft long enough and you don't feel as happy.

557
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:12,230
Right. And so SSRI is actually block that re uptake.

558
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:19,400
They block the action of the serotonin transporter here so that so that the

559
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,870
that are transporter stays in the synaptic cleft longer and you feel happier,

560
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:36,470
essentially. So they're interested in this gene because it has this really important biological function and because a lot of animal studies,

561
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:40,190
I think they talked about like rat studies,

562
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:56,210
rhesus monkey studies, other human studies have shown that that this shorter wheel tends to be worse in terms of developing things like depression.

563
01:04:56,750 --> 01:05:02,870
So the the wheels are based on a variable variable number of tandem repeats.

564
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:05,389
And so there's a repeat.

565
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:13,790
I forget what it is now, but when you have the longer wheel, you have like 16 or there can even be more than that repeats in the short a little.

566
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:22,490
It's like 14, but for whatever reason the shorter we all tends to be associated with with worse outcomes.

567
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:30,380
And so like you said, this paper was looking at things like, well, actually, well,

568
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:38,480
we'll keep going and I'll tell you something else was associated with things like stressful life events that occurred before age 21 and.

569
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:44,090
Like about a third of the sample had no stressful life events.

570
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:47,820
A quarter had one. And then there was like the scale of people who had more.

571
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:55,979
And so this is like that important part where like what is most of the distribution looking like?

572
01:05:55,980 --> 01:06:01,770
It's around like 92. And then they looked at depression five years later,

573
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:11,160
and about 17% of people had at least some sign of depression and 3% had suicidal ideation or thoughts.

574
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:17,560
So then I have this next piece. And it was it's a really important piece.

575
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:23,970
So when you're looking at gene environment interaction, you have to be cognizant of gene environment correlation.

576
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:32,010
So so this is where you have a relationship actually between the genotype and the exposure of interest.

577
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:47,159
Right. So what if the what if this shortly all of the serotonin oh, the serotonin transporter actually caused people to have stressful life events.

578
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:54,370
So caused them to have employment issues or failed relationships or health related issues.

579
01:06:54,390 --> 01:07:02,700
Right. If that was the case, then when we see a gene environment interaction, it might just be because of like this correlation.

580
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:13,150
So we have to check that. And but they did not find an association between the stressful life event and the genetic.

581
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:21,940
The. The illegals. But they and so this is like a model to interaction.

582
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:30,430
So they had an environmental effects on depression, but they didn't have a genetic effect on depression by itself.

583
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,340
But they also found that gene environment interaction.

584
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:42,820
So that's like our model to where we have an environmental effect, no genetic main effect, but we see the interaction and here's what it looks like.

585
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:46,690
So what does this look like for looking at this picture?

586
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:49,989
You've got the short, short, short, short, long and long, long.

587
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:58,389
Here's your environment. Here is your depression, sometimes depression episode and informant reports of depression.

588
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:06,580
And here's your suicide ideation. So looking at these graphs, does this look like the the susceptibility,

589
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:11,740
the plasticity model or the stress diocese's model of gene environment interactions?

590
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:17,110
Or like what do you see? What's the shape? Is it a crossover or is it a fang shape or what do you think?

591
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:46,830
Somebody in the gas. Okay.

592
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:51,690
I will interpret silence to mean you're not sure which it is.

593
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:57,810
Because. Because like it to me.

594
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:03,000
I think the depression one sort of look like the fang shape where like where you

595
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,530
have zero or one stressful life events and pretty much everybody is the same.

596
01:09:08,610 --> 01:09:17,460
But then when you have a lot of stress, you see a clear separation of groups where the SS is a lot different right then than now.

597
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:28,500
And I think like most of the concentration is going to be in this area and I think in this area people are kind of pretty similar.

598
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:36,450
So I feel like when the environment gets hot, when you've got a lot of stress, that's when you see the separation.

599
01:09:38,930 --> 01:09:44,970
The suicidal ideation might be a little bit different. It kind of looks more like that crossover pattern to me.

600
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:52,999
But remember also that there's only 3% of the sample that had suicidal ideation.

601
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:59,180
So like, you know, especially up here where you've got a lot of life events,

602
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:05,750
you're probably not going to have very many people in that part of the sample. So I feel like you have to interpret that a little more with caution.

603
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:10,610
But I would say if I had to name it one way or the other, it might be more of a crossover shape.

604
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:23,129
All right. One thing I'll say, this serotonin receptor has been a subject of a lot of different research.

605
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:40,890
A lot of research. There is no super clear, super clear answer to how this particular polymorphism really relates to the topics discussed here.

606
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:46,350
What I because some studies have found this interaction and some studies have not.

607
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:57,309
But what I will say is that. One thing that's pretty clear is whether the stress is self-reported or objective.

608
01:10:57,310 --> 01:11:02,300
And actually objective measures of stress tend to have more robust findings.

609
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:07,420
So it's not like. Which may or may not be intuitive, but it's not how you feel about something.

610
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:16,030
It's whether it happened or not. And so, like, I think a lot of it has depended on how they measured the stress,

611
01:11:16,030 --> 01:11:19,270
how they measured the depression or other outcomes and things like that.

612
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:24,759
Okay, I'm going to skip that. This is the last thing I want to talk about.

613
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:30,250
And we're almost at time, which is this topic of changing interactions.

614
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:36,700
So I picked the simplest possible model system here to show this to you,

615
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:42,880
because even in this tiny little model system of yeast, there's so much going on.

616
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:52,000
So this is actually a picture of all a lot of different genes and showing how those genes interact with other genes.

617
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:58,479
So it's like this visual description of interactions between different genes and it

618
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:06,610
shows you like how so all the genes related to secretion and vesicle transport are here.

619
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:10,149
Metabolism and amino acid are here, mitochondria are here.

620
01:12:10,150 --> 01:12:16,240
And you can kind of see how there's this statistical interaction, at least across systems.

621
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:20,980
What they did to create that is they took yeast,

622
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:33,370
they have 6000 genes in total in east and they knocked them out one by one and they found that actually the yeast can survive 80% of the time.

623
01:12:33,370 --> 01:12:37,089
So 80% of the genes they knock out, they still get a surviving yeast.

624
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:40,200
And that to me illustrates the redundancy in that system.

625
01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:47,980
Right. You don't need everything. But if they knocked out two genes, that's how they looked at these gene gene interactions.

626
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:55,930
So when they knocked out two genes and the yeast goes fast, grows faster than expected, that's a positive interaction.

627
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:03,700
When they knock out two genes and the yeast grows slower than expected or doesn't grow, that's what they're thinking of as a negative interaction.

628
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:08,860
And they tested basically every gene pair,

629
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:18,490
which was like 5 million and they detected 170,000 that had these interactions and mostly their negative interactions.

630
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:27,730
And the average gene is actually showing about 30 interactions and there's a big distribution.

631
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:33,580
So so some genes actually are highly interconnected hubs,

632
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:39,610
so they have interactions with tons of other genes and some genes just have interactions with like a few.

633
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,500
So the ones with more similar biological roles did tend to interact more frequently.

634
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:49,180
And what I'm going to say about that in humans is we're doing the same thing, right?

635
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:53,680
We've got this huge number of genes, we've got this exponential level of complexity,

636
01:13:53,980 --> 01:14:02,380
and we also find these kind of hub genes or genes that interact with a lot of different partners in human biology as well.

637
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:12,160
As, you know, like everything in human genetics, there are databases that can help you learn about that and, you know, have cataloged that.

638
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:24,100
So I gave you an example of one, but but we have both intra genetic or within the same gene and in turn genic or across gene interactions.

639
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:31,750
And so when we're thinking about this for each step that we're analyzing, the whole rest of the genome is the environment, right?

640
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:37,600
So that's what I had. Does anybody have any quick questions before we.

641
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:47,780
Hit the road. So kind of what you expected when you think about changing gene environment interaction.

642
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:55,010
Questions. All right, good.

643
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:58,510
Well, I'll see you next week. And I don't know if you have anything else to say for us.
