[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06,225 --> 00:00:09,150
So how can we prevent
common chronic diseases?

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,260
Well first,
we have to figure out what causes them.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,186
In order to figure out what causes them,

5
00:00:14,186 --> 00:00:16,960
we have to use the epidemiological
study designs.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,335
Whether or not it's cross-sectional and
case-controlled that allows us to get

7
00:00:20,335 --> 00:00:23,960
the first look at what might
be the main risk factors.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,630
To then evaluating them in cohort studies
and clinical trials to evaluate both,

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,480
whether or not they are influencing
future disease risk, or if we have

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,030
a prevention or therapeutic measure which
can stop the actual onset of disease.

11
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,040
What are we looking at?

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,660
We're looking at the exposures and
the outcomes in these study designs.

13
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,630
Probably one of the best ways to identify
the modifiable causes of chronic diseases

14
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,460
is the cohort study.

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,550
So again, we start with this
concept of a population,

16
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,010
move into those we are gonna study.

17
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,910
Evaluate whether or not they've been
exposed or have a risk factor, and

18
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:09,433
then over time evaluate whether or
not they developed disease.

19
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:14,139
Many of the things that we read
in the paper every day about what

20
00:01:14,139 --> 00:01:19,119
causes a common chronic disease
like heart disease or diabetes or

21
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,854
depression will change over time.

22
00:01:21,854 --> 00:01:27,540
Not because the actual biology changes,
but because sometimes we get it wrong.

23
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,140
Sometimes we actually are looking
at an exposure that is

24
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,790
correlated with something else.

25
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:39,250
And that something else is actually
got a name, it's called a confounder.

26
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:44,760
Confounders are these third variables,
these lurking variables is another term,

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:50,050
that are associated with the disease and
they're correlated with the exposure.

28
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,880
And those confounders
distort the association

29
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,000
that we see between the risk factor and
the disease that we're studying.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,140
A classic example of this was a study
in the 70s between coffee drinking and

31
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,830
pancreatic cancer, where they
found a very strong association.

32
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:13,350
Now, if you drink coffee, that actual
scare stopped people from their

33
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:19,660
daily routines and questioned whether or
not they should be drinking coffee at all.

34
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:25,570
Only when the epidemiologists looked
more deeply into the study variables,

35
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:29,680
into why coffee drinking might be
associated with pancreatic cancer,

36
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,770
did they find this lurking
variable called smoking.

37
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,630
Because somebody's coffee drinking
in the 70s was correlated with

38
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:43,530
how much they smoked,
the coffee drinking, as an exposure,

39
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:49,440
was carrying what was the association
with pancreatic cancer.

40
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,830
There are multiple ways in which we take
that into consideration in the modern

41
00:02:53,830 --> 00:03:00,950
epidemiological studies, so that we reduce
the number of times we get it wrong.

42
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:06,270
As we've accumulated information over
the last decade, using cohort studies,

43
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,700
we've identified a whole set of
causes of common chronic diseases,

44
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:16,720
from underlying socioeconomic, cultural,
political and environmental factors.

45
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,430
These determinants often are things
within somebody's lived experience and

46
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:28,790
their environment, to another whole class
called modifiable and lifestyle factors.

47
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,160
These are choices that people make,
whether to exercise or

48
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,490
not exercise, what diet that they eat.

49
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:40,620
There's also a set of factors that we've
identified that are not really modifiable.

50
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,490
So that's things like genes and
heredity or for instance, age.

51
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,970
There's nothing we can do about aging,
per se.

52
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,000
And as we put the pieces together,

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,800
we've identified also what we
think of as intermediate factors.

54
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,830
These are things like elevated
cholesterol or glucose and

55
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:08,290
insulin that now serve as biomarkers, sort
of preclinical measures of the disease,

56
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:13,260
that we can use to actually identify
people at risk of developing the diseases

57
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,030
like diabetes and heart disease and
actually intervene earlier.

58
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,480
So knowing this whole causal spectrum
actually allows epidemiologists to work

59
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,920
with health professionals and Departments
of Health to put in place ways to prevent

60
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,880
and improve disease outcomes.

61
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,860
If we look at that sort
of prevention lens and

62
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:44,330
ask ourselves, okay,
what are we doing to prevent disease?

63
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:49,420
And go to maybe the things that we
already know are big contributors like

64
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,680
physical exercise, and ask people,
how much are you exercising?

65
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,810
We get some stunning sort of
conclusions about the American public.

66
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:04,060
So probably, you already know that
about 50% of the American public

67
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,670
is not getting the recommended
amount of physical activity.

68
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:13,136
It is a little bit worse at
the older ages, but even teens and

69
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:20,240
20-year-olds are not getting the amount of
physical exercise to keep them healthy.

70
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,960
When we look overall, so we look at,
for instance, smoking and

71
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:32,100
exercise and modifying your diet
to maintain good, healthy weight.

72
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,150
If we actually intervened on those,
and created a more

73
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,930
healthy living example of
epidemiology in action.

74
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,981
We could probably prevent 80% of diabetes,

75
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:52,970
40% to 50% of cancer, and
something like 80% of heart disease,

76
00:05:52,970 --> 00:06:00,000
if we stopped smoking, if we ate
healthily, and if we stayed in shape.

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,480
When we think of that in terms of lives,

78
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,610
it's something that's
kind of astronomical.

79
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,060
Hundreds of thousands of
lives could be saved,

80
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,300
if we had this focus on preventative care.

81
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,690
And it's not only the healthy behaviors,

82
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:21,010
it's also getting the healthcare that
you need in the very early stages.

83
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,870
So, for instance, mammograms for women,

84
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:29,880
just even doing that on the right schedule
could save hundreds of thousands of lives.

85
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,260
So there's prevention both in what
we do in our modifiable behaviors,

86
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,860
but then also what we can do in
order to get early disease detection

87
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,420
to prevent disease in
populations in our communities.

88
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:49,280
We're making a lot of progress,
most of the common chronic diseases that

89
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,115
we identified in the 20th
century have actually

90
00:06:53,115 --> 00:06:58,075
a large list of known risk factors and
modifiable diseases.

91
00:06:58,075 --> 00:07:00,555
So we've gotten better at
understanding the biology.

92
00:07:00,555 --> 00:07:03,405
That includes the genes,
the human behaviors, and

93
00:07:03,405 --> 00:07:07,145
the ways in which the lifestyles
are associated with risk.

94
00:07:07,145 --> 00:07:10,690
We've gotten better at screening for
common chronic diseases.

95
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,730
And most of us now have
the opportunity to have

96
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:20,160
multiple kinds of intervention,
if we do indeed have a particular

97
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,140
early warning sign that we do have
one of these common chronic diseases.

98
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,540
There's been a huge amount of
progress on common chronic diseases,

99
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,984
we just have to keep going.
