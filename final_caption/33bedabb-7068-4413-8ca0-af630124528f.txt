00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,170
Hi, Whitney. Thanks so much for being here to have a conversation. Absolutely.

2
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,090
Well, one of the things I wanted to talk with you about is your idea of troubling hierarchy.

3
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,700
It's one of the things that you've said that kind of sticks in my head, and I think about it a lot.

4
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,340
Could you say a little bit more about what you mean by that?

5
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:51,060
Yeah, when I think about troubling hierarchy, I think in many ways anti-racist work is at its core about troubling, problematic hierarchy.

6
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:58,720
So thinking about hierarchies that are based on race, that produce inequitable outcomes, that produce marginalization and oppression.

7
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,950
And so a core part of our work in anti-racist practice is to trouble those kinds

8
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,570
of hierarchies and in the troubling try to create space for something different,

9
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,260
something more equitable and more just. Yeah, I really like that idea of creating something different.

10
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:22,240
And I know, you know, some people might hear that troubling hierarchy and I guess wonder is is all hierarchy bad or how do you think about that?

11
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:27,940
Yeah, that's a great question. You know, I think we want to think about hierarchy in relationship to power.

12
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:36,249
So if this is hierarchy that's in the service of a kind of coercive power, like a power over a power over that leads to domination.

13
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,000
Right. A power over that leads to valuing some people more than others.

14
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:48,510
That's absolutely the kind of hierarchy that we want to trouble. But we also might think about hierarchy connected to power to or power with.

15
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,399
Right? So what's in the spirit of collaboration?

16
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:58,600
What allows us to share different kinds of experiences, different kinds of knowledge with one another and build on that?

17
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:04,389
So I wouldn't say that all hierarchy is bad, but I do think we're targeting particular kinds of hierarchy, right?

18
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:11,650
The kind that really say that one individual or one group is more valuable than another.

19
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,250
That's the kind of hierarchy that we really want to trouble and that we want to disrupt.

20
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,590
Yeah, that distinction is really helpful.

21
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:25,269
I know the idea of troubling hierarchy has been really helpful for me because when I think about anti-racism,

22
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,639
sometimes it can feel a little bit theoretical.

23
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,940
But when I think about troubling hierarchy, it feels like it's more, more of a guide for what I should be doing in my teaching.

24
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,980
Well, what are some of the ways that you are using troubling hierarchy in your teaching practice?

25
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:46,090
Yeah. I mean, I guess I think of that term troubling hierarchy when I'm doing things like reviewing my reading list,

26
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:51,430
thinking about my syllabus, thinking about how I'm going to plan a certain class for a certain day,

27
00:02:52,150 --> 00:03:00,130
and that that feels a little bit like kind of a guidepost for me to to ask that question of how am I troubling hierarchy in this particular context.

28
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,850
It's a great way to use that as a question. You mentioned your reading list.

29
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,060
It would be really interesting to hear how you see your reading list is connected to troubling hierarchy.

30
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,059
Yeah. So when I think about my reading list, it's, it's even beyond the reading list.

31
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,350
It's kind of what voices or what perspectives are I in my bringing into the classroom,

32
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,220
either through assigned reading, but also I think about guest lectures.

33
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,709
And when I think about troubling hierarchy, what I'm trying to, in terms of a reading list,

34
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,090
what I'm trying to do is really expand who are the voices or who are the

35
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,980
perspectives that are shaping the the learning that's going on in the classroom.

36
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:48,490
So it's not just folks who have a Ph.D. or who are research experts in a topic, but who has lived experience, who is doing the work on the ground?

37
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:55,780
How can I either bring them in as a guest speaker or assign a podcast where those people are being

38
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:01,990
interviewed so that there's really a range of perspectives and types of knowledge in, in my classroom.

39
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,780
I really appreciate you naming those things.

40
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:11,739
I mean, our reading lists are really a way that we introduce students not just to information, but to the norms of a field.

41
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:20,020
Right. And so once we expose them to a particular set of authors, we're signaling to those students, this is who counts as an expert.

42
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,459
This is what an expert looks like,

43
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:29,950
what a professional looks like when we expose them repeatedly to a particular kind of resource or a journal article versus a podcast, right?

44
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,670
Or a policy brief versus a poem or a play.

45
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,960
We're also communicating to them this is the preferred mode of communication.

46
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,160
And of course not everyone has access to all modes of communication in the same way.

47
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,750
So I really think paying attention to diversifying who's on your syllabus,

48
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:54,610
but also what are the modes of communication really helps to create a wider pathway that students can use to see themselves in the field.

49
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,390
Right. And perhaps then can further enter the conversation in your class.

50
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,590
Yeah. I love that idea of a wider pathway into our fields.

51
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:09,340
I think that's so important. What I'm wondering, kind of beyond reading lists or when you think about troubling hierarchy,

52
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,180
what, what other things are you thinking about in the classroom, how we do that?

53
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,430
I think a lot about student voice. So where do we make room for student voice in the classroom.

54
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:24,579
And there are a number of ways that you might think about doing that. That could be through feedback mechanisms.

55
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:32,700
So. Midterm evaluations that could be through quick check ins that you do with students at the beginning of the end of the class.

56
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,170
You might also invite student voice by asking students to help you pick a

57
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,940
reading list or bringing in or suggesting readings or offering presentations.

58
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:49,230
So there are a range of ways that you might really invite students to be co-creators of knowledge and of the intellectual space in the classroom.

59
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,790
I also make connections with this to the work of Kyoko Kishimoto, who really talks about power sharing in the classroom.

60
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,750
How do we share power with our students?

61
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:05,550
How do we really invite our students to be in conversation with us and to really help build what we're learning to teach us as much as we teach them?

62
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,889
Yeah, that's a really great point.

63
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:15,480
And I think I could do more to invite students to co-create that reading list or who are the different people we invite in.

64
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:21,780
So I really like that idea. One of the other things that I'm thinking about is, and you mentioned Kishimoto,

65
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,970
who who emphasizes that we need to do thinking about anti-racism beyond our classroom.

66
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:33,360
So I'm wondering if you could just say a little bit more about how you think about troubling hierarchy beyond the walls of a classroom.

67
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,260
I think it's a core part of the work that we do as anti-racist educators.

68
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:45,420
If we are drawing on the work of someone like Kyoko Kishimoto, and if we think back to our six principles for anti-racist teaching,

69
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,260
we understand that the classroom is really only one part of our work.

70
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,990
It's only one part of the domain of anti-racist pedagogy.

71
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:58,920
So working beyond the classroom in the level of our departments, in the level of our school or college or our larger university,

72
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:04,680
the city or town in which we live, those are all really important spaces for exactly the reasons you just named.

73
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:09,420
When students leave your classroom, they're going to interact with a range of other spaces.

74
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,780
And if those spaces aren't operating on anti-racist principles,

75
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:18,450
if they're not committed to anti-racist ends, then your students have really quickly met the limits,

76
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:25,170
right, of what anti-racism looks like on their campus or potentially in their college career or their their graduate school career.

77
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,070
And so really wanting to think about how do we use committee service,

78
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:35,489
how do we allow our classroom spaces to be sites of organizing for students that they can

79
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,420
build something there that they might take to the larger campus or school community?

80
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,700
How are we getting involved with the larger city or the state?

81
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:49,380
Right. But all of these are sites of intervention and places that are ripe for anti-racist action.

82
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,090
Wow, that's really great. Well, I appreciate you having this conversation with me.

83
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,260
I learned a lot, as I always do, talking with you. Thank you very much. I enjoyed it myself.
