1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:15,150
We have a problem. And I told him we have to be on the lookout for that.

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:26,720
Let me tell you how everything else is going to go.

3
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,030
You're going to be okay. I do. I do.

4
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,999
I like my friend.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,740
You hear me? Well. Okay.

6
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,570
So let's continue our discussion on stationary.

7
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:59,400
I would say if you remember last time we were talking about how to work kind of series,

8
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:08,760
that our idea has come to me in films, they don't see the trend, so they don't seem to be able to work out.

9
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,160
And so in order to do that, we are using you now.

10
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,290
So they're going to be taking a few operations in the past.

11
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,959
And when we observe that the observations in the past and we are going to use that average look at the future,

12
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,340
you know how many observations in the past we're going to take?

13
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:42,540
Well, that depends depends on the Time series. And that's why what we are going to do is check 95% different number of observations in the past.

14
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,259
And we're going to do two things. We are going to check the number.

15
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,540
We are going to test different numerous observations in the past for all the following years when we bring the

16
00:01:51,540 --> 00:02:01,560
wave to those observations and in order to forecast and last time we stopped by what we were dealing with,

17
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,050
what we call weight, that would be average and we needed to produce the weighted moving averages.

18
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:20,340
And when we found out that they the the best weights for if we were going to have the median weighted moving average for this particular time series,

19
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:32,390
we are going to use point seven for the oldest observation and 1.3 for the most reasonable observation to see is

20
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:40,770
we kind of backward to what you would think that we are going to push the most way to the most recent observation.

21
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:46,140
But if you think a little bit this time series looked like it's sagging.

22
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:57,420
So the most recent observation is not the best at this observation is not the best two for each one, but the one in the past is closure.

23
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:05,280
So when you see these time series that are going up and down, I'm not allowed to be compensated.

24
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:11,780
So being the you know, you have an observation now and then, oh,

25
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:18,660
that observation is too low and then the next information is high and then, oh, this is too high, then, then expectations do not go on.

26
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:26,550
This is what we call the volatility. And what happens is, again,

27
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:38,880
you are better off by looking at one more direction in the past of the month and the more here from the information that doesn't always come back.

28
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:48,690
Now, I would like for you now to be interested in the weighted moving averages.

29
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:57,570
So what I want you to do is hold these people holding these this these time series.

30
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:04,780
So I'm going to copy the Time series from here at all.

31
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:14,490
And then again, to add to the right and that I'm going to take the error and errors square and see out.

32
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:29,700
So I'm looking at the event series and what I would like to for you to do is right now get and compute a three period weighted moving average,

33
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,100
find the optimal weights and forecast period, 25 and 26.

34
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:49,500
And I'm going to give you about 5 minutes of the math. I would do it one more time.

35
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,390
You can talk to your neighbors and friends and.

36
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:12,510
Just about 30 seconds.

37
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,560
To. To to. Just the three.

38
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:35,800
You need to sort this out.

39
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:52,750
I think you need to do something.

40
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:02,090
I think it's making you girls in the picture.

41
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:14,400
You know, you don't need to be doing this for.

42
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:33,270
I'm like, Oh, yeah.

43
00:06:38,350 --> 00:07:10,320
I feel like I'm just doing something that I just, you know, still trying to do is start at something.

44
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,580
That's not what I would have been engaging.

45
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,670
I would be the formula for everything that we did.

46
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:26,990
Moving average right. So is the forecast for period people as one is the only one times the observations and the

47
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:33,580
most of the two times the operation and the main one goes to the consideration of two.

48
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:42,360
And then the last one we do that. The one thing you have to be equal to one and you have to leave the weights and

49
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,200
you have to take the weights in such a way that are the best possible one.

50
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,870
So you know how to do that. You minimize that means wherever you.

51
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:13,640
Just. To me, it's just.

52
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,880
Confused. Yeah, that'll help some.

53
00:08:32,140 --> 00:09:01,260
No, thankfully. And you see when you first.

54
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,889
Okay. That's enough to get your juices flowing.

55
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,980
So let's actually start doing this all together.

56
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:53,050
Okay, so. So what is the first thing I need to do?

57
00:09:53,560 --> 00:10:01,390
Be I need to get weights, right? So and then the weights are going to be WS three.

58
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:15,610
No need to. And the only one I know that there's some weird looking people and then I am going to become.

59
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:21,120
Yes. Could you zoom in next? I'll show you a little bit of what I think you might.

60
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,920
Yeah. That's good. Yeah.

61
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,320
You know, so.

62
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,040
So we have three weights and there's some. And what.

63
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:47,690
What I would like to do now is just come up with weights and arbitrary weights.

64
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:54,920
And the most out of the one is say, you going to 43 and 45, right.

65
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:05,630
Let's say I go point to. From 3.50 to 1.

66
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,629
Then I'm going to create a formula here, so I'm not going to just have one.

67
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,890
I'm going to create a formula. And that's the sum of the ways.

68
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:29,820
And then I'm going to also let me produce a forecast.

69
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,870
So the forecasts are going to be okay.

70
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:40,140
I am going to produce the study period.

71
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,580
Weighted moving averages.

72
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:59,710
Right. And the first the first forecast I can produce a firm period that I can produce a forecast is the number or.

73
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,260
Okay. So I need to I need to get video number one, two, one, three.

74
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,580
Multiply that times its weight and produce the forecast for opinion.

75
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:16,920
Before he said think forecast because I'm just figuring out how the the time series how how

76
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:24,350
the 3 billion moving averages would have and would of perform with these specific weights.

77
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:31,799
Right. So I am going to do my 3 billion moving averages by just multiplying these

78
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,290
weights times the three numbers and then controlling that will be an average.

79
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,830
So what's the best way to do that? Multiplication.

80
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,590
I can go oh, five times three, 3.3, ten three eight.

81
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:55,320
What's that mean for me? Like an Excel information in Excel that allow me to scale this some product.

82
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:04,890
There's some product in Excel, so it gets two columns or two rows or two blocks of the same dimension.

83
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:12,720
I'm multiplying each corresponding element with the other corresponding element and add them.

84
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:21,090
Well, you know all these multiplications together. So here I'm going to do some useful.

85
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:33,970
So from day one, you're going to get 3 to 1.

86
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,630
And I just want those weak to remain fixed.

87
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:43,350
And therefore, I am going to put a dollar sign on those weight for me.

88
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,100
I'm going to press function for that.

89
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:57,880
And then I get the weight block and then I'm going to apply the three weights times, the three observations.

90
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:06,070
The most recent observation, one motivation in the past, and two observations in that, and then close parentheses.

91
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:15,280
And that's going to be my first forecast for with my three people losing weight and moving average 34.1.

92
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:24,310
So I have an editor here. Right. And I'm going to keep checking that editor and the more foreign gas I produce.

93
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:40,300
Okay. So let me make sure we don't get a lot of decimals about if we use or mind these numbers so we can just see we need to see this.

94
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:52,060
So I'm going to format with no decimal these numbers and now I can write this formula down.

95
00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:02,370
Right. And I have my forecast with the my three period weighted moving average with these weights.

96
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:08,340
So how do I know if these, you know, how good these forecasts are?

97
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,110
I am going to compute the MSE by the means wherever, wherever.

98
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:17,760
So I'm going to take for each of these numbers.

99
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:24,830
I'm going to take this number and I'm going to take the difference between these two and going to be friends.

100
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,980
And then I'm going to add that to this different square and these different square,

101
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:34,440
and then I'm going to add all these different squares, and then I'm going to average them.

102
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:39,360
And we're not divided by the total number of forecasts that we have.

103
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:44,270
So that's why I'm going to get here.

104
00:15:44,280 --> 00:16:01,080
I'm going to use my MSE is e is equal to the sum of X minus y squared, the open parentheses.

105
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:05,040
And then this is going to be first this column.

106
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:13,820
Home grown kids. I'm done. I wrote just to get everything the corner.

107
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:23,020
And I'm going to compare that to each one here and then control the heat.

108
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,960
And then I wrote the close parenthesis.

109
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:36,290
So I have the two columns and I have these two columns into the sum of H minus Y squared.

110
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:42,170
So I'm just going to get to the sum of squared inverse.

111
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,180
And now if I want to get the average of the sum of its wherever,

112
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:51,290
it has a way to divide that by the total number of numerical or or the total number of workouts that I have.

113
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,610
And I don't have to remember how many I have.

114
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:59,900
I just need to use a function in Excel or the count function.

115
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:10,300
So I'm going to count open parentheses and I can use either column to count, right?

116
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:16,240
So when I use the one with the word gospel through the Chief and Arrow two,

117
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:25,700
I do use the length of the column, close parentheses and the and then we have 7.93, whatever.

118
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:30,970
What does it mean? We don't know, but we want to make this as small as possible.

119
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:35,120
That's what we want. We don't need all these decimals.

120
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:41,940
This let's get to that. So I got 794 and that's now in my means square.

121
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:58,250
And that means that, that, that the average of the sum of the squares, the, the average of the of the square errors is equal to seven.

122
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:07,370
So I think one is what I want to know is what I know is I and then the average all the square entrance and then I said,

123
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,210
okay, now what is that I want to do?

124
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:26,410
How about if we pulled that to see how it looks? So I'm going to plot that by see lately.

125
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:34,820
I can see. Yeah, I want to ask and I just want.

126
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,730
In the what we have to do now is block these numbers.

127
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:57,210
Oh, God. You mean, like you said, I'm going to I'm going to put out these numbers.

128
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,149
And you remember how we all that before. So I'm going to get the X axis.

129
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:07,370
The time period will highlight all of these.

130
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:23,430
And then I'm going to get the three period moving averages and then control the base and click on the first one and then an arrow.

131
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:27,870
And then I need also the next two.

132
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,770
Even though they are not, they don't have anything in yet.

133
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:40,410
And once they have these two columns, I'm going to copy those columns.

134
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:51,480
Then I'm going back to my graph and I'm going to activate the graph and then I'm going to do it based.

135
00:19:51,550 --> 00:20:01,330
Especially what I want to do is a new series and the series is in columns right

136
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:06,630
in the why isn't it in the third quarter and tripling of the weighted average.

137
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:13,170
The series names are in the first row, so then they lose what he said they'd be a moving average.

138
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:23,220
The first row is not no number and just labels and the X values are in the first column, say C and then okay.

139
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,950
And that's how my three year moving average looks like.

140
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:36,240
I don't know how good or how bad it is, but I know that I can forecast with this.

141
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,899
But I don't want to forecast with any wins.

142
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:46,790
I want to forecast with the best possible way. So I don't know if I can get these numbers down right.

143
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:52,709
And I don't know how much how far down I can get that number.

144
00:20:52,710 --> 00:21:03,840
So what I'm going to do is I am going to use in procedure a routine and optimization routine called solver and solver

145
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:17,120
solver is going to take their weights and is going to try to minimize these number here by making sure that my wave,

146
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:21,300
I don't do one and they weights are between zero and one.

147
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:35,850
So let's do that as we did before. So I'm going to get into oh, by the way, let's actually you see that .5.3, 1.2 are here.

148
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:41,450
We can can change those way, right? So we can say point four, point four.

149
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:48,630
I'm going to basically say that we went for one four, one, two.

150
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:54,990
Right. And when we do that, the the red graph is going to change this and all that type of work.

151
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:59,100
So and they add the MSCI change.

152
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:04,380
So what we want to do is change those weights in order to get everything done.

153
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:10,920
So let's do that by going into some of the data so over.

154
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:19,080
And what I want to do is what I want to minimize or maximize something.

155
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:31,020
I want to minimize I want to minimize the M and see this number here by changing these weights here.

156
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:41,660
So I use highlight is to get four and subject to the constraint that the columns

157
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:49,950
they're weights okay I don't need the some of their weights must be equal to one.

158
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:58,380
So some of the weights which is this number here at six must be equal to one.

159
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:05,490
And also I need that that the the weights.

160
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:11,549
Okay, each one of them must be less than or equal to one in the A independently.

161
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:18,390
So I just have to highlight or select all of them and then put less than or equal to one.

162
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:22,110
That doesn't mean that this some is less than one.

163
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:27,870
That means that each one of them is due at the forward, must be less than or equal to one.

164
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:38,220
And if if you keep these I check these mark make unconstrained variables non negative outlook.

165
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:43,030
Myopically the weights will be. Equal to zero will be nominated.

166
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:49,000
So now I want to minimize the MSE by changing that way.

167
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,280
So you to that the weight must be less than or equal to one.

168
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:59,560
Each one of them. And the sum must be both one and time.

169
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:07,600
You know, this is a nonlinear optimization, so I leave that as it is, and then I sort of got into bed.

170
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,830
The minimum MSE happens to be 5.92.

171
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,370
It's the best possible graph that you can see here.

172
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,200
These are the best possible way.

173
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:32,500
So I would be assigning 29% to the most recent observation, 63% to the other one and then 8% to the two peers in the past.

174
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:39,670
So if you want to get these two to.

175
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:53,180
To do this. Also, we got to point to 8.60 3.29.

176
00:24:54,110 --> 00:25:05,210
Those are my ultimate. And then now now that you have that, then you can forecast heating at 25 and period when.

177
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:11,450
So we have immediate 25 and 26.

178
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,170
So how we forecast period 25.

179
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:24,409
So I am going to check the weight and I'm going to use the weight and I'm going to

180
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:29,840
use w one times these number w two times this number W three times this number.

181
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:36,620
And that's going to be my forecast would be 25. So all I need to do in this case is drop these for me.

182
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,960
So I get City five. And so what about period 26?

183
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:47,090
Well, for me at 26, I don't have these observations.

184
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:57,739
So I would have to know, I would have to multiply w one times these operations of two times this operation, three times this operation.

185
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:06,330
But I don't have these observations. So I'm going to take the forecast as the observation that I don't have now.

186
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:15,290
So I'm going to say this is equal to 35 times the new one.

187
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:27,320
Not. Seen these 36 times going to.

188
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:40,240
Plus. Finally, 35 times W3.

189
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:48,240
And then he entered. And then I get three seats in my mind.

190
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:53,080
Four guys. Let me make these. 35.

191
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:57,650
So. Same.

192
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:15,610
Same format. All right. So those are my forecasts that if I'm on the digits for the next video, 4546, using the three medium weighted moving average.

193
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:30,160
And the questioning is, you know, you want to see how I close then that we have to wage don't always do to block that at the first line.

194
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:43,510
It already extended that, so automatically Excel extended that forecast.

195
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:51,010
So we have 25 and 20 seats here and 25 quickly and when you think which is 35 and 36.

196
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:58,930
So I didn't have to make any effort or any particular effort in forecasting this.

197
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:10,060
So you have them. All right. So those are my forecast for the period 25 videos and questions.

198
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:23,680
The question I think you can you just do the solver part one more time when you got the constraints on in three theta solver.

199
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:29,780
You don't. You see that?

200
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,400
What is that? What is the input for those? Some equaling one.

201
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,170
Huh. So this is the sum equal.

202
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:45,230
One is is six equal to one. Oh, you don't you just highlight the one bottom number.

203
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:53,450
I see. Gotcha. Thank you. How did you type that into the box for the participants?

204
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:58,570
So you know the constraint. Oh, okay. So you just add them to.

205
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,620
Right. So let me delete all these constraints here.

206
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:10,280
And then you. You know how I got this, right?

207
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:15,880
And then by changing the variables have to wait for I just highlighted those.

208
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:21,020
Right. And then what I want is this.

209
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:34,880
So I want to add height. And the add is the sum of these three numbers, which is a formula here is has to be equal to one.

210
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:46,910
And I know also that the is w1w with dual w three they have to be less than or equal can be one.

211
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:51,260
Right. And those are my goals. Right. Okay.

212
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:58,490
And I want to minimize. All right.

213
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:04,010
So how about this?

214
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,920
How about if you do this for p weighted moving average?

215
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:19,560
Do that by yourself right now. To.

216
00:30:40,690 --> 00:31:12,810
It's. Yeah.

217
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:21,820
Oh. So.

218
00:31:32,230 --> 00:32:06,260
This. It's to.

219
00:32:39,710 --> 00:33:22,810
Six. It's an opportunity for us to do.

220
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:44,990
Oh, you need three additional. Yes, please.

221
00:33:47,810 --> 00:34:12,560
You need to just basically raise your hand if you're done.

222
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,060
I'll let you finish this. So.

223
00:34:41,800 --> 00:35:11,490
This was a hard. I just want you to know that I can't use graphs and graphs right now.

224
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:55,200
You know, you can actually not only break your hand if you're done all right, and you have about 10% of the year you didn't do it.

225
00:35:55,410 --> 00:36:15,680
So we're not. That's right.

226
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:26,120
That's. Right.

227
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:46,880
Okay. The first thing is we need to come up with weights and then let's say this is the point when we do for 3.4, things are up one, right?

228
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,970
Then I create a formula here and this is some of.

229
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:03,280
On this week's. First.

230
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:13,280
So I am going to I am going to name some of these variables, for example, these global variables now.

231
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:22,280
So I highlight these local variables and then I am going to here in the name box, I'm going to pull that way.

232
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:29,250
It is. I know there are alternatives to do things just to use excel in probabilities.

233
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:42,000
So I'm going to call these weights. It doesn't matter if it is uppercase or lowercase with them.

234
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:48,810
And then the one here is going to be that cell.

235
00:37:49,140 --> 00:38:07,630
And then I hope that some of. This one here I am going to hold the embassy.

236
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:23,510
And is that right?

237
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:34,550
So when I like the four waves, you know that the big bugs, that name bugs tells me that that block is gold weight.

238
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:41,700
When I just put my cursor on this cell G 16 then.

239
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:51,460
Now I know it is something. And then we put my cursor on the and 18.

240
00:38:52,200 --> 00:39:00,479
That sounds cool and is the right. So I need to create a formula here which is this some of these weights.

241
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,040
So this is going to be equal to that's.

242
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:15,370
There's some of the ways we see these, of course, this fourth period.

243
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,710
This is this is a some of the white.

244
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:36,850
And then. Then now I am going to create a continuous wave and moving average and first where we can have work

245
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:43,180
has been going on for five and the formula that I'm going to put here is going to be there's some.

246
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:59,010
Open parentheses. Oh, they wait. Coma for a number.

247
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:09,400
And then I will simply drag this formula down.

248
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:22,960
On my mercy with the war within, our reach is going to be it.

249
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,500
Who is Tom Hanks?

250
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:40,100
My mom lives where I need to get compared to observations of you,

251
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:48,670
and I wrote them all now, and I need to compare that to the 40 weighted moving average.

252
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:57,850
I read this book I wrote in Close Friendship and then divide it by the account.

253
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:09,220
I've got a little bit of overreaching to forecast in this case so she knows what to look for in business.

254
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,810
So 7.29 fatigue.

255
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:25,690
And I want to optimize those beliefs. Right. I'm going to go into data silver and silver.

256
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:36,420
What I want to I want to reset or that again, because I am doing value optimizations and what is that I want to do?

257
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:50,940
I want to minimize minimize what? I want to minimize the events that I can just see now by changing what we.

258
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:05,900
So I'm getting to in some ways what I call that sum that has to be equal to one.

259
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:17,780
And also a ways. You have to be less than or equal to.

260
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,840
One independently. Right.

261
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:27,980
So this is is the same thing we did before.

262
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:33,760
But it's a little bit more. Do you really need this?

263
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:46,310
The the second constraint, if you have the checkbox for non-negative variables, click like aren't those doing the same thing or no?

264
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:51,530
Why is the weight has to be greater than or equal to zero?

265
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:56,600
And the other is the weights have to be. They said that it would you know, but.

266
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:12,640
Well, but if the some of the weights have to be equal to one and then the birth weights can also not be negative.

267
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:18,130
Yeah, I think you're right. I think I think I don't I don't need it. It's just to one completely.

268
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:22,120
But I think you're right. Okay. I think just one.

269
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:32,130
Yeah, that's how I like to do it.

270
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:46,060
And we all sit there all day long, and then we got these .19 for you.

271
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:53,049
And so we have four zero.

272
00:43:53,050 --> 00:44:04,400
8.60 4.27 range is pretty much when we would be for the new world.

273
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:15,910
You. So.

274
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:28,410
Okay. So .1.6.3.

275
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:42,780
We needed more or. Close the bond.

276
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:46,690
08. 65.27.

277
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:55,000
Pretty much the same thing. So this is this is I want to read something here.

278
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:07,840
Did you see that for the three period moving average to the period moving average, their weight didn't change that but give you that to change title.

279
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:15,310
So we have the W three is point eight, which is pretty small.

280
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:19,210
And www4 is zero.

281
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,470
So that means that this is a three period movie now. Right.

282
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:35,020
So in the the idea here is that if you try a four period moving average,

283
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:39,970
you don't have to try a three year moving average or moving average because

284
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:44,500
the best solution would have been in three 3D were it to be a moving average.

285
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:51,810
They wait at a put aw4 and W three would have been few like in this case.

286
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:59,290
So this is the best you can do with a three year moving average with this way instead of 28.65, 1.67.

287
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:05,740
The difference in the MSE that you have here is because we have a fewer number of observations.

288
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:15,220
The average and that's why we're dividing by a you know by is is slightly lower but that's it that's pretty much the same.

289
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:28,290
So. So when you are doing this kind of analysis, just think with the maximum about four feet,

290
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:32,369
you're moving averages and weighted and you'll see their weights,

291
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:38,069
each one of them weights the weights in that they they find that observation

292
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:43,700
is very small but he's got it because this is equivalent to a lower repeat.

293
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:59,290
You're moving that weight then moving up. So it's better to have a parsimonious model like a three period moving average and has zero.

294
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:07,589
You don't you don't have the four and you have these three numbers rather than these four numbers.

295
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:12,900
This number, for example, is going to be a very, very small number here.

296
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:16,320
Not exactly zero. So if you have, let's say.

297
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:30,580
Pretty much zero. So you said 3 billion. Okay.

298
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,300
All right. So you get the idea.

299
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:41,889
All right. All right. So now that's about the three, the weighted moving averages.

300
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:51,070
So there is another. Another model that I want to show you.

301
00:47:51,370 --> 00:48:04,280
That is another way to go. Moving averages of moving averages is called exponential moving and these weighted moving average instead of using them

302
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:14,530
use a few observations in the past is going to use all the observations in the past but is going to wait to the most.

303
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,420
The oldest observations are going to start declining, declining, declining decline.

304
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:32,559
Right. So if I if if you take for gas observation 25, for example, the weights in your day that you give to observation one is going to be very small.

305
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:41,139
And if you forecast Earth Observation 26, the way that you apply to observation number one is going to be even smaller.

306
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:45,310
So the weights are automatically climbing.

307
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,970
So as to the weight that you assigned to, the most recent observation is always the same,

308
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:57,730
but all the other ways are going to go down exponentially in this case.

309
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:00,370
So let me show you what.

310
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:23,430
So if you, for example, you have these series of observation, observation one and then motivation two or three or three or observation five.

311
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:35,950
And then you use these observations in order to forecast six periods six then you are going to apply a weight to these

312
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:43,780
observations to operational five and then a smaller weight to observation four and a smaller weight to observation three.

313
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,350
And it's more of a window observation to one, a smaller way to observation one.

314
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:54,040
But let's say that then you want to forecast sitting, right,

315
00:49:54,040 --> 00:50:02,230
and then you obtain observations six Then you apply the same way that you apply to observation five here,

316
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:05,870
but then all the others are going to start declining, right?

317
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,240
And declining and smaller and smaller and smaller.

318
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:21,010
So then every time you forecast in your observations, you will still use all the observations in the past,

319
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:25,050
but you even wait for those observations in the present.

320
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:34,840
So it's like you are forgetting exponentially. The oldest observation, not totally forgetting them, but slowly forgetting.

321
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:43,240
That's you. It is. And that's, you know, what we call this plumbing shall be continually building.

322
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:50,080
So that's mean this wounding needs exponential in these outings.

323
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:53,950
So how do we do that? Maybe.

324
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,790
Let me show you what the formula is going to be.

325
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:12,040
So the formula is different. If I want to forecast this thing, he knows one that is going to be equal.

326
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,570
That the alpha times the observation that opinion.

327
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:29,140
The most recent observation. Last one minus alpha the forecast you.

328
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,070
So I forecasted something for Pete.

329
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,840
Pete and I made a mistake.

330
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:50,120
So I have an observation. So the difference between the two results is the error between the observation and the forecast.

331
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:58,010
So in order to forecast the future, I'm going to take the observation that I have right now very serious,

332
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:03,200
and then I'm going to multiply that times some week. And the forecast that I made.

333
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,790
I'm going to multiply that times one minus, you know that.

334
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:15,250
Wait, so it's going to be a weighted average between what I thought I was going to get and what I really got right.

335
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:19,100
So in essence is going to be okay.

336
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:27,230
I forecasted I forecasted here what the real observation was here.

337
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:34,520
Right. So my forecast for the next period is going to be in between those numbers can be something here.

338
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:44,360
Right? So this is I'm going to this is going to be my observation.

339
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,630
This is going to be my work guess. Right.

340
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:55,850
And then I'm going to multiply these times alpha and these one minus alpha, and then it's going to be between the two.

341
00:52:56,060 --> 00:53:05,540
So my forecast for the next period is forecast, what, 80 plus one is going to be in between the two,

342
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:11,440
between the forecast that I had before and the observation that I that I obtained.

343
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:21,169
So let's say, for example, suppose that the alpha alpha is 4.5 and then you say, okay,

344
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:31,700
I'm going to forecast yesterday I forecasted that today we are going to have a demand of $0.50.

345
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:36,020
So my forecast for today forecast perpetuity.

346
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:45,690
Is equal to 50. But then I look at the observation today and the observation today is in Hungary.

347
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:50,430
So the observation today is a Hungary.

348
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:58,140
And then you tell me so. Okay. Now, I saw a hundred and I forecasted it 50.

349
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:01,530
So what is going to be my forecast for tomorrow?

350
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:08,250
So if Alpha is they say that Alpha is point five, right?

351
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:15,560
So I'm going to multiply point 5800 times, point five times, 50 times.

352
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:20,640
So my forecast for tomorrow is 75.

353
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:29,520
Eight is not going to be what I see today because that's some error term here.

354
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:34,950
But it's not going to be what a forecast for today because, you know, I made a mistake.

355
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:41,070
My my my model is not totally correct. So I'm going to adjust it.

356
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:44,610
So I'm going to get something in between.

357
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:58,610
So in Alpha, I think 2.5. Then my foreign guys are going to be 75, 45 is equal to one.

358
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:04,430
Then my fourth guy is going to be Hungary to leave.

359
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:15,230
Depends. Depends on what alpha. Alpha is the way that I give to them, to the observation that their most recent observation that I have right now,

360
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:22,130
to the observation that I, you know, I forecast it and then I may I, I, I said something.

361
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,460
I made a mistake because I have the observation now.

362
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:30,590
So how much weight the idea that observation in order to forecast the future.

363
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:36,710
That's all. If I give out 500%, then it's going to be the same thing that I observe.

364
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:45,030
If I give alpha I down to ratio, 50% of the weight is going to be exactly between the two in the middle.

365
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:57,220
If I give, you know, almost no weight to the most recent observation, that means when we have a lot of volatility,

366
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:04,700
this is being forecast with, you know, the big and the previous work.

367
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:16,310
So I just used the previous observations as a better indicator of where you see this is going rather than what I see.

368
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:25,040
That is very time and that is not. Think me anyway.

369
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,850
So how do I know what to use? So we minimize them as.

370
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:39,710
As as we did before. So let's let's do that and let's do exponential smoothing.

371
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:47,400
It's going to be moving over now.

372
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:57,960
They were going to. Get a stationary premises here.

373
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:32,090
A coffee. It's slow and slow.

374
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:44,010
Just. With speech and everything serious in Newsday.

375
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:56,640
So I am going to read all these numbers and I am going to create exponential smoothing work that is regional.

376
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:33,380
The U.S. And then the third thing I need for exponential moving forecast is the alpha line of your.

377
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,620
Any good, you know, any outfit they say point to.

378
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,490
That's the way that I'm going to assign to the most recent alteration.

379
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:55,329
And in order to forecast with exponential smoothing I need to initialize the

380
00:58:55,330 --> 00:59:03,040
exponential is running so I don't have to in the forecast for the first period.

381
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:08,709
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to start with the forecast for a single opinion.

382
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:10,480
So I'm going to ignore that first period.

383
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:23,110
And the second period is going to be the four day forecast that I'm going to have is the same observation that I having in in in the other one.

384
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:26,830
So this is going to be simply equal to 33.

385
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:33,420
That's my first forecast, and that's how I'm going to initialize the process.

386
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:41,370
And then after that, I can just simply hold and call the sale alpha.

387
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:45,760
So it's going to be easier for us to apply that formula.

388
00:59:48,980 --> 01:00:01,530
And the work asked for for the previous three is going to be equal to all of the times.

389
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:09,860
The observation in opinion to clause one minus all of the.

390
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:21,950
Times the forecasting value to use number in C three rate.

391
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:29,120
So I get 34 and now I can just simply copy.

392
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:41,530
He's working on that. So they can do anything, make these bigger.

393
01:00:56,310 --> 01:01:04,890
Right. And then what I want to do now is I get the best outcome possible.

394
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:09,120
So I am going to pursue that immensely.

395
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:19,140
And Jim is equal to the sum of X minus five square times.

396
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:26,080
Both embrace the old story. Can you show the formula for how you got the theme?

397
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:34,030
The first one after all of these were the one below one minus alpha.

398
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:40,570
This was the 34, if any, for increased protection for the forecasting.

399
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:47,560
So it is alpha times the observation ingredient to one minus four times the forecasting value.

400
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:58,120
So the observations show that the forecast for period three is equal to alpha times.

401
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:03,410
The observation you get two plus one minus of gas in the.

402
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:11,890
So you use the observation and the forecast that you have for the previous period in order to forecast the future.

403
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:31,029
And now the MSE is going to be equal to the square of the seas.

404
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:44,380
And then we do the same thing. This is by by county.

405
01:02:56,570 --> 01:03:02,180
And we've got 7.92 and let's make this as small as possible.

406
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:13,370
And so I go into the data, so I want to minimize the game even in this year.

407
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:21,920
So I changing after some use of.

408
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:32,960
How far is the standard equal to one? And that's pretty much it.

409
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:42,280
I've is is greater than or equal to zero and none the work will be done here in thinking.

410
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:50,570
So I get the image seen equal to seven.

411
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:54,160
So I'm going to be seeing some day in the.

412
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:01,790
MSI equal to 7.81.

413
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:09,640
You get that. And you.

414
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:25,440
So point 27 is is the best answer.

415
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:32,640
So that means that most of the observe it most of their weight is given to the previous operation.

416
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:40,620
Right. It seems that this series is very volatile and they want to feed more weight to the prior observation.

417
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:46,350
So how does this look? This both for the time opinion.

418
01:04:48,090 --> 01:05:01,800
I can. I don't need to go into insert the forecast first thing.

419
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:14,610
So how about if we forecast period 25 is simply time would move throughout these formula because these alpha times the observation goes one miles off,

420
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:24,329
then the forecast and then in video 26 is alpha times the observation.

421
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:30,630
But we don't have any observation here. Right. So we are going to be using the same forecast plus one minus are four times at work.

422
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,310
So it's going to be the same for the customers.

423
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:42,660
So in exponential smoothing, you just you just you just simply extend the last forecast and that's the same thing.

424
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:48,900
And that in this case is going to be equal to this one.

425
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:32,420
Insists that it won't. But you know, on the one hand, he lose a lot of that and then we go in search and it's why.

426
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:43,510
Marked. You.

427
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:56,310
And you can put any names that you want in charts or whatever, but you see that if we get.

428
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:15,980
She? You know, we thought from this stage you go from 33, you can see better this year.

429
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:24,930
So if you see the the exponential is more than is actually the trend with no doubt.

430
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:32,150
So if we have the time series that is very volatile.

431
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:49,150
So this shows really is trying to get the within that center that mean that low code need and ignore the noise that the accident has.

432
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:54,830
And you see that we are forecasting over here right now.

433
01:07:55,250 --> 01:08:05,210
And the more observation you got then you re optimized the alpha and then you get type of, you know, you get in new for time.

434
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:19,730
But in this case, this is the best alpha point of about 2.27, just the best you can get with this time.

435
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:27,530
And so, bottom line, how are you going to forecast these this time series?

436
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:38,270
Well, do you think you will actually use exponential smoothing because it is moving is is is very is like any

437
01:08:38,290 --> 01:08:46,670
very extended weighted moving average exponential smoothing uses all the observations in the past.

438
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:57,200
And with these simple with intensity properties like the most recent observation carries the more weight and all the other observations

439
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:08,900
are really planning with the weight and moving average has a little bit more flexibility because you can give different ways.

440
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:14,860
You don't have to have the same way. So you can have the most recent observation,

441
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:25,370
have this morning weight done one observation in the past or something like this so right for the video moving

442
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:36,349
average and try exponential is moving peak one the one with this one is amazing so you have three you have

443
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:45,200
a is stationary time series to forecast what you do is okay Ulises stationary time series so we you don't have

444
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:52,430
to provide a simple moving average because a simple moving average is a special case of a weight moving.

445
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:58,910
So the simple moving average is when you have a calculator I think you will have solved that's fine.

446
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:08,780
But if you have something like so you want to optimize weight, there's no reason for you to to use as economical.

447
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:14,990
So use a four or five year moving average.

448
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:19,040
Usually we don't get to five because it too cumbersome.

449
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:24,230
Usually we get up to four. That's enough for, you know, what they are.

450
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:30,560
You know, you can actually consolidate those weights and say, well, it is five.

451
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:36,820
All this weight is very small, so let me get a three period moving average, for example.

452
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:41,560
And when you are happy with your MSE,

453
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:51,960
it has the best see that you can get with three year of what we do with the average the transformations moving because that's absolutely right.

454
01:10:52,220 --> 01:11:00,950
So explanation is moving as another type of movies is another popular movie which I've been dealing with the best with the variance.

455
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:09,860
So for exponential exponential smoothing, can you only forecast one day in advance?

456
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:14,389
You can be one day or one period in advance.

457
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:19,430
No, you come you come August several periods in advance, but is always the same.

458
01:11:20,210 --> 01:11:28,610
Okay. So if we wanted to forecast like five periods in advance in this example, the forecast would always be 35.81.

459
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:32,990
And this is alpha times observation plus minus alpha.

460
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:40,130
Because you don't and because you don't have observation that works people's information.

461
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:43,530
So is the same thing. Yeah. Doesn't seem that useful.

462
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:52,190
It is. I mean so is what he's saying is I just found the local mean and I'm going to stay there.

463
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:54,440
All right. I'm going to come. Okay.

464
01:11:54,950 --> 01:12:06,770
That's you know, it is you'll see that the for example, in 2 million weighted moving average right after a second forecast is.

465
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:12,220
His plan is 3 billion. Moving average through the forecast is flat.

466
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:30,600
Thanks. One more thing and note that you need to remember or drive these.

467
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:41,100
But if you want to know what these cool exponential moving and free and what I told you,

468
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:47,630
that is a special case of a weighted moving average with all the weights added another one.

469
01:12:47,970 --> 01:13:06,209
So you can see that or at is a cast of in is equal to alpha names the observation of

470
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:22,070
nine laws one minus August nine being opinion nine but then four as a figure nine here.

471
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:28,520
So this is forecast between the fund. Usain Bolt icon.

472
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:41,990
No one minds out and the forecast of the nine with the focus of the United is of

473
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:51,800
that was the observation of a one minus Hong Kong times the world prize of a.

474
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:01,879
I mean, if you see this one minus alpha is going to be multiplied by one minus alpha.

475
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:09,860
So it's going to be one of those displays. And then if I just keep expanding, this is going to be one way above the.

476
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:14,230
q11 fourth, right? So that is exponential.

477
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:20,180
And because one minus number is a number less than one, right?

478
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:26,690
So those numbers, when you multiply, you race out to the new, to the fourth, to the field are going to getting smaller.

479
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:32,120
This one is more. So they are expanding. Those weights are exponentially declining.

480
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:38,930
And that's why we call it. And they are always adding up.

481
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:47,260
So next time we are going to do homework.

482
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:51,950
So you have homework that is due next Tuesday.

483
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:56,329
And the homework is pretty simple. What we are going to do that in class.

484
01:14:56,330 --> 01:15:00,140
So you are on together. We are going to do the homework.

485
01:15:00,850 --> 01:15:11,540
Oh, we finish the homework, the little one on Thursday and then you more homework and more things to read and start to work.

486
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:24,260
We're any question. All right.

487
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:52,940
Now go on the Web. Now, when you come in and say, oh, thank you very much for your time to go upstairs, or were you asking me to lunch?

488
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:01,030
Today I was trying.
