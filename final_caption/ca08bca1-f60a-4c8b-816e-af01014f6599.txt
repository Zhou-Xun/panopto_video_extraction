1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:37,980
I allow you to consider how you will contribute if you haven't paid up your midterm.

2
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,300
You can come to me every year.

3
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,760
Break. So today I'm going to move on to the next chapter.

4
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,050
Chapter four, chapter one, chapter five.

5
00:00:52,080 --> 00:01:01,200
As I mentioned before, both chapters are going to be you know, you're going to notice a significant or increase in the difficulty level.

6
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,760
So be prepared.

7
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:13,980
And also, we're going to use a lot of multivariate analysis so that when I review the material, review your calculus notes, any of these calculations.

8
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,130
Multiple integration, multiple probation analysis.

9
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:26,190
It's up to you to make sure that I go back and check the previous notes from Calculus.

10
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:32,640
Okay. So you're going to start on multi multiples, our random variables,

11
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:39,990
and this is the outline of this chapter we're going to cover join and a marginal distributions, conditional distributions.

12
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,850
And then five,

13
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:55,080
our transformation models make sure fusion's covariance correlation and multivariate distributions and it's from the book form section one,

14
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:01,560
Section six. You can also get some additional ratings from the Ross book, chapter six and seven.

15
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:07,680
All right. So first, why do we care about multivariate variables?

16
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:18,659
Previously, what we have talked about is a univariate, no matter what is this great or continuous, it's just a one right about recall.

17
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,980
That random variable is essentially a mapping right from the original sample space to the real.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,460
Now in practice, there are many cases actually we care about multiple things simultaneously.

19
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:39,720
For example, as our research, you only want to study the survival of the patient as well as the quality of life

20
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,550
of the other patients and the tacit and consistent toxicity of the of the drugs.

21
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:56,340
Now, the worse the effects of the drug on the patients. So these different factors are this different variables.

22
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:06,120
They are interrelated. They are not independent. Of example, the survival, the quality of a life may have an effect on the survival and vice versa.

23
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:15,210
They are not independent events. So one way to do it, one naive way of doing it, and I think this is to analyze them separately.

24
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:23,220
You can look at the survival alone, look at the quality of life alone, look at the toxicity of the drug alone.

25
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,150
That's fine. That's a way of analyzing this.

26
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,500
This data may not give you the best power artisan's, most comprehensive picture of what's really going on.

27
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:44,790
So sometimes when you have very small sample size, just to look at a one hour bar at a time and not be sufficient,

28
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:52,680
you may not be able to get much, but if you look at multiple variables together, maybe you can leverage the relation between different variables.

29
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:58,670
We got a better understanding of what's really going on right now in genetic studies, right?

30
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,790
You can analyze each chart or each genetic marker separately,

31
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,310
but you can also analyze them all together by treating them as multivariate randomized trials.

32
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,760
There is a big difference between the two. Okay, so hopefully after learning this chapter,

33
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:23,190
you will get a better understanding of why it's different and why sometimes it is better than to look at this.

34
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,989
One of our individual examples concerns, for example,

35
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:35,310
the reproductive health studies in the long history of the time to pregnancy, spontaneous abortion that you find.

36
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:41,610
Again, these are all related factors and related variables that can be measured on the same set

37
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:47,879
of individuals so they can be analyzed together using this multivariate data and so on.

38
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,620
So of course you want to analyze this multiple running variables together.

39
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:59,790
We need a framework. We need a new tools, definitions to help us define what we mean.

40
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,590
This multivariate distribution for multivariate roundabouts.

41
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,689
So previously what are we have down is only valid for a single run of our analysis.

42
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,580
So our data was multiple random variables. We need new definitions of patients.

43
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,030
So this brings us to the theory of joint distributions.

44
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:27,300
So to start with, we, we're going to begin with the simple case where we only have to run a variables,

45
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,760
but later on we will move to we will try to multiple variables.

46
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,070
Many of the notions actually I'm going to carry over here.

47
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:47,970
So make sure that you're following our central dual variable case before you jump to the multiple variable case and it is carried over.

48
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,430
All right. So the five varied running variables is defined as follows.

49
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,640
That X and yb2 round of variables define on the same probability space.

50
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:11,499
So that's very important. We are originally from the same sample probability space if they are totally different things.

51
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,620
For example, X is whether it's a brand or not today, and a y is the age of some individual.

52
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:23,410
There is no point of analyzing this to the current right or irrelevant.

53
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:34,959
So they have to be from the same probability space. Then we compare this to the variables and the pair is going to become a function

54
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,180
that maps points in the original sample space as to this two dimensional plane.

55
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:45,130
Our square. Why are the words the two dimensional space right where I mean it was.

56
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:53,140
And for the university's acts to sum up the original probability space of the real space to the real line.

57
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,480
Now we are mapping the original sample space to a two dimensional plane.

58
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,300
And so that's the main difference.

59
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:11,380
And in order to define probability for this pair, we just take any set in that plane and make it back to the original space.

60
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,500
The idea is exactly the same as before, but the operation is slightly different.

61
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,309
So originally, what do we have is a sample space, right? We have a mapping, for example,

62
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:33,010
as a maps to the real space and to define probability of this run of our whole taking value or taking the law into a set,

63
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:39,760
we just take a particular set in this particular barrel site from this real space and map it back.

64
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:50,860
Okay. So assume there is a there's a one there is a mapping between this around side A and the original.

65
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:00,690
It's a hate crime by anybody else that a crime in this real space.

66
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,830
We can always find this event events at a in the original sample space pass.

67
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:17,910
The probability of acts belongs to this or else that is defined as a probability of all of this event.

68
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,080
Such that acts of Omega.

69
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,180
Loans to a product or other words in means.

70
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:43,700
But I think the probability of this event in this is that that's how we define probability for this random variable in universities.

71
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,730
Now, the only thing that's different is we have a.

72
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:59,060
New mapping, a five hour mapping X and Y, which maps the original sample space to this hour square,

73
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,700
which is the point where everything stayed the same.

74
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:13,220
So in order to define a probability, you just find a parallel set in this hour square and map it back to the original sample space.

75
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:18,170
And then you can properly define the probability in the original sample space.

76
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,280
That's how you define the probability for this binary random variable.

77
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,460
I will give a few examples to demonstrate what this means.

78
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:40,270
So consider this example. You are waving a fair coin three times, Barry Bonds three times.

79
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,630
And we have we define two random arrivals.

80
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:57,340
One represents the number of pass on the last pass and another out of our role in Node, the total number of cards in the three tosses.

81
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,940
The first question what is the support for is?

82
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,610
Yes. Zero or one. There are one binary, right.

83
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:19,080
You either got a hat or you got a tail. You can you know, it has one zero or y vice versa.

84
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,770
But anyway, it's a binary, discrete, random variable.

85
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,790
And what about the Y? What is a what is the support for Y?

86
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,920
Why? Simple question. 010123.

87
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:43,000
Very good. All right. That's the only possible outcomes that I can get for Y.

88
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:50,380
So there's X and Y. First of all, we can check the all originate from the same sample space.

89
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:56,350
The all comes from the flipping out three flipping the coin three times.

90
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:05,710
So if you conduct the experiment, flipping the coin three times, all possible outcomes becomes the original sample space.

91
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:14,750
All right. Which is listed here. These are all possible outcomes for this 3000.

92
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:21,580
In a row, eight horsepower comes, and that's two to the power of three.

93
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:26,570
All right. And that's the original sample space. So this is your us.

94
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:46,450
And we can say that these x one pair essentially map the original sample space to a few points in this hour, square foot.

95
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:54,040
And for all of the other points, all the other points in the planet basically have a probability zero and are only

96
00:11:54,130 --> 00:12:00,670
being non-zero for a few points in this two dimensional plane in particular,

97
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,860
for each outcome, we can write out what these x y values are.

98
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:18,340
If you your outcome in our original three policies is three hats, then we know for x I set it's one zero.

99
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,360
So perhaps the value is what one of the last cars is a hat and the y.

100
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:35,499
The number of paths is three. So that's why we have a particular .13 in this two dimensional space to the two

101
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:42,420
dimensional plane that is the mapping of the original outcome had to work.

102
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,450
Similarly, what is the one car assigned to this second outcome?

103
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:59,680
In our original sample space? If you have an outcome of hat and tail, what is the value that corresponds to?

104
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,440
See what I can do.

105
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:13,360
Come on. To. What is the matter?

106
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:21,760
Perhaps because we had as 120 what is it should be zero, right?

107
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:29,980
Because the last thing is that tail. So Alex represents that number of hats on the last pass.

108
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,880
So that's a zero. Okay.

109
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:42,490
And what about line 2 to 2 out of three causes?

110
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,990
All right. So that is another data point in this to the two dimensional plot.

111
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,520
Similarly, you can write the remaining are this one, what is ax?

112
00:13:51,520 --> 00:14:12,760
What is y axis? What? It's 2.1 and y two Knox 10101201.

113
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:19,750
This is 11100.

114
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:36,030
This completes the mapping. These points are the support for this binary right about this.

115
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:42,370
This is the support for the binary right now on the two dimensional plane,

116
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:53,890
only based on how non-zero probabilities every other point have zero probability and any can say they are not all different.

117
00:14:54,670 --> 00:15:07,480
For example, if the original outcome is had, tail, head or tail had had it both across the same data point one, two, it doesn't have to be different.

118
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:18,070
And from from the original experiment, we know that each outcome has equal probability.

119
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:24,460
If you toss a coin three times, you are equally likely to get any one of these eight outcomes.

120
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:29,020
So the probability of each outcome in our original sample space is always one eight.

121
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:39,040
Okay. And now with this mapping, you can define the PMS, the probability mass function for this bivariate random variable.

122
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:46,720
In particular, we know the probability of args equal to one y equal to three is what?

123
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,980
Now to find out about age as you just log into this.

124
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:01,010
AVL and say which outcome corresponds to one, three or X and Y,

125
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:08,970
and you find there's only one case that corresponds to one three, so it has a probability of 181 over.

126
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:15,890
Okay. And what about the probability of an equal to zero y equal to one?

127
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:30,750
What's the probability of x equals zero or one? Our exports are very good.

128
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:39,270
That's one over eight here, plus one over eight from here.

129
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,480
All right. There are two possible outcomes in our results space.

130
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,280
I gave you zero one.

131
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:57,240
So the probability of actually for a0y for a one is a probability of having those two outcomes, which is two overhead or one over and so on, so forth.

132
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:04,290
You kind of work out all possible work out the probabilities for all support points.

133
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:14,309
And that gave you the PM out for this binary right about any kind of easily tracked that the pump wasn't up

134
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:23,190
to one of its support because there won't be any outcome that is missing or any outcome that's on it twice.

135
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:35,460
Right. Original sample space. If you sum up the probability for each for each unique outcome, you got total probability equal to one.

136
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:40,050
Same here for this mapping of this binary available.

137
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,460
If you sum up all the probabilities for all of this distinct.

138
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,630
Support points. You also have the probability, some of you.

139
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,800
But I gave you the piano for this five hour ceremony.

140
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:12,660
Any question. So that's for that's a discrete case.

141
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:22,290
In fact, we can define CDF for both discrete, continuous or some combination of the two for this binary random variable.

142
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:29,850
And recalling the univariate case. That's also the that's also how we started.

143
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:41,220
Right. So it's first introduced the CDF cumulative distribution function and then for this program are all with if PM were continuous random variable,

144
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,180
we define PDR. So it's the same thing here.

145
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:51,480
The CDF is common regardless of the type of this run of animals.

146
00:18:53,670 --> 00:19:01,140
So we define that joint CDF for this bivariate run a variable and as follows

147
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:09,450
We use this notation AB with two arguments x and Y to the CDF of this primary

148
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:16,559
random variable at volume x and y and in particular just affects y is means the

149
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:22,440
probability of x last are equal to and and y last are equal to a small line.

150
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:39,720
So this comma means that right now, the other words, it's the intersection of these two events acts less already for us and y that's our current one.

151
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:48,729
Sometimes we also use this notation closely at the lyrics that have the Y in in

152
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:54,400
the subscript to denote that is corresponding to as two of our running variables.

153
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,690
Right. So this is a definition of the joint CDF.

154
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,860
And from the definition we can say the following properties.

155
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,610
First Property says it's a probability. It's always going to be equal to zero, right?

156
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:17,790
It's always non-active. So that's straightforward to you.

157
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:25,920
And second, if you impose it, you set the small acts on small like both to be positive infinity.

158
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,820
What do we have on the right hand side?

159
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:38,190
We have this infinity. Infinity. On the left hand side, we have this probability of X last article infinity y less than or equal to infinity.

160
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,460
That's basically everything, right?

161
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:50,700
The entire space, the entire real space and the entire real space, two dimensional space map back to the original sample space.

162
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,850
And what's the probability of their original substance?

163
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:04,530
So that's why if you plot in the affinity of both X and Y, you're gonna see the outlier to be equal to one.

164
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:11,260
So that's the other extreme. And anything between going to be between zero and one.

165
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,380
Because, again, it's a probability. Right.

166
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,100
Really has to be between zero and one. And it reached zero.

167
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:31,320
Love on side average one on the right hand side. And that's we can say we have the falling properties.

168
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,350
If we just plug in one maximum infinity, two X or Y.

169
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:43,470
And so what you have is take a look at this 1/1.

170
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:49,649
And so the city of evaluate out acts equal to negative infinity.

171
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,360
And why go through this small line?

172
00:21:52,050 --> 00:22:02,010
By definition, what that means is the probability of heights last are equal to negative infinity and y that's already far to small.

173
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:14,970
All right. That's the that that's the definition. And as I said, this is this relation is which means major section of this two separate events.

174
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:21,270
So if you look at the first event that's already put in active infinity, what is that event?

175
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:27,940
That's a nonevent, right? Meaning in maps.

176
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:31,810
Back to the original sample space.

177
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:44,870
If this guy maps to the outside in the Orient somehow space, then whatever set it in intersect with us will always be an 80 seconds.

178
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,640
So that's why there's always going to be zero.

179
00:22:50,410 --> 00:23:01,270
Similarly, if you plug in nothing infinity in the place up, why, you also got zero yellow words for the five arid or destroyed city.

180
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,890
As long as you could not the infinity and one of the spot, you got zero.

181
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,360
And of course, if you put an active infinity in both places, you also got to zero.

182
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:19,300
You can also prove this by just referring to the definition.

183
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:40,990
All right. So lost property is that the the city our function is now decreasing and right continues in each variable separately.

184
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,850
So it's a bivariate function, meaning it's a function with two arguments.

185
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:52,510
But it can always fix one and treat it as a univariate function of the other argument.

186
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:57,130
All right. So you can consider ly to be constant.

187
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,460
So it's fixed. Then this affects y becomes a function of actual.

188
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:14,860
You're treated that way. Now, what the last property says is that it's now decreasing and right continuous with respect to X and Y,

189
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:25,419
that let's say if the base of Y line that speaks of why the Y zero representing

190
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:33,070
it's a constant and only allowed ax to change and why is it not decreasing.

191
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,910
All we have to refer to this definition. All right.

192
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:50,050
Because by definition, that means the probability of the last X are equal to this small ax, and white lies are equal to this Y zero.

193
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:57,520
When we change as these terms does not change by the words the event,

194
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:04,720
they be the events corresponding to that line and that sorry for the y zero stay the same.

195
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:09,220
The only thing that's changing is the events that are responding to acts.

196
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:18,580
That's why smocks. If you increase this small x value, they say that the first step just becomes larger.

197
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:25,120
I tend to be super set up there of the previous set corresponding with a smaller acts x,

198
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,840
then the intersection of this to going to be a superset of the intersection of the previous two sets.

199
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:36,520
That's why the probability is going to be now decreasing.

200
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:40,990
It won't go on. It's smaller, it can stay the same, but it can also increase.

201
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,990
All right. And also, it's a right continuous and that is corresponding to.

202
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:58,240
That's the property. Right. The property of we are using this the last hour equal to instead of last time is going to be right.

203
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:05,230
If you take the limit from that from the from the right, it's going to be continuous.

204
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:10,960
So now we have we have send out or univariate cases.

205
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,870
The last property just tells you if you treat this function as a univariate function

206
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:22,600
with respect to X or Y is going to have this now decreasing right into the property.

207
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,430
Any question about this property's. Thank.

208
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:43,710
So this binary random arrivals can be very useful in practice as long as you know the two random variables,

209
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,640
they are originated from the same small space, arbitrary related items.

210
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:55,120
Then they can be paired and then we can focus on the joint distribution of the two.

211
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:06,190
All example if you want to study the the height and the weight of individuals, which again you can imagine the of weight tends to be correlated.

212
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,600
Although the formal definition of correlation. We're going to introduce the next question.

213
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:18,990
But from common sense, we know that, you know, higher height probably corresponds to higher weight, right.

214
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:26,500
So you can study this two together because one run of arable may lend some information on the

215
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:34,210
other end if it acts to be the height of an individual Y to be the weight of an individual.

216
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:44,910
Then you can study the pair as bivariate right of animals and in particular the PDA.

217
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:51,550
The city of all this by very random variable. Why y?

218
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:58,090
By definition it's the probability of x plus small x y.

219
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:05,560
Not sorry for the small one. Right. And that just means the probability of.

220
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:14,010
A height below or equal to Bismarck's and.

221
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:22,130
A weight below or equal to small white.

222
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:34,120
Okay. So if you collect a bunch of individuals to represent the population, you can evaluate given the acts given away.

223
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:40,520
Can you evaluate how many individuals in our population were to satisfy those conditions?

224
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:50,480
And if you divide that number by the total sample size that is collected, you get a rough, rough idea of this probability.

225
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:56,630
So that's going to be that CDO of a spy by random variable.

226
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:06,240
But now we have to of the city out for by the moral and national question is

227
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:12,660
how is it related to the univariate of animals the binary running variable.

228
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:23,250
If you take one at a time, it's still a random variable so conceptual that it should reduce to this univariate random variable in some scenarios.

229
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:29,700
All right. And that actually is what we call the marginal distributions speed.

230
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,080
You can reduce or obtain the univariate distribution.

231
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:42,330
You can turn the distribution for the univariate accounts, either one of these two from this chance distribution.

232
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:51,360
So this is how we do it. Okay. So if we set this our facts y to be the joint city of for this to run a variable,

233
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:57,420
we can derive the univariate distribution functions or acts a y by marginalizing them.

234
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:03,780
And the specific way to marginalize is from the definition.

235
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:11,840
Recall that for running our flags, all we need to know about everything is distribution in the CTA.

236
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:18,690
As far as we know, this affects our pants. We know everything about the distribution or about that run around, okay?

237
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,350
And by definition that just means the probability of X.

238
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,950
The probability of this random variable at last hypothesis models.

239
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:35,720
Right. That's the definition for a university and.

240
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:44,970
And now it's the connection between a university case and the primary case.

241
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:52,319
The events of the last article to a small ax is equivalent to this last article.

242
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,559
Smart and why less article two?

243
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:01,120
In part because as we argued before this, why?

244
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,240
Unless Article two is infinity or why last night infinity, which is equivalent in this case.

245
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:16,140
They just mean the whole sample space. So if you intersect any set with the whole sample space, then you still got the same set.

246
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:22,990
Okay, so that connection build of grace between the universe case and the binary case.

247
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:31,290
And by looking out this term, we know this is can be expressed using this hybrid see function.

248
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,000
All we need to do is so plucky infinity, positive infinity for Y.

249
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:47,310
And once we do that, we have this relation. So now I just give us the city out for us.

250
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:51,840
Marginally can be obtained from this by my recipient.

251
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,650
By just replacing Y with the infinite.

252
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:06,600
Okay. Similarly honored to go to the city for X or y, you just replace X by infinity.

253
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:12,510
And conceptually, that should be. That makes perfect sense.

254
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:21,660
If you want to get the marginal distribution for Y, marginal or Y, you just let acts close to the boundary, I suppose, of infinity.

255
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:29,310
So you don't have to worry about x, whatever distribution, whatever probability left is corresponding to Y.

256
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,740
So that is the relation between this binary city and the universe.

257
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:42,330
It helps. And we call this balance y y y as marginal distributions.

258
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,020
And we don't just call them univariate distributions.

259
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:55,320
Since we know that joint distribution, we call this two separate univariate distributions aren't all distributions that.

260
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:03,530
In contrast to conditional distributions, which is also a universe in which we're going to introduce later.

261
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,670
It's a marginal just means you only look at one at a time without considering the other.

262
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:25,990
So from this relationship we know that you can get the marginal distributions from the joint distribution networks words if I gave you that.

263
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,459
So on Syria, what accent, what you can use, I got the marginal house and the marginal hole.

264
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:40,820
What I need to do is to replace this small ax or small line in the joint sitting up by infinity.

265
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:45,350
Right. You can get the marginal city out. But what about the reverse?

266
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:54,650
If I gave you two marginal distributions, one for ask one, why can you gather joint distribution of the two?

267
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:13,880
What do you think? If I provide if I provide you the margin of distributions, would you be able to find the drawing distribution?

268
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:25,880
Not in general. Right. And in some conditions, you may be able to find you find it are independent.

269
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:31,490
You can find the distribution, which we're going to introduce in in the next lecture.

270
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:42,440
But in general, you can not. And the reason is that if you can find a joint from the marginals, always know what's the point of study.

271
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:49,030
Study this joint. Right. Always find this joint by just multiplying the marginals.

272
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:54,260
There is no point of specifically do you find a drawn distribution.

273
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:03,320
So in general, you can now do it. So you can do it one way from this top.

274
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:11,870
That's why you can get affects, why it's always got those marginals, but not the other way around.

275
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:17,270
In most cases, you will not be able to find that drawn from the marginal.

276
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:25,820
By other words, there are numerous possibilities of a market for the joint with the same margins,

277
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:35,960
and that's why we need to define this joint distribution in the first place, because it does provide more information.

278
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:41,750
This to run of animals compared to just a look at the individual right.

279
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:54,910
So similar with the univariate city of once we know the drawn area once we didn't know the drawn city of we know

280
00:35:54,910 --> 00:36:04,420
essentially everything about the distribution of this five everyone available for example based probability,

281
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,440
this probability of x greater than x and y,

282
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:16,540
greater than small y can be expressed using this join city up in terms of one

283
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:27,340
minus x and a marginal or minus y y the marginal y us of x y smart small.

284
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:31,360
Okay, so it does a y example.

285
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:37,510
You can also construct other examples. And the bottom line is, once you know that drawn city,

286
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:46,239
you know everything about the distribution and in particular our for base simulation is probably

287
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,450
easier to see it if you draw this two dimensional plane with this five over and above all,

288
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:58,930
you can easily draw it to the support, at least on this two dimensional plane.

289
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,080
If you want to draw the actual city app or PDF function, you have to refer to the third dimension,

290
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:11,230
which may be less obvious, but at least you can draw the support for this.

291
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:22,860
So the left hand side is. So if you have arts value here, this is a random variable.

292
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,430
So this is Run America Y and a Y over here.

293
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:37,620
So the left hand side essentially is corresponding to the probability of any point falling to this shaded area.

294
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:50,160
Right. And if you look to the right hand side, this half Axel Max, is the probability of what?

295
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:04,400
She? So these are facts of Earth's is the right area.

296
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:09,860
Right. And why? Why is.

297
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:22,350
And the yellow area. So you obviously got this flow area.

298
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:32,970
What we can do is to first have one, the probability for the whole sample space, the minus the red area, minus the yellow area.

299
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:42,300
And then you'll notice you actually double penalized with this part.

300
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:52,920
Right. So you add about this this brown area, which is essentially a city of that is five out of around an hour.

301
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:59,160
Right. And why? That where you can recover the area of blue.

302
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,510
So that's the idea behind the plume and the actual probe.

303
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:20,440
You can define. You can translate this event in the original small space by defining A to b x.

304
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:36,740
By defining a to be honest the last article to have small acts BWI and that's already to a small line.

305
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:46,400
Then the left hand side can be rewritten as the probability of what in terms of A and B, how do you translate the left hand side?

306
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:56,540
You're going to have two events that will define how X greater than X and Y.

307
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:15,550
Greater than Y is what? Acts greater than acts is a complement and a way greater than why is what b-complex and what is assigned between?

308
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:20,200
Should I use union or intersection intersection?

309
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:25,780
Right. Because it's at an amusing intersection or intersection means that.

310
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:30,220
So that's not a lap and sign in terms of this two events that we define.

311
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:39,160
So that's our left hand side. Then from there we can use the relation that we learned before for this side operation.

312
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:47,380
Okay. So that is equal to a union B complement.

313
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:54,310
Right. And that is a one minus A unit B.

314
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:13,290
Which is further divided into three sets a E, a intersect with B.

315
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:19,350
And so these are all using properties that we have learned before for that operation.

316
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:32,820
Okay. And once you write out this one, you will notice that this play is essentially artifacts of X, right?

317
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:40,010
Because the probability of access that's already but it's mine by definition that means the city out of bounds,

318
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,990
a marginal city above as evaluated at a smart.

319
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:58,920
And this p b is the marginal city of Y value that a small one and this P, a and B is the definition of the joint CDO for X and Y.

320
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:03,770
That's. Okay.

321
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:06,280
And that is your right hand side.

322
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:16,690
So the key to the proof is to properly define as to events and represent the original probability using this two events.

323
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:26,850
Okay. Any question. All right.

324
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:35,310
So if no question, I want you to try this one self and try to prove this relation.

325
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:54,450
The probability of X between x one and x2y between Y one and Y two is equal to this popular x, which is expressed using the transit of x and y.

326
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:05,070
And I would recommend first drawing the support of this to run of variables and say what they are actually trying to show and then go from there.

327
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:10,500
So the support plot will give you some idea of how to define our events.

328
00:43:10,800 --> 00:47:02,340
Okay. All right.

329
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:09,350
So let's look at this together. So first I draw this support plot, right?

330
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,349
So we have the two dimensional space and the x axis.

331
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:17,880
We have two markers or two cars, x11, it's two.

332
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,660
Similarly, on the y axis we have yyy2.

333
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:29,940
So if you draw the horizontal and vertical lines, it will break down this two dimensional space into several blocks.

334
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:40,560
And in particular says, we care about the CTA. Recall that City R is defined as acts class or an equal to something Y less are equal to something.

335
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:49,620
So it's always to the left and to the lower to the left and to the lower part of the hydroplane of this plane.

336
00:47:50,970 --> 00:48:00,960
So we can just focus on this or blocks defined on the slide where A is essentially, what do we care about in the left hand side?

337
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:07,770
Okay. And this B is this part C and D corresponding to fine.

338
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:14,350
So what we can say immediately is that this P of a lot.

339
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:28,660
And so so we can. We can say the left hand side is essentially the probability of a by definition.

340
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:29,830
All right.

341
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:43,900
And what we can see from the figure is that if you take the union of A, B, C and D, that's going to be a C to evaluate two values, x two and Y two.

342
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:51,700
Right? Because this is every ten to the lack of access to everything to the two below yy2.

343
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,790
So that is easy to evaluate. That can be expressed using this.

344
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:01,750
The first item on the right hand side.

345
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:06,460
Right. So the right hand. The first item on the right hand side.

346
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:10,540
We can write it out way. Simply the first item.

347
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:23,020
This affects y value as two and ay2 is essentially a union B, union C, union D and what about the second one?

348
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:28,150
What is the have x y value of x1x2x1 or y one?

349
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:42,820
Using the events that are defined here. What is that? What is the second term?

350
00:49:48,190 --> 00:50:01,720
Which won a seat. Right. Because see, there is this area that is the probability of at plus one last article 2x1 at a y last article 2y1.

351
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:09,370
So that basically. If the cartel attacks one on the way to war is that.

352
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:16,340
That's going to be this area. Right. But that's for the third term.

353
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:22,690
So that's going to be what, C, union D and last term.

354
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:30,800
Similarly, you can say that is. Be seated.

355
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:41,390
All right. So now we have Rick's press on the left hand side, on the right hand side, using this probability of this different sets.

356
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:58,070
Now, what's left is to confirm that this a is a really can be expressed using this probability and that we can leverage the the SAT

357
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:06,980
operation that we have learned before and not assume that ABC and D they are mutually exclusive and should be able to prove that.

358
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:10,910
Okay. I'll leave that as an exercise. Right.

359
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:14,900
Any question? Okay.

360
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:47,870
So let's take a break and come back at two. If you haven't picked up, you are examined and come up and ignoring, which is the next thing you know.

361
00:51:47,920 --> 00:52:08,510
I've got to go, oh, so four or five or ten or 15.

362
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:24,800
So right around nine months I have never seen this guy, so it is harder to work with it.

363
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:34,680
With respect, I was going to argue that during the day,

364
00:52:35,180 --> 00:53:03,610
only with that I would like to do this because I saw this author deciding that this is the man who worked on a lot of these,

365
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:19,820
all those people who got hurt comprised of soldiers.

366
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:24,260
It's actually in a three dimensional space.

367
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:37,790
All its start to think what we've been talking about.

368
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:59,450
I mean, it's just one particular region as opposed to another dimension of the whole time.

369
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:17,570
Let's point is approximately 2400 meters.

370
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:36,829
Yeah. All right. I believe everything to do with this later on that our politics are just building something.

371
00:54:36,830 --> 00:55:15,960
You never really talked that such as if I did not want to do it because you have something like that.

372
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:20,500
Yeah, I don't want to.

373
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:25,850
But instead of saying, oh, well, let me.

374
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:49,020
You need to know that it's not hard for you to say.

375
00:55:51,160 --> 00:56:04,460
How do you interpret the to resort to abortion?

376
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:19,530
I'm sorry. Oh, that's cool.

377
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:30,250
Yeah, I think that's okay.

378
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:43,740
All right. How about you?

379
00:56:48,150 --> 00:57:17,750
Why don't you just go out, eat and see what is going on?

380
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:25,300
Because you're not really taking the time.

381
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:43,990
The other side you have to see.

382
00:57:44,160 --> 00:58:16,140
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

383
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:25,910
All right. Thank you.

384
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:57,560
The whole thing. I mean, this was a long time ago.

385
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:34,930
It was just like I just thought, oh, oh, it's criminal.

386
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:40,010
It's okay. It wouldn't matter.

387
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:57,890
Which has been kind of hard to talk about this.

388
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:09,080
I think she's right.

389
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:16,280
Do you think she had any moral questions before we continue?

390
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:25,459
All right. So for five our that's we're going to talk about this great and continuous case so you

391
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:32,630
never run of horribles this relatively straightforward because it's only have one.

392
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:35,810
Now we are talking about two.

393
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:45,440
So you can imagine there are cases where one is this great, the other is continuous, which makes this much more complicated.

394
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:48,410
So to simplify things here,

395
01:00:48,410 --> 01:01:01,580
we define two types out by the amount of what is called drawn by discrete meaning both X and Y are described and that is jointly described.

396
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,259
It is drawn like this. Great.

397
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:14,860
Then we can define the joint partner of five over a parable that's a direct extension of the PMF or unit of our run around.

398
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:18,380
And so both are discrete.

399
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:23,930
Then we can define the following function as the drawn part.

400
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:33,230
That is the smell of X. What is the probability of the agreement of our of all taking value acts and a Y

401
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:38,930
random are about taken by our y says both are described we know they're both carnival

402
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:48,079
many data points while this man of our about taking now zero probabilities so we can

403
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:53,720
enumerate all possible combinations at most there are some carnival combinations.

404
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:07,110
So we call those theta pairs X marks and it was the support for this binary random variable,

405
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:15,090
namely all of the x, y is all that's y's where PMA is greater than zero sum of all of those pairs.

406
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:29,299
Then we got a probability of one. And it also follows directly from the definition that if we just treat this PMF as a function of

407
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:38,760
acts now we can sum up all the acts values are capable of y and that give us the marginal or ones,

408
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:51,800
right? So which is expressed here we can get the marginal PMA or X by summing up all possible y such that affects Y is greater than zero.

409
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:09,790
So this act is fixed, this one fixed, and you just stand up all y such that the x y is greater than as the PMF greater than zero.

410
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:14,020
Now you've got the marginal PMA for this.

411
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:17,920
That's one of our added value acts.

412
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:25,360
And similarly, if you've got to if you want to got the marginal PMF or Y at this fixed value Y,

413
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:34,330
it is a fixed y sum of all of the acts such that the PM of the drawn PM of is greater than zero.

414
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:41,140
So recall the first example that we send in the lecture.

415
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:46,240
So it's the same coin three times.

416
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:54,730
So in that case, it's actually got a marginal distribution for X and Y from this joint distribution.

417
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:03,160
And here is the outcome for that.

418
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:12,880
So from the table before we can get the marginal distribution, so here is the break out breakdown for this all possible scenarios.

419
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:18,870
So the X random variable is the number of times in the in the last task.

420
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:23,280
So it's binary zero one and y the total number.

421
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:27,610
So it takes about a01, two, three. Those are discrete.

422
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:34,630
And here this table summarized the probability or the pmr of the drawn distribution.

423
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:39,820
All right, so you have one eighth of a probability of X equals zero.

424
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:47,010
Y equals zero one fourth of a probability 4.0 y, y, and so on, so forth.

425
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:58,930
So we have this two by four table, and from this table you can actually get the marginal distributions or marginal PMA or X.

426
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:05,520
All we need is these two quantities, right?

427
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:09,760
So these two quantities define the marginal PMF for us.

428
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:19,130
So what is the probability of actually a zero? Because this is the definition.

429
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:26,730
Right. If you want to go to the PM of our house, you're just a fake sex and some of all possible ys.

430
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:35,050
In this case. What is the PMA of Acts at zero?

431
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:43,230
This. It's just some of the top rules are good because some of these numbers are right,

432
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:54,030
because these three numbers corresponds to the Y value where absent a Y are in the support of the binary random variable.

433
01:05:54,810 --> 01:06:00,510
So that going to be one over eight plus one over four plus one over eight, which is one.

434
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:09,390
Similarly, you can calculate the PMF or actually 4 to 1 by summing up the second one, which also give you a one over two.

435
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:21,690
You can also go to the prime of or Y by summing up the columns where Y on a zero is some of this two.

436
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:36,000
Right, which is one over a Y or one is one over four plus one over eight three or eight line for 2 to 3 over eight.

437
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:44,370
And the final I y for the three one over eight that gave you the PMA marginal PMA for y.

438
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:50,530
Okay. Now, you can verify that there's marginal distribution, perhaps,

439
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:59,710
and a marginal distribution for Y is essentially the correct one because we know what the distribution is for AX on a Y separately.

440
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:10,610
AX is the proverb ax representing whether it's a hat or not, for a single toss.

441
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:19,670
All right. And we know that's a fair coin. So of course, it's going to have success rate of one hot or had probably one half.

442
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:29,360
So this marginal derivation is the same as what have we got from the previous chapters,

443
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:36,430
from the knowledge from the previous chapters, X and Y is the number of paths in three houses.

444
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:42,290
If you just look at that problem, that's a of problem, right?

445
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:54,320
And you can calculate the probability of this random variable taking this different about zero one, two and three three policies.

446
01:07:55,790 --> 01:08:02,090
You can consider how many times you would have got zero and how many times you got one.

447
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:08,510
How many times do you have? And so on. So that's a counting process.

448
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:18,810
All right. We passed the call, and three times you got two to the power of three calls.

449
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:28,480
Along comes cycling without a replacement order or something without reply or something with replacement.

450
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:33,640
Okay. And to calculate the probability of life or one.

451
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:45,160
No, just it's just need to count how many cases actually gave you that potential outcome.

452
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:53,230
And if you define you only have one hat out of three causes, then you have three choice one.

453
01:08:54,130 --> 01:09:02,470
So three possible cases, which was to give you the number of cases was two, has a 3 to 3,

454
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:10,540
give you the number of cases with three hands and you can check it will give you exactly the same distribution.

455
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:18,070
But that is just to verify that by marginalizing the joint distribution from Bivariate Rhinovirus,

456
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:24,450
you got exactly the same marginal distributions you would not from a university study, but.

457
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:36,140
Any question. So in this case, we got the you know,

458
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:47,630
we got the marginals from the joint head and we can provide a car example to show that the marginals does not necessarily define the draw.

459
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:51,650
For example, you may consider another pair of random variable.

460
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:56,930
I say x prime and y prime which follow these drawing distribution.

461
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:15,560
Okay, so y prime also takes value zero one, two and three and prime is value zero one but with different distribution going 0814812.

462
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:27,200
Assume that if we have another pair as prime, like prime, which have this joint distribution.

463
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:33,080
First of all, is a valid distribution, right? Add up all this numbers.

464
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:36,830
It would not add up to one. All right.

465
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:45,620
So it's a valid distribution. And I'm not saying that it is X prime and Y prime and they still represent the same thing as before.

466
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:51,740
They totally represent different things because if they represent the same thing, they would have the same distribution.

467
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:58,010
I'm just arbitrarily creating a new pair of random barrels on this distribution.

468
01:10:58,370 --> 01:11:04,320
Right. So far, then we can verify this is a valid joint distribution.

469
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:15,480
And next you can verify the marginals for acts in the same at the margin of the margin for hacks prime, the same at the marginal tax break.

470
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:21,180
And the marginal if a Y prime is also the same as the margin of a Y.

471
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:28,320
Which is same.

472
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:37,870
That's right. So the city of or why is the same as the city?

473
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:41,850
Why prime city? Our is the same as the city.

474
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:50,940
I am surprised. But from this two tables it's easy to say that this CDF or X and Y.

475
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:58,020
This is not the same as the CDF or ex-Prime Minister Y Prime.

476
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:06,190
So this is an example showing you that the marginal distributions does not define the joint distribution.

477
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:12,490
You can have a totally different drawing distribution. Even if they have, they share the same marginals.

478
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:18,980
All right. So that goes back to the original argument.

479
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:22,760
The joint distribution defines the marginals. But now the auto.

480
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:37,559
Questions. All right.

481
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:43,110
So that's for the John described. We can similarly define joint continuous distributions.

482
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:50,790
Recall that a univariate case, when we talk about continuous, we have another function that is PDA.

483
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:56,580
Right? Similar here are we can define a joint PDA probability density function.

484
01:12:57,350 --> 01:13:02,670
So both running variable X and Y are joint joint continuous.

485
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:08,219
If there exists a function of x, y, x,

486
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:22,500
y such that an able set of to post in our square such that the following relation host then this is called a joint PDA.

487
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:36,060
So that is to say, the probability of this pair of run of our roles going to be set is the same at this our integration and

488
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:43,500
the integration area is this piece set and the function that you are integrating in this primary function.

489
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:50,310
I accept y to be always holds. Now we call this small affix y is the density.

490
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:59,450
That's the restriction joint density function by a. For the city of the Twin City,

491
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:06,530
I can be defined as the subway integration of this aspect of why our city where

492
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:13,410
as is the argument for acts that goes from nothing affinity arts and beauty.

493
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:20,580
The argument for why that goes from nothing affinity to a small life.

494
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:32,390
So the notation you need to be a little bit careful here is that double integration, meaning you need to integrate it twice.

495
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:39,000
One for each argument. And so this double integration is not familiar to you.

496
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:49,020
Make sure that you read some additional materials tutorials to get familiarized with this multivariate calculus.

497
01:14:52,720 --> 01:15:02,350
And reverse. Like you can guard this player by taking this partial derivative of the CDO function with respect to acts under way.

498
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:14,350
So this is a binary PDF or this to run a variable sax online compared to the discrete case.

499
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:22,930
The only difference is that we changed this some to the integration and that's the the main difference.

500
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:28,210
Okay. Some properties for this binary PDA function.

501
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:33,400
First of all, it's always non-active, which is the same as what we have seen before.

502
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:39,460
And second, integrated. What if you integrated from not to infinity to infinity or both?

503
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:48,460
And one thing to notice that that the PDA as the univariate case is not a probability function.

504
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:54,340
Right. It's not probability. The actual value does not mean probability.

505
01:15:54,940 --> 01:16:02,200
I can be thought of a relative probability of x and y falling into a small rectangle area.

506
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:07,300
So previously for Univariate Case we say the PDA function.

507
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:14,230
You can consider the value as a relevant probability if you take small intervals of the x,

508
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:24,040
this is an x, then at times the x is the probability of an x belonging to that small interval.

509
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:30,660
Okay. This is how we interpret the value of this function in a unit.

510
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:34,090
Our case here. A binary case is essentially the same.

511
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:44,620
If you take small intervals the x y, then the probability of accidental y falling to those two by two rectangle area.

512
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:56,140
It is approximated by this period from adding an accent of white times three times the white right.

513
01:16:57,130 --> 01:17:01,690
So that's what that cultural value means for this function.

514
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:16,469
It's not probability, but. Some relations again we of tend to marginal from the from the joint and we can't pretend

515
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:24,380
the marginal PDF from the joint pdf by taking a integration with respect to one parameter.

516
01:17:25,690 --> 01:17:31,730
Okay. If you integrate this binary function with respect to why integrate out wide,

517
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:39,410
then you got a function of x and that function is the marginal city, a marginal PDF for access.

518
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:47,600
Alternatively, if you integrate out angst, then you get a function of life and that is the function.

519
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:53,690
That is the city. That is a PDA function. Marginal PDF front of our about y.

520
01:17:54,800 --> 01:18:00,160
So that's the relation between the marginal TR and the drawn period.

521
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:05,980
Again, you can build a connection with this great case, write this great case.

522
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:13,070
Essentially what we do is we take the summation and we sum up all about viva y values.

523
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:19,890
You got marginal PMI for us and we send all the X values online here.

524
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:26,420
We just change the summation to integration and any question so far,

525
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:36,020
all this relations and you can actually prove this radiation from the radiation of marginal city of transit.

526
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:45,020
You recall that a strong city of you can get marginal city out by taking one as infinite right.

527
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:50,120
And you can take a derivative to go from Syria to PDL.

528
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:56,460
So you can build a connection, you can show this relation, you have a savings.

529
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:04,160
So now let's take a look at a couple of examples and say how this joint distribution actually work in practice.

530
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:08,560
So first example, assume that we have the joint city.

531
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:17,360
Our function are to run a variable as wide being as times Y on this interval and zero everywhere else.

532
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:23,450
First we notice that if you have.

533
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:33,120
And if you can imagine what a function looked like in this two dimensional space or in the three dimensional space,

534
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:36,400
it is essentially a continuous function, right?

535
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:52,470
This function is continuous with respect to both X and Y or jointly, and is only restricted to this square area from 0 to 1 or at 0 to 1.1.

536
01:19:54,570 --> 01:20:03,990
And they can also verify that if you plug in X or Y equals zero zero, if you're plugging away for a Y, you're going to one, right?

537
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:11,600
So the function kind of looked like I tried.

538
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:30,670
So the function. You.

539
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:42,700
Is only restricted to this area, which is not only restricted to this area.

540
01:20:43,310 --> 01:20:50,250
So this is what the function is and the function is going to be zero on.

541
01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:59,880
This is going to be zero or.

542
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:15,260
This area. Okay. And down zero on this right on the square area and beyond.

543
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:27,410
And so it takes a several careers at once. And why taking my readers zero is always going to be zero.

544
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:38,670
And if so, in the first, essentially in the first order, and this function is going to be non-zero.

545
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:42,000
So I start from zero and then gradually build up.

546
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:49,980
So you have to use some imagination to imagine what the function look like in the first quadrant in this two dimensional space.

547
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,880
So the function is on the third dimension event, on the third dimension.

548
01:21:54,370 --> 01:22:01,540
Okay, so it's going to be zero. If X is less than zero or why is that?

549
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:05,520
Everyone here is always going to be zero.

550
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:09,630
But is not it going to be zero for the first quadrant?

551
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:15,750
And it's always at one beyond this area.

552
01:22:17,310 --> 01:22:20,690
These is always going to be one. This is always going to be zero.

553
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:24,570
And here it's always going to be between zero and one.

554
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:30,570
And imagine what the function of the C function looks like.

555
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:34,920
Three dimensional space. Okay, so that's the CTA function.

556
01:22:35,230 --> 01:22:45,690
And so one thing that we can verify is that this function is indeed a CTA, is satisfy all of the previous properties for this joint CTA function.

557
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:50,730
Okay. And from the drawn CTA, as we said, this is continuous.

558
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:58,380
We can derive the joint PDF because this is that joint continuous case.

559
01:22:58,830 --> 01:23:02,400
We can grab the joint PDA by taking the double derivative.

560
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:06,480
How about the first part of the derivative?

561
01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:13,860
Differentiate the CDR function with the respective parts and then differentiate with respect to what?

562
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:22,170
So what we got is if you first differentiate it with respect to answer, you got to y okay?

563
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:26,310
And then if you further differentiate it with y, you got one.

564
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:36,010
So that is what the PDF looks like on this. And the PDR is going to be zero.

565
01:23:36,030 --> 01:23:40,380
Everywhere else, beyond this square. All right.

566
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:53,130
So from this joint PDA, what about the marginal PDA?

567
01:23:53,410 --> 01:24:04,440
What is the marginal callbacks? One way to do it.

568
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:07,920
You can refer to this formula. Right.

569
01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:11,460
You have the joint out. One way to do it.

570
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:15,030
You can integrate out the other argument to get the result.

571
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:25,500
If you do that, it can be integrated. They're not claiming ability to infinity, x, y, y.

572
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:36,540
All right. And we know this affects Y is equal to one in this interval Y between zero on one and zero everywhere else.

573
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:41,580
So it's equal to zero two, one, one be y.

574
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:46,740
And that is what. Right.

575
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:51,440
So that is the PDA, marginal PDA or.

576
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,810
Right. Similarly, you can do the integration.

577
01:24:55,170 --> 01:25:04,790
You can integrate out X in this joint PDA to get the marginals for Y, which is also a constant one zero to Y intervals.

578
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:12,270
Why is that distribution? If you are PDA busy is a constant one on this interval.

579
01:25:12,270 --> 01:25:16,950
0 to 1. What is that distribution? Yes, the uniform.

580
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:20,400
Uniform distribution. Right. That's what we have seen before.

581
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:26,210
So that's one way to do it. Alternatively, you can also proceed from this Cydia function.

582
01:25:27,170 --> 01:25:33,390
Recall that you can grab the marginal CTA from the drawing CTA by sending one to the infinity.

583
01:25:35,370 --> 01:25:39,570
Right. So in this case, you don't have to set it to be infinity.

584
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:45,180
You just need to set it to be one, because that's the upper bound for this function.

585
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:52,500
In fact, if you send it to the infinity, it should also equal to the value up study to be one.

586
01:25:53,070 --> 01:26:04,680
So of course it's just equal to x, y of x and y.

587
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:12,360
Right. So here we plug in one set of infinity.

588
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:20,820
And the reason is base function is only defining this formula for this square interval.

589
01:26:21,870 --> 01:26:27,930
If you are extended beyond this interval, then it has a slightly different definition.

590
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:32,580
You can consider what that particular function or form is.

591
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:40,710
But the simplest way to do it is you replace Y by one that will give you the marginal CDF.

592
01:26:41,250 --> 01:26:46,260
All right. Okay. So if you plug in Y in this formula, that's going to be X.

593
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:56,570
So that's the marginal cost of X. Then you can go to the marginal PDA by taking that derivative F,

594
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:03,990
which is again equal to one, and this is greater than zero and those are equal to one.

595
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:10,020
And these are just the two ways to get the marginal distribution.

596
01:27:10,170 --> 01:27:14,880
I now go from the PDF directly by integrating out the other argument.

597
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:23,280
Or you can go from the CTA. They first got that marginal setting up and then differentiated.

598
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:32,230
Any question. Yes.

599
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:36,130
You got the joint period. I see.

600
01:27:36,730 --> 01:27:40,000
Um. Why over your blind?

601
01:27:40,090 --> 01:27:44,560
But how come we don't do that? Yeah.

602
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:49,240
So in the second line. Uh. Finding the joint.

603
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:54,020
Yeah. Yes. Um, so we're taking the derivative.

604
01:27:55,450 --> 01:28:01,420
Yeah, but it's back to X and Y, but we still do it with respect to Y.

605
01:28:02,290 --> 01:28:06,830
So you mean here? Yeah.

606
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:14,500
In a partial derivative. So if you plug in a partial derivative, this is a function of X times Y.

607
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:17,980
Right. So you can first take the properties of everything with respect.

608
01:28:18,010 --> 01:28:24,870
And then this is just the this part is just a you want a Y, right?

609
01:28:25,270 --> 01:28:29,230
And then you can take the partial derivative with respect to Y. So that's going to be one.

610
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:31,770
Alternatively, you can switch the order first,

611
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:41,020
taking the part of the relative with respect to Y not going to give you access and then taking the partial directive with respect to X,

612
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:45,940
and that's also give you one as it takes on the questions.

613
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:53,450
All right. So now is your exercise. Okay.

614
01:28:53,470 --> 01:29:04,050
So this one. Why don't you try out this one and see whether you can fill in the blanks?

615
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:15,900
Okay, so the joint Syria is defined as one and it's defined on this region and it's not a regular region.

616
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:22,050
It is is a region, but it's not a squared or rectangle or a region.

617
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:32,340
Okay. And the PDF, the CDO function has this functional form on this region, and I extend beyond that in a reasonable way.

618
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:42,900
What I mean by that is, is of one flat on a one and a B non decreasing are both X and Y.

619
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:47,490
Okay. So the question is what is a drawing a PDF?

620
01:29:47,610 --> 01:29:53,340
What is a marginal payoffs? So take a couple of minutes.

621
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:57,920
Try to use what we've learned to do.

622
01:29:58,050 --> 01:30:14,140
See whether you can derive this. The.

623
01:31:20,930 --> 01:36:24,950
It's. People.

624
01:36:36,030 --> 01:36:41,220
She? It's.

625
01:36:57,180 --> 01:38:06,690
It's. They got it.

626
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:15,620
All right. So let's look at this together and see how we tackle this problem.

627
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:27,020
So first we need to draw the support of this round of arrivals from Iran about what we know is provided here.

628
01:38:27,050 --> 01:38:37,770
So it's in this rectangular area where an axis from 0 to 1 and why from 0 to 1.

629
01:38:37,790 --> 01:38:43,760
And X is also last are equal to one. So it's this upper triangle area.

630
01:38:45,630 --> 01:38:58,210
And here. So the functional form is defined on this rectangular area, and then we can go that joint period by taking the derivative,

631
01:38:58,540 --> 01:39:03,670
the partial derivative with respect to x and Y respectively.

632
01:39:04,210 --> 01:39:08,290
X is either do it or x first, aka y first.

633
01:39:09,070 --> 01:39:16,180
So it should give you exactly the same result. More specifically, if we do it with respect to x first.

634
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:27,300
Then we can have. These taking the derivative up base with the respective acts.

635
01:39:28,530 --> 01:39:41,310
Essentially, you just treat acts as your argument and a Y is a constant and I'm taking the derivative now give us one minus LA X over y minus one.

636
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:49,860
So if you actually calculate the derivative, that's the function, and then you take the part of derivative out.

637
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:53,670
This guy was a risk factor. Why not give you the final result,

638
01:39:54,060 --> 01:40:05,370
which is one over one and that's that joint pdf on this file I ran afoul of that's now defined on the on everywhere.

639
01:40:05,370 --> 01:40:10,200
So you have to carry over this support.

640
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:21,420
Okay. So this is a support for this fiber only on this support and as this pdf function one over one unit support and a zero support,

641
01:40:21,810 --> 01:40:26,880
it has zero equal to zero. The drawn area is equal to zero.

642
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:36,090
And so that's the first part. And then from there we can calculate this marginal and the marginal PDF.

643
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:47,280
If we do the integration here, you have to be a little bit careful about the the limit or the boundary of this limitation,

644
01:40:47,310 --> 01:40:57,060
the upper bound and the lower bound. So here we want to integrate out why you already got the marginal price.

645
01:41:00,330 --> 01:41:05,430
And to do the integration, this has to be from that same infinity to infinity.

646
01:41:05,850 --> 01:41:10,650
But do recall that basic function, functional form only applies for this region.

647
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:15,320
So when you do the integration, you have to integrate this.

648
01:41:15,330 --> 01:41:19,140
Why goes from lower bound is going to be x, right?

649
01:41:19,170 --> 01:41:22,350
Why is always greater than up to one?

650
01:41:23,310 --> 01:41:28,620
So that is to say you want to grab a PDF of x or any given x.

651
01:41:29,370 --> 01:41:33,240
I say this is you are activating. They want to evaluate.

652
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:39,930
So this slide is what you are integrating over.

653
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:48,630
Okay. Sorry. Integrating from this point, which is like automatic zero up to this point.

654
01:41:48,690 --> 01:41:55,560
Which is why. Part of what? Because that's the support for this PDA function.

655
01:41:55,920 --> 01:42:06,030
Okay. So you integrated from X to one. Now, if you want one over, want be y, which is more y.

656
01:42:10,490 --> 01:42:20,480
This. So that's the marginal payoff for us.

657
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:32,800
And what is the support of tax? From 0 to 1.

658
01:42:34,270 --> 01:42:38,860
You can also observed that from this figure the possible value that I can take

659
01:42:39,370 --> 01:42:44,200
is in this triangle and if can only focus on the x values is from 0 to 1.

660
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:51,050
So that is a support by X and that gave you the marginal distribution flags.

661
01:42:52,360 --> 01:43:00,420
And similarly for Y on if you got a marginal P, a Y, you do the integration with respect to acts, integrate our X, right?

662
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:08,170
And here are. The key is to notice that for each variable of.

663
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:17,260
The integration element is going to be from zero to x. That I gave you one over.

664
01:43:17,270 --> 01:43:20,700
Why don't you? Why?

665
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:28,600
So for each. Why value is going to be from 0 to 1.

666
01:43:42,220 --> 01:43:45,640
So that's what you have. That's a constant one.

667
01:43:46,330 --> 01:43:50,530
And the support provides from 0 to 1.

668
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:59,380
And from there we know the marginal distribution of for Y is essentially a uniform attribution.

669
01:44:00,130 --> 01:44:09,310
Okay. So we wouldn't say like the balance are from X to one instead of like zero.

670
01:44:10,450 --> 01:44:14,079
I mean, this one. Well, I mean, like when we.

671
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:18,790
When we states the support of X and Y at the end.

672
01:44:19,030 --> 01:44:28,300
Mm hmm. Like my initial thought was to say, like, for y say that that goes from X to one instead of from 0 to 1.

673
01:44:28,390 --> 01:44:37,000
Very good question. So Y doesn't support or does not involve y and a Y and the support for Y does not involve X.

674
01:44:37,030 --> 01:44:40,780
Right. So that's actually a very good point.

675
01:44:41,350 --> 01:44:49,090
So if you look at think about the function that we are deriving in some marginal PDF for.

676
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:56,050
When we talk about the marginal distribution, run a variable. It has absolutely nothing to do with the the retroviral.

677
01:44:57,020 --> 01:45:03,670
Right. The marginal just means the marginal. It just means of that particular unit of amount available in just a look at it.

678
01:45:04,570 --> 01:45:06,040
What is the distribution for that?

679
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:15,250
So that's why we need to integrate all the other retroviral and we are deciding the support of that around available.

680
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:20,770
It also has nothing to do with the other random variable. Otherwise it's not a marginal.

681
01:45:22,090 --> 01:45:28,660
And you look at this figure, actually the scenario is how X and Y and take values.

682
01:45:29,380 --> 01:45:35,710
And if all marginal X, all we need to look at is which values on these axes.

683
01:45:36,430 --> 01:45:38,650
If you put everything onto the x axis,

684
01:45:39,790 --> 01:45:49,420
what it would support B and in which interval the x would have non-zero probability, I would have non-zero here.

685
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:54,600
Yes. All right. That's nothing to do with.

686
01:45:54,610 --> 01:46:03,250
What about y that if you also consider y, that's going to go back to the joint distribution.

687
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:13,090
Similarly, if you want to find the support of what you project everything on to the Y axis and figure out what the project what is the support.

688
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:24,070
The both case is going to be from 0 to 1. And so conceptually, that's how you can argue the support for this marginal distribution.

689
01:46:24,790 --> 01:46:30,370
And another way to verify that this is true is that it's actually doing the integration right.

690
01:46:32,180 --> 01:46:38,800
So you have this marginal GDPs, so you can do the integration only interval to verify whether that's Econ one.

691
01:46:39,940 --> 01:46:45,220
Because if it's a volunteer PDA, it should integrate what on the support?

692
01:46:47,170 --> 01:46:54,510
And you can double check that if you do an integration only scenario, it actually is equally similarly applied.

693
01:46:57,280 --> 01:47:00,310
So of course, if you integrate out 0 to 1, you also got a one.

694
01:47:01,270 --> 01:47:08,050
So that confirms that these two functions actually properly define this as 0 to 1 intervals.

695
01:47:13,730 --> 01:47:21,620
So another way to do it is you can also verify it from the city perspective.

696
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:29,960
Recall that you can grab the PDF directly from the joint PDF format and got it from the CTO or vice versa.

697
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:34,700
Once you have this marginal PDF, you can get the marginal cost.

698
01:47:37,970 --> 01:47:45,980
In particular, the marginal CTA for access is the integration from zero to acts of access?

699
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:54,200
Yes. Right. The zero to access log not to with log as the.

700
01:47:54,260 --> 01:48:05,330
Yes. So if you do the integration, that's going to be as minus as times has zero to X.

701
01:48:05,770 --> 01:48:11,860
So that's going to be hard times. Log backs.

702
01:48:12,430 --> 01:48:18,580
So that's a marginal CTA or AX.

703
01:48:20,980 --> 01:48:35,870
You can also get the marginal capital Y. Which is just a small way to why we're zero.

704
01:48:35,890 --> 01:48:42,230
That's how we could have what Adam wants. Once you have this marginal CD out for X and Y,

705
01:48:42,580 --> 01:48:51,520
you can further verify whether this marginal city or has essentially the joint city up with Y being equal to infinity.

706
01:48:53,530 --> 01:49:01,749
That's a way to double check. Your answer is correct. And so in this case, you do not just think, oh, it's a good, you know,

707
01:49:01,750 --> 01:49:09,550
just the point you've been adding in it, but rather you put a Y in it and why you would.

708
01:49:12,990 --> 01:49:19,520
One. In the joint CD function.

709
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:23,910
Essentially you got.

710
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:46,440
The marginal CDO or acts as acts and if you put it, can also marginalize that trying to see the R function to get the marginal seat away Y right.

711
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:52,590
And to do that you need to put on what the opera about.

712
01:49:53,130 --> 01:49:57,560
Don't see quite a Y. All right. So that should be. Why?

713
01:49:58,100 --> 01:49:58,620
Why?
