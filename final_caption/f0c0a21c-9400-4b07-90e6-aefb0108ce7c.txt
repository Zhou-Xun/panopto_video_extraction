1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:07,900
Well, I was actually going to try to try to understand that because like I was like doing like just kind

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,930
of create like I put three tea bags to shoot them for drinks was kind of like water is no longer.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,770
So there's another tea bag in here, but it exploded. So you put them in the whole.

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:26,980
But it's still like, you know, just just like it's just like it's just like.

5
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:35,670
Well, it's funny, as I say, that you wanted to avoid contact.

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,760
Let's go ahead and get started with been talking about mathematical modeling

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,200
this week that we talked about and talked about a little bit last weekend,

8
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,640
decision trees last time and today we'll talk more about models.

9
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,120
And so we'll talk about your general and really walk through some examples.

10
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,100
The way I like to think about it is you might start out with the decision tree and,

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,869
you know, maybe we have some sort of branches in our decision tree.

12
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:17,040
In this very simple example, we may have a branch, people are dead or alive and that might say, okay,

13
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:24,600
2020 are they get our light in 2021 or they dead or alive too or they do a lot of 23 or they get a lot.

14
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,050
And we see this kind of repetitive process in your tree can grow to be really big.

15
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:40,140
Similarly, you might have something here where maybe you're about to sort of cancer tree and someone and they start off and stage one,

16
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,170
they might progress or they might remain in their stage one.

17
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,990
So it may be a temporary one.

18
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:55,739
They stay in stage one or they progressed to stage two very to if they want it progresses stage one or sorry they stay in stable works

19
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:02,880
want to progress to stage two so you can think of these as time implements here and people are progressing to stage one or stage two.

20
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,740
And this is a simple example where people could just progressed, but you could think of it as more complicated.

21
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,299
And you can imagine here, here I kind of simplify minute the nodes kind of go back to each other.

22
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:18,810
But typically in surgery they don't go back to each other and your tree just expands exponentially and gets bigger and bigger and bigger with many,

23
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:25,110
many more branches up. So anything you can do with the Markoff model, you can do with the decision tree.

24
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,139
It's just that the decision tree can get really big and unwieldy and a more pop model can be a useful

25
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:37,950
tool to simulate outcomes over time and simulate outcomes that are kind of repetitive over time.

26
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:51,030
And so typically think about dividing those health states up into different, mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive health state.

27
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,190
So in this example here, maybe the health states might be stage one, stage two, stage three and stage four.

28
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,770
And of having a tree that branches off and have a branch for each time period.

29
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:08,400
We might think of the health states here as the bubbles and then the arrows being the transitions between the health states.

30
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,180
And we don't have to write this that I want to tie to three and five.

31
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,970
We just say these are the health states and each time period you can progress one of the arrows.

32
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:26,640
And so that's what the market models are, is if we think that those transition rates don't change over time,

33
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,170
they kind of stay the same over time, and we can represent it like this.

34
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:38,730
And we'll walk through some examples, say how you can relatively easily simulate the longer term outcomes, the lifetime outcomes.

35
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,240
With something like that, we pause for a second to see if anyone has any questions.

36
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:55,220
Begin on this diagram is circles represent the circle represent the health state.

37
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,680
The state arrows represent the transitions between the health signature.

38
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:10,010
And actually kind of similar to a decision tree, a mark on bottle and I think a nice communication tool as well.

39
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:16,790
When you're talking to other people, you're saying, okay, these are the important health states that I think we have.

40
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,559
These are the important transitions that I think we have in this very simple example.

41
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,440
We can say, aha, we have we assert that you cannot move from this health state to this health state

42
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,160
because there's no arrow there or we can't go from this health state back to this one.

43
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:39,079
There's no arrow going back to your point of saying something about the state of the world and your beliefs about

44
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:46,340
what can happen and what can happen when you draw more science to these new bubbles or the important health states.

45
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,910
These arrows are the ways in which you can move between the health sector.

46
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,490
Yeah, but it's clear, right? So there could just be a different model where it's not the case, right?

47
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,940
Where there could go. Exactly. Yeah. And so let's see.

48
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:04,219
This works out.

49
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,560
So you could say I have a different model where you can actually move in here and there's another health state here.

50
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:17,150
Yeah. So different models might have different levels of complexity. And that's actually one of the that parts of the art there.

51
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:22,610
So part of the challenge of conducting these analyzes is deciding how do you want to structure your analysis?

52
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,420
What do we want to include? What aren't you going to include in your analysis?

53
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:36,890
So, for example, here, you know, you could say I think about some sort of cancer and you could say,

54
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:44,030
okay, you either have no cancer or you have and you have cancer, and then maybe you're dead.

55
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:57,230
So those can be your three health states. But later but also, you can have something similar to that other diagram where you might have,

56
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,950
you know, no cancer or maybe have some sort of pre-cancer and maybe you have stage one.

57
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:10,940
Stage two, you have treated or resected.

58
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,680
So you can have a bunch of different arrows here and then.

59
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:21,500
Yeah. And anyway, so you can make it more complex or less complex.

60
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,350
And part of it depends on the kinds of questions you're trying to answer.

61
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,020
If we're trying to look at some details of some specific cancer treatment, maybe I do need all these details.

62
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:37,280
If instead I'm looking at maybe cancer prevention, maybe I just need to know cancer and cancer.

63
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,780
And that's the important part. And what happens to you after you get cancer is not as relevant.

64
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:48,020
I'm just worried about this diet program where it reduces your risk of eating cancers.

65
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,809
I'll take part of this as there's again, there's kind of an art in your choosing,

66
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,100
what you what you think is most important to include in this analysis.

67
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:03,640
Was there a question or are you just stretching or talking about it?

68
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,739
There's not necessarily a right or wrong answer for how you structure.

69
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:15,620
These is an opportunity to talk to experts and decide, you know, what are the critical components that you think we talked to for your class projects?

70
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,730
You can talk to experts if you want to work in your research and kind of back a reading on the issue.

71
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,770
You yourselves will be kind of somewhat expert as well and decide, you know,

72
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,549
if you're going to use a mark, you don't have to use Markov models for your project.

73
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:36,020
So if you use a marco model, I mean, you can make judgment calls about what you think are the important aspects of this,

74
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,060
let's say disease conditions that are important to you, including your analysis.

75
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:49,010
What I'm saying kind of going back again, you do not need a moral model to solve every kind of decision problem.

76
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:58,760
But Markel models can be especially helpful in figuring out kind of long term progression or evolution of something over time.

77
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:07,280
And the way or another way I like to think about is if you have if you have a decision tree.

78
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,989
In the decision tree, you need probabilities and then you also need for cost effective,

79
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,700
substantiated health outcomes so less cost and quality adjusted life years.

80
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:33,009
At the knees of your tree. I think if you can just find it in the literature, if someone says, okay,

81
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:38,950
here's the the long term lifetime costs and qualities associated with being this branch of the tree.

82
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:49,990
Great. You're fine. Go ahead. Use the decision tree. If, however, let's say, you know, in your decision tree, this means you get diabetes.

83
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,860
And you say, gosh, I don't know what the lifetime costs of quality are for diabetes.

84
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,260
Then you might use a Markoff model to simulate the long term outcomes of with diabetes.

85
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:07,180
And with that said, if you can find literature and someone says, oh, if you get diabetes,

86
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:13,090
it adds an extra $10,000 to your health care costs and you lose three quality adjusted life years.

87
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,120
Then then you can just use that. But if you don't have that,

88
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:22,630
then you might use a marshall model to simulate the rest of that person one time and see what they're they're monitoring health outcomes.

89
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:32,770
Yes. So in that example, if you didn't have the lifetime costs and quality data, you would say like every year,

90
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:40,569
like each year after the study goes on, you'd say this person loses half of quality and costs $5,000 or whatever.

91
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,830
And then the next year, it's the same thing. Exactly.

92
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:53,350
So if we have in fact, let's go to this example here. So if we if we know the health states and we know the transitions, how,

93
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,610
let's say typically annual transitions are right, but you can use weekly or monthly or whatever.

94
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:04,150
But anyway, you've got health states in your state, you say, okay, I know how many people are going to start in each health state.

95
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:11,850
And oftentimes maybe everyone starts in one health state and they know the transition rates or how quickly do people progress along this path,

96
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,030
this path and so forth.

97
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:23,910
And I also know the per unit, time, cost and quality of life of being in each health state, then we can calculate total lifetime cost quality.

98
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,550
So I need to know what are my health states, what are my transitions?

99
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:36,969
And then for each blue bubble here, I need to know what are the costs for being in a health state.

100
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,890
So let's say you're going back to this stage one, stage two, stage three, stage four.

101
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,290
What does it cost? What's the annual cost of having stage one lung cancer?

102
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,130
What's the annual cost of having stage two lung cancer? What's the annual cost to having stage three lung cancer?

103
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,730
Or maybe, maybe if this is progressing quickly, you do things on a monthly basis.

104
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,550
And then what's the quality of life with stage one lung cancer.

105
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,620
Stage two Lung Cancer. Stage three lung cancer. Stage four lung cancer.

106
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:09,410
So you need to know for each health state what are what are my costs per month,

107
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:14,660
per year, whatever it is, and what's quality of life with that health state.

108
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:22,190
So cancer. But you can think about, you know, diabetes and you can think about what's your quality of life with asymptomatic diabetes.

109
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:32,090
Maybe not so bad, maybe. But then diabetes can maybe lead to amputations, which would lead to loss of life and some costs.

110
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:37,790
Maybe it leads to a heart attack or a stroke. Or being a dialysis or going blind.

111
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,510
So those might be other health states that you might include in a diabetes model, for example.

112
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,620
And then there are costs and quality of life implications of those things.

113
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:51,590
Yes. So correct me if I'm wrong, but I know a lot of us are going to policy,

114
00:11:51,600 --> 00:12:01,069
so like an application of our top models could be us trying to explain why we put certain items or the cost of like on a decision tree,

115
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:04,370
like what would be an example of an application.

116
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:12,230
Because I think I understand, I think I need a specific example of when this was when this was effectively used.

117
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:27,430
Yeah. So. I think we're using this to simulate the long term evolution of health for some sort of system.

118
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:35,320
And so let's say also you could maybe say an emissions smoking cessation program and know we've got a group in here interested in smoking cessation.

119
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:41,560
So you could have non smoker, former smoker, current smoker.

120
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:49,410
And you say nonsmokers become current smokers and then current smokers become former smokers.

121
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,140
And former smokers might go back to being current smokers.

122
00:12:52,560 --> 00:13:00,780
And we know, you know, even if you if you're a current smoker, you're you have certain costs and there are certain health implications of that.

123
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:05,790
And even if you're a former smoker, at least for some period of time, maybe a decade or so,

124
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,750
you have worse quality of life and worse health outcomes than if you were never smoker.

125
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:19,830
And so you could you could model this and you say, look, I know from the natural history and the epidemiology of this,

126
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:29,999
maybe there's a 1% chance of becoming a current smoker each year and maybe 10% of people quit each year.

127
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,510
So that current smoker, former smoker, and then maybe 20% of people relapse each year of performance over the current smoker.

128
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:48,360
So you can you can simulate that and you would then be able to create a graph and show current smokers and former smokers and nonsmokers over time.

129
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,930
And you can figure out what are the costs and health implications of all of that.

130
00:13:52,380 --> 00:14:04,170
And then you can then you can say, okay, what if what if I'm able to reduce the rate of initiation of smoking?

131
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:10,140
So it used to be 1%. What if I can bring that down to in half to half a percent per year?

132
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,450
Or what if I could increase quit rates?

133
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:22,830
So what if we have a great new treatment that has a 30% chance of having people quit versus 10% chance or something?

134
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,720
Or what if I reduced the relapse rate from 20% per year to 10% per year?

135
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,370
And then I simulate that and I'm going to get a different trajectory of all these health states

136
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,110
and I can figure out what are the long term health and economic impact impacts of that.

137
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:44,680
Thank you. Yeah. And so you can also. So here we're doing about dealing with this for cost effectiveness challenges.

138
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,470
But you could also do this for other things, too, like me.

139
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:54,540
Let's say you think I'm going to have some sort of Medicare for All or something like that.

140
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:01,200
And and so you could say here are insured and non insured.

141
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,710
But let's say, you know,

142
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:15,709
actually a medicare is a great example because presumably you'd have this uninsured population

143
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:20,540
and like Medicare for All comes in and everyone and all of a sudden is is insured.

144
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:25,579
Or maybe have some other program where people gradually move from insured to uninsured.

145
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:30,200
And so there you might have to model that with the market model of evolution of over time.

146
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,530
And it just so 10% of people who are uninsured become insured.

147
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,690
And so you'd be stimulating that over time and potentially. So some sort of evolution over time.

148
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,710
Is is a market model can be useful for that. A useful tool for that.

149
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,820
Yeah. Other questions. Okay.

150
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,570
So let's go through some examples to make this a little more concrete.

151
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:03,920
So in this case, study of some horrible disease, some old diseases, originally 20% of people die each year from some horrible disease.

152
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:11,750
We have this pill disease away way that reduces risks of dying from HD and get rid of it

153
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:18,560
is a surgical procedure where we cut out the bad parts of your body and cure the HD,

154
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:26,150
or you can choose not to get either one. Now, these aren't perfect interventions.

155
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:30,080
Disease way reduces the relative risk of dying from HD by 40%.

156
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,850
So that's great. But it does have some side effects increases stroke and heart attack mortality.

157
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:40,820
One key thing I want to mention from this example is it increases mortality risk by 300%.

158
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:54,410
What if something increased mortality by 50%? So let's say the risk is, you know, 1% increases and it increases the mortality risk by 50%.

159
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:00,320
What would that mean? Let's say you started at 1% and it was a 50% increase.

160
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:06,670
What would your new recipe? 50% relative risk increase by 5%.

161
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:13,930
Yeah. Me 1.5. So we take the one multiplied by one plus the 50% increase that would get us 1.5%.

162
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:20,410
So this is a mortality increase of 300% and 200%.

163
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:24,790
But these are relative increases. So part of it depends on what the baseline risk is.

164
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,880
We'll talk about that second and then get rid of it. Can completely cure.

165
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,900
That's great. But it's a surgical procedure. It's very risky.

166
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,950
There's a 40% chance you'll die during a patient will die during the procedure.

167
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,750
So a few other assumptions here based on stroke mortality is 1% per year.

168
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:47,260
So actually, let's work through this here. If if this if the baseline is 1% and it increases your risk by 300%,

169
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:57,520
what is your new risk of stroke of dying from a stroke per year with disease when you started at 1%?

170
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:07,490
It's a 300% increase. 4%.

171
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:13,250
It'd be 4%, right? If we multiplied by one plus the increase.

172
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:21,790
If it's a 100% increase, if you multiply by two, 300% increase, you multiply it by four.

173
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:30,130
So that gives us 4%. So anyway, so we need this to kind of calculate what the what the net impact of things will be.

174
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,990
So let's assume the only cause of death are stroke and heart attacks.

175
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:41,260
And let's assume we looked at our telescope and we looked out and we saw this giant meteor that's going to destroy the earth in ten years.

176
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:45,810
So we only care about what happens the next ten years. And then after that, everyone's dead and we don't care about anything else.

177
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:52,770
So we're going to assume that everyone drops dead ten years. So and we're also only worried about life expectancy at this point that Claudia just.

178
00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:01,570
So actually before we get into this, so just a raise, raise your hand.

179
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,710
Who thinks disease away is the best to give you the take the pill.

180
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:13,300
Who thinks the surgery is best? Who thinks not doing either one is the best.

181
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,460
Who doesn't know. Okay, good. You know, and that's why we do.

182
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,450
That's why we build these models to help us answer these questions. So that's fine.

183
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,600
It's good that you didn't immediately say, Oh,

184
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:32,000
it was obvious that this is what we need these models to help us calculate that figure, which has the best life expectancy.

185
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:39,170
So one of the first thing we will do here then is calculate the net annual mortality with disease away.

186
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:54,100
So recall as HD has 20% mortality, but disease way gives us a 40% reduction.

187
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:09,970
And we had a stroke. You have 1% for that, and I'm going to call this myocardial infarction or heart attack 0.5%.

188
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,800
But this has a 300% increase and a 200%.

189
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,420
Increase. And those are the only cause of death in this simple example here.

190
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:30,250
So what is our net annual mortality? Then with disease, we give you a minute to think about it.

191
00:20:47,690 --> 00:21:17,950
These are all relative reductions in arms communications. As he.

192
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:30,510
Increase by 300. I'm here.

193
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,799
Okay, so what what would the mortality be? Just.

194
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,920
Just from itself? How would that mortality be if you took this?

195
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:51,200
If someone took this disease? Wait till. So they told me it'd be 12%.

196
00:21:51,200 --> 00:22:00,320
And we get that by saying 20% times one -40%, and that gives us 12%.

197
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,390
So that's the remaining risk. So that drops substantially.

198
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:13,400
And then stroke risk, we already did this year times one plus 300%.

199
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:18,260
So that gives us 4% stroke risk and then heart attack risk.

200
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,140
One plus 200%. So that's going to be 1.5%.

201
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:38,160
So if you don't take disease away, you have a 21.5% chance of dying each year, 20% from another one and a half percent from heart attacks and strokes.

202
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,750
If you take disease away, what's our total risk here?

203
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,800
So. 16. Is that a stroke and then should be 17 and a half, right?

204
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,620
Okay.

205
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:13,730
So presumably when FDA was approving this imaginary drug, they did their job and the benefits outweigh the risks in terms of mortality, at least here.

206
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:20,150
So if this is, you know, and presumably those are things that FDA should be looking at when they're approving drugs is thinking about.

207
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,220
Net overall benefit risk 2% anyway.

208
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:32,219
So the first thing here is it looks like disease way will give us better life expectancy give us

209
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:37,710
better or reduce mortality overall even though it does increase stroke and heart attack mortality,

210
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:46,010
it reduces that's an interesting mortality. But one of the thing we're not doing is we're not looking at quality of life, you know,

211
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:51,479
presume and so anyway, so, you know, presumably there could be other factors here that we think about.

212
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,390
But but in this in this example, we're just look at life expectancy. And so it looks like disease where it does have lower mortality.

213
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:06,950
So let's take a look at this and see how we can calculate life expectancy.

214
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:19,480
So what we can do here is on our course website, we have a under the modules, we have this disease away versus get rid of it.

215
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,540
Budget Impact Excel spreadsheet.

216
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:32,420
Don't worry. Not. You don't have to hide. I'm not going to make anyone of you come up right now to build this here.

217
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:40,610
But I want to just just show this first one to you as a first example.

218
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:45,020
So this is the disease way versus get rid of an example.

219
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:49,730
And I want to point out, there are there are several tabs here.

220
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:54,170
We're just going to focus on the first tab here today, the cost effectiveness analysis tab.

221
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:01,550
And this this shows life expectancy. We also control quality adjusted life expectancy and cost so forth as well.

222
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,880
But I want to say this. Yes, I picked the name of the module.

223
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:15,110
Can't find it. Oh sorry. It's under week three I think here.

224
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:23,660
So if you go to our course website modules and we three here should be disease waivers.

225
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,470
I think week three as a whole unit isn't published so you can't see it.

226
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:37,820
Oh yeah. We tune you. Yeah. Okay I get that is help make things a lot easier for us to be three is okay thank you.

227
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:46,580
Thank you for letting me know. Okay so just big picture on oriented to the spreadsheet, I have all the inputs at the top.

228
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:52,099
So these are all those numbers that you saw in the sprint in.

229
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,910
That's right. In the slides here shc mortality risk, heart attack, stroke mortality risk.

230
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:02,690
Then intervention risks. I'm sure I converted the percentage increases into a relative risk multiplier.

231
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,460
So we just have, you know, the relative risk of stroke is four times higher.

232
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:14,990
Heart attack risk is three times higher or 200% increase of periprocedural mortality from the surgical procedure 40%.

233
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:24,440
Then how much do these things? What's the remaining relative risk of HD with disease?

234
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,160
When you read a bit,

235
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:33,680
curves converted a 40% reduction into a 60% remaining relative risk and then get rid of it is 100% reduction in your HD mortality.

236
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:40,040
So that's just roll out to a 0% relative risk of death if you get the surgical procedure.

237
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:46,219
I put in some quality of life numbers here and costs.

238
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:51,170
So costs of the disease and and we'll see how those kind of fit in.

239
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:58,010
But basically for each health state, we have we have costs and we have a one time cost of the surgical procedure.

240
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,740
An initial population and discount rate. We'll talk about the Walmart discount rates.

241
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,450
I think most of you see that. We'll talk about that next week.

242
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:15,810
So all of the numbers, all the input numbers are here at the top as inputs and assumptions.

243
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:22,860
And you'll notice and then later on, I guess in the bottom here, we will have we have the model, which is where we actually do the calculations.

244
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:31,049
And I think it's a very good practice to separate your input assumptions and numbers,

245
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:37,200
parameter assumptions from the actual calculations in the model for for two reasons.

246
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,510
One is it really facilitates sensitivity analysis, which we'll talk about later on in the semester,

247
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,570
where you change your assumptions and see how that changes your results.

248
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:51,450
It makes it millions of times easier if you separate your input assumptions from the actual model calculations.

249
00:27:51,930 --> 00:28:01,110
And then two is it makes it easier to debug and examine and and understand your model.

250
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:06,630
So every out here in the model. So for example here I'm calculating that net annual mortality.

251
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:18,570
This is a calculation of those those mortality and actually disease where here you can see the calculation here.

252
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,210
It's just a bunch of cells and subtract applied divide and so forth but just a list

253
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:28,800
of cells and there are no magic one recall magic numbers in this formula here.

254
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:32,760
There's no seven times six plus 32 times 14.

255
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,010
Don't have any numbers in these cells.

256
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:42,990
And I'd argue that's a good thing, because then later on, you don't wonder why why they want to put a seven here or a 36 or a 14 or 19.

257
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,960
Here I can see. Okay. D four times, 18 times six times D 11 plus D, 12 times D seven.

258
00:28:49,200 --> 00:29:02,670
And then I can go back up here and see 0d4 is HD mortality and I'm multiplying that by 18, which is the relative risk of dying with s hd.

259
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:11,730
If I'm taking the disease way drug and so I can I hopefully can then go back and try to

260
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:19,590
figure out what do these numbers mean rather than just having a random 0.2 times point six.

261
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,280
And I don't remember what those numbers mean or represent.

262
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:32,880
Okay. So here down in the model, we have just some calculations for calculating the net annual mortality.

263
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:37,240
So two and a half percent with no intervention, 17 and a half percent with these weight,

264
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,000
which we just calculated a few minutes ago, and then get rid of it.

265
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:46,240
If you have no SHC mortality, you still do face a one and a half percent chance per year of dying from heart attacks strokes.

266
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,280
And here I've also added the net annual costs. So here I had some costs of $5,000 per year of having food.

267
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,040
If you take the disease weight, it's a dollar a day.

268
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:07,120
So you had $5,065 in annual cost of curtailing the disease, weight health and then annual costs of our if you don't have HD, they're much lower.

269
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:14,230
So the annual costs are $5 billion. But of course, then there's the one time cost of 50,000 to get rid of a procedure.

270
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,400
But down here is where we're actually doing the the mechanics of the Markov model.

271
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:26,990
So here we're calculating what fraction of the population is alive, dead,

272
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:32,540
and then how many quality adjusted life years and costs do we have for each of those years?

273
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:42,700
We'll start off with no intervention here. Each row represents a different time points, we might think, with 10.0 as the start of all this.

274
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:48,130
So today is 10.0. Who do we have in each health state?

275
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,950
So we start off in this case, people. We start off with this example.

276
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:56,209
A thousand people who don't have PhDs are all a lot are sorry.

277
00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:01,610
They do have 60, but they're all life and our health states are alive and dead.

278
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:09,860
So it's a very simple markov model. You're either alive or dead. So two health states are alive and dead, and we have one arrow from alive to death.

279
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:22,730
So it's very, very simple, Markov. And because it's so simple, the masses here should be relatively simple.

280
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:29,320
So alive is the number of people alive at time period.

281
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:36,140
One is simply how many who were alive the previous time period that didn't die.

282
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:41,480
So the previous number of the people, previous people here, times one minus the death rate.

283
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,980
So if two and a half percent of the population dies each year,

284
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:53,090
then 78 and a half percent of the population remains alive the subsequent until the subsequent year.

285
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:58,850
So we have 70 or 85 people alive at time, period one.

286
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:04,339
So one year from today, if you had no intervention with ADHD of your population of 1000,

287
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:11,780
you'd have 785 people remaining alive one year from today, and then you'd have 215 people dead.

288
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,100
So the number of people who are dead at any particular time period,

289
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:23,320
any particular year here is just how many people were dead the previous year, plus the people who died.

290
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:26,660
So the thousand people were alive. Times their mortality rate, we add them.

291
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:32,020
In one way I like to think about it.

292
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:38,390
Many of the facts here is if you think about all your bubbles and arrows, your health status.

293
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:47,560
See how states actually make this an n d for alive and dead.

294
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,549
If you don't know how many people are. So you start off at you initialize the system at time period.

295
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,790
On the call time, you're in zero. How many people are in each health state?

296
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:07,120
And then from then on we just calculate how to figure how many are in each health state.

297
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:14,830
We say how many people are in the in that house in the previous time period, and then we subtract out the flow out.

298
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:23,710
So if we have people leaving alive, for example, we subtract out the people who die or leave that health state each time period.

299
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:30,280
And then we and then if we have a health state with arrows going into it, you add those people in each time period.

300
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:41,410
So for life and death, it's pretty straightforward. But if you have a very complex model, I actually want to just go back to this one here.

301
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:45,670
If you want to figure out how many people are alive at a particular time, you start at the beginning.

302
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:54,250
And so in this House state, for example, I'm just going to subtract out the flows along these zeros, the number of people moving out of those zeros.

303
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,560
And then, for example, this health state,

304
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:04,000
we add in the people who come in from here and from here and we subtract out the people going out along this arrow.

305
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:09,309
So think is helpful to kind of draw the diagrams and then, you know, where all the flows are.

306
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:14,230
And so when you're calculating each time period, you can figure out, I have to add,

307
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:18,760
the people flowing in with the arrows going in and subtract, the people going out with the arrows going out.

308
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:29,170
Any questions? Yes. For that's for that Markov model.

309
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:34,870
Well, you can see the people love the ads. Yeah.

310
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:43,090
So sometimes it doesn't mean it's okay.

311
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:48,280
So sometimes people will draw these more problems. Also with a loop going back into the health.

312
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:57,760
Same. Yeah.

313
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,490
It's basically if they don't flow out, we assume they stay in.

314
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,180
So sometimes you'll see a diagram with a kind of looping back health state.

315
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:15,230
But it is not necessarily. Is that what you're saying? So the total the total of probability F to the sum of the total probabilities one.

316
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:26,180
Yes. So if you if you include this extra looping, I'll say so if this if this let's say this is 30% chance of moving along this transition,

317
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:29,840
then you have 70% chance of remaining in that health state.

318
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:36,020
Yes. So the arrows out plus those who remain should be 100%.

319
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:52,950
So sometimes but sometimes anyway we leave off the the arrow going back because it's assumed that by definition if you don't flow out,

320
00:35:53,220 --> 00:36:04,340
you stay in that hellscape. And if you want it to denote a health state where you don't stay in it, you'd have to have 100% flow out or,

321
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:10,050
you know, 50% of people here or 50% of people flow out there and no one stays in that health state.

322
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,860
So if the the flows out can never be greater than one, if they're equal to one, you don't know what stays in that health state.

323
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,069
And if the less than one if that if you see the some of the arrows going out,

324
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:28,960
it is less than one then people some people will stand at health state each to the next hundred.

325
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:41,160
So in this simple example, it's just alive and dead. And we don't have to keep track of a whole bunch of flowers.

326
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:47,010
So it's it's pretty straightforward to figure out how many people are alive.

327
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:50,460
You just look at how many people were alive the previous time period and didn't die.

328
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,530
And then if you want to hear how many are dead in a particular time period, how many who are dead the previous time period,

329
00:36:55,890 --> 00:37:03,030
plus the people who died in that between type year and then plus one or minus one.

330
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,720
So here I can calculate how many people are alive and dead over time. And so we can.

331
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:17,740
You know, we can figure this out here and we can create a nice graph here.

332
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:27,280
And so this is for no intervention. You know, you can plot over time what fraction of the population or how many people would be alive and dead,

333
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:33,310
how actually this is this is how many people in the population will be alive again over time.

334
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:42,750
And we can use that to calculate what we think the the costs and quality adjusted life years would be.

335
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,500
So here it will get bigger into more details just like yours next week.

336
00:37:49,030 --> 00:38:00,520
But if you have quality of 4.9 and you've got a thousand people alive, then on average each person is going to get 1.9 quality just like you.

337
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:08,050
And so you have about 900 quality adjusted life years lived during that first year in the number of people who are alive.

338
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:13,360
And if each person has $5,000 in health care expenses and you've got 2000 people,

339
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:19,710
like you would have $5 million in costs for that cohort of people in that first year.

340
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:29,770
And then the next year you'd only have 70 or 85 people alive. So you'd have 3009 or $25 in health care costs that year and so forth.

341
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:35,020
And so we can calculate what the annual costs will be in each year as well.

342
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:42,800
So we know how many are alive and dead. How many quality adjusted life years will be accrued each year?

343
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,410
And what the cost would be in each year as well.

344
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:51,020
So if you're Blue Cross and you say, Hey, I've got a population of a thousand people with some horrible disease,

345
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,559
you can make some projections for budgeting and planning to say,

346
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:00,710
I need $5 million to take care of these people this year, but I'm going to need another $3.9 million to take care of them next year.

347
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:05,870
Another $3 million to take care of them the following year for kind of longer term budget planning.

348
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:16,579
Now, what we can also do here is. As we can calculate, rough life expectancy here.

349
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:23,090
So if we know we have a thousand people alive, the first year, 785 people live, the next year, 660 people within the next year,

350
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:30,620
we can kind of add up those years of life lived so we can sum up all those years of life lived.

351
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:44,240
So we can sum up all those years of life. So we have 1000 years of life.

352
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:49,800
That person, years of life, live in the first year, 70 or 85 person, years of life lived the next year and so forth.

353
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:56,370
Add them all up. So we get, you know, 4000 something years of life lived in that cohort of a thousand people.

354
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:04,920
So per person, on average, we divide by the thousand people we start with, we'll get about 4.25% for one,

355
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,660
two, four years of life lived in that cohort over that ten year time frame.

356
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,420
So that's kind of our average life expectancy. For people who get no intervention.

357
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:29,650
We can also calculate costs to it and can't call it average costs per person.

358
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:35,290
And so I want you to think about this. If they live for 1 to 4 years and about $5,000 in health care costs each year,

359
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:40,600
it's going to be a little over $20,000 in lifetime medical expenses as well.

360
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:49,070
Any questions? Yes.

361
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:53,330
I think I missed it. When you said it earlier, what was the the significance of the discount?

362
00:40:54,770 --> 00:41:00,950
So the discount rate and we'll talk with us a little more next week is thinking about the time value

363
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:05,360
of money and how we feel about resource heavy resources today versus resources of the future.

364
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:12,830
So, you know, would you assuming that I'm a very trustworthy person and you can totally trust me,

365
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:20,210
would you prefer to have $20 today or $20 a year from now today or to have it today?

366
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:26,540
Do you prefer to have resources there? Even if I was totally trustworthy, you know, you could do something with the $20 today.

367
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,730
Maybe you maybe you need lunch or money or something like that.

368
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:35,179
You can use it and then or you could just, you know, put it in the bank and you'd have it for you have it available next year.

369
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,290
You don't have to use it, but you have it available to you. It's extra resources available.

370
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:44,270
So we prefer to have resources today versus resources in the future.

371
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:50,690
And in fact, if you owed me $20, would you prefer to pay me now or pay me a year from now?

372
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:55,250
You know, for any year. And I mean even more so if it was $10,000.

373
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:02,720
Right. Hey, pay me $10,000 now today or pay me $10,000 a year from now or ten years from now or 50 years from now.

374
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:13,280
Right. So that's the discount is related to the time value of money and saying that we value things today more than we value them in the future,

375
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:29,060
whether it be benefits or costs. And so this this discounted value says that, yes, nominally we have $21,000 in costs over the next decade,

376
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:34,880
but some of those costs are next year or the year after or three years or four years or five years or six years in the future.

377
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:46,489
And so the present value equivalent of that $21,000 stream of costs over the next decade is actually only worth $19,600 to us.

378
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:58,160
And in present day equivalent because that $3,925 a year from now isn't quite worth $3,025 to us today with a little bit less.

379
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:04,040
And that's $1.17 million that we pay out six years from now.

380
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:07,579
That's not worth $1.17 million.

381
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:12,500
It's probably worth $0.900 thousand or something smaller because that's way off in

382
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:19,129
the future and it's not quite as big and as in a present value equivalent sentence.

383
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:24,890
Yes. Could you repeat how you got the life expectancy like that, Roe?

384
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:31,640
I'm sorry, I yeah. So the way I think about it here is if we have a cohort of a thousand people,

385
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:39,920
we've got a thousand people alive in the first year, we're going to have about 1000 years of life lived in that first year.

386
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:46,970
And then the next year, if we have 785 people, we're going to have about seven, three, five years of life lived in that second year in that cohort.

387
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:54,290
And so these are the person years of live of life lived in B 45, 30, 54.

388
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:57,710
All those are the person years of life lived in that cohort.

389
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:09,350
So we're going to have we're going to have 4240 person years of life lived in that cohort over ten years.

390
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:15,979
And if we start with a thousand people and we've got 4238 person years of life lived on average,

391
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:21,920
that's about 4.24 years of life lived per person over that decade.

392
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:29,160
Okay, so you're just starting, but total years of life divided by the number of lives you started?

393
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:35,420
Yes. Yeah. And by the way, if we if we start so here at the corner of a thousand, what if I said there's a cohort of one?

394
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:40,489
Well, now these numbers are just another way to think about them.

395
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:46,430
Is there the fraction of the population alive at each time point and then?

396
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,880
So you could just add up the fraction, you can just add this up.

397
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:59,630
And now then you don't have to divide by a thousand or anything. And that should still give you the 4.2 for now.

398
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:11,140
Now, if you were reading the book closely to the Munich book closely,

399
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:17,600
they talk about something called a half cycle correction, which is a more precise way to estimate the life expectancy.

400
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:29,659
Don't worry about that for this class. But but technically speaking, if you have a thousand people, I would say they don't all live the full year.

401
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:35,240
Right. 21 and a half percent died during that year. So you don't really have a thousand years of life lived in that first year.

402
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:39,290
Something a little less than that. And so there are some corrections that you can make to that.

403
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:45,540
But don't we run that distance? Okay, so that's no intervention.

404
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:55,769
And then way to get rid of it. We have very similar results here except with disease away here, we have slightly lower mortality.

405
00:45:55,770 --> 00:46:00,840
So we have 70 and a half percent mortality instead of the 21 and a half percent mortality.

406
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,600
So slightly more mortality. So so we have more people alive over time.

407
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:14,220
And if we look at the life expectancy here, it's 4.8, almost 4.9 years of life instead of 4.2, four years of life.

408
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:21,900
So we have better life expectancy over this ten year time period with disease away and then with get rid of it.

409
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:31,320
We have that immediate 400 people out of the thousand dying because there's 40% mortality during the procedure.

410
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:35,490
So that's that's the only kind of major difference here.

411
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:38,670
And then mortality, of course, though, is much lower.

412
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:44,400
If you survive the surgery, you only have one and a half percent chance of dying after the surgery.

413
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:52,469
And so. That's right. So the life expectancy here is is slightly different.

414
00:46:52,470 --> 00:47:14,060
But in fact, let me just show you this here. So that's no intervention.

415
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:28,990
Then let's add this CS way. And we had great events here.

416
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:47,580
So here is our kind of survival curves for these three interventions.

417
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:03,150
So for the first two nights in D.C., where we do have more people live.

418
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:11,100
But over the long run, more people are alive after the surgery because, yes, they had a lot of initial high initial mortality a bit longer.

419
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:21,329
But if you survive that, you live longer. So that's that's what's going on with these these three different interventions here and technically get rid

420
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:27,630
of it actually has the highest life expectancy of 5.61 because although a lot of people die immediately,

421
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:34,530
they stay alive longer. And so the total of years of life lived or life expectancy is a little bit higher with sort of procedure.

422
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:40,090
And we can simulate that here again with our simple markup.

423
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:52,340
Impressions. And then, of course, with the marshmallows here, we can also calculate our costs.

424
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:56,780
Each year we have $50,000 in in and that initial cost of the surgery.

425
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:00,290
But then each year thereafter, there are lower costs and so forth.

426
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:06,320
And then at the end here we can just kind of add up those totals and and plot our cost plan and all that good stuff.

427
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:14,720
And small role models help us figure out what those long term, in this case, ten year lifetime cost of quality adjusted life years would be.

428
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:25,590
Yes. So it's cell 16e 65.

429
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:31,560
What is the life expectancy in terms of cost? Yeah.

430
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:40,090
So that really isn't life expectancy. That's the that's the, the, the lifetime average cost per person.

431
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:48,450
Yeah. And lifetime average costs. Very well.

432
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:54,149
Now, one other thing I think is really nice for moms and we'll get to this more when we get to

433
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:58,350
sensitivity analysis is we can change our assumptions and see how the results change.

434
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:03,480
So for example, I said 40% mortality with the surgery procedure.

435
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:10,350
Any time I see a number that's like nice and round like 40%, I get a little suspicious, you know, where that number actually come from.

436
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:21,840
And so, you know what? If that number is wrong, what if the periprocedural mortality whereas 60% if I've separated my mom, my,

437
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:27,780
my input numbers from my calculations in the model, I can easily change that one number and see how the results change.

438
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:32,340
So if the periprocedural mortality with the surgery is higher 60%.

439
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:44,070
Now I have lower life expectancy 3.74 years of life expectancy with the surgical procedure compared to 4.8 with the medical pills.

440
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:51,700
So when you use models like this, you can easily change your assumptions and see how the results change.

441
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:57,430
So that's a nice thing about just models, generally decision trees or macro models.

442
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:03,870
Okay. Any questions about this? Some horrible disease example.

443
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:17,370
Okay. Let's walk through one more additional example today. That is a an example of cancer.

444
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:25,310
So this one, you're going to download this regorafenib a.

445
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:35,580
Anti-Cancer medication and our model here, and we'll take a look at how we might build that.

446
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:39,690
So this is a model that's typical in a lot of cancer.

447
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:45,960
Cancer analyzes here and basically kind of three health states.

448
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:50,940
This diagram shows more of them. But basically you're you're either progression free.

449
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:57,390
So disease has not gotten worse. So these are your patients with with kind of advanced cancers.

450
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:01,200
And physicians are looking you know, these are cancer kind of stable.

451
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:06,870
Is the tumor growing bigger or is it's kind of staying the same? So if it stays the same, it's called progression free.

452
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:09,989
It hasn't progressed, hasn't got bigger than the cancer.

453
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:14,910
Basically kind of gets bigger. You can progress. It's a one way path here.

454
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,979
And then people can die either from progression free, they could die or they could die when progressed.

455
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:29,460
And presumably when your cancer gets bigger, you have a higher mortality. So we basically have these the Marco model is is relatively simple.

456
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:33,600
You're either progression free, you're progressed or your death.

457
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:41,240
So this is pretty simple, mark on model, but a little more complex than the previous one.

458
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:51,280
We just had to help students. So those are markup houses and transitions, I guess.

459
00:52:52,690 --> 00:53:02,030
So. Let's set this up as a as a merkel volunteer, and I should orient you to this spreadsheet here.

460
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:08,880
There are two worksheet tabs. One is the parameter values.

461
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:20,430
So here are and let's say we look at the medical literature and these were the progression rates here and I think these are monthly or weekly.

462
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:26,640
Yeah, sorry, weekly. So this is you know, cancer is pretty serious.

463
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:34,470
If you really have better supportive care without regression, you have a 10% chance of dying each week.

464
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:43,499
It's pretty serious. And and if you are progressing, you have a 3% chance of dying each week with regorafenib,

465
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:53,910
it drops that progression in half to about 5% per week of progressing and then about the same risk of dying.

466
00:53:55,110 --> 00:54:03,719
And so here I have that couple or another worksheet here where we have a spreadsheet

467
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:07,260
where we're going to simulate the Markov model for the best supportive care.

468
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:13,080
So without regard to what is your progression look like and organize this here with

469
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:18,269
different in this case instead of years we have weeks so we we zero when we start off,

470
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:25,440
we have one representative version of progressive free version freedom and what's in eight weeks, two, three, four, five, six and so forth.

471
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:30,000
And we're just keeping track of people. Are they progression free, progressed or dead?

472
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:39,330
So these these first three columns, your B, C and D are just what fraction of the population is in each health scene at the time.

473
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:47,460
So it's kind of a snapshot. If you were to walk in the clinic and try to figure out a week six how many are alive.

474
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:56,370
Sorry, progression free progression death column is B, F and G are going to be where we calculate the rates.

475
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:01,920
So how are people moving between so between period T.A. plus one.

476
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:06,450
So between period week one, week zero one, how many people progressed?

477
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:12,480
How many people died? And so so we're going to keep track of basically the bubbles,

478
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:18,720
how many are each bubble in the first three columns and then how each will move along the arrows in these next three columns.

479
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:25,530
And if we tell you how many will move on the arrows, we can then figure out how many people will be in the bubbles if the next time you're.

480
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:39,060
Okay. So who would like to volunteer and fill this? Want to pick on our students without computers today.

481
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:42,920
So why don't you come on up and you can be our volunteer? All right. Sounds good.

482
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:50,100
So, again, thank you for doing this. If you make mistakes, don't worry about it.

483
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:55,050
You're going to be up. This is good, I think, to walk through this here with you.

484
00:55:55,470 --> 00:56:02,940
So we already have the initial population here in 1/1, one representative, progression free, one progressing one day.

485
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:09,810
And what I think we should first work on are the progression, the number of people or the fraction of people kind of progressing each time period.

486
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:14,700
So let's figure out how. And by the way, at the top of the screen here we have our progression rates.

487
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:23,010
These are the rates at which people move. So let's calculate progression free to progress how people will progress in that first week.

488
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:30,390
So it's simply going to be we're going to multiply the number of people who are progression free times.

489
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:37,020
The progression rate can be three. Okay.

490
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:43,160
So if we have one representative person who's progression free will have 1.01.

491
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:52,820
I'm sorry. Sorry. Point one on one inch or 10% of that population would progress in that first time period.

492
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:58,370
And then progression free to Dead is simply on progression free times.

493
00:56:58,370 --> 00:57:01,430
The mortality rate in this case is zero. But that's fine.

494
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:08,089
What choose that and then finally we're going to calculate progressed to dead now

495
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:12,200
progressed to dead is not too exciting because no one is progressed at the beginning,

496
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:22,160
but we're still going to just to build the formula here. So with progressed times, the mortality rate, which is about 3% per week,

497
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:30,220
so in the from period, if you had a population at time period zero, you know,

498
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:34,010
you've got a person here or 100% of your population starts off progression free,

499
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:45,410
10% would progress or move along the arrow from progression free to progressed and no one would die either from progression free or or progressed.

500
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,370
Now let's calculate now we know that now we should be able to calculate how many

501
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:53,810
people are progression free progressed to date and time period one and week one.

502
00:57:54,410 --> 00:58:01,219
And so let's do that in column B. How many have you guys how many what is the formula here for?

503
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:06,290
How many? Who would be progression free at time? Week one The beginning of week one.

504
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:13,960
Yeah. So a thousand -1000 times.

505
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:17,610
0.1 to 1. Yeah. So it's going to be equals.

506
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:20,940
The previous progression free so equals, you know, what do you do there?

507
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:25,470
B-12 and then all that multiplication. We don't even have to do that because we already did it.

508
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:31,710
So we're going to say minus this point 1 to 1 here that we calculate as that transition rate.

509
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:38,580
So how many people were in that state previously? And then we subtract out people who flow out.

510
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:45,780
Now there's actually a little bit more to it. We're actually also going to subtract out progression free to death.

511
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:54,540
Now, in this case, it's zero. But so just for completeness, we should add that so it's all the arrows flowing out, we're going to subtract those out.

512
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,830
So who is in that? How, say, previously subtract all the flows out.

513
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:02,860
Okay. Now let's do the same thing for progressed.

514
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:13,899
So it's going to be the previous people who were progressed, but in this case progressed has an arrow going in from progression free.

515
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:23,300
So we need to add that in. And then when you subtract out people who die from progression of progression.

516
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:31,450
And so that's going to be progressed to death in Column G. Okay.

517
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:40,000
And then dead is going to be what always previous dead and dead is how say with arrows only going into it.

518
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:47,500
So we're going to add in those two flows into dead from progression free and from progressed.

519
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:55,750
So those are our formulas here.

520
00:59:55,940 --> 01:00:00,170
We we come here from is for the flows, the rates, kind of the arrows going along.

521
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:05,190
And then we've calculated the fraction in each health state at the next time period by

522
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:08,640
looking at the previous time period and then adding or subtracting the proper flows.

523
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:16,200
Any questions? You come to the G20?

524
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:21,030
The now. Yeah. Formula and G20. Won't you click in there and double click on that.

525
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:27,389
So it's how many people. Basically whatever the source health state is, you want to take,

526
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:33,180
how many people in that source state and then multiply by whatever that the transition rate is up here at the top.

527
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:39,299
So now if we set this up properly, we should be almost done with it.

528
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:46,590
So getting close to that, so what we can do is take the progression rates in the 12, 13 and 14.

529
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:53,040
If you highlight those three cells, you can drag them down once you strike it down one row for a second here.

530
01:00:54,540 --> 01:01:01,409
And one thing you'll notice is things look a little funny and say, hey, no one is is going from price and free to press.

531
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:10,290
So let's look in that formula and look at that and you'll notice it's it's it is the right cell here we from time crude 1 to 2 we do

532
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:17,460
want to multiply by the fraction of people who are progression free but we want to multiply by the progression free to progressed rate.

533
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:24,690
And as we drive the formula down, it did properly try to gather progression free from the next time period.

534
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:28,560
But we want to always point to this rate up here in cell B three.

535
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:36,490
So what we can do is go back to cell he 12 here and put a dollar sign in front of this,

536
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:41,459
the three or dollars in front of both of those dollar signs by typing them.

537
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:45,630
If you want a cheat, you can hit a four of Macintoshes.

538
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:49,830
I don't know what the key combination is for that. Maybe you guys will not show the difference.

539
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:56,970
So now, if so, we'll lock in that region in make making an absolute reference to that particular

540
01:01:56,970 --> 01:02:02,190
cell and we can do the same for the rates in in columns F and G as well.

541
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:14,900
And now if you drag down the formulas in F and G, now they should reference the proper cells here.

542
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:23,990
So now we have we have 10% of the population move from progression free to progress the first time period and then 9% in the next chapter.

543
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:29,090
It's 9% in the next time period because there is fewer people who are progressed to start with remaining.

544
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:34,729
And we also have some doubts here because we now at 201, we had some people progressed.

545
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:42,290
And so in the next time period, we will have some gains. And now what you can do is actually you can highlight the entire row here at time period

546
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:47,570
one and you can drag that down both the population percentages and the progression.

547
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:53,120
And so since those formulas kind of relate to each other, that should fall down.

548
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:58,850
And I think it goes I think this goes on a few years and these are these are weeks it's going to go out.

549
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:03,919
Well, actually, once you slow it down, actually, I'll show you one of the little tricks offered filled out here,

550
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,340
for example, and you can let go of your cursor. Okay.

551
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:08,480
So now we have some progression rates.

552
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:15,709
If you hold your mouse in the lower right hand corner and get that little black x right like plus over the over the corner,

553
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:24,320
like you're going to drag it down. You can also just copy paste and is not going to copy paste, but you can also if you hover your mouse over this.

554
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:35,190
Over this and you double click it's this. Plus, it will fill down to the bottom here, which is hundred 56 weeks in this case, three.

555
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:43,280
Right. So so we've got progression free progress down and we calculate that for a three year time period.

556
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:49,760
Now after three years, actually, if you go down to the bottom of this, very few people are alive.

557
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:54,499
You know, 98.7% of the population is dead in three years.

558
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:58,120
Again, this is very deadly. We've got you know, these are weekly increments.

559
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:02,030
If people are, you know, progressing 10% per week and 3% per week dying.

560
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,330
So this is this is quite an. Okay.

561
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:11,600
So that's our Merkel model of the health states for best supportive care here.

562
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:19,970
Now, let's scroll back up to the top. And if you scroll to the right a little bit, we have a few other things here.

563
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:25,820
We have in this case, like I'm calling this life weeks lived.

564
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:30,110
So how many weeks of life are lived in that first week?

565
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:35,140
Well, if you're alive, you're alive for a week.

566
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:42,250
And so what we can do here in column H is just add up how many people were alive?

567
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:49,220
Basically, we're in progression free and progressed. So we'll sum up B 12 and see 12.

568
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:01,150
So we have one week of life lived in this population in time, period, zero.

569
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:07,170
And why don't you fill that out? You can just double click on that.

570
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:08,650
I don't feel let down.

571
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:16,780
So we get one week of life the first week, another week of life, the second week, because everyone is either progression free or progressed.

572
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:21,070
But then this number kind of slowly decreases over time because more and more people are dead.

573
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:27,880
Now those are weeks of life lived, but in the end, we want a figure of life expectancy, maybe in terms of years, not weeks.

574
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:33,760
And so what we can do is, okay, years of life lived during that short time period.

575
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:43,800
And what fraction of a year is a week? 52nd, 152.

576
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:48,420
Yeah. So here we can take the week weeks of life that divide by 52.

577
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:55,440
And so we have 0.02 years of life lived in that during that first week.

578
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:00,270
And if you fill that down, you figure out how many years of life or lives.

579
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:07,210
And now actually maybe just easier to do this at the top here in like age ten.

580
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:13,120
Why don't you just sum up the weeks of my split? So some of.

581
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:20,700
Age 12 through age 200.

582
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:24,630
And it's like the whole. I don't think so.

583
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:28,910
But you can you can hold control in church or something.

584
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:33,330
You have to control and shift around the people and and that or that, you know.

585
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:42,000
Yeah. No, I think I just the it. Yeah.

586
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:50,070
Or you can hold on to try and sit down here. So I think that it was mad to.

587
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,340
They're going to bigger and.

588
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:08,650
So on average, people have 43 weeks of life on average, and you can just drag the format over to the right and you get years of life lived.

589
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:16,590
So it should be a little less than a year. The question yeah I'm sure you over the life years lived equation again oh so

590
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:21,899
years of of so the first column H is weeks of life lived and so we add those up,

591
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:29,250
we get 43 weeks of life lived. And so we can also say, well, how many years of life are lived in each of all of those or week increments?

592
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:35,610
And so each time each week you're alive, you're gaining 0.02 years of life.

593
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:48,660
It's basically the weeks of five divided by 52. Okay. So here we calculate the average life expectancy in terms of weeks, 43 weeks and years of life.

594
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:52,380
Your .85, three, five years of life.

595
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:59,950
Okay. So we've done that for best supportive care. Now, I'd like to do this for Regorafenib.

596
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:03,990
You're saying, Professor Hodges, we only have 30 minutes left.

597
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:10,480
How do you do this? Well, the good news is, if we structure this properly, it'll be really easy.

598
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:17,170
And what we can do is we can right click the tab at the bottom here and choose, move or copy.

599
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:24,510
And we're going to create a copy by clicking, create a copy in reverse, or add this to the end of our list and then hit.

600
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:29,860
Okay. The good news is right around here have been best support of care, have exactly the same structure.

601
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:34,540
It's either progression free progress or dead. It's just that we have slightly different rates of moving around.

602
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:44,440
And so let's rename this tab here regorafenib and we'll see if we can figure out how to spell that.

603
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:49,210
Norman just oh, that's good. Yeah, he just says it in the name, so.

604
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:58,660
Yeah. Oh, I said okay. So then, then all we have to do actually is at the top of the screen here, we'll change these, these numbers.

605
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:05,709
So this is put to the parameter values B eight, but in fact, B is for best support of care.

606
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:09,430
We want B three, four and five instead of eight, nine and ten.

607
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:16,549
So the right acronym and make that B I think for. So three, four, three, four and five.

608
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:19,850
Sorry. Yeah. And then you can actually just drag that down.

609
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:26,470
And so now, now we have the rapid progression rates.

610
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:33,880
So now all these formulas down here are now based on the retrospective rates instead of best supportive care rates.

611
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:38,170
And if you scroll over to the right, you can see what the life expectancy is here.

612
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:42,940
So now, instead of living 43 weeks of life, now people are living in 55 weeks of life.

613
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:49,660
And instead of, you know, 0.8 years of life, it's 1.0 years of life.

614
01:09:50,290 --> 01:10:00,010
So now we've been able to convert that information from the trial about weekly mortality rates and progression rates into life expectancy.

615
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:06,340
I mean, if I and I should have me I said the beginning here, you know, given those rates,

616
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,870
how long do you think people would live with by your acronym in support of care? And it's not intuitive.

617
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:14,290
You say, oh, of course, point four, three years of life forever.

618
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:16,750
You kind of have to do the math here.

619
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:26,740
And it's not super complex, but we can build a model here to simulate what we think the long term, long term life expectancy would be given this.

620
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:29,799
And I will say, oftentimes in in cancer clinical trials, for example,

621
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:37,390
they do look at things weekly and they might only study people for six months or a year, and then they end the trial.

622
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:42,850
And you don't know what's going to happen. You don't have the data for what's happens at the end of the trial.

623
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:46,480
And so oftentimes, you don't have three years worth of data.

624
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:52,780
And so it's helpful to use these models to simulate what we think the long term progression of these health outcomes will be.

625
01:10:55,090 --> 01:11:01,480
Actually, this is a case where we're in the long term isn't that long term because this is this quite a deadly cancer.

626
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:05,390
But then, you know, there are many cases here where you might be looking at, you know,

627
01:11:05,410 --> 01:11:12,819
diabetes or smoking and where the outcomes occur many years, maybe decades after the initial thing.

628
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:22,960
And so you you maybe have some some new maybe new treatment that says it reduces the rate of going from prediabetes to diabetes in half.

629
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:24,870
That's great. But what really,

630
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:32,620
really we're concerned about the long term outcomes or maybe you've got a smoking cessation intervention that increases quit rates by 80%.

631
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:37,480
You might need to simulate over the long run what that means for total smoking rates.

632
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:43,959
And so you can take what you know about short term, you know, annual or weekly rates and the impact.

633
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:47,080
And you can use a miracle model to simulate what the longer term outcomes.

634
01:11:51,450 --> 01:12:02,930
Any questions? Well, thank you for being our guinea pig here or volunteer or fearless leader and showing us how this can be done.

635
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:10,990
So again, I think for four more problems, I think Microsoft Excel can be really useful at a high level.

636
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:18,550
I think it's useful to keep track of all your health states here in various columns each row represent the time increments.

637
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:26,090
We saw an example with with year time increments. This is an example with which time increments you can choose, how you want to divide things up.

638
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:32,090
But I think it's useful to have kind of your bubbles keep track of who is in which bubble at each particular time period.

639
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:35,600
And then I think it's nice to keep track of progression.

640
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:38,540
So how many are flowing along the arrows in each time period?

641
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:45,530
And once you know the starting population and the annual or weekly or whatever it is flows,

642
01:12:45,950 --> 01:12:49,970
you should be able to calculate how many people are in each health state at each particular time.

643
01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:11,070
Okay. So I guess to to kind of wrap up here, there were a lot of kind of modeling choices you're making when you're setting these things up.

644
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:16,250
There are a lot of considerations of things to think about often as I think about,

645
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:20,000
you know, how do we tie things to the final outcomes that we care about?

646
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:22,230
So in the end, we care about costs and health.

647
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:31,730
And maybe I have some information about, okay, this new medication reduces cholesterol level, but honestly, I don't care.

648
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:35,430
You guys don't care what your cholesterol level or hypertension level is.

649
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:42,209
You only care about how those affect things we care about. Which are things like how does my cholesterol affect a stroke or heart attack?

650
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:44,940
My quality of life, my length of life, my costs?

651
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:52,020
So how do we link the things we the things we know with things we care about so we know about cholesterol level.

652
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:56,280
How does that link to the things we care about here in the end to cost of health?

653
01:13:56,280 --> 01:14:01,650
And maybe I can link cholesterol level to strokes and heart attacks to link it to cost to health.

654
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:07,390
Maybe there's up again like a pre-diabetes intervention that reduces the risk of diabetes.

655
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:09,560
Well, do I really care what that means?

656
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:18,210
Maybe a little bit, but I really care about is, you know, amputations, the blindness, the strokes, the heart attacks, those kinds of things.

657
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:24,570
And so how do we link and ultimately my quality of life and quality of life and and costs.

658
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:28,860
And so how do we link the information we have with the things we care about?

659
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:34,740
And so those are some things to think about in your models, whether it's a decision tree or Hong Kong model, you know,

660
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:38,879
how do I kind of tie all these things together and get to those outcomes that I do

661
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:47,250
care if you're building a Markoff model and actually even for your Susan trees,

662
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:51,000
you want to think about mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive health status.

663
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:57,540
So all those bubbles, mutually exclusive means there's no overlap in the bubbles.

664
01:14:57,870 --> 01:15:04,020
The bubbles are distinct and then collectively exhaustive that all the bubbles cover all the possible things that might happen.

665
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:09,600
So alive and dead is pretty straightforward. Alive and dead, you can be there alive or dead.

666
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:13,470
There's no mixture of the two. And you're either alive or you're dead.

667
01:15:13,470 --> 01:15:21,340
There's no third kind of health state here. The final thing, I guess there are kinds of degrees of distinction.

668
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:29,230
And so for that, again, you might think of.

669
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:42,910
Yeah. So let's say you have diabetes and you can think of diabetes as having maybe you can think about amputation outcomes.

670
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:50,940
That might be one distinction is what kind of amputation outcomes if someone had maybe no amputation, a foot amputation and you know,

671
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:56,440
whatever it is and then you might have blindness outcomes and that's a different distinction is the blindness outcomes,

672
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:00,280
you know, amputation and blindness. Those are two different distinctions.

673
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:05,500
And then within those distinctions like amputation outcomes, you might have different degrees.

674
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,930
You might have to say no amputation or amputation,

675
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:14,080
or you might say finger amputation versus teleportation versus hand levitation versus like amputation.

676
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:18,100
You see, you can have different degrees of that distinction of amputation.

677
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:26,920
And those are things to think about. How much detail do you really need to answer the kind of the policy question you're trying to answer?

678
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,380
Sometimes you need a lot of detail.

679
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:37,270
If you think you've got some special intervention that reduces the severity of amputation, maybe you do need all that detail.

680
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:43,770
If you're thinking about something that it's far upstream and it's really not going to affect that the types of amputation,

681
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:48,220
it's just going to affect the overall rate of amputation. And maybe you just care what amputation of our story potentially.

682
01:16:49,930 --> 01:16:53,590
That's a bit of an art is deciding, you know, how much complex do you want to argue?

683
01:16:53,620 --> 01:17:02,739
You know, start with something that's low complexity and only add additional complexity if you really do need and I'm happy to for your projects,

684
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:09,459
I'm happy to give you as much advice as your problems. Take any final questions?

685
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:12,570
Somewhat more problems. Okay.

686
01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:25,090
Yes. So one thing that I'm wondering about is the extent to which like savings accrue to the government from like early death.

687
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:36,200
So less Social Security and Medicare expenditures, if those ever get included or that's just considered like a transfer because like

688
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:39,910
you paid that money in and you're not going to quote unquote get it back out.

689
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:46,330
So. Or is that just not is that not something people think about?

690
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:52,000
So that's that's a good question. And there's there's a little bit of debate about that, about whether that should be included.

691
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:57,700
Oftentimes, we're definitely including kind of medical expenses and somehow possible.

692
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:01,930
And I think there's general agreement that we probably should include all medical expenses,

693
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:06,180
not just that medication expenses are related to that disease.

694
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:09,820
Or if you're cancer, don't just count cancer costs, but all kind of health care costs.

695
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:14,739
And then there people are you also from a societal perspective, we should include all costs.

696
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:23,410
And we'll talk a little about this more next week, too. But we can think about, you know, productivity.

697
01:18:23,410 --> 01:18:29,260
So as your I we will call this income.

698
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:40,879
And we might think is his age. And so you might have a lower income and actually buy kids under the age of 20 something.

699
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:45,540
You you're going to have maybe negative income or fighting or zero income actually as my daughter.

700
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:50,910
And then you have expenses. So, you know, so what's your net?

701
01:18:53,330 --> 01:18:58,540
Kind of economic value, if you will. So my kids right now are ages ten and 12.

702
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:02,390
They have zero income and they're expensive. So they're they're next.

703
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:05,150
They're they're mine. They're negative here and this graph.

704
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:09,590
And then, you know, presumably at some time, their income will be a greater than their expenses.

705
01:19:10,130 --> 01:19:14,510
And then actually at some point, here are your income, definitely your expenses, maybe when you retire.

706
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:18,530
And so there are some people would argue that that should be included as well.

707
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:22,820
And so there is a cost to having, you know, children under the age of 20 something.

708
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:29,060
And then there's actually a cost to having retired people because their their expenses are greater, their income.

709
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:33,950
And that's a cost to the economy. Now, some people argue that we should do that.

710
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:40,790
That's that's a debate in the in the lecture. If you're reading the paper, you look at and see, I didn't do that or not.

711
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:46,610
Most of them I don't. But some sometimes say, well, obviously that actually more European cost effective sources, Native American ones.

712
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:55,940
But that is something that potentially can be included, although this kind of costs unrelated to health care kind of in someone's lifetime.

713
01:19:56,090 --> 01:19:58,790
And then so that would be kind of in some ways kind of related to those.
