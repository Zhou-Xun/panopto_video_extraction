1
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,690
He might have some other people filtering in.

2
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:32,009
Then I got it down to like for over a year or something, but I don't know how it's going to be.

3
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:36,650
10,000 pieces.

4
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:41,730
Yeah, I think that's like the Wall Street Journal.

5
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,960
Yeah. I mean, you talk about, like, security for. For her or for.

6
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,780
All right. Let me go ahead and get started so we can get everything in.

7
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:10,030
All right. So this is where we're at in terms of the semester.

8
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,110
Today, we're going to do another kind of double up where we're doing structure, function and pathology.

9
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,469
So it's a little bit intensive. The lung is a great one for talks.

10
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,880
We get to talk a little bit about particle toxicology. So there's some really good examples there.

11
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:34,810
And then after that, we're only covering one more system, sadly, I know, but that one we're going to do split between next week.

12
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:42,460
Normal structure and function of the nervous system, followed by nervous system pathology, because that gets a little bit harder to kind of follow.

13
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,730
So that will be our last system.

14
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:56,050
So then we'll have done liver, kidney, lung, nervous system and that will be the clothes on the 18th of November of the material for your final book.

15
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,990
So that will be all the systems that we're going to go over for the final.

16
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:07,149
Then we have Thanksgiving week and then on the second we have a little we're going to bring in a little bit more diversity of slides,

17
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:15,610
just maybe show on some organ systems we didn't get to cover and just kind of practice our basic histology recognition for your final.

18
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:24,490
As I've said before, the only pathology examples that I'll show on your final will be things that you've seen in our systems lectures in class.

19
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,860
So no matter what wacky things we bring to visitor palooza, those will not show up on your final.

20
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,940
I mean, it's still good practice because you still get to practice looking at slides.

21
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,819
But for the final, just like you have on your quizzes, essentially if you see an image,

22
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:45,879
you have to figure out first what tissue is it and you only have four organ systems to choose from.

23
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,440
So you can narrow it down based on the features, you know, from those organ systems.

24
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:59,020
And then of the lesions that I'll show you though, it won't be the exact same image, but the lesions will be something that we've seen.

25
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,010
So if you remember liver, we did acute hepatic necrosis,

26
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,970
we did a chronic liver injury that had fibrosis and had biliary hypoplasia and things like that.

27
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,680
So essentially you learned two basic patterns of injury for the liver.

28
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,390
Okay?

29
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:21,550
So once you figure it out that something's liver, you have to decide, okay, does this more let's look more like an acute lesion or a chronic lesion.

30
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:32,320
And same thing for the kidney. We have a little bit more entities that we looked at there, but essentially we looked at two versions of acute injury.

31
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,980
We looked at just tubular necrosis with the gentamicin example.

32
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,250
And then we looked at Christa Luria with an ethylene glycol example that also caused an acute lesion.

33
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,909
Then I showed you a chronic lesion in the kidney and I talked about a lot of things that led to chronic lesion.

34
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:55,989
But I'm not going to be showing you a histologic slide of that on your final because that's a little bit more complicated lesion.

35
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,760
It's kind of a lot to ask of a beginning microscopist.

36
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,069
So there was a question based on the pathogenesis and there were some image questions on our quiz,

37
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,060
but there won't be an image based question for that chronic renal injury.

38
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,500
Okay. So again, there's a limited amount of things that you've learned.

39
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,450
So when you're looking at the pictures on the final, don't panic.

40
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,089
You just have to identify the organ and then think, okay, we learned acute chronic.

41
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:30,160
We learned these two versions of acute for kidney. Which one of these does this most resemble?

42
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,780
So that's how I would suggest kind of structuring it in your head as you go through

43
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,890
the quiz and as you look back through the PowerPoints in preparation for that final.

44
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,579
Okay, you will still need to know.

45
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,670
So pathogenesis questions are fair game.

46
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:50,680
So even for that chronic kidney question, even if I'm not showing you an image,

47
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:58,000
pathogenesis questions are fair game, a reminder or a kind of tip that I'm noticing from the quizzes.

48
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,960
So pathogenesis means the genesis of the pathology.

49
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,360
So when you do those little progressions, you start with the injurious agent.

50
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,480
So you start with the toxicant, right? However it was take it in, ingested, inhaled, whatever.

51
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:21,129
You start with the toxicant, you walk through the mechanism of toxicity of that toxicant and for the crystals as a precipitate,

52
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:26,770
the something is there in enzymatic metabolism, but you have to end with the pathology.

53
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,880
So don't forget like for the clean glycol one,

54
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:40,060
a lot of people did the path did the mechanism of how ethylene glycol led to calcium oxalate don't stop there, get to the pathology.

55
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:46,150
So now you have calcium oxalate crystals precipitating where precipitating in the renal tubules.

56
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:55,520
So what happens? So there's a partial obstruction and you have back pressure in the tubules and the epithelium gets flattened and over time,

57
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,140
right, that can cause the epithelium to regenerate, maybe necrosis.

58
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,790
So lead up from the toxicant to the actual.

59
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,700
Pathology. So don't forget that last part, because that's the definition essentially of pathogenesis.

60
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,840
How does the pathology pathologic lesion develop?

61
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:22,459
Okay. And I don't know if any people following the news, but last week when I showed that ethylene glycol injury, like the Crystal Murray,

62
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:29,180
I said something like, oh, with antifreeze, this is often seen with antifreeze toxicity, but we rarely see that anymore.

63
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:35,900
You see, this was a New York Times this morning about cough sirup injuries.

64
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,580
Have you guys been hearing about that? So there's been incidents with medicines, medicinal cough,

65
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,500
sirups that have been developed with somewhat shady manufacturing practices that

66
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,510
were sold in Gambia and some other African countries and also in Indonesia.

67
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:58,820
And children have become sick and even died from acute renal injury.

68
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,709
And the initial analysis from the World Health Organization is that the contaminants

69
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:08,150
in the medicine are ethylene glycol and a related compound diethylene glycol.

70
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,100
So unfortunately, I guess I take back what I said.

71
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:23,540
There is still some toxicity occurring and in this context it was kind of illegal contamination of pharmaceuticals for human consumption.

72
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:30,290
So that's the same essential pathogenesis. So the children are affected by acute kidney injury.

73
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:37,250
And as we said, depending on the degree of compound and how well people can be supported through that period of acute kidney injury,

74
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,250
you actually can get regeneration of the epithelium.

75
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:48,050
But the the kind of clinical effects of acute kidney injury can be potentially serious and even potentially fatal.

76
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,870
So that's kind of an unfortunate example of toxicology currently in the real world.

77
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,910
Okay. Any questions about oh, and then.

78
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,410
Yeah, any questions about where we stand in the semester?

79
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,419
Things like that. Okay. All right.

80
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,310
We're getting there. Yeah, I had a question regarding the ethylene glycol pathogenesis.

81
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:22,280
Okay. So I understand that ethylene glycol gets converted by leading edge and then a LDH ultimately to glycolic acid.

82
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:30,560
But then your schematic shows that glycolic acid goes to apply oxalic acid and then goes to oxalic acid.

83
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,070
But there is no enzymes named there.

84
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,780
Is there an enzymatic reaction occurring? Is that important, though?

85
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:46,720
It's for our purposes, it's not important. I think that is and semantically mediated.

86
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:52,640
I can't recall off the top of my head I'd have to go back to Katherine to look that up for this class.

87
00:09:52,820 --> 00:10:01,160
I didn't have the I didn't pay attention to that part of the schematic because the main thing I want to get at is that first step,

88
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:08,090
because the alcohol dehydrogenase is kind of the main pathway that people inhibit, like when they're countering that toxicity.

89
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,440
And I wanted to include the enzyme that takes it to the aldehyde because the

90
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:18,020
aldehyde is the compound that is thought to have some direct tubular toxicity.

91
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:25,940
And then the things kind of distal to that toxicity comes into play when the oxalic acid combines with calcium and precipitates out.

92
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,010
So I think there are enzymatic mediators for those later reactions.

93
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:35,989
For this class, I wanted to kind of keep it simple, but I don't I actually don't recall specifically.

94
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,590
So you'd have to go back and look at that part of the schematic. Question.

95
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,530
Kim Reynolds, I was going to say. But. All right.

96
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,550
All right. So let us switch our focus to one.

97
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:02,610
I just noticed this morning that the lung structure function lecture that was on your site was kind of the old style compress.

98
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:08,710
It's kind of an older version. So if you downloaded it like yesterday or something, you may want to download it again.

99
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:15,180
It's basically the same thing. It's just formatted a little bit more widely and a little bit better with this version.

100
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:23,969
All right. Let's look at lung structure function. So as we've done before, the first thing we're going to start with,

101
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:29,340
what are the main functions of this organ system, which are pretty easy to recollect for the lung.

102
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,030
So clearly the lung is involved in air conduction.

103
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,240
So we have air airways in the lung that are kind of the highways of bringing air to the gas exchange regions,

104
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,750
but do not have the function of gas exchange themselves.

105
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,250
So those air rays form that function of conduction, but also cleaning.

106
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:57,060
So there are various defense mechanisms in the airways and in the upper respiratory tract for removing particulates and other materials from the lung.

107
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,870
So you want to kind of get rid of that before it gets to the air exchange areas.

108
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:09,480
So it functions of the respiratory tract, air conduction and cleaning and then clearly gas exchange, the exchange of carbon dioxide for oxygen,

109
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:20,490
which provides oxygen as a fuel for aerobic respiration right in the body and also relates to acid base balance in the blood.

110
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,900
So your excreta, you're exhaling CO2.

111
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:33,950
And that also maintains helps maintain a stable in the blood as a portal to the outside.

112
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,340
It's also important and also as a site with a lot of blood flow.

113
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,790
It's also important for the lung to have some detoxifying mechanisms.

114
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:49,590
So there are various cell types that we'll talk about that relate that contain metabolizing enzymes that just as we've learned in other tissues,

115
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:55,080
there are sites of interest that are the higher concentration of metabolizing enzymes.

116
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:03,810
And then in the upper respiratory tract, we're not going to do too much of this today, but we also have an intersection with the olfactory system.

117
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:09,000
So the epithelial cells in the back of the nose are olfactory neurons.

118
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:17,190
So these are of neuro epidermal origin, and these communicate with the brain and give us our sense of smell.

119
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,240
And so there's kind of a junction with the respiratory system and part of the nervous system.

120
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:31,309
This is a diagram of a human lung. Depending on the species, there can be different lobar arrangements of the lung.

121
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:38,060
But for our mammalian species, essentially you're going to have a bi lobed lung with various subdivisions in it.

122
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:46,280
In our rodents, the left lung is primarily one large lobe, and then the right one is still subdivided into three.

123
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:52,160
But essentially the same basic structure and then the trachea branches into the

124
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:56,510
main bronchi and then branches into smaller airways as it enters the lungs.

125
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,310
And we'll look at what all those divisions are. Okay.

126
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:06,320
So this is an overview of the respiratory tract from the site of air entry.

127
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,650
So the first, if you're thinking about the entirety of the respiratory tract, you can think of the nasal passages as the first opening.

128
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:19,040
So the nasal passages serve to serve a function not just sort of trafficking of air.

129
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,030
The main function they serve other than that is air warming.

130
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,110
So air from the outside can be a lot colder, obviously, than body temperature.

131
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:33,920
And so the nasal passages are rich with blood and serve the function of air warming before the air enters the deeper,

132
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,770
more sensitive cells in the lung. And then air cleaning.

133
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:44,890
So nasal hair growth, as it is and certainly as it is, serves a purpose,

134
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,330
part of which is to remove particulates from the inhaled air, to remove bacteria.

135
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,750
There are secretory cells in the lung that are protective to the epithelium.

136
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:01,970
So air warming and cleaning is a major function of the nasal passages.

137
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:11,750
Then leads us into the deeper airway. Once you once you pass through the larynx, into the trachea.

138
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:17,120
So the trick is the main tube leading to the deeper structures of the lung.

139
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:23,540
In humans and in many mammalian species, the trachea has continuous cartilaginous rings around it.

140
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,450
So if you feel your trinkets firm, it's essentially like a firm hose like tube,

141
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:36,700
some sweet and the trachea, I shouldn't say continuous, kind of a C shaped ring.

142
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:42,830
There's a small area that's just muscles, so it does have some elasticity or some contraction from it.

143
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:48,140
Some species, like birds, actually do have a continuous trachea, which just a formed ring.

144
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,720
So there are some interspecies differences.

145
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:59,420
Birds also have really cool structures where the entire trachea kind of loops and that relates to their like a trumpeter.

146
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:09,110
Swan, for example, has a crazy trachea. It's almost like an S shape looping through the base of its neck, so that magnifies its vocal ability.

147
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:19,520
So the trachea and human cells relatively short and relatively simple, and then branches into mainstream bronchi that head to the left and right lung.

148
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,510
And then the tree just gets smaller and smaller diameter.

149
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:33,650
So the first branching of the main stem bronchi are the primary are the primary bronchi cells are larger diameter.

150
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,370
Oops, sorry, primary bronchi. Those are the main stem, larger diameter.

151
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:42,950
And then the secondary bronchi are still large diameter but are branching within the lung,

152
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:51,740
these branch to the tertiary bronchi and that is the end of the portion of the respiratory tract that has cartilage.

153
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:57,680
So in this diagram, the cartilage rings are indicated by some of the yellow, the light yellow.

154
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:06,590
And so the tertiary bronchi which are branching within the lung, still contain cartilage, but it's more intermittent than in the trachea.

155
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:16,850
The trachea has a more of a almost complete ring. The tertiary bronchi have just sort of small segments of cartilage after the tertiary bronchi,

156
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:22,219
the cartilage ends, and you have just respiratory epithelium and some other specialized cells.

157
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,790
And these are the bronchioles for the smaller diameter airways.

158
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:32,479
These are still not areas of gas exchange. So there's still no real gas exchange taking place here.

159
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,160
It's still kind of the highway of the lung,

160
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:41,120
but just dividing into smaller and smaller diameters until you reach the end point of the system, which are the alveoli.

161
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,780
So these are long as we'll see by a very thin epithelium.

162
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:51,080
There's no more goblet cells or anything like that. And this is, of course, where gas exchange takes place.

163
00:17:51,530 --> 00:18:00,680
So these alveoli are imbued with an extensive network of capillaries that's bringing the deoxygenated blood from the heart,

164
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:08,840
conducting gas exchange with the oxygen in the air, and then returning the blood to the heart for spread to the rest of the body.

165
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:16,310
Okay. So we have our airways. The airways are just conducting air and then we have our gas exchange areas.

166
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,150
Okay. So so cellular only. What do these look like?

167
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,430
So here's our diagram again. Let's look at the nasal cavity.

168
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:32,719
So this is a cross-section. I think this one is primate. This is a cross-section through the nasal cavity.

169
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:39,560
So imagine this is a side view of a monkey, the primate cutting at a certain level through the nasal cavity.

170
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:48,320
So you can see that part of the warming function of the ear is facilitated by the sort of convoluted nature of the nasal cavity.

171
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:54,110
So this is the nasal septum. This is a special stain that's stain and cartilage, a light blue.

172
00:18:54,710 --> 00:19:00,140
And then all these complicated, beautiful scrolls, all the pink stuff is the respiratory epithelium.

173
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,490
But rather than being a straight tube, the nasal cavity has different chambers.

174
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:09,470
So there's navel terminates, which are the different chambers of this cavity.

175
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:17,479
And so there's a lot of epithelial surface area, a lot of opportunity for the air to be warmed because as I said,

176
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,590
these are imbued with quite a large blood supply.

177
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:27,500
And in the front portion of the nose, there is actually nasal hairs that remove particulates.

178
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,490
So that's kind of a symmetric cross version through the nasal cavity.

179
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:39,110
And depending on where you make that cross section, there's different epithelium that can be lining the nasal cavities.

180
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:47,000
So looking at the monkey in the very front portion of the nose, the thing that's labeled in black is squamous epithelium.

181
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:56,150
So obviously inside of your nose, skin wise or epithelial wise, is similar to that your regular skin, and that it's covered by squamous epithelium.

182
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:04,580
It's kind of a tough, thick layer. So that's protective because that's the area of the nose that is most at risk to things coming in from the outside.

183
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:11,150
And that's also the area where there's hair. So that's the haired portion of the nose and that's mostly in the front portion.

184
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:15,980
So the stuff that's in black and in a rodent has more of a stretched out nose.

185
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:24,139
That's also squamous epithelium right at the front portion and then in the majority portion of the nasal cavity,

186
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:32,420
the stuff this didn't come out very clearly, this darker thing, but the majority portion of the nasal cavity is the respiratory epithelium.

187
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,990
That's the middle portion or the majority of it, really.

188
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:42,530
And the respiratory epithelium is where we have our ciliated pseudo stratified columnar epithelium.

189
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,420
You know that when we learned our histology, we learned was equivalent was respiratory epithelium.

190
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:54,590
So that's mixed with ciliated cells and goblet cells that's in the middle portion.

191
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:59,660
And in between those with the pope dogs, it's kind of a transitional phase that has some features of both.

192
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:06,920
It's a relatively small portion. So most of the nasal cavity is covered by respiratory epithelium.

193
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:12,769
And then this is hard to see because I don't know why the color shading didn't come out for one of them,

194
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,190
but should show up on the screen a little bit better as it does on the computer here.

195
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,780
But the olfactory epithelium is right up in the back of the nose.

196
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,240
So when the monkey hears the brain and this is bone in between the brain in the nasal cavity,

197
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,970
so there's kind of actually a porous area of bone in the back of your nasal cavity called the crypt reform plate.

198
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:42,620
And right up against the back of that are nasal or olfactory epithelial cells that have axons that actually stretch all the way back to the brain.

199
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:50,600
So those are neuro epithelial cells. And once they are have stimulation from whatever is inhaled,

200
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,580
they're sending signals to the olfactory lobe of the brain, which is the very front portion of the brain.

201
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:00,230
So there's neuro epithelium in the back there. That's the olfactory epithelium.

202
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,899
And in rodents, this is very, very important for them.

203
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:08,540
They have extensive neuro epithelial cells in their olfactory sense, also in the back of the brain.

204
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,690
Okay. So there's that neuro epithelial version.

205
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:21,620
And that is important because some compounds that are neurotoxic or some compounds that there's actually metabolizing cells back there.

206
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,670
And so they can be affected.

207
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:30,890
Some compounds that are neurotoxic, that are inhaled can actually affect their cytotoxic to those epithelial cells in the back of the brain.

208
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:35,360
Some infectious agents as well have tropism for those cells.

209
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:42,830
And so sometimes if you have destruction or loss of anosmia, a loss of sense of smell, those are the cells that are being affected.

210
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:47,510
So that's an important area to examine when you're looking in a toxicology study.

211
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:52,940
So this is there are some those of you in 717 have probably seen similar diagrams.

212
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:59,600
There are some standardized histologic sections that are taken of nasal cavity in rodents.

213
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:05,360
And the three sections are intended to represent those sort of three areas of epithelium.

214
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:11,330
So this you don't necessarily have to know, just know that from front to back.

215
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:17,000
There's a difference in the type of epithelium, but you can see that the nasal cavity looks a little bit different.

216
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:22,370
Depending at what level U.S. it is a level one is intended to look at squamous epithelium,

217
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:27,500
a little bit of transitional level two has the majority of trends of respiratory epithelium,

218
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:35,000
and level three has respiratory epithelium, but also olfactory epithelium, which is way up in the top.

219
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:40,070
So as three sections can be very differently affected by toxicants.

220
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:48,010
Which my time. Okay. So that's the nasal cavity looking at the trachea.

221
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,980
So it's the first of our major conducting airways.

222
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:59,120
So again, this is a special stain that stains cartilage blue and the rest of the epithelium kind of a pinkish color.

223
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:07,490
So this is showing you that almost continuous but not quite cartilaginous ring of the primate trachea.

224
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:15,390
So the blue is cartilage and then there's a section of the trachea, this muscle that allows us to have a little bit of give.

225
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,110
So if you were that kind of compressed this, there would be some give through this portion with the trachea.

226
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,480
And then there's so trachea, this muscle is sort of heading this way.

227
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:30,319
And then there are also longitudinal muscle segments heading towards us.

228
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,680
So those are appearing in cross section on the outer portion.

229
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,919
And then it's kind of to high back to low magnification here to see the epithelium.

230
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,870
But you could see there are folds of epithelium of the inner portion and this is what that looks like.

231
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,860
So the tracheal lining. So in this picture, this is zoomed in to the epithelium.

232
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:55,360
You can't really even see the cartilage. The cartilage is down below this image.

233
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,920
So this is a higher magnification. So there's our respiratory epithelium.

234
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:06,980
You can see the little cilia sticking up. This is our pseudo stratified ciliated columnar epithelium.

235
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:15,050
And interspersed with those pseudo stratified cells are also goblet cells, which are not shown very well in this particular image.

236
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:20,720
But in the diagram on the lower right, the yellow cells are goblet cells.

237
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,560
So those are secreting mucus that coats the trachea itself.

238
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:30,230
And then we have some supporting connective tissue, which is the lamina propria.

239
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,030
So just like in many other tissues, the epithelium is supported by a connective tissue stroma.

240
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:38,510
And this is also the area where most of the vasculature comes in.

241
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:45,260
So the respiratory tract is richly imbued with vasculature. And you can see that in the many profiles of blood vessels here.

242
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:53,300
And then there are also some mucosal glands which provide some additional secretions and then some fibrous connective tissue,

243
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:58,580
which has a lot of elasticity in it because epithelium and that connective tissue supports.

244
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:05,860
So the main two cells there are the pseudo stratified ciliated columnar epithelium and the goblet cells.

245
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:12,160
So those are all none of those are gas exchange cells right now moving forward

246
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:17,319
into the kind of further the more distal aspects of the conducting airways,

247
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:24,040
we have our bronchi, the larger components, and then those change eventually into bronchioles.

248
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,470
So this is a primary bronchus which looks very, very much like what we just saw for the trachea.

249
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:38,410
And the only real difference here is that there is a decrease in those glands, those mucosa glands.

250
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:41,690
So they're starting to drop off as we get a little bit deeper into the lung.

251
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:44,800
There are still some glands present that have a little bit different character.

252
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:48,670
And the other difference is that the cartilage is becoming intermittent.

253
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:55,780
So again, that image, there's a little bit cartilage with the see at the very bottom image is a little bit too zoomed in to see the cartilage,

254
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,290
but know that in the bronchioles, the cartilage is becoming intermittent.

255
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:04,750
So that is basically the composition of the bronchi.

256
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,680
So very similar to the trachea in terms of the two major cell types.

257
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:15,700
And now the bronchioles, which are the finer divisions of the conducting airway system,

258
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,080
have a bit of a difference or a change in terms of their cell type.

259
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:25,810
So they still have ciliated stratified, calm ourselves, but the goblet cells have dropped off.

260
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,190
So we don't have goblet cells here anymore in normal conditions.

261
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:34,600
And that's actually important because these are much smaller diameter airways.

262
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:40,180
We don't actually want to have a lot and they have no cartilage supporting them, so they're more collapsible.

263
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:46,090
We don't want a lot of mucus here because, one, it's more likely to sort of fill that airway with mucus.

264
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:51,549
And we don't have the ability to dilate or they don't have as much elasticity.

265
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:57,040
So there's higher chance that if you have something viscous and narrow, like a lot of mucus, it's going to be obstructed.

266
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:02,770
So there are almost no goblet cells in the bronchial, but a new cell type kind of appears.

267
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,390
These are actually present in lower levels, very lower levels of the bronchi.

268
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:11,800
But in the bronchioles, it's the major site for clearer cells.

269
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:19,000
They have various different means club cells you might see them referred to as or tend to be more technical, bronchial or exocrine cells.

270
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:23,319
So there are Clara cells present here over image.

271
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:30,400
But those so Clara cells predominantly existing in the bronchioles have some very important functions.

272
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:39,130
One major function is that they are the major cell type that have the highest concentration of p450 enzymes.

273
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:45,340
So they're not the only cell type, but they're the highest concentration of phase one metabolizing enzymes.

274
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:53,350
They also have some other protective enzymes like lysozyme, so that they can secrete that dissolved materials that enter the deeper airway.

275
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:58,690
So they're very enzymatic, the active, and they also act as the stem cells.

276
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,770
So the tissue stem cells for the ciliated, respiratory epithelium.

277
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:09,160
So up in the upper right corner, you'll see the normal ciliated respiratory epithelial cells.

278
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:17,590
And then the Clara cells tend to predominate in the bronchioles. So they get more and more frequent as you go distally in the bronchial tree and

279
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:22,300
they have an enzymatic function for metabolism and also function as stem cells.

280
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,959
So if there's injury to the ciliated epithelium one finding that you might see as an increase

281
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,490
in the Clara cell number as those cells proliferate to try to replace that epithelium.

282
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:40,830
Carousels. So the bronchioles I told you get smaller and smaller.

283
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:47,100
And the last of the sort of true bronchioles in primates are the terminal and the respiratory bronchioles.

284
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,169
So the terminal bronchioles,

285
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:55,560
essentially what we are essentially what we just talked about as far as having Clara cells and ciliated respiratory epithelium

286
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:03,479
and in primates these give a what sets the T in the diagram to your right these give way to respiratory bronchioles,

287
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:10,740
which are sort of an intermediary stage between the air exchange regions and the airways.

288
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:18,510
So respiratory bronchioles the are here rather than having just continuous respiratory

289
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:22,620
epithelium there are little areas of respiratory epithelium and then you'll get like

290
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:28,979
an old cialis just sticking off to the edge and the alveoli get more and more frequent

291
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:33,510
as you move towards the alveolar duct and the respiratory epithelium drops off.

292
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,660
So in the respiratory epithelium part,

293
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:43,980
you'll have intermittent areas of respiratory epithelium and underneath the red stuff I nose is pretty low man is smooth muscle.

294
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:48,600
So a little nodules nodule a space, a nodule, a space.

295
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,620
And the nodules are respiratory epithelium covering smooth muscle.

296
00:30:53,970 --> 00:31:01,770
Okay. And as you go deeper, this rest, this kind of intermittent structure gives way to an alveolar duct.

297
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:09,120
So like here in the respiratory epithelium, respiratory bronchial, here's some alveoli, just kind of interrupting it.

298
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,340
And here are those little nodules. It's kind of intermittent.

299
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:19,170
And then in the alveolar duct, you have a sort of short tube that has alveoli coming directly off of the ducts.

300
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:26,610
And that finally gives way to the alveolar sacs, which are the end point, which is just a grape like cluster of alveoli.

301
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,090
It's it's kind of the blind end of this whole tubular system.

302
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:38,910
So it goes terminal, bronchial, respiratory, bronchial, which is kind of intermittent transition between the two alveolar ducts and alveolar stacks.

303
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:47,650
So gas. So that brings us to the gas exchange areas, the alveoli themselves.

304
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:52,480
So these have to be very thin because this is now where we're going to have actual gas exchange.

305
00:31:53,620 --> 00:32:00,980
Whereas in the bronchioles we had respiratory epithelium and we had Clara cells in the alveolar wall.

306
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:08,740
We have three main cell types. So two of these are epithelial cells and one is one of our innate immune cells just kind of hanging out.

307
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:18,040
So looking at the rest of the epithelial cell types, first, the main cell type in terms of surface area are the type one tumor sites.

308
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:24,100
So these are flat squamous epithelial cells, but not stratified squamous epithelium.

309
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:31,600
It's just really flat cells, just like line or endothelium because they have to allow gas to exchange.

310
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,670
So when the diagram to the far right, the thing at the bottom that says P one,

311
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:43,480
that is a type one Newman site, the terminally differentiated flat squamous cell.

312
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,470
And it's hard to see in this diagram,

313
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:56,170
but right next to so this is the alveolar lining and then it's like a little space here that's actually a capillary.

314
00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:00,099
So this is like with a weird stain. So it should be red in normal stains.

315
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:08,440
But these are red cells percolating through this capillary and our capillaries, as you remember before, line by endothelial cells.

316
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:11,960
So here's an endothelial nucleus, here's that capillary.

317
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,770
So my finger is following along with the red cells go, let's use.

318
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:20,229
A lot of times you don't see very many nuclei because these are really stretched out cells.

319
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:24,640
So a lot of the surface there is just their cytoplasm. So here's an endothelial nucleus.

320
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:29,950
And then on this side, we have the alveolar cells, type one tumor sites.

321
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:38,410
Okay. And then in addition to type one human sites, we have type tumor sites which have a more rounded appearance.

322
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:43,330
Here's one. Almost looks like a macrophage, but it's just sticking in between those type one tumor sites.

323
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:55,570
These cells are actually more numerous than the type one cells, but they have a smaller surface area because they're compact.

324
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:59,920
So there is one there as well. Just little rounded cells sticking up every which way.

325
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:07,030
And they have two jobs. One is that they serve as the stem cells, the tissue stem cells for the type one tumor sites.

326
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:10,599
So if we have destruction and these are terminally differentiated,

327
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:16,240
if we have destruction of these type one tumor sites, it gets in there, it's caustic or toxic or whatever.

328
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,229
The type tune in, the sites are going to have to enter the cell cycle,

329
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:24,760
divide and proliferate and then eventually differentiate to form a flattened cell.

330
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:29,290
So these are our tissues, stem cells for lung, for alveolar epithelium.

331
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:34,330
And then their other job, very important, is to make surfactant.

332
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:45,400
So surfactant, as you may recall, is a substance that is secreted in the lung and actually coats the alveoli and it actually reduces surface tension.

333
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:50,950
This is a really small diameter chamber. So if it were to collapse in on itself,

334
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:59,229
there's actually a lot of surface tension about all of this closed and having surfactant present dissipates that surface tension.

335
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:05,740
So it allows the alveoli to open up. Okay. So like premature infants, for example,

336
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:13,090
one of the last things to mature in the lungs in gestation is production of surfactant for these type two tumor sites.

337
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,530
So one real problem for premature infants is they don't have surfactant.

338
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:23,800
So being able to take that first deep breath to inflate those alveoli is very, very difficult.

339
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:31,600
So one of the treatments of premature infants is to give them actually surfactant, to allow that portion of the lung to expand.

340
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:39,850
So those type two tumor sites are the source for surfactant. This is this diagram is just trying to show you.

341
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:50,530
It's not that great a diagram. I included it trying to show you the thinness of the wall of the alveolar epithelium and kind of its juxtaposition.

342
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:59,530
It's in viewed by all these capillaries, the third cell type that is present are the innate immune cells that are present on site,

343
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:05,439
and those are pulmonary macrophages and they have a couple of different subtypes in the lung actually.

344
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,599
But one really common one that you'll see when there's an issue, again, this is washed out on the screen,

345
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:16,030
but these alveoli are actually filled with pink pernicious material and these are very foamy.

346
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,240
They're very evacuated, foamy pulmonary macrophages.

347
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,290
So they're phagocytosis, fluid that has gotten into these alveoli.

348
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:27,370
So these are pulmonary macrophages that have a phagocytic function.

349
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:33,520
Anything that gets into that deeper portion of the lung that doesn't belong in that airspace, they're going to try to remove.

350
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:42,760
So there's a better electron transmission, electron micrograph of the alveolar wall showing you the airspace.

351
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:51,339
And then that p one type, one tumor site all stretched out and then the endothelial cell of the other side.

352
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,450
So this is the blood vessel,

353
00:36:52,450 --> 00:37:00,400
one cell and these two cell types being epithelial have to have a basement membrane and they actually have a shared basement membrane.

354
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:05,410
So there's a relatively thin division between them.

355
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:10,150
The basement membrane is not continuous. It's intermittently fuzed.

356
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:17,709
And ordinarily this is so tight that in light microscopy you have a hard time distinguishing between these two cell types.

357
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:23,050
It just looks like one layer, but truly by electron microscopy, it's actually kind of a sandwich,

358
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:26,670
two layers of the basement membrane in between it and one of the.

359
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:33,920
Even though there is no interstitial space here, one of the things that can happen if there's inflammation in the lung, so there's inflammation.

360
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:40,599
Here's a blood vessel. The inflammatory cells are going to enter either from larger diameter vessels or they can actually

361
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:47,770
slip across through these endothelial cells and you'll have a thickening of these alveolar walls.

362
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:55,240
So if that becomes thick and now instead of seeing the alveoli, just as those thin outlines, we'll start to see a thickening of the interstitial.

363
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:59,140
So that can be a sign histologically that there's inflammation in the lung.

364
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:07,209
And as you can imagine, if you thicken that space, that's going to decrease the diffusion ability of gas exchange.

365
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:13,660
So that's a has a pathologic effect because it's going to diminish the efficiency of gas exchange.

366
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:24,340
Here is a cartoon of macrophages. I told you there are many subtypes, so pulmonary macrophages actually are cool.

367
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:32,020
They actually crawl around on the inside, all that kind of thing all around on the inside of the alveolar space.

368
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,310
And you'll occasionally see them just kind of floating within the alveolar itself.

369
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,879
And ordinarily you'll see a few, a few of these.

370
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:45,370
So it's normal to see a couple of these alveolar macrophages just kind of crawling around waiting for something to do.

371
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,980
But if there's a larger number of them, that's a sign that there's an inflammatory stimulus.

372
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:58,930
And then there are also alveolar macrophages that do sort of squeeze themselves between this little interstitial space.

373
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,780
But again, ordinarily, there should be very few of those.

374
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:08,230
So you're not going to see that thickening or that true division between that wall of the alveolar and the wall, the blood vessel.

375
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:14,080
And then finally, of course, we have intravascular macrophages.

376
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:17,500
So those are derived from monocytes which are white blood cells.

377
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,609
So they come via the blood and then once they get to tissue,

378
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:28,810
can differentiate into macrophages and squeeze out of the endothelial cell and infiltrate the tissue.

379
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:36,640
So it's kind of the alveolar macrophages are kind of the troops on the ground take care of things that might arise in ordinary state.

380
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:42,549
But if there's an inflammatory stimulus, there's going to be cytokine stimulus, just like we heard before.

381
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:50,320
And monocytes are going to be stimulated to kind of come to this area, infiltrate and sort of reinforce the macrophages that are already there.

382
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:57,340
Okay. So those are macrophages. Let's look a little bit at pulmonary blood supply.

383
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:04,150
So the pulmonary blood supply or the function really of the lungs obviously is to oxygenate the blood.

384
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:13,660
So it's going to receive blood from the heart. That's deoxygenated and the pathway is that deoxygenated blood from the body.

385
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:19,420
So you have all the blood that's draining the tissues and organs collects in the vena cava.

386
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:27,550
So there's a cranial and caudal vena cava, both of which feed into the right atrium of the heart.

387
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:32,110
That's deoxygenated blood from the body coming to the right atrium of the heart.

388
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:37,209
And then from the right atrium of the heart, it's going to go into the right ventricle,

389
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:42,040
which is sort of the staging area that's going to pump it to another area, another organ.

390
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:52,470
So it's the still deoxygenated blood. The deoxygenated blood leaves the right ventricle and enters the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary loops,

391
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:56,079
the pulmonary artery branches to go to each of the lungs.

392
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:04,809
So there's a right and a left pulmonary artery. So usually we think of arteries, artery away, artery leading away from the heart.

393
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:12,400
And this certainly does lead away from the heart, but this is the only artery in the body that carries deoxygenated blood.

394
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:21,280
Okay. So that right side of the heart basically functions to pump blood to the lung, which is its neighbor right in the thoracic cavity.

395
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:23,140
So the right side of the lung,

396
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:30,340
typically the muscle along the ventricle is thinner because you don't need as much muscular strength to pump blood to the adjacent lung.

397
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,380
So it's a little bit thinner wall.

398
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:41,260
So then the blood goes through the pulmonary artery to the lungs themselves, where it enters the lung and becomes oxygenated.

399
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:49,570
So I'll show you a finer diagram of that in a minute. But then the oxygenated blood from the lungs leaves the lungs through the pulmonary veins.

400
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:55,780
So there's a right and left main pulmonary vein that parallels the pulmonary artery but heads back to the heart.

401
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:01,360
Okay. And then my blood is entering the heart. It always enters the atrium first.

402
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:08,620
So this is going to go to the left atrium and then from the left atrium to the left ventricle.

403
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:18,250
So that's the main staging area. And the left ventricle has a much thicker wall because its job is to pump blood into the aorta.

404
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:21,489
And then from the in the aorta, it spreads it to the entire body.

405
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:29,080
So you need to have a higher pressure in that system. That's the pulmonary blood supply, oxygen getting from deoxygenated,

406
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:35,500
blood getting from the heart to the lungs and then back to the left side of the heart to go to the body.

407
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:42,639
So we don't really cover cardiovascular system, unfortunately, in this session of the course,

408
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:48,670
but just fly the aorta is the main supply of oxygenated blood to the entire body.

409
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:54,580
So various arteries branch off of the aorta, you know, arteries, iliac artery, all kinds of arteries.

410
00:42:54,910 --> 00:43:00,489
The heart itself needs blood too. So very, very close to the origin of the aorta.

411
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:02,290
We actually have not shown this diagram,

412
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:10,210
but we have tiny branches that come off the aorta close to its origin and then go right back to the heart and infiltrate the wall of the heart.

413
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:17,440
And those are the coronary arteries. So they are the oxygen supply of blood to the heart.

414
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:23,740
So this makes this system I just showed you is the substrate blood for the heart, the function pumping blood to the body.

415
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:27,460
And then its own oxygen supply is via the coronary arteries.

416
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:34,870
Okay. The bronchial artery also branches from the aorta very, very close to its origin.

417
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:38,470
And that supply, that's the oxygen supply for the lung.

418
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:45,130
Okay. So this is substrate blood for the lung heart. And then oxygenated blood comes from both branches of the aorta.

419
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:50,530
This is what it looks like when the substrate blood gets to the heart.

420
00:43:52,090 --> 00:44:04,030
I guess I did bronchial artery first. The bronchial artery that I just talked about from the aorta follows the line of the airways very, very closely.

421
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:09,759
So it's the blood supply. If you're looking at a cross section of the airway, there's usually an artery branching close to that.

422
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:19,420
That's the bronchial artery, which is oxygen rich blood that branches within the heart to within the lung to supply oxygen.

423
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:27,100
The pulmonary artery is also near. It follows the airway, maybe a little bit separate, a little farther away.

424
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:34,060
And that's the oxygen cord blood, which goes all the way down to the capillaries surrounding those alveoli.

425
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:38,020
So it's oxygen, poor blood at that point and within the capillaries.

426
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,900
So all of those capillaries have both red and blue coloring.

427
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:50,770
That's where the blood becomes oxygenated and then it pools into the pulmonary veins, which head back to the heart for the sequence we just discussed.

428
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:54,280
And then those are pulmonary capillaries for gas exchange.

429
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:02,270
Okay. So that's blood supply to the heart as far as pulmonary protection.

430
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:08,360
We have a number of detoxifying enzymes that have different content and different cell types.

431
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:15,680
So I told you that the Clara cells were the main cell type that contains phase one detoxifying enzymes.

432
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:20,930
They're not the only cell type that contains them, but they have a much higher concentration than other cells.

433
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:25,940
So Clara, cells are the most important cells in terms of phase one detoxifying enzymes.

434
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:33,980
And as a result they are also often the most vulnerable to toxicity from compounds that require phase one metabolism.

435
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:45,200
Here are some other detoxifying enzymes which are conjugating enzymes, and then there's an overview chart for where some of these are found.

436
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:50,170
The main thing I want you to remember so again, it's not just one cell type.

437
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:54,379
The main thing I want you to remember for this class is that Clara cells are in their highest

438
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:59,200
concentration in the bronchioles and they are also the cells that are at the highest level,

439
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:01,250
phase one metabolizing enzymes.

440
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:08,720
So they are going to be the most vulnerable cell type when it comes to materials that need to be functionalized for toxicity.

441
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,020
Arianna, I'm sorry, did you have a question? Yeah, just a quick one.

442
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:19,980
In all of this, like are the bronchioles and the whole lung structure enclosed in any sort of like, membrane or anything?

443
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,910
Or is it just if you looked at the lung in a real animal or person, it would just be a bunch of branches?

444
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:31,730
Or would you see like anything surrounding in the lung itself or.

445
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:36,560
So there is the so the the thorax itself.

446
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:44,550
There's a lining on the inside of the thorax that doubles over and then covers the inside of the organs as well.

447
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:47,630
So you can kind of think of the heart and the lung. If I had a balloon.

448
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:55,820
I don't know. Like if the entire saw outer part of the thorax was a balloon, I actually can sort of punch the heart and the lung into the balloon.

449
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:03,020
So the pericardium, for example, the pericardium is continuous with the outer lining of the thorax.

450
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:07,129
Pericardium is a sac that surrounds the heart, that contains a little bit of fluid.

451
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:09,290
So when the heart beats, it decreases friction.

452
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:16,340
And that is actually if you follow the pericardium up, it's a membrane that doubles over and hits the outside of the thorax,

453
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:21,590
and then that imbues at least a portion of the upper part of the lung itself.

454
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:26,180
And then the outer portion of the lung is actually covered by mesothelioma cells.

455
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,600
So they're kind of a specialized covering cell.

456
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:38,629
So, I mean, you'll see like the trachea and you'll see the main stem bronchi and then I guess you'll see the lung itself,

457
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:46,190
which looks just like a discrete organ is. I guess the reason it doesn't look like tiny little nodules is because of that mesothelioma covering.

458
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,729
Okay. Yeah, it's a second, you know.

459
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:56,420
Yeah. Okay. All right, let's do the particle clearance part and then maybe take a break.

460
00:47:56,630 --> 00:48:00,590
Okay, so that got us all the way to the airways. We talked about blood supply.

461
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:08,360
We talked about toxic detoxifying enzymes. So particle clearance, a very important part, obviously, of toxicology in the lung.

462
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,630
So there's a couple areas where this can take place.

463
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:19,720
So first, we have trapping in the nose and some of this can happen just by impaction upon the hair.

464
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:26,870
The hair is in the front portion of the nose, but also especially in a human because of a structure like the kind of straight passageway of our nose.

465
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:35,660
Some larger diameter particles actually impact onto the olfactory epithelium can be good and bad because it's not going to go deeper in the lung.

466
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:39,680
But if it's something that's toxic to the olfactory epithelium, that can be an issue.

467
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:45,440
And there are some substances that can actually get to the brain via the olfactory epithelium,

468
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:51,200
because, remember, those are vaccines that go directly to the brain. So trapping in the nose is one source of particle clearance.

469
00:48:52,220 --> 00:49:00,650
Then when we have particles in the trachea, the trachea has a lining of goblet cells in that ciliated respiratory epithelium that I told you about.

470
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:10,580
So we have what's called the mucus ciliary escalator because all those cilia are actually beating anteriorly up towards the oral cavity.

471
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:18,560
So you have a layer of mucus and a parts and particles, sediment here on the outside of the trachea,

472
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:24,170
the the cilia are beating towards the throat and the goblet cell,

473
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:29,030
like all the cells, secretions actually carry them back up to the oral cavity where they can be swallowed.

474
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:37,550
So a significant portion of inhaled particulate material is actually eliminated through the GI tract.

475
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:44,810
So it's kind of a little recognized portion of like respiratory toxicology in that actually a larger amount of particulate

476
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:51,680
material gets eliminated through the GI than through the respiratory tract because of that mucosal area escalator.

477
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:55,549
Let's see if this one is going to work. One of my students gave me this a couple of years back.

478
00:49:55,550 --> 00:50:02,970
So this. Creation of a little unlucky bacteria. Oh, no, no, it isn't present.

479
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:14,180
So it's trying to illustrate that those trachea are beating up towards the oral cavity and then it gets either coughed up or is covered up,

480
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:17,240
but a significant portion gets eliminated through the GI.

481
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:25,040
And so you can imagine if you lose that apparatus, if there's destruction of that solid cell and you no longer have that goblet cell mechanism.

482
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:34,400
So like when we have sort of a chronic smoker's respiratory tract where the epithelium undergoes metabolism and changes to squamous epithelium,

483
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:42,200
that's a major risk for getting particulates inhaled deeper into the lung because you've lost that protective mechanism.

484
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:50,059
So that's the mucosal area escalator. And as we talked about, that can lead to particulates getting swallowed through the GI tract.

485
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,970
So that's another mechanism of removal from the respiratory tract.

486
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:59,130
And then finally, some finer diameter particles can actually make it all the way into the lung itself.

487
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:05,570
And there we have our friendly, helpful alveolar macrophages that function to phagocytosis, those particles.

488
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:14,000
And though the macrophages can actually remove them to the blood, or sometimes macrophages can actually accumulate.

489
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:22,310
And so with chronic toxicities, you'll actually see particle laden macrophages around the airways of the lung,

490
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:29,990
which, you know, it's not great to have a lot of macrophages, and if they get too full, they can kind of induce a low level chronic inflammation,

491
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:35,180
but they actually have a significant capacity sort of serve as a sink for particulate matter.

492
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:39,140
So that is a protective matter mechanism for the sensitive areas of the lung.

493
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,640
So those are some mechanisms of particle clearance and as I said,

494
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:53,210
by absorption but via macrophages in the disproportionate the lung or just by direct absorption blood is also a final mechanism for clearance.

495
00:51:54,380 --> 00:52:01,850
And this is just a diagram that where particles enter, the one under most conditions relates to their size.

496
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:08,780
So larger particles, as we talked about, they get inhaled into the nose can lead to sedimentation or impact.

497
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:17,840
Impaction remain in the upper portions of the respiratory tract so larger diameter particles are more of a risk for the upper respiratory tract.

498
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:24,540
Smaller diameter diameter particles will start to sediment out in the bronchioles and the heart,

499
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:28,640
the higher diameter, bronchial bronchi and bronchioles in the lung.

500
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:33,950
So the kind of medium diameter particles in the upper portions of the lung,

501
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:41,840
and then really fine diameter particles by Brownian motion can just waft their way into the smaller diameter chambers of the lung.

502
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,280
So smaller, finer particles are more of a risk for the deeper portions of the lung.

503
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:50,540
In a broad sense, coarse particles of the upper portions of the lung.

504
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:55,910
Really fine particles don't like nano particulate material or just ultrafine particles

505
00:52:56,180 --> 00:53:01,340
actually impact this portion as well because they're just moving by Brownian motion.

506
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,700
So yes, some of them can get all the way in with the air stream,

507
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:11,510
but a significant number of those actually just kind of waft around in the nasal cavity and end up at that olfactory epithelium.

508
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:19,580
So for like nanoparticle toxicity, a lot of people are very concerned about that olfactory epithelium and that also can be a route to the brain.

509
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,220
So will the caveat, I guess, I would put is that those fine particles also can impact the upper airway.

510
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:29,030
Yes, something like that. They would cross the blood brain barrier.

511
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:35,930
It depends on the nature of the material. So some materials, yes, there actually are using fluorescent nanoparticles,

512
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:40,010
studies that can demonstrate in rodents that some of those materials can get into the brain.

513
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:47,240
But nanoparticle toxicity is highly dependent on things like like sometimes when you put a nanoparticle in the body,

514
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:51,320
it no longer becomes nano because it precipitates out and agglomerate.

515
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:58,850
So now all of a sudden you're doing sort of not ultrafine, but fine particulate toxicology and certain nanoparticles.

516
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:02,300
Substances can be more or less inflammatory inducing than others.

517
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:07,640
So a lot of nanoparticle toxicity depends on what happens in the environment of the body and what it can do.

518
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:15,080
All right. I think we'll take the slide. It was supposed to be inside, but it's just kind of a more detailed version of what we just showed you.

519
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,620
But we'll take a little break there and then we'll start with some pathology.

520
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:28,380
So let's take a five minute break. Do you have pictures?

521
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:39,830
You know what? Out of control.

522
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:45,290
Yeah, it's here. You know, I got one of those up there.

523
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:50,250
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

524
00:54:50,600 --> 00:55:02,000
Education in the town. Just like when you're out there, like a lot of people have lost their.

525
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:22,320
I realized that, yes, I was pregnant.

526
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:33,720
I mean, like I said, I hope I did. Yeah, I agree with, you know, that regard.

527
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:56,610
Our framework for that resource in the insurance market and those are some other things.

528
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:05,500
Yeah. So yeah, that's a real nice yeah, that's a really nice idea.

529
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:15,050
But since there was a P5 contamination free zone recently discovered in that decade, we'll see that going forward.

530
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:29,680
It is a place where there's a lot of demand, which is some room when we're to live up to design.

531
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:38,040
And as I mentioned earlier, we can't I guess is not going to change.

532
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:46,290
It's not decided. I'm going to wait three or four days a week.

533
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:53,750
Yeah. You know, the last one.

534
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:57,960
I mean, I don't know.

535
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:07,500
You know, I think it was one degree, you know yeah.

536
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:19,280
Sometimes even doing some of those others but you actually that this.

537
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:31,160
I'll never forget. It's a very very hard.

538
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:45,980
Don't be scared of the limitations of like to reach out to go you through it.

539
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:51,620
And that's all I say for sure.

540
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:59,470
I mean, I should be your Anderson Cooper when there are some, you know.

541
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:06,320
Yeah. You know, people like you, Jersey, you know,

542
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:16,320
back in the 1980s responsible for you really months it earlier it was supposed to be yesterday it was three or 5 hours.

543
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:23,770
So we don't really know. Yeah.

544
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:45,900
This is the process that I know them always, you know, like I was helping my parents and financially, or at least not like, you know,

545
00:58:46,400 --> 00:59:00,979
if I'm so nervous about going to the latest news or having to learn about things like attendance,

546
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:05,780
anyone needs to send a picture of a animal, but they're always in the shape of a penis.

547
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:13,520
And I think that they were actually good because I feel like I have grown a lot of my neighborhood around.

548
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:24,140
Yeah, I think it was.

549
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:34,099
It was like something. This is the way he's crazy.

550
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:38,360
He's like, he lives around, like, 30 miles an hour.

551
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:48,270
He's, like, going to say that he was fortunate or didn't even realize it, even though there was this time he was.

552
00:59:49,580 --> 01:00:02,120
I think that is really nice and that is all that this is like.

553
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:10,910
I think they like them. So as we go towards a new place,

554
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:20,060
it was like he works at an engineering firm Hobbs that ups say they're therapy supplier for transmissions too to

555
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:27,620
he works on his ground after school year after year that's why my girlfriend he works on some brand new Chrysler.

556
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:36,410
Yeah. And his car you know number one the grand something grand, I don't know.

557
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:40,670
But yeah, he's working on the fly to where we are.

558
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:45,379
Yes, it is. It isn't.

559
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:52,140
No, no. He just finished up. They just finished up the case and they're putting it on to like and sale next year.

560
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:53,780
Just like, wow,

561
01:00:53,780 --> 01:01:15,919
it's just like $90,000 driving around the country to declare a state that they can really make him part of the transition for him like they need to.

562
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,960
He does like that song, like driving around for 70 hours.

563
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:27,620
I'm like my dad. Really interesting thing.

564
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:42,460
So I started this family and so he says, You can't plan that.

565
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:49,940
So yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.

566
01:01:54,840 --> 01:02:07,230
And. You have to really like what he does, things he doesn't want to be like an engineer.

567
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:15,510
Like that's like that's kind of the position. Do you guys think about the job and me?

568
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:20,820
And I'm like, Why would I go ahead with that?

569
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:26,680
Well, like, yeah, I've said before, even.

570
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:36,620
30 minutes. And I was by his side, his entire economy.

571
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:43,860
Senator. Not a word of anything. They went to the pub and there were tears.

572
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:50,640
And thank you for all the feedback. Make sure you at some point, I trust.

573
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:54,000
I have no idea. It's great.

574
01:02:54,820 --> 01:03:06,510
It's okay. I mean, I did it once. I did it once. Yeah, but I waited to do my second submission because, you know, it was just miraculous.

575
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,130
But, yeah, I guess I just wanted.

576
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:22,260
Okay, now I know what the answer is, but I guess overall and again, it was my specific, I think everything related to this one.

577
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:30,480
A lot of people are questions about it. And part of it is because I went to high school on lower magnification and like scroll down on this again.

578
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:40,550
So a lot of people thought this was in the dorm. And so part of this is that this is a cow kidney be is turning around and this is a little cortex.

579
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:44,370
This is the junction kind of of the cortex in the medulla.

580
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:49,820
And then this is actually who I am like, but how can you just it's kind of weird.

581
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:59,190
So when I was trying to get I like trying to get people to go back to the lecture, we talked about the distribution of this stuff, even my cortex.

582
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:04,380
Okay. And then because if I just show you these gaps, it's hard to imagine you can't recognize where this is.

583
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:11,850
So I included this little thing, which is a distant tubules, because I try to like, Oh, look, wasn't that great?

584
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:17,130
But it's so damaged. I would have been better off if I had, like, a medium sized version.

585
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:21,899
This is so damaged, this is hard to recognize. This is the distal tubule.

586
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:28,440
And then some people get visited by this. Like there's like a little low level kind of background.

587
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:34,259
I mean, it's not really inflammation is it's kind of like innate immune cells that are there.

588
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:38,489
Ordinarily, it tends to be more in a cow. This is like a real slides.

589
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:46,320
It's not really conflict. Right. But I taught you guys so very specifically that for a lot of people and a lot of people would on it because of this.

590
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:53,280
Yeah. Well, what I was trying to get at is I probably should have chosen this was trying to show you that this is the cortex.

591
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:56,550
These are some to build on. They're both the same whole structure. Correct.

592
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:01,590
Okay. And then this I didn't even I didn't even see it because I'm so used to seeing it out of the background.

593
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:04,720
And then I was like, Yeah, I probably won't see.

594
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,390
But what happens here?

595
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:13,670
I was trying to get people to go back to the lecture about just the pathogenesis I talked about, like this was Krystal Yes, yes.

596
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:17,940
I recognize partial structure that caused a lot of things.

597
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:21,390
All of those are black. Why? Why is that? Why was it close the.

598
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,469
Well, because it's an epithelial origin structure.

599
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:33,510
And so imagine a place like if I have back pressure, I'm going to have increased pressure in terms of above the obstruction.

600
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:40,140
Yeah, right. And even if I have a metal structure, revival style structure,

601
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:47,969
it's kind of like feeling like a rubber gloves pattern and I pinch off one of the fingers above the finger.

602
01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:54,270
It's going to go like, Yeah, okay. And so that flattens the epithelium and so acutely they just have dilation.

603
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:59,070
And the other feature here that perhaps didn't come across as well or this kidney,

604
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:05,280
all the tubules were like in the same stage in like all of them look like this.

605
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:13,770
They were all like acutely black. Okay. So this was a very acute one time event as opposed to if this were going on over multiple times,

606
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:18,890
you'd have some tubules dilated, some tubules regenerated, some revealed very fluid.

607
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:22,210
So that uniformity is another way to develop, you know? Yeah.

608
01:06:22,290 --> 01:06:28,160
Okay. For a single event. Yeah, yeah. Okay. As a model, physical lesion versus surgery.

609
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:36,360
Okay. So basically for this, I wanted you guys to kind of I was thinking people would go back to the class because we taught this is an acute lesion,

610
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:40,649
but people were smarter than that and they tried to figure it out just from the image.

611
01:06:40,650 --> 01:06:45,690
And then I realized that in me trying to include these two little things like, you know,

612
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:49,560
it couldn't be restrained just because you have a limited sort of library to choose from.

613
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:53,610
Okay. But just so you know, this is the quiz you can do to get your answers.

614
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:57,809
But just so you understand, so this was you have the pathogenesis, right?

615
01:06:57,810 --> 01:07:06,420
This is crystal back, pressure flattening. And then over time that can cause I mean, if that gets alleviated, the tubules can go back to normal.

616
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:14,740
But so I might just one or and then that can cause like inflammation fibrosis and you end up like that second kidney with the retina.

617
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:19,320
So yeah, but that wasn't what we were trying to do here.

618
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:23,850
Okay. Does that make more sense? Yeah, that's. I'm just crossing my fingers.

619
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:34,860
Finger. Finger is that I have enough going on in the short answer because like, obviously you do that a lot.

620
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:41,010
You're doing a lot of work. There is the final decision.

621
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:49,260
Historically, almost everyone does better, a little bit more living on their hands.

622
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:58,550
And I think they're willing to wait for the final results, like put in a specific number to someone to see how, you know, at the end.

623
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:02,040
I usually want to play a player, but I wasn't sure.

624
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:07,670
Like right now we're actually kind of sitting where I sit in front of me.

625
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:11,879
Like, I know this was more than maturity, I think was when I went back period.

626
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:20,330
I think part of it was I just wasn't recognizing like the person, like you're having a problem for me was I want more on this list.

627
01:08:20,490 --> 01:08:27,299
Yeah. And I think that's, you know, that's over time education of like historically my education.

628
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:32,520
It's like, oh, I already feel almost like I've, you know, yeah, this method.

629
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:36,330
But I'll be with you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

630
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:45,380
The main thing is I want to make sure, like with the feedback that they don't make sure think that the.

631
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:50,920
All right. Yeah. I'm not stressed about my master's.

632
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:57,180
Yeah. But I mean, the good thing that I make sure that with the feedback doesn't make sense.

633
01:08:57,390 --> 01:09:00,640
It's not personal property, of course, that you're somebody.

634
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:05,600
If I take away, like, I wouldn't discuss your state of mind.

635
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:12,929
Yeah, you can tell me, like, over a little bit. I think I'm like, okay, yeah.

636
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:19,020
Sorry to hold this turnover. All right, guys, let's go ahead and get started like you just said.

637
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:24,510
Okay. So I'm still in that first lecture.

638
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:28,079
The first lecture has some normal images just to kind of review for us.

639
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:33,960
One. And then at the very end of the first lecture, there's actually some like quick pics of pathology,

640
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:39,389
all of which we're going over in the pathology lecture. So those I'm going to leave for you.

641
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:45,840
So just so you can see what I'm talking about. So I'm going to do, just review quickly the normal structure so we're all on the same page.

642
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:50,430
And then there's a bunch of hidden slides here that are called like Path Pictures or something.

643
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:56,129
Those will be good for you after we do today's pathology lecture to kind of have another image of

644
01:09:56,130 --> 01:10:00,660
the same thing that's kind of reinforcing all the different lesions that we're learning today.

645
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:05,340
I'm not going to go over them specifically in class just for the sake of time,

646
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:09,899
but just know there are those extra slides at the end of the structure function lecture that

647
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:14,040
will provide some more practice for your eye for recognizing the things we talk about.

648
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:19,590
Okay, so let's do this and do this picture time.

649
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:28,350
Always fine. Okay. So normal one. So the lung in its normal stages, essentially it looks like an ear filled honeycomb.

650
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:36,089
So at low magnification, I mean, you can kind of get the sense already that we have lots of little alveolar sacs here.

651
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:40,380
The overall impression that you get at the lungs should be lots of open space, right?

652
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:42,959
This is actually an inflated lung.

653
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:49,020
So when you take the lung out of an animal at necropsy, the whole thing collapses and all these little spaces collapse down.

654
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:57,660
It'll look like a solid tissue. So those of you from 717, remember we infused fixative into the lung to open those airways spaces again.

655
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:03,810
And that's what makes it look like this. If you can imagine this whole thing squish like a sponge so it looks like a sponge.

656
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:07,559
That would be very, very hard to interpret if we didn't do that. So this is long.

657
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:10,560
Normal lung should look like a lot of open space.

658
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:15,180
There are other larger structures, so most of it is the alveolar, alveolar space.

659
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:20,490
These are some larger diameter blood vessels. So the thing with red in it is a blood vessel.

660
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,960
I'd have to zoom in a little bit, but this is probably a pulmonary vein.

661
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:31,500
And then the things that have some more darker, dark purple lining are the airways.

662
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:38,850
So bronchi and bronchioles. Okay, so that's normal lung at low mag here.

663
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:48,450
We're zooming in a little bit to one of those dark spaces. And this is the junction between the primate lung, the junction between a bronchus.

664
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:53,940
So we're looking straight. It's probably a tertiary or bronchus.

665
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:58,080
So here's cartilage, but it's not continuous. There's some cartilage here.

666
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:02,100
There's some more over here, some more over there. It's starting to drop away.

667
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:05,730
That's cartilage. And then that's going to a bronchial.

668
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:08,790
So that has no cartilage now. It's just respiratory epithelium.

669
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:16,320
Okay. And then going further, if you imagine coming further along that bronchial that I just told you,

670
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:21,000
this is the last this is actually terminal bronchial up here.

671
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,690
And then the respiratory bronchioles really more accurately here,

672
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:29,940
you're starting to get drop off of that respiratory epithelium and you'll have little nodules.

673
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:34,860
So sort of smooth muscle and respiratory epithelium, then kind of a pseudo gap.

674
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:39,550
Another one, then a gap. On another one. It just gets less and less as it goes.

675
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:43,719
These kind of blend were the exact transition between them is.

676
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:49,750
But the gist of it is that there is more respiratory at the feeling in the respiratory bronchial and then the alveolar duct.

677
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:56,770
Here's the little nodules of smooth muscle hanging on the alveolar doctors where you're starting to get alveoli just off the end.

678
01:12:57,250 --> 01:13:07,180
There's no alveolar sacs yet, but it's just basically alveoli off of the duct nodules, intermediate fuel II groups of alveolar wall.

679
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:11,080
And then in the gas exchange area, we have the alveolar sacs.

680
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:14,750
So depending on how you cut them, it's supposed to be like a bunch of grapes.

681
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:18,100
It looks like more or less, I don't know, discrete.

682
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:23,350
So these are alveoli. Each one is an obvious, and then they kind of combine together.

683
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:32,290
And then here's a little tiny pulmonary venue. And then there's capillaries which you can't see in this normal lung the capillaries come off of.

684
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:40,120
This is the venue also. This is actually going this way, but the capillaries come off and they're in the wall, so everyone treats them.

685
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:43,800
It just looks like an alveolar wall. Here you can see a little bit there's little red cells.

686
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:51,250
There's actually little red cells. Those capillaries are so small, it's kind of one red cell filtering through at a time.

687
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:55,910
So unless there's something wrong, it just looks like a thin single membrane.

688
01:13:55,930 --> 01:14:01,210
But remember that electron micrograph, that's the type one tumor site and a capillary right next to each other.

689
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:04,840
So this is the area of gas exchange. Okay.

690
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:16,930
So let's be honest. Yes. Since it's such a skinny passage, when you have the intravascular macrophages fully block the capillaries,

691
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:20,799
the red blood cells, not really because it's dynamic, right?

692
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:27,040
So it's like continual blood flow. So and there's some distance ability.

693
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:30,640
So it's not going to be like a blockage unless you have a clot.

694
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:35,140
So if you have pathology that's causing abnormal clotting in the vascular system,

695
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:38,680
the presence of the macrophages is not going to block the flow of blood or anything.

696
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:45,520
Here is a mouse lung and there are a couple differences in the mouse lung.

697
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:51,490
One of the main ones is that pulmonary veins in mice have cardiac muscle around them,

698
01:14:51,790 --> 01:15:00,160
so they actually have an extension as the blood is sort of heading to the pulmonary veins occurring, blood back to the heart.

699
01:15:00,850 --> 01:15:06,220
The cardiac muscle actually extends up the pulmonary veins all the way into the lung, which is kind of weird.

700
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:11,440
And then the other so pulmonary veins have cardiac muscle around them.

701
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:19,150
And in primates, I showed you that image of the sort of tertiary bronchus with intermittent cartilage.

702
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:25,629
In primates, there is some cartilage around those intra pulmonary bronchi.

703
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:32,110
In mice, there's no cartilage in the lung itself, all the cartilaginous areas of the lung or external to the lung.

704
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:38,740
So trachea main stem bronchi. But as soon as those bronchi enter the lung, the cartilage drops out in the mouth.

705
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:47,380
And that's probably just related to the small size of the animal. It doesn't need that much infrastructure in the lung to keep its warm open.

706
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:51,370
So there's no cartilage in the intra pulmonary bronchi in the mice.

707
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:58,540
And then this is showing a high back, higher magnification view of a bronchus.

708
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:04,350
So there's that respiratory epithelium in a bronchus. There are some arterial structures.

709
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:11,979
So here's an artery coming by. And then this, which looks like what I thought was inflammation kind of it is.

710
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:18,640
But this is all lymphoid tissue. So this is bronchus associated lymphoid tissue or balt.

711
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:25,420
So some of you might have terms heard terms like got, which is gut associated lymphoid tissue.

712
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:30,880
So many tissues that are portals to the outside have the they're not lymph nodes,

713
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:39,010
but they have these little lymphoid aggregates, some of which are formed even without antigenic stimuli in development.

714
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:47,080
So some of the lymphoid tissue in the gut form, even without antigenic stimuli, although they're increased with antigenic stimuli,

715
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:55,000
but bult which is the lymphoid tissue around sort of the entry way is in the lungs as things come down the airway.

716
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:57,640
Both is an inducible lymphoid tissue.

717
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:04,299
Almost everybody, you know, is not living in a sterile environment has this because your lung is exposed to antigens,

718
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:13,870
but this is induced sort of after birth with antigenic stimulation and the degree of bult depends on the degree of antigenic stimulation.

719
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:18,940
So one of the things you can see in an animal or a person exposed to antigens that are

720
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:24,910
inhaled is both hyperplasia or an increase in the bronchus associated lymphoid tissue.

721
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:32,530
Okay. So it's sort of looks like inflammation, but it's not that sort of innate, just nonspecific inflammation.

722
01:17:32,770 --> 01:17:36,970
It's just an expansion of immune immune tissue and rodent.

723
01:17:37,150 --> 01:17:48,160
Love to do this. So there's usually a lot of bolts in road and there's that picture of the pulmonary veins which for whatever reason,

724
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:52,750
have cardiac muscle around them, which makes it easy to recognize pulmonary veins.

725
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:55,810
But it's a distinct difference from human. Yes.

726
01:17:56,680 --> 01:18:03,520
So with other secondary, secondary lymphoid tissue that there's like a stromal matrix.

727
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:07,220
Why can't we not see that or like the achieves?

728
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:12,610
Yeah. So this tissue is so densely packed with lymphocytes.

729
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:23,290
So the HCV is you'll see high endothelial values are your vascular structures like your waves in secondary lymphoid structures like lymph nodes.

730
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:30,970
So we'll see an example of that in 717. Today in both you have vasculature normally present there.

731
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:36,280
So the blood is being carried to in front by the vascular structures that are already there.

732
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:40,300
So it has a little bit more less organization than a lymph node.

733
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:46,060
So what is essentially a cluster of lymphocytes performs in proximity to blood vessels,

734
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:52,600
but it doesn't have as defined an underlying structure as a node.

735
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:58,000
So if we were to immune deplete this animal, we'd probably see a bunch of up ptosis here,

736
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:02,770
but we wouldn't really see a scaffold the way we see that in a lymph node that's been depleted.

737
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:08,830
So there are lymphoid aggregates with a little bit less internal structure than a lymph node, I guess is the take home there.

738
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:19,179
All right. And then this is just Zoom. Oh, one thing I forgot to say, this is zooming in on the mouse, lung, mouse or rodent lungs go very abruptly.

739
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:26,230
So they lack cartilage in the upper airways and they also go very abruptly from tertiary bronchioles with a continuous respiratory epithelium.

740
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:32,680
Well, alveolar duct, they don't really have that extended period where there is intermittent smooth muscle,

741
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:39,640
the respiratory bronchioles, as in the human. And while they do have clever cells in their tertiary bronchi,

742
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:46,780
remember I said that the clearer cells in the human are at highest level in the sort of distal bronchi,

743
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:51,760
bronchi, bronchioles, particularly in those respiratory bronchioles.

744
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:57,580
So there are many toxicities that actually in the human target, the respiratory bronchioles,

745
01:19:58,150 --> 01:20:04,930
which is kind of a terrible place to have toxicity because if you have inflammation there, you're blocking things from getting to the alveolar ducts.

746
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:10,000
But some of that toxicity is mediated by Klara's cell activity.

747
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:15,730
And so sometimes rodents don't replicate that well because they have a little bit different structure here.

748
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:19,059
And the Clara cell concentration can be different. It depends.

749
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:24,820
There are some particular toxicities that they replicate quite well, but that's one difference in respiratory bronchioles.

750
01:20:25,630 --> 01:20:30,430
Okay, so that was a reminder of our mammal structures and a little review of some or a

751
01:20:30,430 --> 01:20:35,080
little introduction to some differences with rodent and human or primate lung.

752
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:40,480
Now let's look at some actual slides. Well, let's look at this one.

753
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:48,760
So, okay, so this is case one from a macaque. And I love this case because at first glance, like this is lung, I'm telling you, it's lung.

754
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:57,009
But like right away, what's different just about looking at the song compared to that honeycomb they just showed you, what would you say?

755
01:20:57,010 --> 01:21:03,100
Like even if you don't know any path words to collapse, it's actually not collapse.

756
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:08,350
Which is interesting. And like one of the things that you'll see, it looks collapse because it's solid.

757
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:13,450
But I told you that lung can collapse like a sponge and become solid.

758
01:21:13,870 --> 01:21:17,020
This is solid because something's filling the air space.

759
01:21:17,530 --> 01:21:23,020
So the word that I would use here is consolidated, it's filled, it's made into a solid tissue.

760
01:21:23,290 --> 01:21:28,509
But the outline of it and actually that's one of the gross necropsy signs of this.

761
01:21:28,510 --> 01:21:31,510
Usually if you take the lung out of the chest, it should collapse.

762
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:36,340
If this is going on, it's not going to because the alveoli are filled with something.

763
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:40,090
So this is consolidated and it's look how diffuse it is.

764
01:21:40,090 --> 01:21:46,239
It's I mean, yeah, it's a little bit less here, but it's diffusely consolidated for most of these slides.

765
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:53,170
I put a little u r rel in and it kind of takes bandwidth to do in class.

766
01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:58,090
But if you look at those on your own, there's this is the joint pathology centers.

767
01:21:58,090 --> 01:22:03,520
It's run by the Army. Actually, they have a human version of it and this is their animal pathology version.

768
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:08,620
And they have this little cool veterinary systemic pathology.

769
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:16,180
So you can actually look up various findings like if you want to see toxic things, let's do toxic lung and search.

770
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:19,690
It will give you a number of different toxic lesions in the lung.

771
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:22,000
Play with species, it can play with findings.

772
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:29,020
And so when you get to it, it will give you this a little write up about what the cases in the description.

773
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:32,979
And if you want a guided tour, this is the actual slides I'm showing in class.

774
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:36,910
If you click on this little image, like if you wanted a review of this in class.

775
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:38,780
So you click on this, gives you a thumbnail,

776
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:45,140
and then you show the Little Hotspots walkthrough right through and it tells you alveoli are diffusely filled with edema and fluid,

777
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:48,560
and then it zoom you even closer and it tells you all about it.

778
01:22:48,890 --> 01:22:56,600
So it's this little guided tour and then if you want to get really pathology, if you click on this thumbnail,

779
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:01,670
this slide at the top, it'll take you to this database and you can type in just guest.

780
01:23:03,970 --> 01:23:07,240
It's really cool. And you have to trust me.

781
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:11,830
You have nothing happens. You click the site again and all of a sudden you have a microscope.

782
01:23:12,370 --> 01:23:17,829
So all of a sudden it takes you to the actual slide and then you can actually drive on the side.

783
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:20,860
So I'm going to close. This is your slide tray around your mailbox.

784
01:23:21,310 --> 01:23:25,540
Here's your slide. And then you can actually I'm just rolling my mouse.

785
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:34,180
You can actually either click on the different magnifications, but you can move around and you can actually read the slide.

786
01:23:34,930 --> 01:23:40,389
This is depending on your computer, like this is a fairly standard computer.

787
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:42,880
The refresh rate to do this has to be pretty high.

788
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:48,940
My laptop is kind of souped up for graphics, so depending on your computer, this might be irritating because you have to wait for the refresh.

789
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:52,690
But this case is fairly straightforward.

790
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:57,730
Refresh. So it's harder to do, especially when I'm projecting because of the bandwidth.

791
01:23:58,210 --> 01:24:05,560
But it can be fun to sort of do on your own. But if you imagine like that image I showed you, so this is that long, diffusely,

792
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:11,350
consolidated and you can even at this magnification get the sense that there were alveoli here.

793
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,830
Right. I'm going to try to go a little higher refresh for me.

794
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:21,040
Just give it a minute. So it's harder to kind of do this in class because the refresh is just give it a minute.

795
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:26,020
But what we'll see if it ever refreshes is that the alveolar spaces are there.

796
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:31,829
You can kind of see the ghost of them, but there is a loss of the lining here.

797
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:36,800
It comes in my computer. It just. There it is.

798
01:24:37,190 --> 01:24:40,820
I just can't focus as quickly and crazily as I usually like to do.

799
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:46,160
All right. So can you get the sense that there are alveoli here, but they're just filled with stuff.

800
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:49,910
And so if we were to describe the slide in a big picture,

801
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:56,510
we might say this long is diffusely consolidated and that the consolidated era is now we're going to want to say something about them.

802
01:24:56,660 --> 01:25:00,260
So in the alveoli, what do we have going on here? What would you say?

803
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:05,210
Is this just what it looks like? Color?

804
01:25:06,110 --> 01:25:09,500
Is it cellular? What color is it?

805
01:25:13,590 --> 01:25:18,870
It's. Yeah, it's pink, it's eosinophilic. So we have eosinophilic material in the alveoli.

806
01:25:19,590 --> 01:25:21,570
It's kind of a low sodium area. Right.

807
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:29,430
And I told you in the lung when I showed you all the things we should, what should we normally have lining these alveoli?

808
01:25:30,150 --> 01:25:40,050
It's kind of hard to find capillaries. And what type of epithelium should line most of the alveoli because those tape one, the flat cells.

809
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:43,740
So we should just see thin flat cells lining the alveoli.

810
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:49,979
And even though we have ghosts of the AP, I'm hard pressed to really point to any.

811
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:54,540
Maybe there's one. I'm really hard pressed to point to any type one alveolar cells.

812
01:25:54,930 --> 01:26:03,750
They're kind of gone and in their place, I have sort of bright pink strands and lots of roundish looking cells,

813
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:10,110
and a lot of the roundish looking cells are also making their way into the alveolar spaces.

814
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:18,660
So in this area I have diffuse consolidation, a filling of the alveoli by eosinophilic material.

815
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:22,260
And not only what else did you notice about this is similar stuff.

816
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:28,050
What's what else can you say about it? Try to discern one more, but a fresh.

817
01:26:30,210 --> 01:26:37,080
That's why I don't do them all like this, because it's just takes too long. Can you see there what's going on with that pink stuff?

818
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:40,650
It's not like uniform pink. It's all this.

819
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:48,840
Do you see that? Spider webs? So those. It looks like it, but it's actually strands of fibrin.

820
01:26:49,810 --> 01:26:52,889
Okay, so there are strands of fight. There's pronation.

821
01:26:52,890 --> 01:26:56,340
Fluid is simple stuff. There are strands of fibrin.

822
01:26:56,850 --> 01:27:03,060
And then the reason we can kind of see the wall of the alveoli is so remember, an ambulance has a capillary.

823
01:27:03,150 --> 01:27:08,490
That's a blood structure. Right? We've lost the type one, numerous sites.

824
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:13,830
They're gone. But I have this pink line. Those are layers of fibrin.

825
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:18,780
Because remember, we said that fibrin, not fibrosis.

826
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:24,060
Different thing. Fibrin is the end product of the coagulation cascade.

827
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:30,779
Right. If you damage a blood vessel, you have hemorrhage and you try to clogs.

828
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:35,910
They're going to form fibrin here in almost every volvulus.

829
01:27:36,690 --> 01:27:45,480
We have protein leakage. So that's from the vasculature proteins leaked into the alveoli and we have fibrin.

830
01:27:45,990 --> 01:27:51,720
So we've had kind of simultaneous damage to all the alveolar lining of this entire lung.

831
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:59,940
So we've had destruction of the type one, numerous sites which are tightly adhered to a basement membrane where there's a capillary.

832
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:04,950
So not only the type one, new methods have been destroyed, but the adjacent capillary is damaged.

833
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:13,710
And so the response is fibrin. So remember we talked about types of necrosis and one of the manifestations was redness necrosis.

834
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:17,910
When you have a mucus lined structure or something where there's a capillary present.

835
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:23,730
So what we had here is actually type one tumor site necrosis.

836
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:28,590
This is acute necrosis and it's something that affected all the alveoli simultaneously.

837
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:36,540
And then we have proton gnosis or we have protein in the alveoli and fibrin as a result of that necrosis.

838
01:28:38,070 --> 01:28:42,360
So we have something that diffusely hit the entirety of the lung.

839
01:28:43,050 --> 01:28:53,940
And so that's pretty common with inhaled toxicants like a gas or toxicants that are carried to the lung and hit it simultaneously in the vasculature.

840
01:28:54,300 --> 01:29:01,620
But things that hit all the alveoli at one space and this caused some cytotoxicity to the lung itself.

841
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:08,850
I'm going to close the slides. I can go back to my thing like I went through your set design.

842
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:13,590
Let me go to this. All right, so there's my same case.

843
01:29:14,970 --> 01:29:19,590
The section of lung, the alveoli are diffusely, consolidated. So there is our big picture statement.

844
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:25,830
And this is that image that I was showing you before. And there's your normal on the lower corner.

845
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:29,610
So this was trying I hate that that I shouldn't put that writing over it.

846
01:29:29,610 --> 01:29:35,070
But the type one number sites are missing. If you see any of them, they're hyper eosinophilic.

847
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:39,880
But basically there's nothing there. There's necrosis or loss of the type one pneumocystis.

848
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:50,100
So that's consistent with alveolar necrosis. And then what's filling these alveoli is sort of the secondary manifestations of that.

849
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:57,870
So the capillaries were adjacent. So I have protein rich fluid coming over from the capillaries and fibrils.

850
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:01,770
So these little things and essentially those are those are fibrin.

851
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:07,080
And then all the little blue arrows are pointing at inflammatory cells.

852
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:11,850
This is a little bit hard to see, but this is a segmented nucleus.

853
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:17,009
This is a segmented nucleus. It's a little harder to see, but those are neutrophils.

854
01:30:17,010 --> 01:30:22,079
So there's acute inflammatory cells, which we would expect because we have acute damage.

855
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:28,560
We have necrosis, we have fibrin. We're going to have our acute inflammatory cells in addition to the macrophages that live there ordinarily.

856
01:30:29,070 --> 01:30:38,639
So this is a very acute lesion. And here's a this kind of a ringer slide from a human version of a similar lesion from a different process.

857
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:44,490
But this is also that fiber. And this one, the macrophages, have done a little bit more of a job at eating up all that fluid,

858
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:48,390
but the fibrin has kind of precipitated out and formed a thick layer.

859
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:52,710
And this almost kind of is refract dial in a microscope.

860
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:58,890
So there's a word, a pathway that we call it as a HYALINE and it has to do with how it refracts light.

861
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:07,560
This is a highland membrane and this particular disorder is sometimes called highland membrane disease.

862
01:31:07,890 --> 01:31:10,950
But all it really means is that there's thick mass of fibrin.

863
01:31:12,330 --> 01:31:19,070
And the key to that, this is a hallmark. This is telling you, oh, my God, there's been a lot of vascular damage here.

864
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:23,460
This is a hallmark of acute alveolar necrosis. Okay.

865
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:30,150
So let's sum up what happened here and here's a little clue what was going on in that primary.

866
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:36,030
If you start guessing away at it. For those of you who are plant or spy buffs.

867
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:43,380
So the morphologic diagnosis, the basic process was necrosis.

868
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:50,040
Our distribution was pretty diffuse. Right. And necrosis is by definition an acute process.

869
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:54,329
And we noticed acute inflammatory cells. We noticed fibrin. So this was an acute process.

870
01:31:54,330 --> 01:32:02,280
So the basic process was necrosis, all those things, edema, fibrin, all that was kind of secondary to the basic process in a process.

871
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:05,550
Diffuse, severe, acute, severe. Here we have some more images.

872
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:10,530
So first, what is that acute necrosis?

873
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:19,890
So clinically, acute necrosis often goes hand-in-hand with a disease called diffuse alveolar disease or hyaline membrane disease.

874
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:28,260
And this is a common result of any toxicant or injury that acutely damages the alveolar epithelium so that a lot of things can do this.

875
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:31,020
The hallmark is that they present very acutely.

876
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:39,000
So inhaled toxicants can do it or systemic toxicants that travel to the long in the bloodstream, certain viral infections.

877
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:41,910
So COVID 19.

878
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:50,940
Yes so diffuse alveolar disease and Hyland membrane disease is one of the findings that was seen in people who became acutely ill with COVID.

879
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:54,900
It had to go like on an MRI machine or something to bypass their lung.

880
01:32:55,440 --> 01:33:01,740
There are other manifestations of COVID that people had, if they survived a little bit longer, if they had more of an inflammatory component.

881
01:33:02,070 --> 01:33:05,260
So the pathology of pneumonia and COVID is actually diverse.

882
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:12,270
There's a lot of different presentations, but this is one of the ones that landed people on respirators and admonishes.

883
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:20,280
Hypersensitivity reactions can do this and certain immune diseases that damage the capillaries because think

884
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:25,410
all these things what do they have in common something that's going to damage that alveolar epithelium.

885
01:33:26,010 --> 01:33:29,340
Right. Could be a toxicant, could be a viral agent,

886
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:36,480
damaging that alveolar epithelium and causing leakage of all that stuff in the vasculature and the histologic features of intra of.

887
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:44,470
Commonality are that alveolar damage, that acute necrosis, and then you see the fibrin and edema as a result of capillary damage.

888
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:51,400
Okay. If there's enough fiber and you get that thick mat of fibrin that we call Hyland membranes,

889
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:57,520
so that's its other name hyaline membrane disease and that's kind of clinically and in clinical pathology.

890
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:02,440
That's a hallmark of people who are in this acute respiratory syndrome.

891
01:34:03,010 --> 01:34:11,049
Have is the Hyland permanent you know those that fibrin is going to get like any other injury or a destroyed tissue it's going

892
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:16,690
to get phagocytosis by the macrophages and then there's going to be a change to the villa wall that show in just a sec.

893
01:34:17,830 --> 01:34:23,470
So clinically this presents as a person, imagine that lung, you can't do much air exchange in that lung, right?

894
01:34:23,830 --> 01:34:28,180
So clinically these people present in very severe acute respiratory distress.

895
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:32,709
So the clinical this is the pathology diagnosis.

896
01:34:32,710 --> 01:34:36,790
The clinical diagnosis is acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS.

897
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:42,729
Obviously the symptoms relate to severe hypoxia due to impaired air exchange.

898
01:34:42,730 --> 01:34:49,059
And there's also acid based imbalance because you can't get rid of CO2 either and sometimes to support.

899
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:53,140
So there's different things. If it's mild, you can actually put them on a positive pressure,

900
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:59,319
basically increase the pressure of the air going in and you're trying to kind of force air exchange,

901
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:02,940
but if it's severe enough, they sometimes actually need to use it.

902
01:35:02,950 --> 01:35:04,900
KMO I know if you've heard about this,

903
01:35:05,410 --> 01:35:10,809
a lot of people in COVID ended up on this and there's a major research group here at the University of Michigan.

904
01:35:10,810 --> 01:35:12,850
This is actually where Echo was first developed,

905
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:20,019
but extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where you're actually taking the blood and external to the body,

906
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:24,220
oxygenating it so you're bypassing the lungs while the lungs have a chance to heal.

907
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:30,520
So it's a pretty intensive procedure utilized sometimes with premature infants,

908
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:35,350
but came really into play in COVID because of people who had lungs that looked like that.

909
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:40,330
Okay. So that was diffused alveolar disease. So for our purposes, it's acute necrosis.

910
01:35:40,630 --> 01:35:46,690
Lots of different things can cause it. And this case, you guessed it, this was Reisen toxicity.

911
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:53,889
So Reisen is a plant, as you probably know, and it has these cool little B seeds that have kind of an interesting pattern.

912
01:35:53,890 --> 01:35:59,260
So people use them in jewelry a lot. You'll see them in like just little ornamental jewelries.

913
01:35:59,650 --> 01:36:06,130
And the plant itself also has an oil that is used, has industrial and certain pharmaceutical use,

914
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:13,450
but the seed itself has a high level of a protein called Reisen, which is highly toxic.

915
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:19,420
And I mean, kids, pets, eat anything. You have this cute little thing, hang around in your house.

916
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:24,100
So there are cases of accidental toxicity from ingestion of those beads.

917
01:36:25,390 --> 01:36:29,740
Reisen is kind of notorious because it's lethal doses very low.

918
01:36:30,130 --> 01:36:33,610
So the lethal dose can be it varies quite a bit depending on the plant,

919
01:36:33,610 --> 01:36:41,409
but the lethal dose can be as high as or as low as just a few seeds for ingestion because it's so toxic.

920
01:36:41,410 --> 01:36:46,450
Unfortunately, it has been a focus of attention as a biological weapon.

921
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:50,230
So purified Reisen has been used as a biologic weapon.

922
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:55,270
This compound is considered a select agent, so people are using it for research use.

923
01:36:55,270 --> 01:37:01,660
You need to have special permissions and there's quite a bit of controls in terms of using this in an experimental setting.

924
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:11,559
And that slide that I gave you was actually from the department, from the DOD, it's from the Department of Defense looking at so under anesthesia,

925
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:17,200
using ricin and trying to come up with therapeutics for people who might be exposed to bioweapons.

926
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:23,530
So that's what that primate side was, which is pretty sad, but it's a sad fact of life.

927
01:37:24,250 --> 01:37:33,610
Okay, so how does Reisen work? So Reisen is a hollow toxin that consists of A and B subunits that binds receptors on cells.

928
01:37:33,610 --> 01:37:36,040
And there's a couple of different cell types that it can bind.

929
01:37:36,670 --> 01:37:44,020
In this case, probably the one that's most relevant is epithelial cells, so binds a lot of different epithelial cells, including the ones in the lung.

930
01:37:44,470 --> 01:37:50,860
It also binds to macrophages, which compounds the problem because now you're killing the very cells that are trying to remove all that fluid,

931
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:58,900
but the whole toxin binds the receptor on those cell surfaces and that it's under a site host into the cell and either

932
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:06,790
can be accumulated in the lysosomes which then can destroy or it can be undergo retrograde transport to the air,

933
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:11,170
to the endoplasmic reticulum where it dissociates into A and B subunits.

934
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:22,600
And then the sneaky B subunit, I believe, binds the ribosome or complex itself, and that stops protein synthesis.

935
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:28,240
It's essentially a cell starving to death because it can no longer undergo any of its protein translation functions.

936
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:33,370
And that leads to cell death. Okay, so that's Reisen Pathogenesis.

937
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:42,540
And as I said, Reisen has quite the nerve. Various history as in use as a biological weapon so that we are an umbrella thing.

938
01:38:42,570 --> 01:38:48,540
I've never been to this museum. I kind of want to go, but there's like the spy museum in Washington DC and nobody's ever been there.

939
01:38:49,710 --> 01:38:57,780
But this was a case way back in the 1970s where there was a Bulgarian dissident who just defected to the UK and was walking across a bridge in London,

940
01:38:58,230 --> 01:39:02,730
had some guy with an umbrella walking past him the other direction and felt like a prick on his leg.

941
01:39:03,630 --> 01:39:08,430
And that turned out that they'd made this crazy umbrella with a little pellet of

942
01:39:08,430 --> 01:39:12,780
purified rice in it and injected it into his leg with the needle off the umbrella.

943
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:20,400
And, you know, nobody expected that to happen. So sadly, he became febrile, became ill and died in hospital a few days later.

944
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:24,990
And then in the post mortem, they found out that it was, in fact, ricin toxicity.

945
01:39:25,660 --> 01:39:31,680
That's kind of a bizarre story, but there are actually several other instances of rice in use as a biological weapon.

946
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:35,520
And as I said, it is classified currently as a selective agent.

947
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:46,350
Okay. So just remember, not just rice and a lot of different things can cause that acute alveolar disease presentation.

948
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:52,739
So now pretend that we had someone who was not so unfortunate as George Markoff or that poor monkey,

949
01:39:52,740 --> 01:39:56,010
and now we've had survival for a little bit longer.

950
01:39:56,430 --> 01:40:01,530
So this is a lung also from a macaque, but this is a little bit more kind of a sub chronic.

951
01:40:01,530 --> 01:40:05,220
So maybe like a week or so after an injurious agent.

952
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:10,180
And so at low magnification, we have a little bit better idea that this is lung, right?

953
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:18,750
Because we see more open spaces, but we have this thickening and the thing that's actually thickening are the interstitial spaces.

954
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:23,370
Okay. So here you can kind of see the normal thickness of the infestation,

955
01:40:23,790 --> 01:40:28,290
but like everything's being spread apart and the interstitial is getting very thick.

956
01:40:29,850 --> 01:40:35,640
So again, this is kind of showing you this gets like really hard to recognize because these almost look like airways.

957
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:41,250
But those used to be these are all alveoli. There's something funky going on with their lining.

958
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:44,609
And then the space in between is no longer a virtual space.

959
01:40:44,610 --> 01:40:49,620
We now have dilated capillaries. We have some cells in there with all kinds of stuff going on.

960
01:40:50,790 --> 01:40:57,570
So there is those dilated interstitial. So if I were describing this, I'm sorry, I'm like flying, trying to get through this.

961
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:01,830
This is a section of lung. This is diffuse thickening of the interstitial.

962
01:41:02,820 --> 01:41:09,570
You guys could see that. Okay. And then if I'm looking at that second interstitial, like if I just showed you this,

963
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:12,720
you'd be hard pressed to say that this was not everything's very thickened.

964
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:16,050
I have a couple of things going on. I have inflammatory cells.

965
01:41:17,010 --> 01:41:25,860
These these are actually macrophages in there. And then I actually have this is going to be really kind of tricky.

966
01:41:25,860 --> 01:41:28,920
And this is not going to be a major feature that I want you guys to know.

967
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:36,330
This is actually early fibrosis. So there are fibroblasts in here that are starting to deposit collagen,

968
01:41:36,690 --> 01:41:41,400
but it's not as thickened and defined as we would have ordinarily with fibrosis.

969
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:50,150
So in the second intersection, there's inflammation and fibrosis, and then these are the alveoli.

970
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:55,050
So like, look at these things. That's not that flat cell type that I told you about.

971
01:41:55,070 --> 01:42:01,600
What do you think is going on there? What happens if you kill all the type one new missiles?

972
01:42:01,970 --> 01:42:06,440
What is the lungs ability to regenerate the proliferation of the type two?

973
01:42:06,650 --> 01:42:12,950
Yes. So remember we said the type tuna missiles with a round are cells that ordinarily are kind of inconspicuous,

974
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:19,709
but they're the stem cells for type one new missiles. So if the type one new missiles have been killed, like with our poor monkey, with the rice,

975
01:42:19,710 --> 01:42:27,770
then what the body does or what the lung can do is to all the type tuna missiles will divide and will line the alveoli.

976
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:32,060
So going back to our basic pathology words, there are more type two sites now.

977
01:42:32,070 --> 01:42:34,670
So this is type two new muscle hyperplasia.

978
01:42:35,990 --> 01:42:41,959
Sometimes people call this bronchial or ization of the lung because it looks more like a bronchi, but that's a password.

979
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:46,490
You don't need to worry about that, but if you see that. So there's increased numbers of type two tumor sites.

980
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:50,500
This is type two pneumo site hypoplasia. There's a really good example of it.

981
01:42:50,510 --> 01:42:55,340
This is still pretty thin. There should be a viewer lining and look at all these cells sticking up there.

982
01:42:56,240 --> 01:43:00,110
So as you can imagine, that's great that you can recover the alveoli.

983
01:43:00,950 --> 01:43:08,110
But air exchange is still a problem, right? Because we have now a thick, bubbly looking cell type rather than those nice flat cell types.

984
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:11,330
So we still compromised as far as air exchange here.

985
01:43:11,810 --> 01:43:18,710
So there's more type two tumor site hypoplasia and then there's still some other kind of an and other center.

986
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:24,190
And there is also centers. These are alveoli that have macrophages.

987
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:30,800
Those are the yellow arrows and some red cells in there. They're also increased intra alveolar macrophages and scattered hemorrhage.

988
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:34,040
So maybe there's a little damage still going on or some cleanup response.

989
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:41,810
So the processes that we have here are the main one is that type two new monocyte hyperplasia.

990
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:49,150
We have that thickening of the interstitial. And I said there were inflammatory cells in there and there was early fibrosis.

991
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:59,360
This is kind of a transitional lesion. And depending on how well this animal copes, this might actually go away because it's still not organized.

992
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:06,020
But this is basically the reparative response, the repair response to diffuse alveolar injury.

993
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:08,479
So if we had that first animal,

994
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:16,820
if that animal would be able to be supported and would survive or example of the COVID patient on echo in the repair phase of their injury,

995
01:44:16,820 --> 01:44:19,370
they're going to have this type two tumor site hypoplasia.

996
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:24,140
They're still not out of the woods because they're still not performing oxygen exchange normally.

997
01:44:24,470 --> 01:44:32,960
And there's their ultimate outcome is dependent on how well these guys these guys are going to differentiate to become type one dimmer sites.

998
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:36,470
So it's going to recreate the normal alveolar epithelium.

999
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:41,560
But you also want to hope that this does not solidifies.

1000
01:44:41,580 --> 01:44:46,489
You don't get permanent fibrosis in that interstitial of the lung, because if that happens,

1001
01:44:46,490 --> 01:44:50,360
you're going to compromise some of permanently some of the ear exchange area.

1002
01:44:51,160 --> 01:45:01,760
Okay. So this is usually I try not to make it so most people in pathology would call this lesion kind of sub chronic or subacute.

1003
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:06,739
There's like this kind of fine distinction. We don't care in our class.

1004
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:14,210
We're just going to do acute and chronic. So I am calling this chronic because it's a response to an injury that previously happened.

1005
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:19,730
The necrosis was acute. But I want you guys to know is that this is the response to that.

1006
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:24,260
So we're further down right in our pathogenesis of injury, body response.

1007
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:28,250
We're not at resolution yet, but we're further down. Okay.

1008
01:45:28,670 --> 01:45:34,040
So this particular example, the one that I showed you, was not rising. That was an example of oxygen toxicity.

1009
01:45:34,910 --> 01:45:42,680
So, again, premature infants oftentimes are placed in an oxygen and an incubator that has supplemental oxygen,

1010
01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:48,779
which is great if they're not able to exchange oxygen as efficiently as an adult.

1011
01:45:48,780 --> 01:45:52,340
So provides them some help to prevent hypoxia early on.

1012
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:58,550
But oxygen itself is toxic to the epithelium because it increases the generation of reactive oxygen species.

1013
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:06,410
So the downside of being in a high oxygen environment for a longer period of time is you actually get epithelial cell death from oxygen toxicity.

1014
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:14,000
And so type two numerous side hyperplasia is an unfortunate outcome if infants are not the ultimate outcome,

1015
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,650
but an unfortunate side effect of being in a high oxygen environment for too long.

1016
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:23,750
So that's something you would that's another reason why you want to wean them from that as quickly as possible.

1017
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:25,760
Okay.

1018
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:38,030
My God, if we end up running a little long here, I will push this or the end part of this two hour neuro one next week because we're splitting that.

1019
01:46:38,570 --> 01:46:42,710
And I don't want to rush my way through particular toxicology because it's important.

1020
01:46:43,130 --> 01:46:48,410
So next week, we're doing the structure function for nervous system, but we can do a little bit of this.

1021
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:51,680
I think I'll probably do that because I don't want to rush my way.

1022
01:46:51,770 --> 01:46:56,239
That's too boring. All right. So this was type two. Never site hypoplasia again.

1023
01:46:56,240 --> 01:46:59,240
This is the repair phase of diffuse alveolar damage.

1024
01:46:59,540 --> 01:47:02,650
So this was a high oxygen therapy case.

1025
01:47:02,990 --> 01:47:10,460
But the important thing for you guys is that that same appearance is basically the generic response to acute alveolar injury.

1026
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:17,060
So it could be with anything that caused acute alveolar damage and this is the pathogenesis of this lesion.

1027
01:47:17,630 --> 01:47:25,220
So, you know, whatever the toxicant was before, right then oxygen toxicity caused necrosis of type one pneumocystis.

1028
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:28,910
And then the type two never sites are part of the repair response.

1029
01:47:29,420 --> 01:47:34,020
And eventually what should happen is they should differentiate into type one tumor sites.

1030
01:47:34,370 --> 01:47:38,779
So it's just part of the lung repair, but obviously it has a functional consequence.

1031
01:47:38,780 --> 01:47:44,719
One, while we were in there, this is a reminder that in real life,

1032
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:48,650
although I teach you these nice, neat categories, real life things get a little complicated.

1033
01:47:49,070 --> 01:47:52,970
So this slide, like if you go back and look at the VSP site and look at the slide,

1034
01:47:53,240 --> 01:47:59,750
it has some features of acute damage and it has some features moving more towards chronic damage.

1035
01:47:59,750 --> 01:48:06,440
So that's just a real world example how sometimes those things can get mixed together.

1036
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:09,920
And from a pathology standpoint, you go with the dominant process.

1037
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:18,020
And then again two potential outcomes successful repair, everything goes back to normal, but that interstitial thickening,

1038
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:21,980
you've got to kind of watch that because that actually can create areas of scarring in the lung.

1039
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:27,500
Okay, so we did a keyword damage. We did the repair.

1040
01:48:28,970 --> 01:48:33,709
Most of this I think I'm going to do next week. But here is a quick preview of the slide.

1041
01:48:33,710 --> 01:48:38,330
So cool. This is a slide of a human lung.

1042
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:41,750
And so now our distribution is just trying to get a distribution list.

1043
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:45,260
Our distribution distributions quite different, right. So a distribution.

1044
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:48,980
What would you. So we liked our word consolidation. We had areas of consolidation.

1045
01:48:49,310 --> 01:48:52,460
But what's going on about the distribution for consolidation here?

1046
01:48:54,220 --> 01:49:00,379
It's multifocal. What else about it? Pretty much a round, very nodular.

1047
01:49:00,380 --> 01:49:07,880
That's actually the exact pathology where I look at you. So there is multifocal nodular consolidation.

1048
01:49:08,630 --> 01:49:12,650
Okay. And this consolidation is going to be something a little bit different.

1049
01:49:12,650 --> 01:49:16,070
And those nodules, you can't tell now because it's so destroyed.

1050
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:19,820
But those nodules originated around bronchioles.

1051
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:28,399
So something happened in a bronchial and there was tissue reaction and it just kept getting spread concentric around those bronchioles.

1052
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:37,729
So this is something that was inhalant inhaled exposure and a lot of them are actually even smaller diameter bronchioles that are small,

1053
01:49:37,730 --> 01:49:43,580
intimate, little bronchial or centered multifocal nodular areas of consolidation.

1054
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:49,670
And then if you look at what is what is there, that's that this is sort of the edge that can see the lung.

1055
01:49:49,730 --> 01:49:53,390
So we have a lot of busyness in the lung that you can still recognize this long.

1056
01:49:53,840 --> 01:50:01,100
And then we have this thing, this is the nodule. So those little squares are showing you in higher mass.

1057
01:50:01,130 --> 01:50:06,530
This is that nodular area. So this has some similarities.

1058
01:50:06,530 --> 01:50:11,150
It sometimes gets difficult to all those fibrin stress that we talked about with the first case.

1059
01:50:11,180 --> 01:50:16,100
What is different about this picture compared to like those alveoli that I showed you with all that fibrin?

1060
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:28,520
How does this look different? Sure. How this? Well, I think that there is more cells here.

1061
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:32,229
Yep. So those are nuclei. Good. So this is a much more cellular.

1062
01:50:32,230 --> 01:50:39,970
So there's more pink. There's more pink stuff. But the pink stuff appears to be kind of imbued with or around a lot of cells.

1063
01:50:40,690 --> 01:50:45,350
So what do you think this pink stuff is? What was that?

1064
01:50:46,730 --> 01:50:51,950
Some of it could be the cytoplasm of the elevated cells, but it's also something outside the cells.

1065
01:50:53,930 --> 01:50:57,670
That's another thing. That's pink. That's extracellular. It's not fibrin.

1066
01:50:58,690 --> 01:51:02,840
Oh, let's start with the cells. Like what kind of cells? What could these spindly cells be?

1067
01:51:03,980 --> 01:51:08,350
Kind of salty things. Those could be. You don't know that many cell types.

1068
01:51:08,470 --> 01:51:12,780
So is it an inflammatory cell? Is it in a bacterial cell?

1069
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:19,150
What other cell types do we know? Would you say?

1070
01:51:19,930 --> 01:51:27,680
A final blast, right? A connective tissue cell. Who said connective tissue cells are elongated and going down our sequence of injury

1071
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:33,070
body response to repair fibroblasts are helpful repair cells when there's damage,

1072
01:51:33,490 --> 01:51:36,710
fibroblasts and tissue are spindly looking. And what do they mean?

1073
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:44,620
Collagen. Collagen is an extracellular protein that deposits in tissue with extracellular pink stuff.

1074
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:54,190
So these are a lot of activated fibroblasts laying down layer upon layer upon layer of five of fibrous connective tissue of collagen.

1075
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:57,670
And they're doing it in this nodule around that area.

1076
01:51:58,060 --> 01:52:00,580
So something in that area is really aggravating.

1077
01:52:00,970 --> 01:52:08,799
And then the other thing you're seeing, what we'll see coming next week are these normal, dark, granular looking things.

1078
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:12,310
So that was the this is fibrosis, nodular fibrosis.

1079
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:19,419
And then this is the area adjacent which has some macrophages and alveoli.

1080
01:52:19,420 --> 01:52:22,569
And some of the macrophages have that little granular stuff.

1081
01:52:22,570 --> 01:52:28,330
They're trying desperately to kind of eat that stuff up like coal or like it's a particulate material.

1082
01:52:28,330 --> 01:52:32,819
Yes, very good. And an edge. So some of that is no doubt.

1083
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:36,180
So there's inflammatory cells here and we'll go back over this next week.

1084
01:52:36,510 --> 01:52:42,720
Some of that is no doubt carbon like carbon black, but those nodular areas.

1085
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:44,969
So I'll go back over this next week.

1086
01:52:44,970 --> 01:52:52,320
I know I'm flying, but I don't want to I want to tell the end of the story because if you were to put a polarized light on that slide,

1087
01:52:52,950 --> 01:52:59,070
you're actually going to see little fractal elements in that larger area of fibrosis.

1088
01:52:59,730 --> 01:53:12,180
That's actually silica. Silica. So there are two types of silica derived particulates that are refract tile in in lung tissue silicates,

1089
01:53:12,180 --> 01:53:22,589
which are combination with more oxygen and often have other minerals in combination as well, are larger and are not typically fiber.

1090
01:53:22,590 --> 01:53:29,310
Janet, by themselves. So if you're doing an animal experiment, you're just giving it silicates, you're not going to get this fibrosis.

1091
01:53:29,820 --> 01:53:39,059
Silica like with two oxygens is very fiber genic, very irritating to the lung, just by nature of the particles it forms in histology.

1092
01:53:39,060 --> 01:53:42,299
It's smaller refractory particles and it's highly fiber.

1093
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:54,480
Jack So it creates chronic inflammation, fibroblast activation of these nodules of fibrosis around the airways where it was inhaled in real life.

1094
01:53:55,230 --> 01:53:58,290
Almost all exposures are a combination of things.

1095
01:53:58,530 --> 01:54:02,220
So you are correct in that there probably is carbon black in there.

1096
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:06,090
Carbon black by itself is if you were to purify, give it to an animal.

1097
01:54:06,270 --> 01:54:14,070
It's not very fiber, Jack. You get macrophage recruitment and you get some information, but you don't get these nodules of of fibrosis.

1098
01:54:14,370 --> 01:54:22,350
So that distribution with multifocal nodular fibrosis is very characteristic of silicosis, which is the condition of exposure to silica.

1099
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:29,669
So I'm going to leave you with that and we're going to kind of review this again next week and talk a little bit more about the different

1100
01:54:29,670 --> 01:54:37,980
kinds of particulates and how the type of particulate influences the type of lesion and the distribution of lesion that forms.

1101
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:41,100
So next week we'll talk about silica, we'll talk about carbon,

1102
01:54:41,370 --> 01:54:47,400
and we'll actually talk about the other kind of famous particulate example of asbestos and see how those with different.

1103
01:54:48,300 --> 01:54:56,640
Okay, so I will extend the deadline for the pathology quiz for this lecture.

1104
01:54:57,030 --> 01:55:02,310
So that will be, you know, the next week after. So just try to do your structure function long one this week.

1105
01:55:03,870 --> 01:55:09,640
All right. Thanks, guys. Are you like that or you just.

1106
01:55:11,950 --> 01:55:31,970
Mean. Thank you.

1107
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:40,880
Thank you. Similar to sneaker.

1108
01:55:53,110 --> 01:55:58,900
So country Republicans said you.

1109
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:10,370
Oh, really? I'm sure. No, I don't think so.

1110
01:56:10,810 --> 01:56:13,860
So I feel like the whitespace is there.

1111
01:56:13,890 --> 01:56:17,970
Yes, that's right. Then, ah, how are these red blood cells not falling out?

1112
01:56:18,510 --> 01:56:22,410
Yeah. Do they so. And do they just continually fall out? Or maybe they're so low.

1113
01:56:23,130 --> 01:56:24,660
So, like thinking in life.

1114
01:56:24,990 --> 01:56:33,690
So in life, we have an alveolar space that ordinarily shouldn't have any red cells in it, but it has, like, capillaries next to it.

1115
01:56:33,990 --> 01:56:39,710
And then there's maybe some surfactant, you know, in the deeper lung in life, those red.

1116
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:43,880
So it's blood. Right. So, like when we see blood in a shoe.

1117
01:56:43,890 --> 01:56:47,549
Yeah. Right. So there's two things that were was originally in that lung.

1118
01:56:47,550 --> 01:56:51,900
There's fluid, the protein, the serum component of blood, and then there's red cells.

1119
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:58,860
Like when we see blood and two, we don't see this, we see what we're seeing as red is actually cells floating in fluid.

1120
01:56:59,250 --> 01:57:08,790
So in life, this appeared as because there's increased pressure here, leakage of red cells and fluid, and then the macrophages are eating up,

1121
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:15,630
you know, both the fluid and the red cells as some of the red cells are just still floating in the lung.

1122
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:20,130
This is a histologic section. So this has been infused with formalin.

1123
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:23,910
So we're not going to see for. Oh, to expand the lungs. Yeah.

1124
01:57:24,330 --> 01:57:29,190
Yeah. So in reality, those red cells in the tissue were floating now in formalin.

1125
01:57:29,820 --> 01:57:38,430
And then when we histologically section them, they're kind of like just take a fluid filled thing and like, yeah, damp, but never dehydrate it.

1126
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:41,950
So all you're going to see that is as is as open air space.

1127
01:57:41,970 --> 01:57:48,360
Okay. Does that make sense? Yes. Yes, yes. But like, if we didn't think, how do you know when the lungs are?

1128
01:57:48,750 --> 01:57:53,550
Like when you do the biopsy and you do the slides, they they're all collapsed, right?

1129
01:57:53,790 --> 01:58:00,080
All these things are so like when you do a necropsy. Like, you're open up the chest and then the lung appears.

1130
01:58:00,090 --> 01:58:09,570
It's like a salmon. A salmon pink structure is kind of at the back behind the heart and they'll be kind of collapsed away from the thoracic wall.

1131
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:17,489
But then at necropsy, we take a syringe with fixative and put it through the trachea and you sort of gently instill a little fixative.

1132
01:58:17,490 --> 01:58:20,850
And what you'll see, it's as if the animal would take taken back to like yeah.

1133
01:58:20,970 --> 01:58:25,920
So you'll see the lung expand to fit the thorax cause like ordinarily, you know,

1134
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:29,730
when you exhale the lung is going to collapse to some degree and that fills up again.

1135
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:34,979
So and that happens because the thorax is a vacuum. We really we've eliminated that vacuum.

1136
01:58:34,980 --> 01:58:35,810
So it's all collapse.

1137
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:42,990
But by infusing, we're essentially like consolidating it just like this was filled with pugnacious fluid, refilling it with formalin.

1138
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:48,060
We're not gonna see that histologically because it's basically aqueous and is going to be, I guess if.

1139
01:58:48,340 --> 01:58:56,930
But if. I mean I'm just curious like when do you know, are there markers to say that it collapsed before the person got like once it collapsed.

1140
01:58:57,120 --> 01:59:01,950
Oh, obviously died. But like, yeah. So you're going to have that all the time to collapse.

1141
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:08,939
So I'm talking about. Yeah. So what I'm talking about is as kind of art of factual ad says an elective.

1142
01:59:08,940 --> 01:59:15,080
This is the word for collapse. Mm hmm. We create that every time we do a necropsy because we're opening up the chest, and that's artifact.

1143
01:59:15,390 --> 01:59:20,850
There is also conditions where a person can have a collapsed lung and can't inhale,

1144
01:59:20,850 --> 01:59:24,780
and that's going to cause the functional compromise that's usually very painful.

1145
01:59:24,780 --> 01:59:30,600
They're trying to inhale air. They have a kind of perfusion mismatch because there's no air.

1146
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:36,870
There's no air coming to the area where the blood is. So there are clinical signs of that that can often if it goes on long enough,

1147
01:59:37,380 --> 01:59:40,890
you can have histologic evidence of hemorrhage, you can have inflammatory cells.

1148
01:59:41,220 --> 01:59:46,140
So actually, yes, if an installation goes wrong and I have a collapsed lung to look at on a slide,

1149
01:59:46,470 --> 01:59:51,300
I have to figure out, is that just artifact or is that something that happened antemortem?

1150
01:59:51,780 --> 01:59:57,120
If it happened before death, there's almost always some tissue reaction, so there's usually a reason for it.

1151
01:59:57,120 --> 01:59:59,160
Maybe I'll find a clot. Maybe I'll find.
