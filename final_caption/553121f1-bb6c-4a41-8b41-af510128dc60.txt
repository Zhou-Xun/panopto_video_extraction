1
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:20,570
Okay. Welcome back. So today we're finally talking about our last topic, three buttons.

2
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:27,550
So looking ahead, actually, there will be two more classes.

3
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,060
So then we will finish and we will start this debate today.

4
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:37,970
We have Thanksgiving break next week and then we'll finish that report this the following week.

5
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:47,929
And then we will still have one more class in which I will do like a brief review and then we'll go over the exam, the final exam together.

6
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,010
So the final exam is take home. So it will be the same as your homework,

7
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,469
but I will do kind of like I will review everything with you to make sure that everything

8
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:02,720
is clear and then you will have some time during the last class to work on the exam here.

9
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,030
So if you have questions then I can answer and then you will have one week.

10
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,840
I mean, it will be due the next kind of like Friday.

11
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,460
And of course you can kind of like us any questions by email during that week.

12
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:25,580
Okay so you and you will have plenty of time is not a long so okay so let's talk about dietary patterns, which is actually one of my favorite topics.

13
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:41,330
I really like this topic. So today I will tell you why dietary pattern analysis, which is the rationale I suppose to do in nutrition analysis,

14
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,710
then I'll go into kind of like a brief introduction to the most popular method,

15
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:57,469
which is basically when we do the analysis, we have actually many options and those are those are the three most common.

16
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,620
I would I would say that the two first are the most common ones.

17
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,150
So we can use dietary indexes and there are thousands of dietary indexes.

18
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:09,379
We'll talk about two, we can use principal component analysis.

19
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,950
This is very popular. You probably have seen it in the literature a lot.

20
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,640
So then this is the thing that you will learn today as the method.

21
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,019
We can also do cluster analysis. That's for some version. I don't know.

22
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,219
That's not that popular. I mean, it's still you can see it is not that popular.

23
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:34,250
I will mention that briefly. And there are other methods and I'll talk about those briefly, kind of like next, I mean, in two weeks.

24
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:41,540
But most of the kind of level two classes will be about principal component analysis.

25
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,050
Have you ever done principal component analysis in other settings?

26
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,709
You have. Okay. This is not a technique that is used only in additional epi.

27
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,340
I mean, this is a data reduction technique, so is used in many other settings,

28
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,870
but it's actually very convenient for nutritional data and you will see why.

29
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:07,850
Okay. So most of the class again will go about going into that in detail and that's what you will be doing in the in the lab.

30
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:12,620
I'll show you this as a goal and most important, the output interpretation.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,860
Okay, so why kind of like dietary analysis? So let's compare with the traditional analysis with nutrients, which is, I mean,

32
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:29,310
when the the nutritional epidemiology field is I wouldn't want to say that down,

33
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,719
but is not as all as all this like infectious disease or something like that.

34
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,730
Right. So, so kind of like initially was very focused on nutrients, right?

35
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:42,590
Kind of like one nutrient, one disease. Right? So let's see if this nutrient is associated with this particular health outcome.

36
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:48,350
And this is definitely useful to understand the the biological relation between nutrition.

37
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:58,900
This is so that that's definitely very useful. But from a public health point of view, I mean, people don't go to the supermarket on binaries, right?

38
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,500
So they don't go to the URL of the protein or the URL of the saturated fat or things like that.

39
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,380
I mean, they really go and buy veggies, food and they don't buy.

40
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,070
So we know they buy food. Right. And fruits are composed by many lot.

41
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:24,290
Right. So kind of like looking at the other kind of like traditional analysis of nutrients.

42
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,389
It happens that I mean, fruits are very complex and complex combinations of nutrients and nutrients that interact with each other.

43
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:35,480
Right. It's not only I mean, it's very difficult to isolate the effect of of nutrients.

44
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:41,150
Right. And because nutrients come together, some of these are strongly correlated.

45
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:50,660
Right. So I'm not sure you remember, I, I think or maybe I'm saying this here, I'm mixing kind of like things like,

46
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:59,929
but remember the when I was talking about trans fatty acids with the Costa Rican Health Study and remember I was

47
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:05,780
telling you that the trans fatty acid is the main source of trans fatty acids in that population was soybean oil.

48
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,080
Right. Okay. So we know it was partially hydrogenated and then.

49
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:13,700
What happened is also kind of like the main source of alpha linolenic acid.

50
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,329
And that population was so benign because soybean oil is one of the main sources.

51
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:17,540
Right?

52
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:25,249
Otherwise, I mean, you can find it in other zeros, but there were others that they were kind of like consuming, like an all Afrocentric analyst.

53
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:31,069
Heinously ironic, but it was not consuming because I was only so, you know, and you can find it in nuts.

54
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,980
But the consumption of Nazi Koesterich was very low.

55
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:41,600
So basically you have this same food source that was kind of like having alpha linolenic and trans fatty acids, right?

56
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,890
So disentangle the effect of those two nutrients were difficult.

57
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,940
I mean, basically they were highly correlated and there were linearity problems.

58
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:59,090
So you need a really large sample sizes to do that. Right. Also, many times they would have some of these may be too small to be detected.

59
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,960
I mean, we know it's kind of like we know it has to be there.

60
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,420
I mean, there are biological reasons to believe that some specific nutrients are related to Sunday services.

61
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:16,069
But when we do the analysis, we don't see anything. And it's likely because it's that small that to that small association that you put together,

62
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:21,580
all the potential biases like measurement error or selection bias or confounding or whatever, then yes.

63
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,060
Right.

64
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:35,209
And then you also have the problem of going into the issue of multiple comparisons mean you take the whole list of nutrients that you can come that

65
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:44,060
comes with any food frequency question is have really large and a long list of nutrients and you compare all of them with your outcome just by chance.

66
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,960
A A few will be statistically significant.

67
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:54,680
Gray I mean, that's the natural type of low. That's your P value at 2.5.

68
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,730
But kind of like just by probability I mean 5% time.

69
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,500
I mean it could be like a significant result. That is not right.

70
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:07,489
So so you have to be careful about that.

71
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,380
I mean, of course, you can always correct by multiple comparisons, but I mean,

72
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,140
the whole issue of the multiple comparisons is funny because there's like I mean,

73
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:23,299
you look at in a paper like you have like a long list of kind of like nutrients,

74
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,690
then they will tell you, Oh, you have a problem of multiple comparison.

75
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:32,030
But if you take just kind of like a few nutrients and then you publish the papers,

76
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,530
then no one is going to tell you you have a problem on multiple comparisons, right?

77
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,930
Because they wouldn't be able to kind of like connect all their papers to with it.

78
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,430
But the problem is still that is the same population is the same list of nutrients, right?

79
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,910
So you're just kind of like doing salami anyway.

80
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:57,140
So another problem with nutrients is that the nutrient effect clearly may be confounded by the dietary pattern.

81
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:07,970
And one of the samples I like to use with this one is that what did you know about eggs, about consumption there?

82
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,610
Do you think that eggs are good or bad or. It is.

83
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,219
It's controversial, right? Why?

84
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:28,370
It's controversial because like every couple of years, people feel like cholesterol on eggs is killing everyone's cholesterol and it doesn't matter.

85
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,380
And why do you think it's so? Why do you think is that?

86
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:39,610
I mean, why I mean, they say that because of results, something so positive associations and something so inverse associations.

87
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:45,230
Right. So why do think that there are kind of like inconsistent associations?

88
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,490
How? Well, like, for example.

89
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:01,149
Yeah, the dietary. But then actually if you look at the most of the studies that show that eggs are not good for you

90
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:06,730
are coming from the US where probably the consumption and access associated with ACORN ancestors.

91
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:13,770
Right. But if you go to other countries in Europe or in Asia where eggs may be just part of a table,

92
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:19,810
like kind of like healthy pattern, then eggs are not only not associated but maybe even protective.

93
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:26,649
Because if you think about eggs, external just cholesterol packages and then eggs is a I mean,

94
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:31,180
they are an alternative source of protein that if you replace with meat, maybe better.

95
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:35,860
Right. It has also micronutrients. It has long change in three fatty acids.

96
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,080
I mean, kind of like if you are not consuming fish, at least you are getting something from x ray.

97
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,100
So it depends on context. It depends on dietary pattern.

98
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:54,040
So so for the Association of Eggs with Cardiovascular Disease, I, I strongly believe I may be wrong,

99
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:01,989
but I think that eggs are okay and they are they show a higher risk is because they are still receiver confounding by dietary Barton but all that kind

100
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:14,350
of like bacon and kind of like sausages come together right so so yeah so that's that's one and that happens with eggs and happens with many of us.

101
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:20,380
It's very so it depends and it depends on this, that the population are the best in the country because the dietary patterns are different.

102
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,030
Right. Okay. So that's that's the rationale.

103
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:31,780
The study via the report there straight instead of looking at the specific nutrition within specific foods, this just study the diet overall, right.

104
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:38,920
So the huge advantages of that is that you study the whole diet, which is really makes more sense.

105
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:44,680
And what is very important from a public health point of view is that you can translate those results into dietary

106
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:52,479
recommendations so you can tell people to eat more plant based it less red meat is more fish or something like that.

107
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,799
Instead of canola, you have to eat less saturated fat or even more polyunsaturated fat.

108
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,570
I mean, people don't really know.

109
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:10,380
I mean, the amount of poly and the amount of fat in things by reading food nutrition labels is very difficult for people who are not ri right.

110
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:21,390
So. And also kind of like helps with going away from this is a term that I like that

111
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:26,910
Michael Pollan going many years ago when he was kind of like publishing this book,

112
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:37,500
would actually say one of the most kind of like wise things that have been said in the recommendations like eat food,

113
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:44,400
real food, not too much and mostly plants. Right. So if everyone was doing that, everything would be much better.

114
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:50,040
Right. So anyway, so but that's not related to what I was going to say.

115
00:11:51,060 --> 00:12:01,950
He was talking about nutrition, some kind of like a something that because of the kind of like training to it in science,

116
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:09,629
because of going into that nutrition ism of oh I'm interested in this particular nutrient is this is from a science point of view,

117
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:15,630
that's perfectly fine. I mean, if we want to answer research questions, but from a public health point of view,

118
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:22,670
that that's a little dangerous because that's actually something that the industry is taking advantage of because I mean,

119
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,649
they are saying, oh, microwaves are good for this.

120
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:31,860
So then I'm going to kind of like put a bunch of microwaves in my junk food and then I'm going to sell it as something healthy.

121
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,550
Right. And that's what happened all the time.

122
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:41,190
I mean, you can see that all processed food has some kind of like claims, health claims that, oh, this is good for you because it has this.

123
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,760
Right. Well, I mean, no, I mean, there's still the whole thing is just garbage.

124
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:51,180
Right. So so that's that's one of the problems of the nutrient approach, which is, again,

125
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:57,570
it's okay if it kind of like is stays in the scientific arena but is not okay if

126
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:02,520
it gets kind of like translated wrongly by the food industry into the public.

127
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,910
Right. Okay.

128
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,340
So let's go into the most popular metal methods to analyze dietary patterns.

129
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:19,739
And I put those three in there. I mean, one is about component analysis, which is the one we will talk most about.

130
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:27,810
And there is some issue with the terminology, because sometimes you will see factor analysis, respiratory factor analysis.

131
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:37,699
And that's okay. I mean, it's not exactly the same when and but we will we will I mean, we will say that this is plausible.

132
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,180
But one analysis that there are few distinctions that it doesn't mean in practice it doesn't matter.

133
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:47,730
Right. The other one is cluster analysis and the other one the other one is not really a method.

134
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:57,060
That is just a way of kind of like translating the nutrition knowledge into into something we want to kind of like condense, right.

135
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:04,520
So the issue is that these two methods are consider what we call our posterity methods

136
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:09,719
because they are they are driven basically is whatever is in the data will I mean,

137
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,270
we will get the dietary pattern that comes from the correlation of the variables like while

138
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:20,729
this one that they added it index is considered an a priori method which is basically

139
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:27,590
based on Garvin nutrition knowledge ratio which basically you you can come up with that

140
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:33,110
dream this based on where you know that is good or it's bad right is not based on the data.

141
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,120
So there are advantages and disadvantages of this to kind of like approaches.

142
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:45,940
So, so let's start thinking about kind of like dietary and this is under dance of dietary.

143
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:51,300
This is I mean, the one the two examples I decided to talk about today.

144
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:57,480
One is the Mediterranean diet score, maybe because I'm from Spain, and the second one is the healthy eating index.

145
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,790
Can anyone tell me all their dietary indexes? How do you work with other.

146
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,959
You were familiar with this story. Let me.

147
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:28,170
Good. He did an alternate healthy eating index or an alternate healthy eating index based on the old one.

148
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,600
I'm going to talk about that one, but I am not sure he veto it.

149
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,350
Oh, that's the Lancet. Yeah. Yeah, they did the Lancet diet.

150
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,640
Yeah, he was involved in that. He was not the only one. Yeah. Yeah.

151
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:49,530
So that that's actually a very nice kind of like a sample of dietary index that takes into account not only the health of their diet,

152
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:53,309
but also the health of the planet. The sustainability. Right. So.

153
00:15:53,310 --> 00:16:06,550
So, yeah. What? All of this. Have you heard about the inflammatory the deadly inflammatory index?

154
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:13,090
I mean, that's that's actually one of this most of the dietary and this is usually a positive in this kind of like we are healthy indexes.

155
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:18,100
This one is the other way around. Right. So this one, is that going to like a harmful index?

156
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:30,340
The measures that the potential inflammation, inflammatory potential of the diet is there are I mean, there's the glycemic index.

157
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:39,400
Yeah, but the glycemic index is not really they say in this is is performed kind of like it's not really like an overall dietary pattern.

158
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,239
And I'm not sure if there is a Fodmap dietary index.

159
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,660
I don't think so. There are a lot that like are very individual too, like this in the Mediterranean diet,

160
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,240
but there's a lot they're very individual to like regional dietary patterns.

161
00:16:52,390 --> 00:17:02,560
And I've started doing a paper on traditional nigiri and just like in Japan, there was one that was focused on.

162
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:11,000
Traditional African doctor. Mm hmm. So those are, like, very individual, and sometimes they're developed for specific people.

163
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,490
Mm hmm. Yeah.

164
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:20,690
So basically, those are trying to come up with their own healthy index based on their own culinary kind of like and preferences in every country.

165
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:27,860
Yeah. Yeah. There's also the Nordic healthy diet or whatever and everything.

166
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:32,630
Yeah. Yeah. So so I mean, there's also the dash diet index.

167
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:38,900
So that is the American heart is that there are many I mean I mean, those that have really exploded.

168
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,330
Yes. The lion's diet. Sorry. I was just the mind's eye.

169
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,170
And it's like a mix between that dream and dash. Oh, I never heard I.

170
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:53,060
Oh, really? Oh, yeah, yeah, I think. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

171
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,049
There's so many that sometimes it's hard to keep up with all of them, right.

172
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:01,310
Because I mean, some of them become more kind of like popular and many people use them,

173
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:04,910
some of them not so specific that they are only used in a couple of papers.

174
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,910
But yeah, so let's look at the Mediterranean diet.

175
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:19,069
So the Mediterranean diet, I mean, this is, you know, the study of the Mediterranean diet kind of like how it came up to I mean,

176
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:25,730
this camp, like people in Sardinia, it wasn't it wasn't great I think.

177
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,300
But yeah. So that they there's that many, many,

178
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:35,270
many years ago when I was I think it wasn't so it was kind of like doing these studies in

179
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:42,170
Europe and he found kind of like that basically the people in the in the south of of Europe,

180
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,969
even though they were having a lot of fat because they were poor in their kind of

181
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:53,510
like salads and reducing olive oil because at that point the whole thing was fat.

182
00:18:53,660 --> 00:19:02,270
That's a whole not kind of like he was seeing like way much better outcomes seen in cardiovascular disease than in the north of Europe.

183
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:09,860
Right. So so that's when they realized that, oh, maybe it's that type of them and it's important or maybe there are other things.

184
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:15,530
So then that that's one kind of like they around those years the the Mediterranean diet kind of like

185
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:22,759
concept was coined and in theory the Mediterranean diet is what is consuming the Mediterranean countries.

186
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:34,330
But if you look at the Mediterranean that can run and is, it's kind of like a huge kind of like, uh, area that comprises many different cultures.

187
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,750
So I mean, sometimes they know that and diet has been, you know,

188
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:47,150
people say that is very Eurocentric and actually always kind of like what it is kind of like as consuming the Middle Easterners,

189
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,799
consuming North Africa. It's going from in Europe to right it kind of like across the continent.

190
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,840
So you shouldn't be too sensitive but anyway.

191
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:06,840
So anyway, so so basically really the Mediterranean diet is just like a healthy diet, plant based diet with olive oil by.

192
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:13,069
So that's that's kind of like I mean we think about if we take out the olive oil because I mean olive oil is mostly

193
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:18,530
consuming Mediterranean countries and we put and all that healthy oil then it won't be a mediterranean diet anymore.

194
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,770
It will be still a healthy diet, plant based diet, but it won't be that anything.

195
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:27,530
But that's what actually what people do when they try to translate that into other countries like the U.S. I mean,

196
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:30,679
they say, oh, this is a mediterranean diet,

197
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:37,400
but I mean, it's just a healthy diet because olive oil is kind of like the main thing of their of their of the made their diet.

198
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:51,500
But but still the the the whole idea is that really plant based with healthy food healthy sources of protein

199
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:59,630
like kind of like more poultry and more fish and less red meat and with kind of like not a lot of kind of like,

200
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,790
you know, so like I said, it's I mean,

201
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:11,269
it's kind of like the salad usually fruit after the dinner and or the lunch and and kind of like with with a lot of physical activity,

202
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,690
social interaction and so on that we never able to put in.

203
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,190
They, they spread it away. So, so that's the kind of like idea.

204
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,899
So the original Mediterranean score was actually very simple.

205
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:30,980
It was amazingly, shockingly simple. It was kind of like a greedy for a Greek population.

206
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,900
And what they did is that they chose a few kind of like items,

207
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:43,310
and then they consider that you were above the million of those beneficial items like veggies, fruits, legumes, fish.

208
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:52,159
Then you had to sign a one and it got to below the median, the median intake of the detrimental items like meats, high fat, dairy and so on.

209
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,310
Then you will have kind of like a one.

210
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:04,190
Right? So the idea that are above or below and the more points you have, the healthy your diet.

211
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:12,040
So on the score was ranging from zero, which means minimal compliance to the traditional term and 8 to 9.

212
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:23,979
So it was really actually it's a very good score, but even that score was kind of like associated with with important outcomes.

213
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,670
So probably you cannot see anything with this is a huge table.

214
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:33,340
But basically if you look at mortality for any cause mortality for going out,

215
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:39,340
how do they see so even mortality from cancer in the fully adjusted model, you can see that one change in two points.

216
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:45,010
I mean, it's associated with I mean, it comes with a hazard ratio of 75.67 and point 76.

217
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:51,270
And even when you stratify by by sex or age or whatever mean you can see some differences.

218
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:54,669
Is some kind of like some potential for effect modification.

219
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:57,820
But still the protective associations are there, right?

220
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:08,350
Since this kind of like a score, people have working variations of their mood that I know score and they have particular to be adapted

221
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:14,020
into this country sometimes instead of using kind of like like olive oil as a potential kind of lysine.

222
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,770
I mean, they just use kind of like they monotone saturated ratio.

223
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:26,319
Yes. Or kind of like some people have included more kind of like I am.

224
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,860
Some people have even excluded. I think the original score was including potatoes as a as a healthy item,

225
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:38,410
which in the context of the middle range that can be probably unhealthy item because it's okay.

226
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:42,730
But these are probably starchy veggies are probably okay if you use them as starchy veggies,

227
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:47,229
but they are not okay if you use them as French fries with a burger.

228
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:52,660
Right. So that's kind of like you. That's one of the problems of what we were talking about before with EX.

229
00:23:52,960 --> 00:24:00,160
If you move the same food out of the dietary pattern, it may look like a passing or may look like a good thing, right?

230
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:04,360
Yes. I just like looking at the age star condition.

231
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,610
It looks like the significant results are only in 35 years.

232
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,340
Is that more likely a power issue? Do that.

233
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:19,810
This is probably because heart disease and cancer more that I mean it's a matter of young people don't die right.

234
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:25,660
So I mean it's not that is I mean is likely that eventually they will reach that.

235
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:31,380
Yeah. That's what I remember about power I mean like there were just weren't enough deaths is sadness at.

236
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:38,540
Okay. So let's move into another one, which is the healthy eating index.

237
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:44,960
So the healthy eating in this, the original one actually was created a long time ago and was created in 1985.

238
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:51,290
And at that time, it was based on the all the USDA dietary recommendations.

239
00:24:51,590 --> 00:25:00,559
And this is an example of I mean, I told you that when you have a priority kind of like knowledge in the dietary indexes,

240
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,890
it may be a good thing because you're creating something that you know that you should work.

241
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:08,440
But if you're a priority, kind of that knowledge is not good, then it's not going to work.

242
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:14,660
So this is kind of like one of those examples because it was based on this pyramid.

243
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:22,970
Did you remember this pyramid? You have seen this one way, so, so and was wrong with this pyramid.

244
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:33,260
There are many things wrong here. Yeah. Well, especially like in the in the bottom one, the major part of groups.

245
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:41,470
And that's I mean it's very heavy and also doesn't doesn't distinguish between Walgreens and process.

246
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,899
Yeah, exactly. So all caps together.

247
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:52,570
So you could have just leave on the the light breath and then you will be eating healthy, which we know is not right.

248
00:25:53,470 --> 00:26:03,420
What else kind of like. All the software for plotting that to get it right.

249
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:12,270
So it doesn't differentiate between kind of red meat or kind of like leader, like poultry or for each of the farms.

250
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:19,230
I mean. SWITKOWSKI There but that's why I mean but also healthy also perfectly fine.

251
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:24,479
I mean this is kind of like the usual the typical low fat value that was kind of like recommended,

252
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:31,440
which we know that is human, be it right there is here like two or three servings of dairy.

253
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,379
It's kind of like very I know it's not a controversial thing,

254
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:40,580
but it's kind of like considering that most of the world is lactose intolerant, which shouldn't be there.

255
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:49,079
That was clearly the dairy lobby was kind of like pushing so that really many things that are

256
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:55,770
wrong and it solve later in the in the that that it guidelines for Americans but the original

257
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:01,290
healthy thing is this index was based on that so basically what would Margie McCullough did

258
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:08,730
in 2000 is that she said let's see how well this index is associated with this is I mean,

259
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:14,520
if the index is really good, then you should see it kind of like I mean, it's kind of like this is you eat well,

260
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:22,469
you should see a decrease in risk of that of any kind of like, I mean, chronic disease or cancer.

261
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:27,960
Right. But what happened here is that you look at these are kind of like quintiles of the healthy eating index.

262
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:35,760
So this is the reference and this is the people at the bottom, the people who are eating, you know, the compliant with the healthy eating index.

263
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,090
And this is the people are more compliant, which is supposed to be the healthier.

264
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:46,330
Right. And what is that you can see here? Is it an association?

265
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,549
There's nothing. I mean, it's breeding all for chronic disease.

266
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:05,630
And from cancer, that is some kind of like hint towards some protection, but not significant.

267
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,410
So, I mean, there's nothing. And why is that?

268
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:15,240
Well, because. Because clearly, the healthy eating is not really discriminating.

269
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,160
A good diet for a bad day. Right.

270
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:25,009
Is just kind of like there's a lot of misclassification because, yeah, you can be high in the healthy eating and having a healthy diet,

271
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:33,630
but you can also be high having a crappy diet based on on there that much white bread that you can have on that much red meat and feels like that.

272
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:37,219
Right. So what you think is that they I mean,

273
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:44,750
what they did to what they created this alternate healthy eating index that what was based more in the in their healthy eating pyramid,

274
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:49,129
which is closer to the Mediterranean diet pyramid.

275
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:55,580
So it's kind of like a spot in their body, kind of like the this plant here.

276
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:02,180
And then from there, fruits and veggies having this kind of less on going up or down,

277
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,990
but at least you finished it in between the key things that we were discussing before.

278
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:11,540
And when you do this and you reclassify people then now you can see that

279
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:16,669
actually the alternate healthy eating index is associated with health outcomes.

280
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:21,590
Right. Is associated with major chronic disease, with cardiovascular disease.

281
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,100
And the only one that is not really associated with is with cancer, which I mean,

282
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:32,420
in a way makes sense because we know that cancer is difficult outcome for dietary purposes

283
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:37,700
because sometimes that we don't know what is the value that is relevant for cancer.

284
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:44,239
I mean, it may be not that you were eating the last few years that you already know some of the lesson or the diet that you were exposed to,

285
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,210
such as a fetus. Right. So so it's kind of like it's more complicated, but for cardiovascular,

286
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:55,310
which we know there is a clear relationship between diet and cardiovascular, the association was there.

287
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,489
Right. So anyway, so now, I mean, the good thing is that now there are new versions of the healthy eating index

288
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:06,350
that are based on the new guidelines that are really classify much better.

289
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:11,940
So. So this example I gave you was in the past, but now the, the,

290
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:18,020
the more recent version is the healthier index 2015, which is based on the dietary guidelines of 2020.

291
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,910
And hopefully, I mean,

292
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:28,880
so probably will have a new one and also kind of like really classify it better and you can use it in your research if you want.

293
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:34,100
As an example, using this kind of like new healthy eating index,

294
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:47,420
you can see that the the American diet is not particularly healthy for Chile and that really is even worse by by age.

295
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:52,960
And then you can see that it hasn't really improved much over the years.

296
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,330
And you know that I mean, we don't have that that few years back.

297
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:00,680
And I'm like, no, no, no, no. Super huge improvements.

298
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,929
And you get I mean, this is 59% a scale from 0 to 400.

299
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:14,350
So it's not particularly great. So anyway, okay, so that's for kind of like eating indexes.

300
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:21,439
So now I'm going to briefly tell you about cluster analysis and then we will move into principal component analysis,

301
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:29,059
which is what I want you to learn in the day. So cluster analysis, basically,

302
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:36,560
what I am going to do is to make sure that you realize about this kind of like the difference

303
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:41,629
between cluster analysis and principal component analysis with principal component analysis,

304
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:48,980
what you're doing is that your group input, right? So you are coming up with dietary patterns that are grouping foods.

305
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:56,630
So basically you make come up with fruits and veggies, but then they kind of like healthy pattern or their junk food pattern for example.

306
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:02,390
And then people can follow those patterns more or less, right.

307
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:09,709
And it's possible that there people who follow both, I mean, which sounds a little weird, but it's possible.

308
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:13,280
I always put the my example, I follow a mediterranean diet,

309
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:21,140
but if I kind of like if I were no study of diet and then I answer my since I also have a sweet tooth.

310
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,440
So if there's a dietary pattern that kind of like it's got that I see like kind of like chocolate and things like that,

311
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:34,070
I probably will also be in those, right? So I still have my high in Mediterranean diet buy high in sweets, right?

312
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:43,160
So that's where, you know, cluster analysis, what they do is that they group people, clusters of people, not foot clusters of people.

313
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:50,900
So basically they put you in a group in the group of the food lovers or in the group of the convenience junkies.

314
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,680
So whatever. I think I was right.

315
00:32:53,680 --> 00:33:01,990
I mean, there had to be those dietary partners that maybe you are in the group of the Mediterranean diet people or in the group of the I don't know,

316
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:06,280
Japanese people. I don't know. So it depends on the study population.

317
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,090
Basically, you belong to a group of people, right? Not so.

318
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:15,550
Just remember BCA, the group put out an analysis of people.

319
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,690
Okay, and this is an example of cluster analysis.

320
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:22,900
This was done in the framing and policy study.

321
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:30,489
They were looking at bone mineral density as the outcome and they were looking at the other bodies in older adults.

322
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:35,379
And they found six patterns of those six patterns, six groups of people.

323
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:43,720
So basically they found people who would have high may very brave people who were high in meat and sweet milk products,

324
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,320
people who were high in sweet weight products. People only people.

325
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:52,990
People who were high enough, older people who were hanging on this and the people who were high in fruits, veggies and severe.

326
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:55,690
Right. So that's how they classified people.

327
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:04,210
And then when they were looking at the differences of those different groups in kind of like with one mineral density,

328
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:10,120
you can see that there are kind of like for example here for the I mean,

329
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:19,780
they have different places to look at their bone mineral density like there they are looking in the femur and mimic in the in the cancer area.

330
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:23,470
This is the worst area and this is in the right direction, different places.

331
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:34,720
So you can see that no matter which one you see, there is one in both men and women that is kind of like showing their height.

332
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:38,820
And guess what? That's their fruit and veggies people, right?

333
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:48,370
So kind of like the people who follow a healthier diet have higher mineral density and then you can also find some that are lower.

334
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:53,259
Right. And guess what does that kind of like candy people, right.

335
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:57,880
So we know that sugar is not good for you. So now what is kind of like it makes a lot of sense.

336
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,010
So anyway, so that's enough. Let's move into principal component analysis.

337
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:13,240
So you probably if you check the literature, you will see that many people have used principal component analysis to get dietary patterns.

338
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:19,060
And depending on the study populations they use, they come up with different dietary patterns.

339
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:25,060
Right. And some of the that report is a half identify high income countries and these

340
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:29,230
are kind of like particularly the first two are kind of like very reliable.

341
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:32,860
I mean, no matter where you go, you always find this to others.

342
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:41,799
So you find like what we call a Western Westernized mother dietary porter, which is high in red and processed meats.

343
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:50,830
But it is about the refined city also kind of like a not very healthy reporter and what we call a prudent or healthy or veggie or whatever.

344
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:56,980
I mean, the name is changes, right? Which is like more like a veggie fruit, legumes, fish, wholegrains.

345
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,400
So kind of like more like plant based and kind of like healthy, right?

346
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:10,989
So those two patterns, well, with some differences of color and some variations, but they always kind of like show every time you do this analysis,

347
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:16,959
particularly in high income countries, all the butters that we have seen sometimes is the highest,

348
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:25,060
which the one they will be is going high, and that is by a single case ice cream so full and depending on the places you go,

349
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,080
you may end up finding the run in which is similar to the line.

350
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:36,969
But in grocery for racial that you go to that in countries you will find a mediterranean both botanically and there all that.

351
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:43,480
But those are probably the most kind of like popular, as popular as you will see.

352
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:50,470
So yes. Is it like are the dietary patterns identified just through like having you?

353
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,540
Most of the time, yes.

354
00:36:52,900 --> 00:37:00,940
Sometimes some people have use of the 24 hour course is is a bit of a pain to do it with 24 hour calls because you have to group the force,

355
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,220
but you can do it. But most of the time is with it, of course. Yeah. Okay.

356
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:12,520
So this is kind of like an example. This is one of the one of the probably first papers on dietary,

357
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:18,250
but there's usually this you that and this I think it was done in the nurses health study.

358
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:21,999
So they identify and that's where the names come from.

359
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,829
I mean, they call it like a western border are brilliant button and it makes sense because I mean those

360
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:31,450
are kind of lazy when go to the front of all these which can be interpreted as correlation.

361
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,890
So there is a high the disease is kind of like more imbalanced and it lighter.

362
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:41,200
So you can see that things like with made structures made smothered what they thought, if I see this lady,

363
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:46,209
I'm going to be really hyper highly correlated and for the improvement that is the

364
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:50,790
other way I might be healthy feels like maybe small two grams fish I'm always.

365
00:37:52,590 --> 00:38:03,840
And when you look at kind of like associations of those partners, when you can do that, you can divide at the end of your physical component.

366
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:09,810
Alex and I will explain this in detail later. You will come up with some sort of a score.

367
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:15,390
Right. And the idea that score, the higher your score, the higher your compliance with the pattern.

368
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:18,959
So then you use that score to then categorize it.

369
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,970
In Quintiles, you have people firing the first, second, third, fourth and fifth,

370
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:30,959
and they a people in the first with that are the people who are less compliant with the bottom in this situation

371
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,850
that proven and people in the fifth quintile is a people more compliant ratio kind of like going from here.

372
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:41,790
Look here in theory they are getting a healthier diet, right.

373
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,190
And then you can see if you look at that, this is their risk.

374
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:55,500
I this is you can see that it goes with expectations which are very good hypotheses that really the relative risk decreases

375
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:05,590
as you get higher in the score for the proven that they report that while you do the same for the Western partner.

376
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:11,429
So again, you see the favor I mean a positive association.

377
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:17,370
Is that so? They hired you going to the Western border compliance.

378
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:26,229
They hired your risk for coronary heart disease. Okay.

379
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:32,800
So so those are mostly in high income countries, but in low middle income countries.

380
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:39,230
I mean, you have to think about that. Those reports are go to specific.

381
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:43,360
Even if you're going to go to Japan,

382
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:49,030
you will see the Japanese data that it particularly but that that data probably will be like what we going to see.

383
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:52,900
That approval will still be high in fruits and veggies and fish and so on.

384
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:59,710
But also in some countries that are still going through the nutrition transition,

385
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:10,690
what you will see is this kind of like kind of like traditional or neo traditional barter system with the westernization of the diet.

386
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:17,080
Right. So it's kind of like some countries have already gone through the nutrition decisions or less in the past,

387
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,550
but all this are still probably going in in that.

388
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,060
So they still there are some traditional remnants in the in the dietary patterns.

389
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:30,160
Right. So so when you do this type of analysis,

390
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:38,440
you have to think about your study population because your study population is one that is going through nutrition transition.

391
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:45,820
You want to pay attention to those kind of like traditional items because you

392
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:50,200
don't want to group them just because they are healthy or healthy or whatever,

393
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,629
because otherwise then the traditional dietary pattern,

394
00:40:52,630 --> 00:41:01,740
one image you will be kind of like putting together and you will see what I mean when I when I go into more evidence into the Costa Rican example.

395
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:08,379
Okay. So any questions I'm talking about today?

396
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:16,160
I know, but but now finally we see what it is and how to do it.

397
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:22,930
So basically, principle component analysis is just a data reduction technique.

398
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:23,580
Right.

399
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:34,330
So is is some way of creating one or more summary variables and those are called principal components or factors from a set of original variables.

400
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:39,610
So the idea is that you have you think about a food frequency questionnaire.

401
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:49,970
You have a huge list of foods. Right. Let's say you have 155, for example, which is a normal kind of like a number of foods in a few.

402
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,200
That's a lot of weight. Right. So you kind of say, okay, let's go and look at every food.

403
00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:03,760
How is associated with kind of like the the outcomes. And then you will end up with the problem of multiple comparisons, right?

404
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:12,879
So by you know that some foods are correlated with others because that there's some dietary pattern embedded in the population.

405
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:22,280
I mean, people eat since together, right? So, so then you can kind of like take advantage of that correlation to create some summary variables, right?

406
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:25,540
And the summary variables are going to be your dietary partners. Right.

407
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:32,480
So the whole thing is to come up with some variable reduction.

408
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:42,640
So instead of having 135 variables of what, in the end you will end up with maybe two or three or four no more than four dietary patterns.

409
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,360
So that's that's that's very powerful, right?

410
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:51,849
Because that's kind of like summarizing the whole variability in the foods into some kind of like variables,

411
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:55,270
the next sentence and then you can use as your new variables.

412
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:04,350
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to explain how it works using an example from the someone islands.

413
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:08,580
So so the someone islands.

414
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:19,290
Well, now that map is kind of like not very varied because it's not always the same way anymore.

415
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:23,099
It's similar, but kind of like they comprise like two different territory.

416
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,130
Everybody is going to be independent somewhat and then they're money going somewhere.

417
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:33,179
Right. And this is actually over the years, this became like a natural experiment, actually,

418
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:40,480
because what happened is that we were seeing the nutrition transition going in these islands at different speeds.

419
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,650
I mean, clearly, the American Samoa was going much faster.

420
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:49,679
Right. Because I mean, they were receiving more attention from the US.

421
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:55,380
Right. Than it was to somewhat of we were seeing kind of like how people were becoming

422
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:02,070
more kind of like obese with more diabetes and with mercury high disease.

423
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:08,219
And that's what is probably because of diet and exercise.

424
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:11,940
Right. So and also many other things, of course, I mean, this multifaceted.

425
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,870
But in this situation, that nutrition transition was kind of like making a lot of kind of life form.

426
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:27,059
So so what is interesting about the the Samoa diet is that the new tradition I mean,

427
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:34,020
I'm talking about nutrition now because I was working in the someone that I was working with an anthropologist and he was telling me,

428
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,090
you cannot call this traditional because we don't know what traditionally.

429
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:43,710
Right. And it's true. I mean, this is I we don't know what happened in like three centuries ago or for centuries ago,

430
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:50,010
but kind of like the more traditional items in the salmon diet.

431
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:54,450
The salmon, they consume a lot of coconut products. Right.

432
00:44:54,810 --> 00:45:00,110
So they use coconut coconut sauce. They put it in almost any item.

433
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:04,020
Right. And and we know that coconut is highly saturated fat.

434
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:08,129
We know that is not that saturated fat as opposed to way worse.

435
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:09,600
I mean, it's mostly Lauric Acid,

436
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:17,640
which is short chain fatty acids and gonads and all that kind of like controversial issue that I don't want to go into.

437
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:25,310
But it's kind of like said if I buy. But on top of that, I mean, we know that again, not everything is is is a lot of fat.

438
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,040
And then they also have like tropical fruit and they have they are island.

439
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:38,730
So they have a lot of fish. Right. And they traditionally they don't have so many refined flours as they were moving into a more Westernized diet,

440
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:43,559
that intake of fish was decreasing, the intake of fruits was decreasing.

441
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,629
Also kind of the fiber coming from fruits,

442
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:53,390
another kind of like veggies was decreasing and the intake of refined flours was increasing and red meat also.

443
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:59,910
So it's kind of like they were westernized in their diets. So as they were moving from that traditional butter to a more Westernized,

444
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:06,660
but then they were actually doing worse regardless of the saturated fat in the coconut, which was very interesting.

445
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:11,910
So anyway, so, so how do you the principle component?

446
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:21,420
So the first thing is that you need your dietary and your dietary that us was nice and very it was a very smart question.

447
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,680
Usually comes on a food questionnaire, but it could be also 24 hour cultural dietary records.

448
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:31,590
But it's much easier to do it for an efficacy questionnaire because it's the same list for everyone.

449
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:35,220
But one is when it's coming from 24 hour record.

450
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:41,570
You have to do a lot of data management to standardize that in in food that everyone is consuming.

451
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:47,610
Right. And then the idea is that the foods are going to group according to correlation.

452
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:53,490
Right. So the idea is that foods that are correlated will show up together in the same dietary patterns.

453
00:46:53,490 --> 00:47:03,270
I do think about, for example, I don't know what you will see in your lab that you will be working with the Costa Rican data.

454
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:08,640
So what are two things that are most likely to be correlated in a Central American diet?

455
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:15,690
Thinking about three. Exactly. Some things I simply said that would be highly correlated because people eat them together, right?

456
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:20,849
If you go to other countries, they may not be great at all, but in Central America they will be great.

457
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:25,930
It's part of the of the of the local gastronomy.

458
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:32,069
Right. So anyway, so so there are different approaches always.

459
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:34,770
And then we will talk about that because depending on the different approaches,

460
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:39,670
you may end up doing a lot of sensitivity analysis in the end and try using one or the other.

461
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:46,350
Right. You can enter all foods or you can group effort, right?

462
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:50,160
So why you should do one or the other?

463
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:55,740
It depends on how many foods you have. If you don't, you have a short for food questionnaire, which it was the.

464
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:59,600
Of this, someone with requisite first internationally free items.

465
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:04,670
So then we decided not to group anything. And then just. And then all the other efforts.

466
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:09,200
Right. But did you have a longer feel for the gossip question that you want to report?

467
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,350
Because otherwise the analysis is a little unstable.

468
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:20,330
Right. So you want to group foods and based on your a priori knowledge of what things should go together,

469
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:23,450
like, for example, you can group your veggies together, right?

470
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:30,469
Or you can group your kind of like poultry on one side and the red meat and processed meats in another side.

471
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:32,170
And the you're not kind of like, I mean,

472
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:39,179
this that makes sense in terms of what you really think that you're going to see if you are in a country nutrition decision.

473
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:42,409
And you also have to pay attention to those traditional foods and those more than

474
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:45,890
nice foods and don't put them together even if they are both healthy or unhealthy.

475
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:52,399
Right. Because if you put them together, you will never see that traditional versus westernized.

476
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,700
But that. Right. Okay. So that's that's one thing.

477
00:48:55,850 --> 00:49:03,770
Now, the other thing is that remember I told you why it's important to adjust for total energy intake.

478
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:08,989
Right. Because we want to assess dietary composition and we want to make sure that the calorie intake

479
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:14,300
is not going to add any strenuous radiation and is not going to confound our associations.

480
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,020
So you also need to adjust for the here.

481
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:23,660
I mean, those are kind of low frequency or grams or whatever of the foods, but you have to adjust for total area intake.

482
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:25,490
But you have two options.

483
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:35,570
You can adjust for that energy intake at this stage when you are just preparing your food or you can adjust for the intake later,

484
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:42,020
maybe in the analysis, or you can try both. So, I mean, there are different ways of doing this.

485
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:49,370
So the first step that you have to do is work with your dataset.

486
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:59,810
And so group your food. You have to either you have missing in there in missing intake, then you either have to delete those people.

487
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:07,190
Or if you think that there are only a few missing and you can assume that those are going to be zero intake, then you have to replace those by zero.

488
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,180
Okay. And then you can adjust for total intake or not either.

489
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:16,429
So then you have to prepare your that said, to kind of make sure that is ready for the analysis.

490
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:21,260
Now, this step is for you, for the future, for the lab.

491
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:24,520
You already have these done, so you don't have to do anything.

492
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:32,860
So what you are going to have for the lab is already groups of foods that are already adjusted for total energy intake and they are not missing.

493
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:36,080
So then you can just throw them directly into the analysis.

494
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:41,540
Okay. So the second step and this is already part of the analysis,

495
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:49,070
already part of running your protractor was that is going to do on any other package

496
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:53,089
is the first thing is going to really look at a correlation matrix among your food.

497
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:57,020
Some food groups, rice is kind of like it's going to see how correlated they are with each other

498
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,840
because that's correlations are the ones that are going to kind of like lead the,

499
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:08,420
the, the, the dietary patterns. Okay. So, so you can, you can look at that or.

500
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:15,350
No, I mean, because if you do that separately, then you already get an idea of, oh, rice and beans are going to be together, right.

501
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:18,979
Or things like that. I mean, it's not necessarily because that is going to do that for you.

502
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:21,590
Right. But that's that's how the process works.

503
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:33,620
And now once you run your block factor, what is going to happen is that the principal components are going to be extractive based on that correlation.

504
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:41,180
Okay. So what happened? And remember, the principal components are the new summary variables.

505
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:46,520
Those are the ones that are explaining the variability in the effort.

506
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:55,160
Right. And the idea is that the first principal component that SAS will instruct is place the maximum variance in the data.

507
00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:01,160
The second explains the remaining maximum variance and so on.

508
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:10,400
Okay. So the idea is that this sounds a little weird because what happened is that you have 55 variables in there that are, say,

509
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:20,720
55 foot and then you put your foot in the analysis then says is going to get 55 principal components and then you are probably thinking like what?

510
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,740
I mean? So we want to get just a few summary variables.

511
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:30,079
Yeah, that's fine. But then what happened is that you are not you are going to include most of them, right?

512
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:38,710
So you are only going to get the first few that display the maximum variance and that makes it blurry.

513
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:48,049
Or else you will see a better link to two things that I kind of like will measure now,

514
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:55,250
but you will see more clearly there is that those principal components are uncorrelated and just.

515
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:05,780
Leave it there and then I will go back to that later. Okay. And also, the principal components are often rotated to get a simple instruction.

516
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:12,890
And then this sounds like what are you talking about? I know I cannot like explain that later.

517
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:20,630
So the terminology in factor analysis and possible component camp comes from Matrix Theory.

518
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:28,610
So then you will see in your source output things like eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which I think is German.

519
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:33,019
Are I think principal values are probably anyway. Not at first.

520
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:39,530
The person who wrote a letter. Right. So but you will see it is I mean, you probably see like a bunch of things.

521
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:44,510
So that sounds like we think about eigenvalues as a.

522
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:51,050
Right. Okay. That's that's what it is. So they can values is just how much variants are displayed.

523
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:55,640
So the higher the value of the eigenvalue, the higher the variance is is plain.

524
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:06,820
This is the code. So the code is actually not that kind of like, you know,

525
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:13,149
I put all these options here being like in different lines, but they belong to the same length.

526
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:16,630
And we know that from here to here there's only semicolon.

527
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:21,030
So then you can put them and I'm making a long line, but I believe that he has.

528
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:29,140
I mean, you don't forget to put some of them, not all of them are necessary, but but also kind of like into the most important ones.

529
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:39,960
So the first thing is that prop factor is used for many other options than principal component analysis.

530
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:40,270
Okay.

531
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:49,210
So we're not in the method for putting images that I wrote about by component analysis, but I can use it also for doing other things like reviews,

532
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:57,520
things that are kind of like similar but are not exactly the same, like revision, regulation of facilities for regression or other things.

533
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,620
Right. I'll mention those briefly into it.

534
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:05,020
So. Okay, but today we are only doing BCA so then we will use that.

535
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:15,790
Okay. Now this thing that says rotate, very much so because we are going to rotate the function and we are going to use a very much rotation.

536
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:20,050
Now we could use all the double rotations, but we're going to use this one.

537
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:25,180
And the reason for doing this one is because this is this is what are very much rotations.

538
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:35,200
So the idea is that imagine this is the geometric representation of your principal component,

539
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,910
kind of like you have got to really see that this one doesn't have default.

540
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:45,220
And then this is one of your components if one and this is another of your components.

541
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:50,019
And then when I told you they are uncorrelated is because the way that you

542
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:54,940
are kind of like getting these mathematically they are perpendicularly means

543
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:59,979
that they are uncorrelated but they react with it kind of like you have something

544
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:06,190
like that will happen is that these fruits are kind of like having high,

545
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:10,450
low values in both kind of like factors.

546
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:15,570
And these other fruits are having high low this year the kind of like inverse about this, right?

547
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,130
So the structure is not that clear.

548
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:30,040
So to make this structure more clear for you is that you take this axis and then you rotate them in and also only way.

549
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:34,540
So they're still perpendicular. So this is equal to this one, right.

550
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:48,430
And by doing this, what you manage to do is that now these foods have high, low these in at one but zero, kind of like in the other one.

551
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:56,110
And these two foods and I know this in this kind of like you're not doing this others

552
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:01,780
but zero in the other way so you are making the structure of the others more clear.

553
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:05,830
And now this sounds a little kind of like from a mathematical point of view,

554
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:14,610
but these are the the the kind of like underlying idea is, is to make the patterns that make more sense.

555
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,700
UNISON I know this sounds like cheating, right? But we are not cheating.

556
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:26,920
I mean, we are still keeping that variability and that kind of thing and the fact that the rotation we're using these or so now,

557
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:34,240
so these two things are still perpendicular. It means that the rotated patterns are still uncorrelated.

558
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:43,000
And this is very important. And you have that question in the lab that what happened is that if one pattern is and correlated with the other,

559
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:48,300
I mean, they are not correlated at all. Okay. So that means that they cannot come from each other, right?

560
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:52,360
Because in order to confirm something, you have to have a correlation between the two things, right?

561
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:57,610
So patterns from being perceived by component analysis are not correlated.

562
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:04,510
If they are not correlated, they cannot confound each other. So please don't answer that question wrong.

563
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:12,430
Okay, I'm telling you the answer. If we do another rotation, there are some rotations that you may see.

564
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:17,469
Some people in the literature sometimes use all the rotations like an oblique rotation,

565
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:21,520
for example, an oblique rotation is no longer and also a rotation.

566
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:25,240
So that allows for correlation between the dietary patterns.

567
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:31,110
So then in that situation, then yes, the patterns could confound each other, but that's not what we are doing here.

568
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:36,880
Okay, so then here it cannot confine each other because of their zonal rotation.

569
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:42,580
They are still perpendicular. Okay, let's go back to the to the score.

570
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:51,580
And as we I know that this looks very kind of like absurd, but as we start looking at the data, it will be it will be matches more.

571
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,890
So this in fact, this is the number of factors that you're going to.

572
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:01,970
So when you run your analysis.

573
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:10,200
You're going to run it first with a relatively high number, like, for example, eight.

574
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,580
Even if only you have 55 in Miami, let's say it.

575
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,740
So eight is still a lot of water that you probably don't want to return in so many, but it's okay.

576
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:28,030
So the idea that once you have to run your analysis like a couple of things, the first one is just to look at, I mean, how things look, right?

577
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:32,350
Remember, this is a data driven analysis. So you have to look at your data to make decisions.

578
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:40,590
So then once you look at the data, you they say, oh, no, I'm going to retain only this two factors or these three factors or these four.

579
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:44,700
Then that's the number that you have to put here. Okay. I want to retire three.

580
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:48,270
I would put a three. I want to three, four, four. If I want to retain eight, eight.

581
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:57,210
Okay. So, yes, when you're so in real world analysis, when you're deciding how many partners to retain,

582
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,960
does it is it based off of the high end value it's based on?

583
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:06,450
Yeah, I'll go there. Yeah, it's based on a few things, but in the end, it's mostly based on vague values.

584
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:09,300
But in the end, it's also I mean,

585
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:17,999
also it's also based on interpretability because if they are not interpretable and the eigenvalues initially kind of lie, sometimes very conservative.

586
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,020
So you are basically and then the eigenvalue will be within too many factors.

587
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:26,549
But I'll also see some papers where they're like, well, like in these studies they used three.

588
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:29,550
So for replicability we're going to use three.

589
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:36,780
Yeah. Now you can do that. I mean, when you do principle analysis, it's good to do a lot of sensitivity analysis.

590
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:43,230
So let's say we use three, but we also kind of like kind of like now we do four or then now either.

591
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:47,900
Yeah. So you okay. So we'll going to do that.

592
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:51,420
Now this you can forget about that.

593
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:55,500
This is this place, this go coefficients but this is not that relevant.

594
01:00:57,690 --> 01:01:00,629
This thing screen is going to display this play,

595
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:07,650
this group plot and this group plot is very important for you to say how many kind of like photos you're going to repeat.

596
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:14,459
So I'll go into that now. And this flexfield is actually just for muddying thing.

597
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:20,890
Again, this is not a super relevant scene, but this help will happen is that when you get the patterns,

598
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:27,450
you are going to get a loading for every for this like a correlation coefficient for every single fourth.

599
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:34,500
So you have 55 foods, you are going to get 55 correlations for one part and 55 collisions for another and for another for another.

600
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:39,930
That's a lot of numbers for you. Do kind of like check which ones are high or not.

601
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:44,879
So then that's why here I'm using this flat point for is like I'm going to say

602
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,650
okay if anything about point four is something that it's worth to look at.

603
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:55,560
Okay. So then by flagging that I'm just going to lie not looking at the other thing and

604
01:01:55,560 --> 01:02:00,360
you will see that the format is like basically the things will go like like missing.

605
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:04,500
Like, I mean they are not missing their value, but if you have a value below point four,

606
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:12,420
so that way I only look at the values that are above point four and then I can kind of like better discriminate if they make sense or not.

607
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:22,860
Right. You will see that. So don't worry about that. So when you run your SAS thing and then we will run it together.

608
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:26,040
So don't worry. One of the first things that you see is that.

609
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:35,320
I don't know why I told you. 55. I mean, 42. Okay. Sorry.

610
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:38,650
I thought he was 55. So this is the same one.

611
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:43,660
If you had 40 to 40. Think. Oh, I think it's because I was working with you.

612
01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:50,200
I mean, I was working with many that SS from someone from different years and some of them have criticized, some they have added.

613
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:53,860
So this example is 42. So then what happened?

614
01:02:54,510 --> 01:03:01,180
I just remember I told you we have 42 votes. Then we put them there and they say, this is going to give you 42 factors,

615
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:07,690
which is kind of like, well, I mean, this is going to exactly the same number as what you have.

616
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:12,130
And, of course, is like, I'm not going to keep all of them because then what's the point?

617
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:16,090
I'm in for keeping 42. Then I will give the 42 votes.

618
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:19,420
Right. So what happened is that you are going to look at these values.

619
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:29,830
This is their core value. Right. And you can see that the first few are really high and the height it's higher 6.9 for going to the party.

620
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:35,500
And then suddenly they start going kind of like lower. And then at some point they go below one.

621
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:39,940
When they go below one, you just discarding completely.

622
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:45,020
Right. Because going below one means that this less vulnerability that just one fourth.

623
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:54,310
Right. So then you don't want to know anything about that. So just just by that, you are at 12 now, which is still a huge number.

624
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:58,220
Right. But I believe they're describing that represented the first time I forget about those.

625
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:04,420
Right. And then what you can see here also is that you're not only have that eigenvalue,

626
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:10,309
but you have kind of like the difference with the net one and you have which is important,

627
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:14,620
the proportion, which means this is the proportional variance, right?

628
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:20,930
So they can values kind of like like absolute variability and the proportion is more like in terms of proportion.

629
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:30,280
So then basically is telling you that the first factor explains 16% of the variability in the data, which is not that right.

630
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:38,020
Now the second one is placing 10% remaining and the third one represents 5%.

631
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:48,520
And and then you can see this is the cumulative. So then if you've retained three, you will end up explaining 32% of the variability in the data,

632
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:52,900
which for dietary data is not looking for other things.

633
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:59,920
Maybe better for data. That is pretty good, right? So just looking at that, you may already be say like, oh,

634
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:06,850
actually it looks like I'm probably going to regain between three and maybe four, five no more.

635
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:11,320
Right? Because the rest I'm not adding that much.

636
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:23,980
Right. And this is actually what's going next is that this this same thing is going to be represented in script, a script plot.

637
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:29,139
And we and this plot is a better kind of like visual way of deciding that.

638
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:35,350
But is the same information because how are you going to retain the factors?

639
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:40,959
The first thing I already told you, anything that is below.

640
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:47,520
I mean, you will live in the one above one. So anything below one you already discard completely, but still you get 12.

641
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:52,300
But now you look at the percentage by the split and then you look at the ones on

642
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:55,690
top because those are the ones that are really extending all of the variability.

643
01:05:56,050 --> 01:06:02,410
Right. For that, you can look at that they want to give you or this group, not that I will show you enough and they'll find that.

644
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:06,940
And then for those, you are already kind of like going to three, four or five, no more than that.

645
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:14,020
Right. And then finally among those three, four or five, you look at interpretability, and for interpretability,

646
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:21,490
you have to actually go the next step that I'll show you now to look at the the loadings for the foot to see if they make sense.

647
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,750
Right. And we will see that. Well, let's do this.

648
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:30,729
Let's look at the script and I'll give you like five minute breaks because it's too much information.

649
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:35,530
So this is this group log, this clip of what is doing is this this is very good value.

650
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:38,950
So then what he's doing is taking that information from this table.

651
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:45,130
Remember that he was the first one was 6.9, 4.2 and that was bloody.

652
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:52,180
Right. So then, then the first factor is a six point something.

653
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:56,650
But I mean, this is this is after they've had some idea of how many to be.

654
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:01,150
The second factor is four point something. Then the third one is to buy something.

655
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:06,240
And then you got your first scene after the fourth feed your fantasy level plan, right?

656
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:12,459
I mean, theorists call it scribbler because in theory you should see like a break here.

657
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:14,980
It's kind of like like something or something like that, right?

658
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:22,540
Kind of like you see going from here, here and then suddenly and by like you're going to see like a lot of variability.

659
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:30,120
Explain that happens a lot in other films in that you have something you've done pop up the.

660
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:39,430
Which makes your kind of like decision a little more difficult because the idea that the moment you see a break, you discard the rest.

661
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:44,390
But she had the break to be around here.

662
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:48,390
Right. So it's kind of like the eye of the beholder to decide what is the break.

663
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:55,240
I mean, there's no ugly break. It's okay. I mean, you should be somewhat here, which is what we decided before.

664
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:59,540
Right. So it sounds like these are the ones that spend a lot of money.

665
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:04,300
These are not really estimated. Almost anybody. Okay.

666
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:11,050
Okay. Let's let's take a five minute break and then we will continue.

667
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:16,750
This is what I'm doing. But we continue with it with the these.

668
01:08:57,210 --> 01:09:38,020
I. Oh.

669
01:11:50,110 --> 01:12:33,780
You had. Okay.

670
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:38,010
Let's go back. And hopefully, I mean, we're almost done with this part.

671
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:45,270
Okay. So then the next thing that you're going to get is that remember I was saying

672
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:48,810
that I was going to retain three factors in my initial kind of like gold.

673
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:52,440
So then those are the three factors that I'm retaining.

674
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:56,720
And then the problem is that this is not a rotated fatal pattern.

675
01:12:56,730 --> 01:13:03,420
So then you can kind of like ignore this part, okay? And then go and but don't get confused because you will get to the next one.

676
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:06,630
You're going to ignore these two. Right.

677
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:13,730
And then this is the one that you have to look at, which it looks exactly the same to this one, but it's actually not the same one.

678
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:23,610
I mean, look at this. It says that's the pattern. And then this one says rotated factor pattern.

679
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:26,880
So this is the one that you're going to look at. Right. Because we are doing the rotation.

680
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:33,060
The rotation is going to help with interpretability. Right. So now in this.

681
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:47,620
This this output actually in a lot of different issues with it, with the formatting, but it's okay.

682
01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:51,780
So these are the famous loadings, okay?

683
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:56,290
The catalog is that basically can be interpreted as correlations, you know what it's like.

684
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:05,590
And here, I mean, look at this. Now what it says is that I'm actually these values are actually multiply by 100.

685
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:09,250
I mean the ones that you will get will be like point 17 points on the right.

686
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:15,370
Like, I mean like a correlation coefficient for -1 to 2 one. But here I multiply them by a hundred.

687
01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:16,950
So then it kind of like is it?

688
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:25,540
And then I kind of like basically what I put is I kind of like put asterisks in those that are above point four or 40, right?

689
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:30,770
Because that will make it easier for me to look at kind of like the things that are correlated together, right?

690
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:35,050
So then you look at this kind of like these are my foods, right?

691
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:42,520
So my foods are here and they actually says we're basically ordering that way that that for the first part or the higher level,

692
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:51,830
these will be together. Right? So then we can see that my first factor actually, you can see that I invest in mine and that I mean,

693
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:55,030
of course you can look at the rest because I mean, it's still this distance.

694
01:14:56,020 --> 01:15:03,280
Okay. Right. But you can see that my first factor and this is kind of like a little difficult

695
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:09,160
to read because these are kind of like the someone names with the English name.

696
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:17,800
But you can see that the first kind of like food that I have, there are margarine, bread, milk, potato chips,

697
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:29,140
coke, apples, eggs, coffee, chicken cake, sausage, ground beef, corned beef and then cheese packets.

698
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:35,310
So all those items are not traditional someone items, right.

699
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:40,030
And most of them actually are pretty unhealthy. Right? So this is more kind of like sort western nice.

700
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:45,400
But we now know that apples are still that would you think like very apples are healthy.

701
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:50,770
Sure. I mean, they're healthy, right? I mean, but this is a foreign item for someone else.

702
01:15:50,770 --> 01:16:00,549
I mean, this apples were not really part of they were they were kind of like a particularly come from now but all right so so think

703
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:06,820
about that with your dietary pattern allergies not everything is going to be perfect because his did have it even right.

704
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:13,210
So sometimes you will find things like okay but apples I mean, my, my unhealthy dietary pattern is still has apples.

705
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:16,780
Yeah. Because it's correlated with those foreign items.

706
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:17,020
Right.

707
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:26,139
So not everything is going to be perfect, but at least on average, clearly based on a healthy dietary pattern and kind of like a western nice dietary.

708
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:30,760
But then if you look at the second factor and then you can that's why you have like them, right?

709
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:34,989
Because it's kind of like now look at the things that are really high here right then.

710
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:41,350
Now I have coconut meat, papaya soup with veggies, coconut cream with water.

711
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:50,710
I salt breadfruit fish, so many soup and know coconut cream, rice and cocoa.

712
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:57,670
So those things belong more to kind of like the new traditional diet of the someone, although someone's right.

713
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:02,620
So it's kind of like you can see that actually things work as expected in that way.

714
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:07,540
I mean, I was kind of like expecting to see I was still nice about them and a more,

715
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:13,450
more traditional dietary pattern because this people were kind of like a study

716
01:17:13,870 --> 01:17:17,470
when they were when the country was going through the nutrition trust issue.

717
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:25,440
And that's what I told you, that kind of like traditional items will go up, regional dietary patterns will coexist with Western Westernization.

718
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:25,780
Right.

719
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:38,770
And then if you look at the second one, you'll see also Taiwan, coconut cream, papaya soup, taro, coconut and starch, flour, lobster jam and so on.

720
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:44,139
So this is another kind of like neo traditional recipes that we have like two neo traditional here, right?

721
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:49,959
Kind of like for some reason they, they come up with two different parties, not just one unique.

722
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:53,860
And it happens because sometimes it has other items that are a little different.

723
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:59,229
Yes. Could it be like this again or were there like two different cultural regions?

724
01:17:59,230 --> 01:18:02,230
So it could be all could be islands.

725
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:08,050
Yeah. Or it could be also that there are different kind of like socioeconomic status issue here.

726
01:18:08,290 --> 01:18:15,430
Like, like maybe some of those items are kind of like more high income within the annual tradition of all these are more low income, right?

727
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:20,379
So, so yeah. Or it could be that they said we can barter too.

728
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:25,990
I mean, apparently what I learned from studying this among us is that many of those traditional

729
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:33,250
items are consumed during weekends because it's part of their like a party like of first.

730
01:18:33,970 --> 01:18:38,840
Yeah. So we interpret this like what are we doing about.

731
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:56,220
And because of those three factors that are distinct, these three live three.

732
01:18:56,790 --> 01:19:04,640
Okay. Yeah. So the first one is playing most of the value Clinton era, the second the remaining most viability and the third the remaining most.

733
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:15,470
So those are the three that I explained most about every lead in the data from the combine, they explain up to the missing.

734
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:22,160
We saw it here when they combined excellent up to 32% of the variability in data.

735
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:28,970
But but they they are distinct. They are very badass, each of them.

736
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:33,290
And this is we have three because we decided to retain three.

737
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:41,929
If you decide to retain four, then you will have four. So that's why there is a lot of subjectivity in this analysis and there is a lot

738
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:45,350
of kind of like that's why you have to do a lot of sensitivity analysis to say,

739
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:50,870
okay, this will happen if everything falls. Do they still have meaning or less if everything only too right?

740
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:56,060
Is it more or less clear? Okay. Yes.

741
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:09,190
The list is equal. This one will happen.

742
01:20:10,330 --> 01:20:13,620
I think that's. Oh, God.

743
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:20,030
Other races high into fighters. Yeah, that's.

744
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:24,030
That's fine. That. That's not a problem because. Yeah, because.

745
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:24,269
I mean,

746
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:33,150
race may be one of those items that is not really kind of like correlates with more things because maybe most people are consuming rice anyway.

747
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:41,160
Right. So for for kind of like a map with an explanation, remember, this is based on the correlation of votes.

748
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:46,409
So, so basically this is what people are reading. So this is completely data driven.

749
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:51,270
So. So most likely is because people are consuming rice even if they are consuming

750
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:54,900
our Western diet or if they are consuming the traditional diet no matter what.

751
01:20:55,240 --> 01:21:00,150
So if because before you said like the factors are correlated, so.

752
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:05,340
Oh, yeah. But the factors, I mean the scores that you can up at the end.

753
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:14,390
So they said the loading the. So don't spit. I mean in general you will see kind of like and that's why we did the rotation.

754
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:21,750
You will see high correlations here and whatever. These are how we should be kind of very low, more or less, but not not exact.

755
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:27,750
Not perfect. Right. I mean, you're going to still see kind of a relatively high correlation in into in two parts.

756
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:34,200
So one one same I think can correlate into parts B that means that is part of the part

757
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:41,549
that that the last part and this is what I haven't told you that is that this is I mean,

758
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:47,970
what you see here is just to decide how you are going to call your diet that it bothers by.

759
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:51,360
So you're saying there is no reason to say, oh, yeah, this looks like a Westernized.

760
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:56,489
This looks like traditional nutrition. Right. But this is not what you're going to use in the analysis.

761
01:21:56,490 --> 01:22:07,140
We're going to use in the analysis is that and this is the last part is that, oh, let me tell you a little bit more about the loadings.

762
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:12,960
So I already told you these, but the photo loadings represent the correlation of the foods with the bottom basically.

763
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:18,240
And then the idea is that in order for the fat of to be interpretable,

764
01:22:20,490 --> 01:22:25,620
each protein factor should have at least three variables with significant loadings.

765
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:29,040
Significant either mean B values and I mean high, right?

766
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:34,470
So you have one pattern that is only two things like for example, coffee and toast.

767
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:41,549
Yeah, you could think like that could be like very fast by then, but it's only two things, so I wouldn't call that a pattern.

768
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:44,960
At least it has to be three, three or more, right? Hopefully more.

769
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:51,790
Right now, the varieties with Halo, they should share a common conceptual meaning, which in this case they do.

770
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:58,740
Right. So they ones that make sense in the context of the traditional diet of Samoans and mixed on May six,

771
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:06,479
in the context of the Western decision of the diet and the values are low on different components, you have a different concept on menu.

772
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:11,430
So kind of like I mean that the idea is that you can differentiate the patterns out of the lollies, right.

773
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:18,210
And they factor, but they should demonstrate a simple structure. The simple structure we got through the rotation.

774
01:23:18,450 --> 01:23:25,980
And a simple structure means that most of the loadings that are high in one pattern and low in the other must.

775
01:23:26,550 --> 01:23:30,100
That doesn't mean that one may be high in both, like. Right, okay.

776
01:23:30,150 --> 01:23:34,320
That one is okay or two. Right. But most of them should not be.

777
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:39,030
I mean, you suddenly see kind of like a lot of mixing, then the patterns are not clear and maybe,

778
01:23:39,570 --> 01:23:42,780
maybe that, that is not good for doing this type of analysis. Okay.

779
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:48,990
So now there, so this is what I told you and and this is how we call them.

780
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:55,320
I see. I mean, we call the modern pattern, right? The western part, the traditional one and traditional.

781
01:23:55,590 --> 01:23:58,950
And those are the things that we have in each that you have already seen.

782
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:07,110
Now, this is the last step. Okay. So what you are going to use in your analysis is not the in fact that we're going to use is a score.

783
01:24:07,650 --> 01:24:16,230
So so SAS is going to use a summary score for each button that is going to be derived and assigned to each subject.

784
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:24,509
Okay. And that is score is kind of like it's calculating their score based on the loadings and the frequency of that person.

785
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:32,069
Right. The frequency consumption of that person. So you have high loadings in something, your frequency is high, then you're going to be high.

786
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:39,330
So that means you are compliant with that. But then you have kind of like low frequency of those things that are high.

787
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:43,290
You are going to have kind of like low compliance for that dietary pattern, right?

788
01:24:43,290 --> 01:24:49,169
So basically that what the score represents is compliance with it.

789
01:24:49,170 --> 01:24:56,850
But then, okay, so is kind of like in a way the number is going to be meaningless.

790
01:24:56,850 --> 01:25:03,210
So if you look at the Three Stooges now is going to be sometimes, I mean, doesn't mean anything as it doesn't have a unit mean.

791
01:25:03,630 --> 01:25:08,250
But what it means is it allows you to rank your your population.

792
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:12,420
So I said this is like a continuous variable. It's a score that means that you are low.

793
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:16,880
You have low compliance. You are high, you have high compliance.

794
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:25,040
Okay. So then you can use that continuous variable and divided in quintiles or tertiles and then use those in your analysis.

795
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:28,510
Sorry. No.

796
01:25:32,730 --> 01:25:36,750
No. Okay. Yeah, I think I'm fine. Okay.

797
01:25:36,770 --> 01:25:44,690
So one of the important things here is that SAP is going to have low and high scores in more than one batter.

798
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:50,780
Okay. So this is not cluster analysis. Remember, with listed indices, you are kind of like stuck with one group.

799
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:55,430
I mean, this is what this is doing is doing kind of like grouping food.

800
01:25:55,460 --> 01:26:00,590
So then you you can be high in both because maybe from Monday to Friday,

801
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:08,050
you eat like a Westernized reporter, but on weekends you kind of like overindulge in traditional fruit.

802
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:12,200
So then you are going to be high in both dietary patterns, right?

803
01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:16,090
And the same as I told you, with my Mediterranean and my sweet tooth dietary.

804
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:19,760
But then like, I will be high in both. So you can be high in both.

805
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:24,470
And usually it doesn't happen. Usually people tend to be high in one, the low and the others.

806
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:27,680
But it can happen that you can be high, high or low low. Okay.

807
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:33,170
So so far both.

808
01:26:34,630 --> 01:26:38,710
Okay. This must happen with the state because the fund.

809
01:26:39,190 --> 01:26:42,430
Can you see the wall or not in your computer? No.

810
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:47,260
Okay. Oh.

811
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,950
Oh. Okay. Then it's okay.

812
01:26:51,970 --> 01:26:57,280
So this is kind of like how the analysis would look like with this data with

813
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:01,510
different metabolic syndrome components and then kind of like build a memory there,

814
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:05,380
right over there and then remember what you wanted one.

815
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:14,800
So but the idea the idea is that I think the blue is there is the traditional because I think this is systolic and diastolic.

816
01:27:15,190 --> 01:27:23,950
So so basically you can see that adherence to the to the traditional letter then results in lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

817
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:29,950
And Google here, I think this is probably I think this is glucose because this is their Westernized dietary butter.

818
01:27:29,950 --> 01:27:40,120
So that you can see that is higher. And this is probably HDL because is lower for the Westernized, but is higher for the for the traditional.

819
01:27:40,690 --> 01:27:47,920
So kind of like the idea is that they will really be that.

820
01:27:48,250 --> 01:27:54,700
So the idea is that I hypothesis was that they're worse than those they had reported was going to

821
01:27:54,700 --> 01:28:00,070
be worse for health outcomes that the traditional bottom and that that's what we that we prove.

822
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:07,690
Okay. Okay. So now we are going to work for the lab with the dietary partners in Costa Rica and then you are

823
01:28:07,690 --> 01:28:13,749
going to we already use this that asset and you're going to use like a sample and a sample,

824
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:14,530
not the whole thing.

825
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:23,979
But we already identified two dietary patterns, one that we call the staple pattern, kind of like we'll be living in your tradition of Costa Rica,

826
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:34,570
which was kind of like rice and beans and palm oil and meat, alcohol, coffee, sugar was kind of like more of the traditional one.

827
01:28:35,170 --> 01:28:37,809
And because of this stable pattern,

828
01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:44,350
it's kind of like a mixed pattern because you can feel like there's nothing wrong with the ends means are super healthy.

829
01:28:44,350 --> 01:28:47,050
Right. But white rice is not that healthy. Right.

830
01:28:47,290 --> 01:28:51,579
And then there are other things like the palm oil is not that healthy compared to this whole, you know, and things like that.

831
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:57,520
So then on average, this stable pattern was associated with with higher odds of myocardial infarction.

832
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:07,750
And then we found also like a vegetable pattern, which was kind of like kind of like all the veggies and fruits and everything together.

833
01:29:09,370 --> 01:29:18,610
And it kind of like going to the, the results when we were looking at the of ratio of called into quintiles of the veggie pattern.

834
01:29:19,570 --> 01:29:25,960
So basically we didn't see any association. So we see basically is pretty flat, which is not what you would expect.

835
01:29:26,410 --> 01:29:34,680
We would expect in that we should see like a lower not so what why do you think that this could be the case in this particular study?

836
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:54,510
Coconut oil? No, this is Costa Rica.

837
01:29:54,630 --> 01:29:58,560
This is no longer someone. This is Costa Rica. So.

838
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:05,990
We don't really know what else they're eating outside of just the vegetables.

839
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:12,290
No, they are supposed to be eating. I mean, I just summarize the vegetable.

840
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:15,590
There were many things. I mean, they were supposed to be healthy.

841
01:30:17,570 --> 01:30:23,340
Right. And, you know, they are not finding, I think, more in terms of bias.

842
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:33,570
Like when they're when they're told they have her disease, they change their diet.

843
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:38,420
Well, the day was the previous year. But you're right.

844
01:30:38,430 --> 01:30:43,829
I mean, there is some potential for recall bias because they could remember kind of like I mean,

845
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:48,150
for social desirability, they could kind of like, you know, recall bias can go in both that.

846
01:30:48,450 --> 01:30:54,899
So people can kind of like blame themselves that you know yeah I was eating too much red medium or whatever or they can feel like, oh no, no.

847
01:30:54,900 --> 01:31:00,389
I mean, they're going to tell me that I was kind of like eating really badly and then kind of like,

848
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:04,440
I'm going to say that I'm going to eat eating a lot of veggies and fruits and so on.

849
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:12,419
So then that would be differential advice. Now that could be, but that was probably not the case in the situation because actually we asked people in

850
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:18,479
Costa Rica what they thought was the main cause of the am I and that it was not among them.

851
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:24,000
So people were not that aware at that point that mysteriously all that day was that important.

852
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:30,340
So they were mentioning stress to local moderate stress.

853
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:37,140
Very so they they were not aware of diet. So recall biases and like there is another source of bias.

854
01:31:42,290 --> 01:31:46,210
No, because there's not a lot of selection bias here.

855
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:52,810
I mean, it could be a ways but no because this that they controlled what a population based on their and

856
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:58,370
Costa Rica has a national health system so then basically they really come from this as population.

857
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:04,280
Smoking we control for smoking.

858
01:32:04,290 --> 01:32:16,799
So. So what happens when you have hypertension, high cholesterol and hypertension, hypertension,

859
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:25,020
cholesterol and kind of like other high glucose, for example, you go to the doctor and go to the doctor, change your diet.

860
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:28,470
Yeah. So it was reverse course issue. That's. Yeah, exactly.

861
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,950
So then most likely was reverse course. What happened is that.

862
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:41,490
But they didn't change their diet, kind of like because of the MRI, the change that I because of the risk factors for them.

863
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:46,170
Right. I mean, you were. Oh, I'm sorry.

864
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:50,900
Then I didn't even understand you. Yeah. Yeah. So reverse causation probably was the case.

865
01:32:50,910 --> 01:32:57,450
So basically, it's kind of like everyone with the risk factors clearly have a higher also have a higher risk of having an MRI.

866
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:03,090
And most likely, they also change their diet to kind of like because they were total.

867
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:10,530
Okay. So that that would be bad. So we saw a higher odds of in my for the staple part.

868
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:14,250
So which was according to our kind of hypothesis.

869
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:19,110
Okay. So this is the end of the first part of the topic.

870
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:28,830
I know you're super tired, so let's let's start working on, on, on the on the lab together.

871
01:33:28,830 --> 01:33:35,810
So then I'm. Okay.

872
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:39,000
So this is the lab. What? US.

873
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:57,330
So you're going to be working with this a sample of this data that were collected in Costa Rica from 1984,

874
01:33:57,350 --> 01:34:03,210
2004, which are the years that the country was going through a nutrition transition.

875
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:08,970
And this is the same kind of population that you have used before for that for another lab.

876
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:15,630
And this is a population based case control study of first incident non-fatal myocardial infarction.

877
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:22,170
Okay. And case subjects were to both men and women who were new myocardial infarction patients at any of the six

878
01:34:22,170 --> 01:34:27,510
participating study hospitals and who were permanent residents of the geographic area defined by the study,

879
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:34,620
which was the Central Valley in Costa Rica, controls what population controls that were selected randomly and match with the cases of age,

880
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:38,640
gender and current area of residence using information from the Costa Rica census.

881
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:46,380
So remember, this is a much case control study. So when you do an analysis, you have to do conditional logistic regression, same as you did before.

882
01:34:46,560 --> 01:35:00,570
Okay. So so that the information was a thing we found 155 if Q though, was developed and validated specifically for using the Costa Rican population.

883
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:06,600
And I mean, these are the useful things of the scale.

884
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:12,780
Now you are going to use this data so that if I diet three parties in this population,

885
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:16,739
I see these patterns are associated to increase or decrease risk.

886
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:20,580
And that is not the correct one, is actually what I hope to change that.

887
01:35:20,850 --> 01:35:24,920
Also, like all information on this, ASCO is attached at the end.

888
01:35:24,940 --> 01:35:30,690
So you can just run and actually I, I put this in a filing in canvas.

889
01:35:32,010 --> 01:35:36,749
So all foods on the fifth you are already a group and adjusted for Tottenham's intake.

890
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:41,700
So then I'm kind of like saving you the time of doing that because I would be happy.

891
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:46,850
So you can put that already into the block fund.

892
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:55,830
Okay. So you need to read the notes in the code and other sections of this Esperanza that I said this is called dietary patterns.

893
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,950
Okay. So the first question I should add one. Okay.

894
01:35:58,950 --> 01:36:10,080
So this is kind of like this is a reminder of how to kind of like decide to interpret the output and kind of everything factors.

895
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:16,070
So to determine the number of factors, you have to consider data and values.

896
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:22,620
But again, this is kind of like this is kind of very conservative.

897
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:29,280
So you will end up with many factors. So then you go to kind of like the variability like for example,

898
01:36:29,610 --> 01:36:33,740
if for food groups what including Epica and the first quarter had anything of value

899
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:39,620
2.9 divide and this variable would account for 74.5% of the related groups with it.

900
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:43,410
You said that I would move having evidence of one, right? So it's kind of like you can read that.

901
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:48,959
But this is a summary of what I kind of like told you that this group, this is very useful to do it visually,

902
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:52,560
kind of like, yes, they the ones that are here know the ones that are there.

903
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:58,350
Right. And then finally, what is very important is to look at interpretability that these make sense,

904
01:36:58,350 --> 01:37:01,740
because if they don't make sense, then you shouldn't within as many factors.

905
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:16,040
Okay. So then copy and paste only the output that is required in each question because there's a lot of output in in for process as usual.

906
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:22,709
So only the one that I'm asking and you do not need to paste any such code because this has I'm only doing through you know,

907
01:37:22,710 --> 01:37:31,530
the first question is for you to do it on your own because this is more like a method of looking at the food foods and tell me what you're seeing.

908
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:36,780
So then you can go to the appendix tool and examine the fruits, including which group,

909
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:45,560
and tell me if you think this is a good way to group foods based on the current nutrition knowledge and if you will, look them in a different way.

910
01:37:45,570 --> 01:37:50,490
So I know that you have to answer the three questions and elaborate briefly, then just tell me.

911
01:37:50,490 --> 01:37:56,490
Yes, that's right. You tell me yes to me. Yes, because for example, this and this and this and you tell me no.

912
01:37:56,490 --> 01:38:02,790
Then give me like an alternative thing and try to put your questions in the context of the dietary patterns of Costa Rica,

913
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:09,570
which I know that you may not be very familiar with those, but I already told you like this table bottom that you bought and things like that, right?

914
01:38:09,810 --> 01:38:15,120
So and again, this is one of those no, there's no wrong right answer.

915
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:19,890
So just kind of like think that me what you think so this is the list of foods

916
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:29,700
is kind of like at the end this is how we kind of like and by like for example,

917
01:38:30,090 --> 01:38:36,470
like 94 are is there like what we put the whiskey, rum, gin, both can work together and so on, right?

918
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:44,129
Like for example we put the high energy drinks together to we put the low fat dairy products together and the high fat dairy products together.

919
01:38:44,130 --> 01:38:48,270
Right. So there are two food groups and the refined grains are the whole grains.

920
01:38:48,270 --> 01:38:50,760
And then. These are kind of individual efforts, right?

921
01:38:50,830 --> 01:38:56,640
Then you look at them and you telling me, Oh, yeah, but I would like to see, I don't know, like for example.

922
01:38:57,810 --> 01:39:03,680
And then I will put the process mixed together with the read and press it or whatever you think that is better, right?

923
01:39:03,690 --> 01:39:09,300
I mean, or you can tell me that. No, I think it's okay because of this or this and this.

924
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:13,740
Right. Okay. Okay. So now let's let's go into snuggles.

925
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:21,590
So. Okay.

926
01:39:21,650 --> 01:39:28,600
So now you're going to run. To run the Gulf.

927
01:39:28,810 --> 01:39:42,540
So we are going to slice. And this is the goal, right?

928
01:39:42,820 --> 01:39:47,649
Remember that this is my I said this is the method that we're using.

929
01:39:47,650 --> 01:39:56,680
This is really about this is the rotation. We're doing the rotation and now telling you to put eight as a starting point.

930
01:39:57,010 --> 01:40:04,889
White Eight eight is just a arbitrary number, but it's like not too many not to feel right.

931
01:40:04,890 --> 01:40:08,500
So kind of like a good point to start sending interpretability, right?

932
01:40:10,540 --> 01:40:18,909
So then did you go there? You know that you put in there then remember these things are things that are going to give me some more information.

933
01:40:18,910 --> 01:40:23,260
I'm flagging the value of the variables 2.4 to make sure that I will be able to.

934
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:27,550
I think these are going to be multiplied by 100, the only flag.

935
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:31,839
And then these are all the variables that are going to be copy here.

936
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:35,200
So these are all all the groups that you have for the field.

937
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:37,360
Okay. So if I run this.

938
01:40:43,550 --> 01:40:56,120
So then you will see that the output from BCA is a lot like the first thing you can see here is that you have 1200 little more observations, right?

939
01:40:57,740 --> 01:41:05,389
And then this is kind of like the first they will show you with their eigenvalue.

940
01:41:05,390 --> 01:41:12,800
So then you can see that you have 43 variables because you have 43 food groups, right?

941
01:41:13,310 --> 01:41:21,650
So then an eight, every of them have one eigenvalue, but you can see that only their first two, three, four.

942
01:41:21,650 --> 01:41:24,230
No. And there are the highest ones. Right.

943
01:41:24,860 --> 01:41:32,530
And then you can see you can see here that the proportion of variance here is lower than we saw for some of right.

944
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:36,740
Which is very normal. I mean, you usually see this not this low proportion.

945
01:41:37,010 --> 01:41:42,079
You can see that the first one displays 9% of the variability you are.

946
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:45,350
The second one will be up to 14 and then you are the third one.

947
01:41:45,350 --> 01:41:46,580
It will be up to 18.

948
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:58,640
And then as you move, then of course, at some point you will explain Splenda the 100%, but you can see that after the factor 18, then anything,

949
01:41:58,640 --> 01:42:05,780
everything should be discarded because those mean if they get values below, one means that is place less variability than just one fourth.

950
01:42:05,780 --> 01:42:16,790
Okay. So one way of kind of like looking at this better is to look at this tree plot and let me see if I can make this higher.

951
01:42:19,550 --> 01:42:25,910
Okay. So you can see that one is here, two is here, and then after three.

952
01:42:29,050 --> 01:42:33,250
Then you should see like a breaking point here. And do you see a breaking point here?

953
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:41,870
I mean, not really is more like something like that.

954
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:45,080
I mean, there's not actually a record. So that's why I mean, there was actually a break.

955
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:50,480
You will see. Okay, I will use that break and then I will read then only the ones before the break.

956
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:56,420
But here it's kind of like, should I stop at three, four, five?

957
01:42:57,530 --> 01:43:05,420
So it's kind of like difficult, right? And now remember this.

958
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:09,510
This is the first kind of life after button, but this is not the rotated.

959
01:43:09,530 --> 01:43:18,860
So then you kind of like ignore this one and remember you here put eight factors to help you with kind of like interpretation.

960
01:43:19,190 --> 01:43:25,040
Every time you change their name, their number, then your factors may look a little different, right?

961
01:43:25,070 --> 01:43:28,940
So it's not like kind of like you're going to see the same. So, so be careful about that,

962
01:43:28,940 --> 01:43:37,450
but you wanna look at that also you can ignore this part and you're can ignore this part and then you go to the rotated factor.

963
01:43:37,610 --> 01:43:43,009
Okay, so now we have the rotate. If you look at the first factor I see.

964
01:43:43,010 --> 01:43:51,710
And you can then when I put in the flag, so then your eyes go to those main things, then you'll see that the first one,

965
01:43:52,700 --> 01:44:00,800
the halo, these are all the veggies that yellow, cruciferous, green, leafy, starchy fruit, tomatoes.

966
01:44:03,170 --> 01:44:07,910
That's it. Right? So this is kind of like which one? This is the veggie button, right?

967
01:44:08,510 --> 01:44:21,799
And this is if you go to the second one, you can see that the highest these are the legumes, the first condiments and their refined grains.

968
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:25,370
So it's the rice. So this is their rice and beans.

969
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:37,370
They bought this. Right. And you can see that is actually negatively associated with veggies and fruits are very low.

970
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:37,700
Right.

971
01:44:39,390 --> 01:44:49,549
You go here, you can see this is probably also kind of like this one is associated with water, soybean and bulk because you are with too many factors.

972
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:53,270
Right. But kind of like this is the hint in the first one is squinting towards the veggie.

973
01:44:53,270 --> 01:44:55,750
The second one is indoors, more like this table.

974
01:44:55,760 --> 01:45:05,180
But then when you go to the third one, you see that, okay, you have super coffee and negative with water, which is kind of like,

975
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:11,870
oh, is this a better because there are three things here, but one is negative, which is make sense, of course.

976
01:45:11,870 --> 01:45:15,350
I mean, if you drink coffee, you can drink tea and the other way around, right?

977
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:19,610
So in a way makes sense. But probably should I consider this a pattern or not?

978
01:45:19,790 --> 01:45:22,220
Maybe. Yeah, looks like a or maybe not. Right.

979
01:45:22,490 --> 01:45:29,360
So as you move into the other one, you will see that you have a less and less items and then they don't make that much sense.

980
01:45:29,930 --> 01:45:36,380
So probably because you should not be reading an eight, maybe just with two or three or four would be enough, right?

981
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:45,290
So that's that's the one when you should decide based on your strip log you so that you shouldn't go more than four or five.

982
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:52,490
Right. And then based on the interpretability, maybe see even less, maybe 73 or maybe two, that that that's up to you.

983
01:45:52,610 --> 01:45:56,420
You have to decide how many you want to redeem.

984
01:45:56,810 --> 01:46:03,350
Okay? And then you can ignore the rest because I mean, that's okay.

985
01:46:03,830 --> 01:46:11,700
I think that will be useful, but you can ignore that. Now, one important thing is that when you're running this, you're there.

986
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:27,650
I said now and let me say here now the analysis is going to add, oh, oh, yeah, sorry.

987
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:32,780
I put it in something like 40 million.

988
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:40,160
Okay. So you see this temp, if you you can change the sample, whatever.

989
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:46,220
And then I said you want because this then a few.

990
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:53,740
So. I know this is in the works.

991
01:46:53,890 --> 01:46:56,910
These are temporary, but that's it. Yeah.

992
01:46:56,920 --> 01:47:03,340
So this one is a copy of the original recipe, but it has this course here.

993
01:47:03,580 --> 01:47:09,220
See, I mean, this is the score for father one. For father to father three, up to father eight.

994
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:16,830
Okay. If I and see that the scores are completely meaningless, right?

995
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:24,430
I mean, just a number that. But if they these if I get one of those scores, for example.

996
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:48,550
Not for a while, but the trial and so on.

997
01:47:48,970 --> 01:47:55,250
Look at the father one, for example. Did you see that?

998
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:58,880
It's just a distribution, that it doesn't have to be normal?

999
01:47:58,890 --> 01:48:06,810
Of course. But the idea is that if you are here, you are have low compliance, and if you are here, you have a heck of life.

1000
01:48:07,060 --> 01:48:15,090
So it's kind of like just a score distribution that in this situation goes from minus to 25 or -2.30 to 4.8.

1001
01:48:15,150 --> 01:48:19,630
But those numbers that don't have any meaning.

1002
01:48:19,650 --> 01:48:22,710
So this is just to rank people, right?

1003
01:48:26,370 --> 01:48:32,840
If I know that if I, it would be good that you change the name of the rest here.

1004
01:48:32,850 --> 01:48:38,940
So then you run over, right? I mean, you change their photos, then you don't get the previous ones, right?

1005
01:48:39,270 --> 01:48:46,590
So now I decided to kind of like, let's say that I want to read them for and I run this.

1006
01:48:49,110 --> 01:49:00,120
I can go now directly to look at my actually my, my four photos here and see that I still I still have my veggie here.

1007
01:49:00,630 --> 01:49:05,940
Now my staple button, it starts to look more like the staple.

1008
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:13,319
But then I, we find in the in the light because it has the legumes, the rice, but also has that.

1009
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:20,670
But remember, that was what I was kind of like. And then the other photos are still look like different things, right?

1010
01:49:20,670 --> 01:49:25,620
So if I change your change, you kind of live in the number two routine, right?

1011
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:37,560
But now if I look at my that, I said. Now I have my four photos here.

1012
01:49:38,210 --> 01:49:46,350
Right. So those are the scores. Now those are scores you are going to in the next kind of like part.

1013
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:53,190
So for this part, I'm asking you this. There's people that have a camera that you doesn't have that the average.

1014
01:49:53,340 --> 01:50:01,590
Right. How interpretable are the patterns? I already told you the first two kind of like are more or less and then the rest.

1015
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:05,680
I mean, you can come up with some ideas, but maybe have not that in there. But I will write that.

1016
01:50:05,700 --> 01:50:09,720
But tell me something. Okay. And how many factors would you retain and why?

1017
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:16,370
Then you have to come up with your own solution and then run the analysis again, retaining the ones you want to retain.

1018
01:50:16,370 --> 01:50:21,719
If you only want to retain three, then you change to three, then flat, and then you just have three.

1019
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:25,710
And then you tell me, how would you know the new ones that you get? How would you interpret?

1020
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:34,350
Okay. And now with those those that you decide to retain, you're going to question three.

1021
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:42,180
We are running out of time. No, you're going to do nothing because it's kind of like, let's stop here.

1022
01:50:43,470 --> 01:50:50,190
So we will we will continue on next ness. In two weeks, we will have plenty of time to do this together.

1023
01:50:50,250 --> 01:51:07,560
Okay. Yes. I am trying to conceptually understand how we're using like the rotated factors to determine how many we should include.

1024
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:17,250
Let me start at eight and then we're like, Oh, only three seem to be important, but then we do it with three and then it's different.

1025
01:51:17,670 --> 01:51:20,760
Yeah. What? Why? Why? They are different.

1026
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:24,140
Why? Why? You don't get the first three from the four.

1027
01:51:24,170 --> 01:51:29,050
I mean, the first few are probably going to be similar.

1028
01:51:29,070 --> 01:51:34,049
So what changes is the rest? Because the rest is kind of lively and stable in that way.

1029
01:51:34,050 --> 01:51:38,880
You could see that they were not really many high loads and they were not really spinning that the variability.

1030
01:51:39,090 --> 01:51:44,060
So the moment that you decide to retain less, then of course this is going to change, right?

1031
01:51:44,070 --> 01:51:52,469
You're going to like the last one and then some of the some of the loadings that were kind of like in a way is kind of like some of the

1032
01:51:52,470 --> 01:52:04,650
variability that when you retain eight some of those kind of like last patterns in a way are still in some of the quotes from the other ones.

1033
01:52:04,650 --> 01:52:08,970
So that way when you realize the, the ones that you want to read them make even more sense.

1034
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:15,209
Like for example, with a stable pattern in the beginning when we saw the rice and beans with the condiments and when we return those,

1035
01:52:15,210 --> 01:52:23,140
we also see the panel together because it was going to another part right away.

1036
01:52:23,190 --> 01:52:27,540
And so your question more or less. Okay. Okay.

1037
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:36,010
So so have a wonderful holiday and I'll see you in two weeks and then we will kind of like it.

1038
01:52:36,210 --> 01:52:39,240
Start here. Okay. Again. So then we will do this together.

1039
01:52:48,420 --> 01:52:48,630
I.
