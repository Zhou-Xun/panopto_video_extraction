1
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:16,710
Okay. I'm going to start on top of three distribution and talk.

2
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:35,940
After what I've seen in lava practice over the time, the followers and definitions of our previous chapters like how to calculate the mean moment,

3
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,500
generation functions, etc. for different family self-help distributions.

4
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,640
You got a chance to offer success.

5
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:56,430
What do we have to learn before? Okay, you've only got to cover a limited number of families, but in Pakistan already numerous families,

6
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:04,170
self-distribution that's divided by the model and are use in practice.

7
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,330
So first of all, let's take a look at a few different.

8
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,510
One on the fridge, one on the computer reading materials, at least here.

9
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,430
So what we actually talk about is specific distribution.

10
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,110
Think about why we need a family of distributions to start with.

11
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:35,970
Why don't we just, you know, looked at a bunch of random variables, what our distribution is throughout the city or city of Ghana and disco, is it?

12
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,880
Why do we need to define a family? Okay, our summarizes.

13
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,200
The distributions are used. First of all, we need to know why we need distributions.

14
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:55,170
I need to qualify. The distribution and distribution can be used to model the population.

15
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:07,290
Okay, so that's a very important point because in practice, all we can do is to sample finite samples from the population.

16
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,340
But at the end of the day, what do we have to care about is really about the population.

17
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,600
So how do we go from the finite sample to the general population?

18
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,260
Is through this the use of distribution?

19
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:26,150
With the final samples, we can get a sense of what the general distribution look like for the population.

20
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:35,120
Now we can make inference on the population. So the distribution really tells us a lot of summary of the data.

21
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:42,020
And also it can be used to describe phenomenons in the general population and its approximation to the reality.

22
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:53,310
And just to give you a sense. You may have heard the notion of, you know, like a hundred year flight or a thousand year fly, right?

23
00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:00,540
So when people talk about, you know, flood travel, they talk about this is a 100 year flood,

24
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:07,320
meaning you're probably only seeing it once in 100 years following a flood, probably only taken once in the following years.

25
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:14,110
But in practice, we actually don't have the record of that long. We may only have the recent decades of reports about Flood.

26
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,810
How can we know it's a 100,000 year flood level?

27
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:27,629
Well, that is using the distribution of fame, the model of our particular distribution to the data that we have out.

28
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:36,420
And we can actually infer what's going to be like for the general distribution, what it's going to be like for the population.

29
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:48,180
And using that distribution, we can conclude whether the actual flood level is a 100 year flood or a 1000, or by looking at the whole distribution.

30
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,320
So we cannot do that by just looking at your recorded data.

31
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:03,080
So that is why use of that distribution, it just tells us a lot about the general population based on what we have observed and

32
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:11,610
published recently in Families and Meaning that we can allow some parameters to change,

33
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,060
but the general functional form of the distribution of function is still the same.

34
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,570
We have seen this before, for example, the uniform contribution.

35
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:28,410
We can vary the range or marry the support of the uniform random variable, but end of the day is all uniform,

36
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:36,360
meaning the probability of the DNA is always constant or the P of the CDF is always a constant.

37
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:45,870
Right? We take the same functional forms. The only thing that's changed between one distribution to another is just some parameters.

38
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,760
By allowing that flexibility, we can have families of distribution.

39
00:04:52,680 --> 00:05:06,030
And that's actually very helpful in defining the distribution of an environmental impact by one or more, one or more parameters.

40
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:12,899
Once we think that parameter, we know exactly the distribution for right about all of our in that parameter,

41
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,250
we get some flexibility so it can be used to characterize the general population.

42
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:24,660
Once you collect some data and get a sense of what that parameter should be and then you get a full customization of the distribution,

43
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,470
that's sort of the idea behind this families of distributions.

44
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,560
So what's what's next? We're going to introduce different families of distributions,

45
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:44,130
and we're going to briefly introduce how that families of distributions actually use in practice.

46
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:51,510
And more importantly, we want got a better understanding of the actual quantities for that families of distribution.

47
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,910
For example, we want to know what is what is the mean formula.

48
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,670
The parent's formula or majority of formula is different families.

49
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,000
And so that's what the focus is now. Today.

50
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,770
On Thursday, we're going to focus on the disgrace distributions.

51
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:20,820
Recall what this random variable is. It only takes finite values are only take countable and infinite values.

52
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,730
But that's physically available.

53
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:33,250
This week we're going to focus on random arrivals, this weird random variable, and say some families of distribution description anomalies.

54
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:42,250
So the very first one is called the discrete uniform distribution, which is probably have some this multiple times in the previous examples.

55
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:51,700
The formal definition of this discrete uniform distribution is as follows A random variable acts as a discrete uniform distribution.

56
00:06:53,020 --> 00:07:05,890
With this to bounce one to n if it satisfy the following, namely a random sample taking antibody from one to end all the integer values from one to L,

57
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:15,520
and each value has a probability as equal probability of one over the form of this rhinoviruses one to at this end

58
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:23,500
integers and averaging in order to have the same probability one over if the random variable for all of these came out.

59
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,380
We call it this great uniform running variable that.

60
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:38,710
Is this great? Because it only takes this finite amount and it's a uniform because the probability is equal.

61
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,530
Every single data point it has equal probability of taking by one.

62
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:50,649
We combine to take about in three all the way to take them out of this as well.

63
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:57,690
And that's why it's called discrete uniform distribution and that's how it's done.

64
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,630
And think about the example that we have shown before, right.

65
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:08,140
If you throw a coin, is that the outcome of the single task?

66
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,190
Is that a uniform distribution uniform in this case, a uniform distribution?

67
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,240
If it's through a fair coin. Is it?

68
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,370
Yes, it is. Right. And what is in that case?

69
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:31,060
One or two. Right. You can represent had by one tail by two.

70
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,600
And just two possible outcomes. They have equal probability.

71
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,740
Each one have one over one over two of the probability.

72
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,720
So that's probably a discrete uniform distribution.

73
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:48,070
If you throw it to coins and require the outcome.

74
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,640
And I assume that they are doing it without considering the order.

75
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:07,450
Is it still a disk or uniform distribution? If it has to cause without considering the order, it doesn't consider all possible outcomes.

76
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,860
Is it still at risk for uniform distribution? No.

77
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,430
Because in that case you have three different outcomes.

78
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,390
Have a tale and tell tale because we don't care about the order.

79
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:30,490
But the three different outcomes are different. They don't have the equal probabilities have had tell tale.

80
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,790
They both have one or both, but they all have one over two.

81
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Right. So that's why it's not a this way uniform distribution because two, without considering the order.

82
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,790
But if you do considering the order, is it a uniform distribution?

83
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,850
If it comes to coins, how do you do things that are harder?

84
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,290
How many are there for?

85
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:03,850
Do they have equal probability? They do. So that satisfies the definition of a physical uniform.

86
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:10,610
It is a discrete uniform. And another example is throwing the dice and throwing a die.

87
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,550
So you have six possible outcomes, 1 to 6, and they all have equal probabilities.

88
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,150
That's another example of this, that this is a uniform distribution.

89
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:27,290
All right. So now helpfully we have defined the PM for this random variable.

90
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,970
As we argued before, the PM app uniquely defined the distribution of a random variable.

91
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,530
With this point, we should be able to know everything about these distributions.

92
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:45,470
Okay. We just treat this as a parameter in this case once and this case we know everything about this distribution.

93
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,330
In particular, we can know what the occasion is, what the virus is.

94
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,040
Right. Let's take a look how these are calculated.

95
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:04,070
So in order to calculate the barons and the mean, we need these two very commonly used equations.

96
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:12,950
I hope you summarize this by heart, because this is very, very, very how do to use the way we derive this type of things.

97
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:20,330
The first equation is, if you sum up, I want to tell you, that's 20 times plus one over two.

98
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:29,930
And the second one is the sum of the square. I post from 1 to 10, it's ten times K plus one points to eight plus one over six.

99
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:38,270
And these are to generate equations that we will use when deriving them in Paris.

100
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,180
With these two, we can now write out what the mean is for this uniform random variable.

101
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,670
And this is quite remarkable.

102
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:55,820
So the mean is just the summation over the support of this retroviral X times, the probability of x y axis value one to it.

103
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,860
That's the definition. All right.

104
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:07,070
And if you take an outside this summation that says that the first equation, we can directly apply the first equation.

105
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,440
And if you do the calculation now for this number and plus one over two.

106
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:25,730
Yes. So we mentioned that this is how we can model the coin flips in like just in the cases to see how do we interpret that expected value.

107
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:31,430
Very good question. So if we let's first start from just have one coin.

108
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:43,700
So if you code had a zero tail as one, then the mean or that is just the average value.

109
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:53,870
If you toss it numerous times, one would be the average value that if we got a few coded in our way,

110
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,780
it doesn't really translate to the original sample space because it doesn't fall into the original sample space,

111
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,800
but now still give you a sense of where the average is.

112
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:11,000
So probably it makes more sense if you consider the throwing the dice to have six numbers,

113
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:18,680
if you throw it numerous times and just take the average of all the numbers that you got is time when it would be the average.

114
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,920
That's what the average is about on this binary case.

115
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:31,970
It's not so obvious divide. It depends on how you define the two values of the different outcomes.

116
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:39,740
That's a good question. Does that make sense? So that's how we can calculate the mean by this description of our goal.

117
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:48,350
Okay. So the mean or a uniform discrete uniform distribution uniform we run a variable is just M plus one over two.

118
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,670
So going back to the DC example, we know an is six, right?

119
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,559
So the average is a number by throwing the dice numerous times.

120
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,940
If you take if you take the average of all the numbers that I got,

121
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:15,620
it should be roughly around this six plus one over to 3.5 since we can do this experiment and check whether that's that's true or not.

122
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,320
Okay. So that's the mean our thing.

123
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:31,280
Then we can also calculate the variance for this run of animal. So we call that numerals as this expression of x squared minus the x squared.

124
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,320
We already know what the expectation is for this random variable.

125
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,590
All we need to know is what the second order moment is.

126
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:43,100
Once we know that, we can plug it in and calculate the balances.

127
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,290
Now here is the expression to calculate. The second order moment.

128
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,930
That's right. A barrel again. Using the second equation directly.

129
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:59,570
We come back to these results for the second out.

130
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:04,790
Our moment for this round of our voice and plus one 200 plus one over six.

131
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:10,159
Now, you plug this two into this formula and calculate it again.

132
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,840
The final result, which is one and then minus one over 12.

133
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,460
That's the variance for a uniform, discrete random variable.

134
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:29,670
This great uniform around about. Any questions so far about this?

135
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,250
All right. No question. Then let me give you a question.

136
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:50,450
So what about the moment generating function for this? Uniform run of arable land and sea.

137
00:15:51,020 --> 00:16:03,560
What is it possible that for all this uniform, this uniform run of Arab oil from one to a.

138
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:25,130
We may need these recent OnePlus eight postpaid square data and is equal to one minus eight plus one over one minus eight.

139
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:34,979
That may be this equation of your derive the moment generating function.

140
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:40,980
So I'll give you a couple of minutes. Try to write down the only generating function for this uniform.

141
00:16:41,610 --> 00:18:52,450
Quite uniform, right. Show me your hand if you got it.

142
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,270
Okay. So let's look at this together. In order to derive this moment generating function.

143
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,900
First of all, let's run our definition right now.

144
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:20,590
The first step, if you if you don't have either an idea of how to divide at the moment, then I'm always right out of that definition.

145
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:30,070
So the definition for the moment generally functions like the foundation of E to the power of the X or acts of the square uniform distribution.

146
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:36,790
Okay, now let's express what this expectation is since it's a discrete random variable.

147
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:41,230
We know that the summation acts from one to N.

148
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:51,090
E to a t at times. What? When?

149
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,329
I'm ready right now.

150
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,500
We can take this one over.

151
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:04,800
And again, outside of this summation of this, a final submission and this one over in does not involve any accent save to take it up.

152
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:13,170
And what's left inside is this E to the T acts C to the power of the x.

153
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,760
Now, we can take advantage of this equation that I just gave you.

154
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:24,660
If you look at this function inside summation, it's essentially a power term.

155
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:30,660
If you put a parentheses around this E to the power of T and treat it as a constant,

156
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:37,200
I feel it as our hey now essentially that just falls into this column.

157
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:42,980
On the left hand side, you're summing up a bunch of power terms, right?

158
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:50,400
A to the first power plus eight to the second power plus eight to the third power all the way to to the end.

159
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,050
So you can directly apply this equation,

160
00:20:55,350 --> 00:21:10,890
which can I give you one over and times one minus we call that our A is E to the T and one over one minus E to the teach.

161
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:21,390
All right, all now we all got to we did has to trade this eight to the T as our a the equation.

162
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:29,610
All right so that give you the moment generating function for this uniform discrete uniform

163
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:35,720
red available and with this you can also take the derivative with respect to T and

164
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:41,010
got different moment of order different order of moment for this random barrel you can

165
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:47,910
marry by whether you can get a patient Barron's using this energy up and any questions.

166
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:56,819
Yes so setting this up to make it look like the formula since X starts out one of the first are not be one.

167
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:03,990
So I was the end result by which the power of two.

168
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:26,000
Yeah. Actually, you are right when I say we need to take out one.

169
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:33,970
All right. And that's very good point.

170
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:42,290
So we are summing from actually equal a one to end. So that's essentially starting from this the a all the way to any to the power.

171
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:54,400
Right. So you need to subtract one here, whereas putting this one to the right hand side and use that as the equation.

172
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,220
All right. Good catch and a question.

173
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:15,650
Okay. All right. So that's the moment generating function for this discrete uniform run environment.

174
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:24,240
Okay. So. Next, let's look at another distribution of family distribution.

175
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:36,630
And finally, distribution. Again, very basic distribution and has been widely used and also heavily used in subsequent adaptations of other reviews.

176
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,680
So let's first take a look at the Bernoulli random variable.

177
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:50,020
And say, how is that fun? And so consider an experiment where the outcomes are binary.

178
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,940
Say success or failure. And the probability of success is.

179
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,830
If we define the random variable to be to take by one.

180
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:08,590
If the outcome is success and zero if the outcome is failure, then we say this random variable has a Bernoulli distribution with parameter P.

181
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:18,260
In other words, we can express it as Y internally with primary.

182
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:32,760
So. If you have any kind of to for this or a uniform in the community they can be the equivalent represented at the Bernoulli random horrible.

183
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,250
And with probability one of hope. That's a special case.

184
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:48,859
Also the corn is also apparently unavailable with a success rate being applied to other

185
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:56,990
examples where the the rate may not be one up and the ultimate outcome is binary code.

186
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:02,480
One outcome has one, the other outcome has zero. Then it just follows the final distribution.

187
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:09,080
Okay, so that's the definition internally, right? About high vocab is right available.

188
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,310
The parameters that can be that can vary is the success rate.

189
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:22,999
See, that's the only form that actually varies in this family self distributions with different key,

190
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,430
you got different distribution, but the support of this in random variables is always the same.

191
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:36,540
It's always this binary zero one. Sometimes it may be convenient to consider not one on one scale.

192
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,190
That's binary.

193
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:49,330
It doesn't really matter what are the actual numbers that are used because you can always establish a a function between this to run available.

194
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,470
You can map 01212 are negative one, two, negative one and one.

195
00:25:54,980 --> 00:26:01,440
As long as this binary it takes two values is definitely right about this.

196
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,000
Zero one is the most common sample space or binary right available by.

197
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:10,729
By no means. This is the only sample space. It was different.

198
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:14,170
Several aspects or simplicity.

199
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,990
Let's focus on this zero one simple space.

200
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:24,800
Then, based on the definition, we can directly write all the piano for this rhinovirus.

201
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:32,830
Essentially the probability of y for one the success rate is P and the probability of Y for the zero.

202
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:47,629
The subsidiary is one minus one that fully defines this distribution to an equivalent way of writing.

203
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:59,510
The piano is using this function and this PMT function where it takes values zero everywhere except when y is equal to zero or one.

204
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:09,020
So we can write the piano using this from our p to the power y times y minus p to the camera one minus one.

205
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:15,530
So you can easily verify that this quantity is equal to P.

206
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:22,070
If Y is equal to one right and equal to one minus P.

207
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,840
If Y is equal to zero.

208
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:40,120
And in most cases, when we talk about paranoia in America, we always assume this is somewhere between zero and one because it takes an exact value,

209
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,360
zero or exact value of a one, and we'll become a degenerating case.

210
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:52,989
If the success rate P is zero, it means you never you never succeed all trials.

211
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:57,550
Well, we will fail. And that's not a very interesting case to consider.

212
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:01,830
Will have one positive outcome with probability one.

213
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:10,000
So when we come back, we're going round about all. We always, almost always assume this probability is between zero and one.

214
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:13,870
I think you know the exact value of a zero and one.

215
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:20,020
So in that case, if you pluck Y for one into this formula, the second term just goes away.

216
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,000
All that's left is the first piece to the power of Y, which is P.

217
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:35,890
You take Y for a zero, then you've got one minus. And the reason why we want to write the PM in this formula is to also later in

218
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:42,490
some cases it can be very convenient mathematically for different derivations.

219
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:50,590
If you write it in as a uniform expression. Right.

220
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,990
Abbas. The PM and the PM have again fully defined this distribution.

221
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:05,990
And from there we can calculate different summary statistic of this retroviral.

222
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,980
First the city out. So what is the city?

223
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,770
A function of of.

224
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:25,000
It was only one memorable sketch.

225
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:48,660
The idea. So what does the function look like?

226
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,830
The city outcomes in the city app is a cumulative distribution function, right?

227
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:59,280
And this random variable and only takes 201.

228
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,810
So you're going to be a what? I'll stop.

229
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:11,750
All right. Well, anyway, at last nine zero.

230
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,020
What is the city of. Zero zero, always zero, right?

231
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:22,960
Because the probability of the right amount of taking value less than zero is always zero zero.

232
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:31,230
It has a chance at just one minus P.

233
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,170
Very good. That's the job. Now, why is that?

234
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,980
But we have to look at the piano, right?

235
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,540
The probability of Y for a zero is one.

236
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,510
So the probability of this cut to one last or equal to zero is also one minus.

237
00:30:51,590 --> 00:31:02,360
So that's why the piano playing at zero is one minus B, and they're going to stay there until it reach one.

238
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:13,920
It has another jump. Why? Why would that be a jump here?

239
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:20,260
Right. And what is this? Very. What is this about on the Y axis?

240
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:34,090
That's one. Right. And the jump is p this chunk, and then it's going to stay there for the rest of the grade.

241
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:38,130
So this is what the city look like.

242
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:47,320
It's a stepwise function as to zones 10121 and the first job as a high one minus P on the second jump is high P.

243
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,840
Right. And that's exactly it from the piano. All right.

244
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,900
So nice. So that's how they start. Hazen and Behrens.

245
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:04,400
So I'll give you a couple of minutes to derive the expectation and balance for this rhinovirus if you are down.

246
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:07,850
Also, try to derive the third moment of.

247
00:32:31,340 --> 00:33:52,520
She? All right.

248
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,630
So what is the expectation for this? I know you were unavailable.

249
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:15,210
Yes, Pete. Very good. If you do this experiment numerous times and just take the hours, that's going to give you heat, as does the success rate.

250
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:22,710
Right. And the actual calculation is it also only takes two values, one and zero.

251
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:31,950
By definition, what we need to do is to multiply this one by the probability of this random variable taken by one,

252
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:38,250
which is P and zero times the probability of y equals zero, which is one -30.

253
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:47,610
Now I gave you a P, and what about the variance? Any time it's my mind,

254
00:34:47,610 --> 00:35:00,630
it's people and they can either use the definition of Aras outweigh the expectation or y over y minus the expectation of y squared.

255
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:06,540
Or you can calculate it's y squared minus e y squared.

256
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:17,520
In a way you can got this man. And finally, what is the third moment of his mind that will still be all right?

257
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:23,020
And why is that? You got to use the definition.

258
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:27,760
What does the y third light?

259
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:36,600
What is the life the. Three. What is the possible values or y to the power grid?

260
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,660
How many different values come y to the three?

261
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:54,230
So to us it's a zero and one, because if the original model Y takes about a zero, then Y to three is also zero.

262
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,720
The original Y is for one, no. Three also on one.

263
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:08,900
Essentially, this one is exactly the same as this occasional line isn't on line to the third is P.

264
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:25,150
And I think this Bernoulli random variable is a very special variable, a very fundamental but very useful,

265
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:34,120
and plays an important role in the definition of binomial one of our volatile match, like the binomial which we're going to have.

266
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:45,969
So this is the foundation of many discrete random variable are different distributions itself is very straightforward

267
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:53,230
only takes two values zero and one with probability p taking one and y minus p take them out of zero.

268
00:36:53,860 --> 00:37:00,240
I can be used to construct many other more complicated in rhinovirus any question.

269
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:12,130
So Mark. One more point that I want to make about this binomial Bernoulli random variable is

270
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:19,780
currently we are assuming that random variable takes about is a zero and a one.

271
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:28,390
You can think about if you tend not to virus to be negative one and one how this formula is going to change.

272
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:41,590
If instead of y taking about a zero and a one line value -1 to 1, how that change on occasion varies certain moment,

273
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:50,500
etc. So the conclusion is they will change and they won't take the same formula.

274
00:37:51,400 --> 00:38:02,750
As apropos, I want to do the right thing and I also appreciate why the amount of cases where I say that is zero one because sorry,

275
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:06,910
give us the simplest expression for this different summer statistics.

276
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,820
Once you start the mouse, then the expression kind of got quite nasty.

277
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:22,840
All right, now it's binomial distribution sort of alluded to this distribution in our previous examples.

278
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:33,730
Now as follows We define what is a binomial distribution. Consider a series of Bernoulli trials where first of all, they are independent,

279
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:39,040
meaning the outcome of the first trial doesn't affect the outcomes of the second trial and so on.

280
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:46,840
So of course every trial is independent and the probability of success or failure in the same for each trial.

281
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:53,350
In that case, we call them IV independent and identically distributed.

282
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:59,030
Each trial is independent of all the trials and all the trials are identical.

283
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:02,200
They distribute how they share the same success rate.

284
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:12,790
If that's the case, then we can set a random variable Y to denote the number of successes in its own

285
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:21,160
trials and that going to follow a binomial distribution with two parameters and p.

286
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:32,110
The first parameter defines how many trials that were actually conducted, and the second parameter P defines the success rate for each trial.

287
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:43,780
And this is why the sum of the number of successes, the total number of successes out of this and trials will follow a binomial distribution.

288
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,870
So that's how the binomial right arrow is defined and.

289
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:59,800
So now is the example of how this Bernoulli run available is useful for defining other antivirals in this case,

290
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:10,750
why is essentially the sum of a bunch of normally random parables if you consider the outcome for each Bernoulli trial as a Bernoulli runabout?

291
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,420
Well, let's be excited.

292
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:25,870
If I once said that this is why is essentially the sum of exi I would want to have a bunch of zeros, bunch of ones, because some of them are.

293
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,750
I give you the total number of successes, right?

294
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:35,770
So that's how I construct if I don't run a variable around or nobody around variables.

295
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:47,990
Any question about the definition of binomial is one special case of binomial.

296
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:55,030
If you set and to be one only consider one trial, then that just reduces to paranoia.

297
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,340
I didn't have one trial either south or here.

298
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:04,700
The success rate being P. That's essentially paranoia, right.

299
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:20,360
About. That's a special case. So by the domination, the sample space of his binomial run of arable and p he already noted at this.

300
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:34,490
My follow this binomial and p as a symbol space zero to end all this implies what it is because the total number of cells can be zero.

301
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:45,380
You have all trials to be here, or you can have one success, two successes, three successes, etc. all the way to success.

302
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,170
It's all success out of this and trials.

303
00:41:49,200 --> 00:42:00,830
And as we argued before, we can calculate the probability of this random variable y taking any integer as assume as is some integer from zero to ARDS.

304
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:09,350
And if the probability of this random variable taken by the US have been calculated in this manner,

305
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:20,900
that's what that's a after sampling without a with replacement.

306
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:23,270
All right.

307
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:35,150
So you are choosing as success out of this and trials multiply the success rate to the power of us and the failure rate is power and minus us,

308
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:42,230
not just give us the probability of observing as success out of trials.

309
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:53,810
Okay, everyone know how to calculate this probability, how this probability derived following the divination.

310
00:42:54,950 --> 00:43:03,590
If you have our success is our and trials. This is the probability of observing our success trials and of course everyone else.

311
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:11,920
The probability the PM is always zero zero -0 one two at.

312
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:17,659
So the city our function can be expressed in this way by anybody.

313
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:32,900
Why is the summation and it editor? Why I consider why there are one all the way and you can express the PM the city out in this way.

314
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:38,240
Again, this function is a stepwise function but only has jumped well.

315
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:58,969
Why take this integer about it? So apply a zero for all y last 40.00 at y 0.0 is q to the power of its at one a quarter

316
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:04,220
Q to the power of M plus n times p and skew to the power and minus one and so on,

317
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:09,740
so forth. And finally, for any Y greater or equal to it, always think about it.

318
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:17,220
One step y's function is to.

319
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:24,350
It's an. Zero.

320
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,640
Then the jump. My job.

321
00:44:46,160 --> 00:45:00,630
Function looks like this. I saw.

322
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:11,550
Here is to give you some sense of all this.

323
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:19,290
Um, this valley you're going to be like if you plug in a specific key and, you know,

324
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:29,620
because in our example where a physician trained ten people have got a disease, so the success rate of the treatment is one over four.

325
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:40,500
So what are the probabilities of different outcomes? Different outcomes, meaning how many people actually are treated or successfully treated?

326
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:48,210
So if you want to model the number of people that are successfully treated using this treatment,

327
00:45:48,810 --> 00:46:03,000
that's essentially a binomial right about if we define y to be the number of patients with success.

328
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:08,940
If I define the Y to be the number of patients with success,

329
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:21,330
then y follows a binomial distribution with parameters what what the total number of trials in this example.

330
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:27,900
And we found that the total number of patients and what's the success rate.

331
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:35,630
One. I four. Right. That's the distribution.

332
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:46,000
When there's two parameters faced, we have a fully defined distribution for this roundabout and the rest in order to answer the question Now,

333
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:48,920
what are the probabilities of probabilities of different outcomes?

334
00:46:49,370 --> 00:47:00,380
All we need to do is to calculate this out or CDP or Harry Y value or this roundabout output if assay is equal to zero.

335
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:08,550
Well, the point is and what the what the city is using the formula that we gave before I do in this formula.

336
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:14,120
Again, the formula in particular is as follows zero.

337
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:19,220
You can plug in zero into this formula that's going to be.

338
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:22,100
Q to the power of ten or.

339
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:35,600
Q Is the failure rate three or and so three quarters to the power of ten that's on 056, meaning the probability of having zero patient success is.

340
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:41,000
0.056. Okay.

341
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:45,710
And what about the CTA? Was the CTA as equal to zero?

342
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:52,830
Same body, right? It's the same. 056.

343
00:47:54,150 --> 00:48:04,470
And that's. You can calculate for AC on a one. What's the probability of having exactly one patient success out of ten patients?

344
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,870
That is as far as equal to y into this formula that gave you a point of 188.

345
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:13,560
And what about the city of A.C., for one.

346
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,380
How do we calculate the CTA as equal to one?

347
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:36,440
That's just an oh, there's two numbers and I'm up that give you this number which is point one, two or four, right?

348
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:45,590
And so on and so forth. So you can calculate it for all the way up to the point of ten and you can verify that the last number,

349
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:49,010
any of all of this, the individual amount is one.

350
00:48:51,800 --> 00:49:00,860
So this table, once you've got it in, gave you the four distributions and it gave you the probability of each outcome as well.

351
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:13,420
Any question? Okay.

352
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:19,340
So let's take a break and come back and to take.

353
00:49:47,480 --> 00:50:38,500
So we want you to know that I'm doing a song about Donald Trump, even though I don't know how much this is going to be so much.

354
00:50:38,760 --> 00:51:14,489
Because, you know, I think that to know the answer to your question, I have the right to do even dependency on themselves.

355
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:27,390
But, you know, this is what I did.

356
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:50,940
You know, that is not just sort of, you know, what I want to do.

357
00:51:51,850 --> 00:52:11,050
You know what I'm doing.

358
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:51,190
Yeah. I mean, it's something that I don't want to see, you know, that's what I think there's something wrong with that for me.

359
00:52:54,180 --> 00:53:10,920
I mean, this is, you know, she's got the right to vote on the war that she was happy to help your choices.

360
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:57,600
But she has to go that way isn't always easy to be the most important thing.

361
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:06,190
You know, this is all of these things.

362
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:17,380
I mean, I don't know.

363
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:33,750
I don't know. You know, guys that you know the real difference that.

364
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:56,120
So we're we don't see what's going to happen just because right now you're not going to

365
00:54:56,140 --> 00:55:42,880
get pregnant because you have a lot of these have nothing to do with somebody else.

366
00:55:46,590 --> 00:56:07,010
I'm not doing this for the time being.

367
00:56:14,160 --> 00:57:16,480
So I I that you I this because this number this is what we don't know.

368
00:57:25,390 --> 00:58:06,980
We're going to you have to find out happen to show.

369
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:37,360
You know was like, oh, I need to know how it got.

370
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:50,710
All right. So I don't have any volunteer for the conference after this.

371
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:57,940
I got to volunteer. All right. What's this all the time?

372
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:02,590
Okay, I to draw a volunteer to do it myself.

373
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:09,940
Okay. So my hometown is from Shandong Province in China, small town of.

374
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:22,400
It's a very small town in China. It's analogous to probably an hour in the US, but in the Chinese scale, definitely more people that Europeans.

375
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:29,560
But still relative to the rest of China, it's about an hour or two of us that relation that is analogous.

376
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:35,110
So that's where it's located and it's most.

377
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:38,310
Famous for this guy is a Confucius.

378
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:45,840
It's the birthplace of the Confucius, which is a Chinese philosopher or is the current of the Chinese sages.

379
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:53,850
So the philosophy of Confucius, also known as the Confucianism, was part of the Chinese social fabric, and we all love it.

380
00:59:54,270 --> 01:00:02,190
So basically, if you deal with Chinese, Chinese, all their mindset is somewhat influenced by this guy.

381
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:11,010
So 50,000 years ago. But his thoughts are still influencing millions of Chinese nowadays.

382
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,010
And there are many famous quotes by Confucius.

383
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:22,350
You probably have heard some, especially there are a lot of very nice quotes about education, about learning.

384
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:28,620
For example, if you are smart in person in a room, then you are in the wrong place today.

385
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:39,520
And to know what you know and what you don't know about the true knowledge that some of you or I know you often know the actual Chinese.

386
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:45,010
And also, when I walk along with 2 hours from at least one hour, I'll be able to walk.

387
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:48,480
That's all wisdom from this ancient guy.

388
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:56,100
He who learns without nothing is lost and who thinks thanks but does not learn it.

389
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:04,230
And of course, there are a lot of famous quotes from the Internet and never said how horrible things.

390
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:13,830
So what she was famous for, of course, is that all around this, the all around the computers or tablet computers,

391
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:18,420
cemetery the computers, and also the family medicine of computers.

392
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:24,780
And that's where I grow up. And I have visited all these places.

393
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:31,470
But my memories, it's been in a way over years. That has been many years since I come back.

394
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:35,340
And these are all UNESCO's World Heritage sites.

395
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:43,290
So we can have a chance to visit people in the future and definitely check out this that this great places, places of tolerance.

396
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:53,850
And also, if you go to church with these are some monasteries, abuses, man, some banquet, many traditional Chinese food.

397
01:01:54,210 --> 01:02:02,700
I wouldn't say necessarily most delicious food are never taken, but definitely, you know, there are additional flavor to it.

398
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:08,340
And also, the producers are also very famous.

399
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:13,320
So to play is best known for the culture and for the Confucian religious.

400
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:22,320
And if you wanted to learn more about the Chinese culture, it definitely CHIP is probably one of the most one of the best places to visit.

401
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:29,820
It's considered to be the Oriental Jerusalem and the birthplace of the Chinese culture.

402
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:34,469
So that's where I'm from. And again, I look forward from all of the years.

403
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:37,650
I want to know where you are from, what your hometown is famous for.

404
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:45,390
And also, if you want to do a talent show, you know, it could be an emphasis on a more fine class.

405
01:02:52,380 --> 01:03:03,550
Okay. So now let's back to our lecture. And we have already given the city out for this final mandarin of our whole class.

406
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:13,350
We noticed that the piano we have this code for our practice and given us any hint about it.

407
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:17,130
We can always play it and into this poem in order to calculate.

408
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:29,160
But for us, directly calculating this quantity may not be so straightforward, especially if you want to calculate all the piano.

409
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:33,750
Just plugging in each of us into this format are maybe tedious.

410
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:47,140
So there is a more there is an easier way to derive the piano using the previous pump or the phrase the pump for minus one you.

411
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:49,140
Then this is entertainment procedure.

412
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:59,880
And the reason for that is that if you look at this expression, if you change as two as minus one, this two expression almost are almost identical.

413
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:11,100
Right? But especially if you break down this and it shows us that he has factorial as factorial and minus as factorial.

414
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:19,709
If you tend to ask to be asked minus one, many terms stay the same for that action.

415
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:26,910
It motivates us to come up with a innovative formula for this piano function, which looks like this,

416
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:34,740
which says if you know the PM or Y minus one, then you can directly multiply.

417
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:41,100
Is the piano value? Will this quantity to God the PM have for why?

418
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:47,220
And this is for why from zero.

419
01:04:50,710 --> 01:05:01,660
Which one should actually. I can use this farmer to figure out the piano line conveniently.

420
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:11,630
You know, the camp for the president. And the reason for that is, is directly from the original declaration.

421
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:20,330
If you have a Y, you know, the PMT function is only shows why P to the Y one minus B minus one.

422
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:26,320
Okay. So that's our definition of the pump and that is equal to it.

423
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:36,130
You break it down and factorial y factorial and minus one appropriate to the Y, one minus P and minus one.

424
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:40,190
Right. And the order to get to the right hand side,

425
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:53,930
we need to somewhat count this after y minus one and you can do it by just taking y out of this y factorial.

426
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:58,880
So you have this y minus one. All right. And furthermore, you take this.

427
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:14,030
You have this additional term following this additional term, to have this minus Y, minus one factorial.

428
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:29,530
And to cancel that, you need. Multiply this on the numerator, right and these die in the middle to give us and shows y minus one.

429
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:34,000
So that's an important component that we need for this one minus one.

430
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,980
And for the term we call that we need a Y minus one.

431
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:42,430
So we just write Y minus one here.

432
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:48,370
And in order to make it equal to the original one, you need additional P and a Y minus P,

433
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:57,310
minus Y plus one divided by one, minus P and then is equal to the original.

434
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:05,770
Now, if you just collect all the necessary terms don't need and remove all the unnecessary terms, it's just a one we can.

435
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:30,450
Right. And this guy is. Exactly. Why?

436
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:37,890
Minus one. And this is a constant. You found out that the one that is P is it is this is Q.

437
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:45,240
That's how we define it. So that gave us this innovative formula for calculating the piano.

438
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:46,920
What binomial roundabout?

439
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:16,010
The question this binomial fits your short term formula is it's useful when you want to derive all this or you want to calculate this, all this path.

440
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,980
So you just make the calculations calculation slightly more convenient.

441
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:27,960
And sometimes you can also use it to define the so called mode of this retroviral or the distribution.

442
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:35,250
In other words, if you want to know which value out of which value, the random variable has the largest probability.

443
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:49,050
This may give you some sense because if you look at if you look at these constant if this counts as a greater than one, okay,

444
01:08:49,590 --> 01:08:55,649
you can directly conclude that the probability of the random travel taken by Y is

445
01:08:55,650 --> 01:08:59,970
definitely greater than the probability of the random variable taking miner y minus one.

446
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:10,170
Right. On the other hand, if this constant is glass or any kind of what it means if it goes down, the probability just kind of stuff.

447
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:13,650
So it tells you where the probability rates the maximum.

448
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:21,090
Just a look have this constant in front of this that is at Y minus one.

449
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:29,460
And so later on for how the distributions can use the same trait to find the mode for this distribution.

450
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:38,500
All right. I mean and Barron's for this we actually have derived this before.

451
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:48,340
I mean we know for binomial end times p recall the trick that we use is to complete some humor.

452
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:54,670
Right now, the definition of the expectation, we have this summation.

453
01:09:55,330 --> 01:10:07,240
I go from one and I find and choose a key to the I my my speed and my insight.

454
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:18,040
And the idea is to combine this I with entries I and to rewrite it into some other PPMO.

455
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:23,450
And then you simplify this summation with some derivation.

456
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:32,300
We have shown that the PMS, not the mean or the binomial random variable and P is ten times p.

457
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:38,510
And we have also shown that the balance is end times P, times Y minus P.

458
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:42,590
All right. Similar tree assignment, more complicated.

459
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:53,120
So if you don't recall how we derive this, make sure that it goes back to the previous Latinos and to familiarize yourself with the derivations.

460
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:59,480
That's a very common trait and a very useful trait to simplify this calculations.

461
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:04,720
Okay. Any questions so far?

462
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:18,220
All right. No question. Let's look at this example and see how to use this binomial random variable to help us address questions.

463
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:24,580
These theories suggest that a treatment for liver cancer should be considered effective.

464
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:31,509
I never said I've treated patients who respond in hospital class or on a trial of a new treatment in

465
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:39,070
12 patients and will consider the drug any factor if less than or equal to two patients respond.

466
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:53,020
The question is what is the probability and what is the probability that a drug with true efficacy rate of 30% is classified as any effective?

467
01:11:56,370 --> 01:12:06,689
And that's a very practical question. What do we know is that the hospital is running on trial and on how patients and the

468
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:13,920
hospital decided to call the drug E factors less than or equal to two patients response.

469
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,290
So that's their criteria.

470
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:30,900
And the question is, what is the probability that a drug is is classified as de facto if it is actually effective with a true efficacy of 30%?

471
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:36,360
In other words, what is the probability of misclassification in this case?

472
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:46,100
So I'll give you 3 minutes to discuss in group if you want to.

473
01:12:46,370 --> 01:12:50,570
And find a way to use a binomial or a random variable.

474
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:57,710
And you would just learn to answer this question so you can discuss with your neighbors if you want.

475
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:14,640
And I'll give you a couple of minutes. I mean, one question to consider first, how do we define the right environment?

476
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:23,220
And that's a very hard thing to do to define around environment and then define the distribution of the red that I write about.

477
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:33,030
And finally, how do we translate this problem into a question that we can solve using that random variable that we just define?

478
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:22,280
Operator. Discuss if you need to. Sure.

479
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:19,250
I just want you to.

480
01:15:53,810 --> 01:16:10,200
Okay. All right.

481
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:17,330
Someone also the first question all the way around about this because and I want.

482
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:36,730
Patients are responding very good. We can define the right amount of all to be the number of patients that responded with a response.

483
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:48,549
And why is that? Well, we don't define random variables arbitrarily and we define random variable.

484
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:50,560
That is going to help us answer the question.

485
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:58,150
So if you look at the question whether a hospital really cares about you are defined, whether a drug is effective or not.

486
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:02,620
It's based on how many patients out of this patient respond.

487
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:10,660
So the actual number of patients that are really responding to this drug is what are really matters for the hospital.

488
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:17,290
That's why we define as our running variable to be the number of patients respond.

489
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:28,020
Okay. Because that's something that we care about once we know that distribution so that we can eventually calculate the probability of interest.

490
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:35,280
So that's the first part we can define or one of our about the interest to be the number of patients who respond.

491
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:40,680
Out of this 12 patients. And the second question, what is the distribution for this random variable?

492
01:17:42,210 --> 01:17:47,040
If that is the number of patients who respond, then what's the distribution for this amount available?

493
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:57,000
I know. I know the right as a binomial random variable with what parameter, what is and what is p in this case.

494
01:17:59,070 --> 01:18:03,210
And it's what about the total number of patients?

495
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:08,040
What about P 30%? That's the response rate, right?

496
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:12,870
And we call these two numbers from the question, does this 20% matter?

497
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:17,580
It doesn't matter in this case. Right.

498
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:26,730
I mean, all we care about, about this random variable is how many trials may have conducted and our trial, what is the success rate.

499
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:32,940
So this 12 and 30% give us that information.

500
01:18:34,230 --> 01:18:37,230
So that defines the distribution by this random variable.

501
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:48,930
Finally, the key question is to translate this probability of interest to something that it can be something that's calculable use in the roundabout.

502
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:55,670
Okay. So how do we translate the probability of the drug as classified as any factor?

503
01:18:59,070 --> 01:19:15,140
In terms of acts. Ability of X plus I got.

504
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:23,790
Although I wasn't able to see quite what to what to do.

505
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:26,400
Less than or equal to that's or any quantity or very good.

506
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:38,100
So to answer this question, to translate this, what do we need to do is to find the equivalent event for this statement.

507
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:45,120
So the event of the drug is the classified to be ineffective based on the question.

508
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:52,170
It is equivalent to say the number of patients who respond is less or equal to two,

509
01:19:53,160 --> 01:20:00,690
because that's exactly how the hospital got to define and I consider the drug to be effective.

510
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:07,740
So you're going to write about all that we just said that is equal to the probability of X,

511
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:11,130
the number of patients who respond that's already constituted.

512
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:16,950
All right. So that's how you translate the original statement or the original question

513
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:24,180
to a question to a probability that is calculated using our random variable.

514
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:31,260
And now the you know, the question becomes, what's the probability of acts last or equal to two?

515
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:38,020
And that is something that we can calculate using the the distribution of the referral.

516
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:48,180
We know exactly what that is because x is a binomial random variable, so it only takes known five integers from 0 to 12.

517
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:56,790
So that is equal to the probability of actually zero plus and second one, but equal to two.

518
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:09,210
And we can plug in the farmer for this PMS by asking for a zero that's going to be 30% of zero and 70% to the farmer.

519
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:33,200
Well, that was 1.7 to the power of 12 plus 12, which was 1.3 and 4.7 to they I believe it was up to is two or to square one seven out of ten.

520
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:36,660
And then you can use a calculator to get these numbers.

521
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:48,960
All right. I'm not going to give you the final probability, the probability of a drug with a true efficacy rate of 30% to be classified as factor.

522
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:54,840
As you can say to solve this question, we bring it down two different steps.

523
01:21:55,230 --> 01:22:00,150
First, define some random out of all the interest so I can find the distribution of that random

524
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:07,440
variable and finally translate the original statement of this bank to some equivalent

525
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:12,420
form in terms of the random variable that we just define so that we can calculate

526
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:18,660
the probability using a piano or preamp or piano bar and video on our retroviral.

527
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:25,560
Exam. You need homework, you need to calculate the final number.

528
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:31,560
So here I just. That I just. I'm just lazy, so I'll leave it to you.

529
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:39,030
All right. So any question for the binomial or mobile?

530
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:47,950
All right. So the next distribution that I'm going to introduce is the following distribution.

531
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:58,639
So it was derived by the French mathematician mathematicians in the 1800s as a limit distribution of binomial mass.

532
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:03,129
So we have seen this limiting this relation between the binomial.

533
01:23:03,130 --> 01:23:10,150
And of course, when we talk about MGM, we call that and we say we have a sequence of random arrivals.

534
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:14,320
Was MGM converted to another random variable MGM?

535
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:21,310
Then these sequences of random arrival actually converge in distribution to that particular random variable.

536
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:32,020
As an example, we show that we have a sequence of binomial retroviral parameter errors and the p four and goes to infinity,

537
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:35,890
p goes to zero and times P goes to a constant.

538
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:39,960
Then that sequence actually approach it.

539
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:43,600
Now another sequence, another run of animals.

540
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:57,970
And the variable is what's all right about with a single parameter that is untitled, which is lambda, as is another way to know this parameter.

541
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:08,410
So these distributions the first invented self to for that limiting version of the binomial distribution later I'll pick up on that.

542
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:12,760
I actually have many much broader utilities.

543
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:20,020
So in practice class on distribution is very commonly used to model counts.

544
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:27,430
You want to count if you want to model the counts for some sum counting process.

545
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:35,920
For example, in genetics, you may want to count the actual number of sequences for a particular gene.

546
01:24:36,370 --> 01:24:40,330
Then this person on distribution could be a very good candidate.

547
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:46,150
Accountants. So before we talk about the actual usage of this distribution,

548
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:53,230
let's first take a look at the PPMO or the PDA of the PMO for this person on distribution.

549
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:07,240
To focus on distribution. The as I said, the single parameter is lambda.

550
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:11,320
And with that we can define the piano in this way.

551
01:25:11,770 --> 01:25:17,260
Equal an active lambda times lambda to the power of a y over y factorial.

552
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:32,540
So that's because the. You.

553
01:25:39,190 --> 01:25:44,739
So that's the PM proposal on distribution and the support for the long run.

554
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:49,360
Inviolable is all the known that to be anywhere from zero to all the way to infinity.

555
01:25:51,580 --> 01:26:00,309
So before we talk about more details about this course on distribution, let's first take a look at why this binomial well, approximate optimization.

556
01:26:00,310 --> 01:26:04,290
All right. Available. Previously we have shown that use analogy.

557
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:07,720
Now let's directly show that using the piano,

558
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:18,700
essentially what we want to show is that if you take a piano or a binomial or unavailable from MP like this and goes competitive,

559
01:26:19,210 --> 01:26:21,610
MP goes to zero an MP.

560
01:26:25,150 --> 01:26:40,510
Those two lambda and then Bass PMF will be equal to this quartet where lambda is just a limit and perhaps be a more direct way to show that a fine,

561
01:26:40,510 --> 01:26:43,749
fine army or antivirals will approximate a plus.

562
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:53,920
I went out of my way in a strength and writer show that it's essentially just a one line of proof.

563
01:26:54,760 --> 01:27:01,060
You can write out the probability of the binomial right available taken by y, by any y.

564
01:27:02,710 --> 01:27:09,340
It has this expression and was y times key to the y y minus p two and minus one.

565
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:14,180
Okay. And then let's take a look at each term.

566
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:23,060
Keep in mind that we want to go to infinity and P to go to zero when we rearrange these terms.

567
01:27:23,390 --> 01:27:26,420
Always keep that in mind. And this. Why is it constant?

568
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:35,990
In this case, this small white space. And when it goes to infinity pool water zero nine times P will go to a constant.

569
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:41,210
So now let's take a look at these terms. First, these entries lie.

570
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:46,860
So this y factorial matter. It doesn't, right?

571
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:53,570
Because it's cause, as I said, this arterial over and minus y factorial.

572
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:57,170
It doesn't really matter because I'm. I'll go to infinity.

573
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:08,680
So without doing any additional manipulation and factorial over a minus five factorial, I'll go to one as goes to infinity.

574
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:21,930
This well it's might even why only takes about a one and factorial and minus one factorial is equal to end as infinity this ratio goes.

575
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:28,240
So we need something to control these terms.

576
01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:31,880
And does this end to the power y term?

577
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:35,630
Can be where the power line can be used.

578
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:42,050
Recall that P is equal to lambda over n where lambda is a constant right.

579
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:50,550
So we can move this end to the paramount y inside this factorial over a minus five, you know,

580
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:56,960
with the rate of convergence, you know that then the numerator and denominator will have the same order of convergence.

581
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:00,860
So that guy will go to one as and goes in it.

582
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:07,460
And so then the first time it goes away, what's left is the remaining terms,

583
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:18,960
which is one over y factorial times lambda to the power of y times one minus lambda over and to the power of minus one.

584
01:29:20,850 --> 01:29:33,050
This is. Approximating as he knows infinity, he goes to zero and P goes to lavender.

585
01:29:33,490 --> 01:29:40,960
And again the first term, second term. Now we don't have to worry about them because there is no nothing that's changing.

586
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:49,270
The only thing that's don't change is the last time we have anything from the previous Lama.

587
01:29:49,270 --> 01:29:57,130
We know this guy actually goes to this particular town, her go to eat an inactive lama.

588
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:04,090
All right, you check your previous laughter knows this guy goes into an inactive lama.

589
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:11,200
So if you take the limit, this entire thing, well, go to the right hand side of the active lambda times.

590
01:30:11,210 --> 01:30:14,710
Lambda to the power y over y factorial.

591
01:30:16,330 --> 01:30:20,710
That's why we have this liminal relation between the two distributions.

592
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:32,200
This is just another way to show the binomial strain of the limited version of the binomial is a plus all distributions.

593
01:30:34,570 --> 01:30:37,990
But here is the example where you can actually say why that's the case.

594
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:46,690
So if you consider the case where any of the five people or one over five or a binomial random variable.

595
01:30:47,710 --> 01:30:54,850
These are the possible values or the binomial random variable zero one, two, three, four,

596
01:30:54,850 --> 01:31:03,400
five and it can plug in the formula to the platform or to calculate these PMS, the probabilities.

597
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:08,800
And so these are the probabilities of this random I don't know random about taking these values.

598
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:19,420
The last column gave you the piano from a puzzle or on a variable or alumni equal to one or the other words four times p.

599
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:24,070
So as you kind of say, it's similar and now the same.

600
01:31:26,050 --> 01:31:35,140
All right. So the probability domain for a zero for binomial is on 3 to 8 or plus on three, six, eight and so on, so forth.

601
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:46,839
And moreover, the person says it can take any and all that be integers so it doesn't stop at five, you can still have six,

602
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:56,400
seven, eight, etc. But if you sum up all the probabilities for why wait, I've got to say that's only on oh one and very small.

603
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:02,080
So this two I'm looking at is two columns. They are similar, but not the same.

604
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:12,430
And the reason is because it's not large enough. Alternatively, you can consider a case where you call it a 50 P or a one over 50.

605
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:16,750
You can do the same table, right?

606
01:32:17,590 --> 01:32:26,650
So if you are familiar with R, I encourage you to try and use the functions that you are to generate this PMA or binomial cosine.

607
01:32:26,830 --> 01:32:35,500
Just to compare this to synchronize with the increase in antiquity, simply make sure that the lambda is equal to end times.

608
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:38,530
P as you can say, was increasing.

609
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:43,120
I think for some P, this two sequences actually becomes more and more similar.

610
01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:49,770
So that's why you have a limiting distribution of binomial to be a causal.

611
01:32:55,270 --> 01:33:00,880
So the proposal on distribution has many applications, as I mentioned, especially when you want to model accounts,

612
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:08,350
counts of event that actually does not have an up or down where the counts can actually right go to infinity.

613
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:16,270
Then photon distribution may be a much better distribution to model such data compared to other distributions.

614
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:22,180
Because we know of a binomial there's a finite amount of arable.

615
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:27,490
There is also there is always an operable. You cannot exceed the total number of trials.

616
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:30,640
So there is no limitation.

617
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:47,799
The support is added and it is often used to describe mortality, incidence of rare diseases, variants of equipment, etc. aside,

618
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:54,940
there are accounts where in Qatar where this hub value data we think about whether policies that go

619
01:33:54,940 --> 01:34:05,110
distribution to model such data always cannot be used in survival analysis and the rare events model.

620
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:14,050
So now let's take a look at the actual definition of the proposal distribution in some quantities.

621
01:34:15,370 --> 01:34:22,000
As we mentioned, the support or the small space or plus are unavailable is 012 all the way to infinity.

622
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:25,730
That's a support and another community.

623
01:34:26,350 --> 01:34:37,530
The point is always zero. No matter how large that number is, you will always have a no, not now zero probability of taking that number.

624
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:42,360
The probability can be very small, but it's never zero set.

625
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:46,600
Not that that's a very important property, but it's close.

626
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:58,389
All right. Available and natural PM of this formula is zero everywhere except for this now not to be integers like it y takes take zero,

627
01:34:58,390 --> 01:35:06,910
one, two, three, etc. The PM is this quantity e to the run through the y over life.

628
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:12,310
That's hard, right? A little bit complicated, but memorize this by heart.

629
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:16,060
This is the piano for the right of retroviral.

630
01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:27,500
Business to the negative lambda to the y over live stream.

631
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:35,060
This lambda is a parameter and that's a parameter also called the pulse rate.

632
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:51,230
Let's see in a second why it's called a rate and this why is the actual value for this random object that it lies if you take y equal to zero?

633
01:35:51,370 --> 01:35:58,220
Now just give us E for the next lambda y for the one I just gave you.

634
01:35:58,550 --> 01:36:10,880
E to the lack of lambda times. And I have to e to the next level on the square, over to the right.

635
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:16,229
There are two quantities in this apartment. Why is the rent available?

636
01:36:16,230 --> 01:36:23,480
That I is that prominent? This tape, this English, this two laminates a parameter.

637
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:34,700
Why is everyone around? All right, so the city of four was all is just a summation, and there's no place for many other words.

638
01:36:35,210 --> 01:36:39,950
It's not. Cannot be further simplify it.

639
01:36:41,210 --> 01:36:44,900
Right. So you just sum up from 0 to 1.

640
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,030
There is no easier way to express this city function.

641
01:36:55,160 --> 01:37:02,530
We? So what is the mean and the barons for this run of.

642
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:09,770
So I'll give you a couple minutes to try to derive the me and the barons for this, plus our retroviral.

643
01:40:06,450 --> 01:40:31,540
She? All right.

644
01:40:31,550 --> 01:40:34,670
So let's look at this together first. Expectation.

645
01:40:35,090 --> 01:40:39,110
So again, there is no better way that I can think of right now the definition.

646
01:40:39,490 --> 01:40:46,010
I sincerely so disagree around. And also we can express the expectation using this summation.

647
01:40:47,060 --> 01:40:50,960
Sum up Y from zero to infinity y times the piano.

648
01:40:52,100 --> 01:41:03,110
Well, I hope by now you are. Your instinct is to combine this y with the y factorial in the denominator and try to complete some piano.

649
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:10,280
All right. So with with the manage practice at Excel, I hope you have the answer to it now.

650
01:41:10,670 --> 01:41:15,440
Once we combine those two now the denominator now becomes Y minus one factor.

651
01:41:15,860 --> 01:41:20,450
If you look at this formula inside the summation, it still looks like a force.

652
01:41:20,450 --> 01:41:25,400
All right, a variable plus a piano with some minor differences.

653
01:41:27,230 --> 01:41:33,050
One thing that if I notice they start applying for a zero, the denominator is going to be not a one factorial.

654
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:38,150
By definition, that's a zero. That's one. By convention, that's one.

655
01:41:38,450 --> 01:41:44,390
So you kind of ignore that part. And then why essentially start from one to infinity?

656
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:52,070
And then you can do a change of variable by setting one prime to be Y minus one.

657
01:41:52,280 --> 01:42:05,870
Now you can see how another you can have another piano for the same, both on distribution with additional problems, all of them.

658
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:11,900
So this summation is just going to be equal to one because it's a summation of the piano.

659
01:42:12,020 --> 01:42:21,380
Of course, on the computer and all that slop, this problem that gave us the mean for this goes on running model.

660
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:33,400
In order to counter the Barons, we can first try to calculate the expectation of the white squares and very similar idea

661
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:40,450
right out on the phone or at the council y y in the y square and the denominator y factorial.

662
01:42:41,050 --> 01:42:46,630
What you end up with is the summation of y from zero to infinity y times.

663
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,910
Um, these pmr times, the lambda.

664
01:42:52,810 --> 01:42:58,540
All right, again, you can do a of variable by saying y prime to be y minus one.

665
01:42:58,930 --> 01:43:06,370
As a result, you're going to end up with this expression and that is actually lambda times,

666
01:43:06,370 --> 01:43:14,180
the exportation of y crime plus what are y prime is the same plus retroviral.

667
01:43:16,170 --> 01:43:21,430
It's not the same random variable, but it has the same distribution as the same person distribution.

668
01:43:22,090 --> 01:43:33,400
Okay. And we already know that. Thinks about how using the y prime is one that J follows, of course, on distribution with prime the lambda.

669
01:43:33,670 --> 01:43:43,150
We know that it's the expectation that y prime is what the government we just calculated that talking about Lambda Times plus one.

670
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:53,140
Right. And with these two quantities you can count for the variance to be lambda one minus Lambda Square,

671
01:43:53,350 --> 01:44:00,580
which is not, as I say, a very important property or plus on distribution.

672
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:04,690
As you have noticed, the minimum of errors is always the same.

673
01:44:07,980 --> 01:44:18,299
Both are equal to this prime talent. Now the words and if you have a large man for for of course all around available.

674
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:20,310
It also means that it has a large variance.

675
01:44:20,910 --> 01:44:29,940
The actual value of the virus is the same as the actual value of the meat, and that's a very important property for the purpose of distribution.

676
01:44:31,410 --> 01:44:35,820
So that's one way to calculate the margin of error. Is there another way to calculate it?

677
01:44:40,790 --> 01:44:48,570
It really is very good. You can also use the moment generating function and that's also our friend.

678
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:53,010
The knowledge generating function can help us calculate all moments.

679
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:59,280
If we can somehow easily got the angles. We're going to take the derivative, evaluate our T for zero.

680
01:44:59,670 --> 01:45:05,430
And again, we actually have derived the moment generating function before focus on distribution.

681
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:12,000
If you still recall the moment generating function as a form of.

682
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:21,010
E to the LA Times. E to the T minus one.

683
01:45:22,150 --> 01:45:25,299
All right, so that's the moment.

684
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:30,730
January function. If you don't recall how triggered this, try to drive it out to class.

685
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:39,220
All right, same idea. Start from the definition and try to simplify using the traits that we have introduced.

686
01:45:40,090 --> 01:45:51,430
Now, given that MJR function, if you want to calculate the expectation, all we need to do is to take the derivative of this guy with respect to T.

687
01:45:52,300 --> 01:46:00,110
All right. Now, what is the derivative? What is the derivative with respect to?

688
01:46:07,130 --> 01:46:21,140
That's E to the lambda b the T minus one times what the times e and they evaluate T from zero, they just give us lambda.

689
01:46:23,330 --> 01:46:31,220
So that probably can be an easier way to calculate the means and that give us the mean.

690
01:46:31,490 --> 01:46:37,960
Similarly, if you take the second derivative evaluated on T for zero, it got the second on moment.

691
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:44,150
I'm going to get the balance right. I should.

692
01:46:49,410 --> 01:46:59,910
For files on distribution. I got given the piano. We also have this very nice relation, different relation between the piano in particular.

693
01:47:00,690 --> 01:47:09,530
If we know the piano for life or to I, we can derive the piano app for life plus one using this formula.

694
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:14,580
The ratio between I plus one and I is always lambda over.

695
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:19,440
I want to show this.

696
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:28,290
All we need to do is plug in the piano and then it should be apparent and this here, etc. this formula.

697
01:47:28,290 --> 01:47:31,830
It also tells us something about the mode of this distribution.

698
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:42,420
We call that this is a random variable that takes value from zero 1 to 3 all the way to infinity.

699
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:54,710
Right. So this is your piano. For each integer, we have a probability.

700
01:47:58,110 --> 01:48:07,620
At some point, this probability for the maximum rates, they cannot go to the infinity because they have to sum up to one.

701
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:12,810
But at some point it will reach a massive maximum and then it will decrease.

702
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:18,060
So these iterative formula. But tell us where you raise the maximum.

703
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:23,370
Right. If you look at base, lambda is your constant.

704
01:48:23,610 --> 01:48:27,480
That doesn't change. All that's changing is the height index.

705
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:42,960
So what that tells us is that if the lambda over ie plus one is greater are equal to zero, it's greater or equal to one.

706
01:48:43,650 --> 01:48:54,660
Then why four divided by five is going to be greater or equal to why put off right?

707
01:48:56,670 --> 01:49:04,470
If lambda over plus one is less than one, then the probability of why I want it to be last.

708
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:13,950
Now y equals. Right. So that's what it tells us about a log in to these two criteria.

709
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:25,230
Now just tells us if I last are equal to this is equivalent to say I is less or equal to what lambda minus one.

710
01:49:26,710 --> 01:49:31,170
Right. This point will go up.

711
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:43,020
If a if I is greater than lambda minus one, the PMF will go with that.

712
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:55,620
So we know that it reached the maximum that is lambda minus one or the integer that is closes to lambda minus one.

713
01:49:57,180 --> 01:49:59,910
Right. So they just tells us this formula just.
