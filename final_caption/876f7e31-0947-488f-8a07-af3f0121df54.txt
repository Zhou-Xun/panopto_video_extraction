1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:13,720
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:38,880
And, you know, I think the only place I feel about is losing calls for reform as far as some sort of education or making traveling.

3
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,080
Do you have. Yeah. Sorry. What is this conference?

4
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:58,360
I need a short walk and then I just have a great time at the club and think about how I felt.

5
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:16,470
And then I realized that I didn't feel like I was doing great work, which is the only thing I do.

6
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:28,260
But I'm not here for something. But then it's funny. I'm like, Oh, that must be great to see you all and multiply together.

7
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:37,940
I don't I don't know how it comes to things.

8
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:47,360
I was like, I think you need to write something.

9
00:01:47,880 --> 00:02:02,480
You have to say, Yeah, I have to like I'm talking about like it's just about trying to not just like I.

10
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,910
Yeah, I think I know which ones are going to be reversed.

11
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,680
So you can just say I would just say like.

12
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:37,560
You know, but it's pretty easy to attack because by the time it's if you presume just because they're so I was like, we can just do it.

13
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:55,400
Yeah. I mean, I guess it's just I don't think we need anything.

14
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:14,160
I don't know. It's 90 seconds for our first caller except for like normally I think people are getting in the way.

15
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:41,820
I think you're right. So is it now? Yeah, it's hard to figure out how to prepare for it, and I think that's for sure.

16
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:58,080
Yeah. Yeah, we got to cut that because I think that if there was an emergency next night.

17
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:09,080
So what do you think of the ads like this? Because this is something like this, I guess.

18
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:29,490
I think you are going to get to the during the years I've been saying so I think changes but nothing like that sounds like a good idea.

19
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:40,650
But I think what you're talking about because it was always so maybe some bacteria and then it would be a breakthrough.

20
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:52,950
And in other words, like this could be the fact is like and I think they're being produced, I think it's like no one is asking you how they're doing.

21
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,300
All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,880
Sorry. I kind of thought that.

23
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:15,600
Yeah. So, like, short chain fatty acids are there. It's just whether or not it needs to be could never get one of the first things.

24
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:26,660
But like you, another example, say there was some bacteria that was like, cause I don't know, maybe that's what I was going to ask you, right?

25
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:43,440
Yeah. Yeah. So that's why do you think there is a close to places that it's kind of like parents as if that means you care?

26
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:56,110
Because I'm sure when I started, I didn't want anyone to disappear.

27
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:04,439
So we can just go over there and hopefully not.

28
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,780
I would go to that. But it's not right.

29
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:16,470
Yeah, that is like someone's got to feed them.

30
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:28,650
And that's how you know what's going on right now, honestly.

31
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:53,060
I mean, how would you feel about that and how he feels like he was sleeping bags of it so many times.

32
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:59,110
Right. Yeah. All right.

33
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:08,620
So I guess it sounds like there's a short chain fatty acids, actually.

34
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,310
So there is not a lot of that.

35
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,590
Right. So, yeah, that has. That is our last.

36
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:39,050
So I do a measure of how I feel and I think some of what of like I think you're probably right because there are a lot of those questions.

37
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,850
I don't want to make them. Oh, so you're asking about them?

38
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:59,090
How would that affect them in the same way? My concern is that resolving this scenario is also likely to occur here, and we're on this timeline.

39
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,620
So we aren't broke.

40
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,140
I suppose we are has one idea about the consult,

41
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:27,490
which wasn't that because then you have to ask whether or not that is something that you and your friends are looking for.

42
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:35,910
Let's say like when you things like. Yeah.

43
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,560
Yeah, because I feel like they have.

44
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:54,930
Yeah. Yeah. I was probably only 30 something like how can I really like everybody else?

45
00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:03,730
And I was like, That's true.

46
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:16,050
But of course, that's why I mean, it's something that I feel like the presence of somebody like that.

47
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:22,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What could think of something like something new?

48
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:33,220
Something or what they're talking about, you know, bacteria that interfere with something.

49
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:38,180
Well, that could be positive. I'm going to see if you have cure.

50
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,360
Like, I don't have anything that you can.

51
00:09:43,510 --> 00:10:02,260
Hardly. Yeah, this is my first experience in something that, you know, I'll just say one word of the world.

52
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:10,140
I think it's a good thing.

53
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,720
I think it's mechanism.

54
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,330
Yeah. Let's look at.

55
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:34,370
What did I say?

56
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:39,369
That's about it. Yeah. Yeah, it was.

57
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,209
Only your answer is a kind of 2006.

58
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:53,260
Yeah. Because I was like, you know.

59
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,560
Yeah, yeah.

60
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:18,250
Well, I guess I do a little bit of a role in my project now in 5 seconds, which is actually if you're,

61
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:30,280
on the other hand, imagine that there's something that we can all be shocked.

62
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:48,129
And so it's not just just carbohydrates.

63
00:11:48,130 --> 00:12:00,070
That's why I said you're right. You're right about your friends, whatever they normally wouldn't be sensitive to.

64
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:06,810
But it wasn't like you have a little Oh, yeah.

65
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:15,970
And you're like, I haven't done anything before.

66
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:31,840
I think back to the same place. I think, you know.

67
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:45,290
I was just telling these stories. You get to see the of the literally in a closet.

68
00:12:45,490 --> 00:13:02,290
I know when I found out that I had seen these terrible crimes.

69
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:09,830
Okay. So it sounds like most of you had pretty good ideas for the future and for the biological function things.

70
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:17,570
Like I said, if you got really confused, just make sure you let us know. So we are happy to be working in the meantime, so have two more enzymes.

71
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,190
Another brief project. Great. And I'm going to finish off with construction.

72
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:29,160
So as I said, I want to spend most of the time on triglycerides because that's quantitatively where we're doing most of our digestion mostly.

73
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:36,950
But of course, if we're trying to absorb cholesterol or fatty acid or or phospholipids, we need to be able to deal with those, too.

74
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,950
So the key thing about cholesterol is cholesterol.

75
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:46,189
Remember I said last class can exist in either the free for all form which is over there or the sirup high cholesterol form,

76
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:54,770
which has a fatty acid that we cannot absorb, is terrifying cholesterol like we have no mechanism to absorb,

77
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,910
so we can only absorb cholesterol in the free form.

78
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:06,060
So even though most of the cholesterol in our food is terrified for us to be able to absorb it, we will need to verify that.

79
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:12,840
We need to take that fatty acid off. And that is accomplished by a enzyme called cholesterol histories.

80
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:19,390
Right. So that's an obligate step for overall for me is pretty sure stick out fatty acid that you can talk about mechanism

81
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:26,870
to talk about later phospholipids are slightly more complicated so phospholipids we're trying to do the same thing,

82
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,740
except now we're starting from the guidance of glycerol at the beginning.

83
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,370
One of the things about Phospholipids is when we absorb it,

84
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:41,870
it's actually pretty important that if there's a head group on here, so let's say there's colony right here.

85
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,590
We aren't sure you're going to want to absorb that all is one big one the unit.

86
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:55,630
And so what happens for phospholipid digestion is we have a particular phospholipid also like a two.

87
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,770
You look up here, there's different these are different fossil pieces. The one that matters for us is A2.

88
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,130
All these other ones are are not relevant for digestion.

89
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:09,560
And it cuts off just in the same to position. So what you're going to have is you start with a.

90
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:15,030
Let's say a pass through a colony, and then you're taking out the number two fatty acid.

91
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:20,550
Now you end up with this really, really, really asymmetrical fatty acid.

92
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:26,670
So when you have a fatty acid on one side and then a bunch of nothing and then a big head group here that's called a light.

93
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,479
So phospholipid that links all fossil with itself.

94
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,220
It's phosphatidylcholine. It is now a lifestyle plus fertil calling.

95
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:42,220
And so that is quite, quite soluble, right. Because as you can imagine, this is now very, very triangular.

96
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:48,250
Right. Because now you've cut off everything on one side and then you've got the head, which is always on the outside.

97
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:55,770
And so that's phospholipids. So phospholipid absorption is obligate to having a fossil like a tooth.

98
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:00,410
Okay. All right, so this is your study summary table.

99
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:07,530
Think of all defined for light hazes we'll talk about Francois legal gastric pancreatic remember is is collectors,

100
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:13,770
cholesterol strains and possibly disease. So if you want to copy that, you can get a bit of free as well.

101
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,520
Well, if you spend 5 minutes kind of trying to fill out as much of this table as you can with your group,

102
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,300
and I believe there's an active ingredients in the press. Again, same thing.

103
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,100
You don't have to complete it to get the points.

104
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:53,430
But if you do want feedback to circle or highlight like confused about specificity of cholesterol and so you have to WorkChoices I understand now.

105
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:14,340
Not only does it not like convert Arabs.

106
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:28,650
I was confused. Yeah. I wouldn't take that as a two or 3%.

107
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,650
I know he's got it. Yeah.

108
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:58,520
I don't have the right to the Nobel Peace Prize smokestack or just a file or something like that.

109
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:22,950
So very little. I mean, that link was made clear to me, so perhaps I'm not going to give you some answers.

110
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,849
So you know what I mean?

111
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:42,930
If they weren't so lucky is going to be allowed to become active in the state party.

112
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:56,030
Yeah. It works on, you know, your dreams.

113
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:06,630
All these things that I want to say.

114
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:14,500
So. Hey. Hey. Yeah.

115
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:27,800
So if there's a lot of us and God, and then when you think about it, you know,

116
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:42,920
while there are some flexible and so that probably will be used for somewhere else,

117
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:57,329
but this is where you would have to know what's so emotionally good once you get close enough.

118
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,850
I think that can help you.

119
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:07,310
Right. A good part of the spring.

120
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,860
Right. Yes, that's right.

121
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,360
In all, it looks like they're looking for.

122
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:24,880
And then it's also for as long as you know what you want to throw it just tremendously.

123
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:37,000
So I went the place and it was kind of a good example when you think about like anyone entering a job,

124
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:48,660
like I was holding hands down wasn't independent counsel.

125
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,570
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

126
00:20:52,860 --> 00:21:02,310
It's like I want to see yourself. As you said yesterday, I suppose it's all the time of the contestants, you know, like that and then.

127
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:07,439
That's right. Yeah, that's right.

128
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:22,440
Yeah. See, that's your thing with a few thousand people moderating and that's what kind of, you know, that's a fair work environment.

129
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:27,360
I think that's really good excuse.

130
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,720
All kinds of different sizes and accessories and engines.

131
00:21:44,250 --> 00:22:02,810
Well, what would it be? One would probably be strong and competitive and I a see detailed one that worked for me in my case.

132
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:09,690
One each similar property, one of 17 or something.

133
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:20,450
I think you have to make sure you go through them.

134
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,960
I know. Yeah, I know.

135
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,520
Yeah, I think so. Okay, so I'm going to move on.

136
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,450
So, again, this table doesn't have to be complete, although it would be helpful, I think, as a study tool if it was.

137
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:42,170
And like I said, circle or a highlight, if you want any feedback on your part that you're not you're not totally sure.

138
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,809
Okay. So as I've been saying over and over and over again, the product,

139
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:51,629
the whole goal here is to get to the smallest, most lipid soluble form of that lipid, right?

140
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,810
So throughout this process we've generated a bunch of things.

141
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,400
We generate a bunch of fatty acids.

142
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:05,530
Simoneaux And Phase Willis roles, including some nice phospholipids, probably some free cholesterol, and potentially even some fully formed forklifts.

143
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:11,399
All of these are naturally going to come back into along with the bile acids into things they're called myself.

144
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,700
So my cells are the smallest form of these lipid, right?

145
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:21,120
So if you think of a big blob of fat like a hunk of butter as it goes down and down, it's going to get smaller and smaller and smaller.

146
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,299
Smaller. And now my cell is literally just a few molecules around. Right.

147
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:29,400
So it's very, very, very, very, very small. So how do we get that into our bodies?

148
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,750
Amazingly, incredibly. It seems like right now we don't have a really good answer to that question.

149
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:39,329
This is a pretty fundamental question of like human physiology, that we don't know exactly how it happens.

150
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:45,540
So what we think happens and then I'll tell you why I think we're all wrong, is that these mice get so small,

151
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:49,410
but they're able to just kind of comfortably line up along the brush,

152
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:55,709
the brush quarter of the entire site, and then they're just able to release their contents to the inside.

153
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,920
Right. And so that's the way right now people think it works.

154
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:08,670
If you look at a a first quarter of a person or a mouse that just recently consumed a lot of fat, you'll see that it's kind of what it looks like.

155
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:12,770
You'll see there's a bunch of fat right on the apical membranes and then they get into the column.

156
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:19,260
The reason I don't think that this is what happens is we used to think that's what happened with cholesterol, too, right?

157
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:24,330
We're like, oh, the cholesterol was kind of like hanging out nearby and then like magically get inside the cell.

158
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:29,459
And then it turned out somebody was identified that had a variant that was a

159
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,120
transporter that we didn't even know exists that prevented that from happening.

160
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,990
Right. So my guess is this is actually none of this is true. It may be helpful.

161
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,920
It's certainly helpful to get to a small part so it can be sort of adjacent.

162
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:46,650
My guess is for all of these fatty acids, there are relevant transporters, but we just don't know what they are.

163
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:51,420
And so important because they are, we don't really know if they're active or passive transport.

164
00:24:51,690 --> 00:25:00,600
What we do know is that in general, the bile salts are not absorbed in this process, so they are solid enough that they stay on the outside.

165
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,799
All right. So what's going on inside the cells?

166
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:10,680
I'm going to start with with cholesterol here, because we've learned a lot in the last ten years or so about what's happening with lifestyle.

167
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:22,440
So I mentioned this transcription factor earlier in the lecture today called Starter EVP to Sterile Response Element Binding Protein Number two.

168
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,730
And it is extremely important for the regulation of cholesterol uptake.

169
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:34,050
So here's what we think happens. So as already, BP too is a sensor of insufficient cholesterol.

170
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:42,450
And well, what clearly the way it works is it is normally found and stuck in a membrane that is not anywhere near the nucleus.

171
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:49,950
Right. For a transcription factor to meet gene transcription, that transcription factor shown in yellow here means to be able to get into the nucleus.

172
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:57,500
Normally, as our EVP two is found on e.R, which is not in the exhibit and therefore it is inactive because it cannot do that.

173
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:03,030
It's just hanging out there doing that and it is bound there because cholesterol keeps it there, right?

174
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:08,940
So if there's enough cholesterol that's with the recognition in the membrane, the transcription factor will just hang out on the air.

175
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:16,260
Right? So it will be there and it will not be active. However, if cholesterol levels are below a particular threshold.

176
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,149
Now, what happens is the transcription factor part of this protein gets cleaved off, right?

177
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:26,790
So there's a a an enzyme called B two and it comes in and it cleaves off this transcription factor.

178
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,850
And now that transcription factor can go into the nucleus.

179
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:37,220
Now it's in the nucleus. It's free to transcribe genes. And in the case of the entire site, there are two genes that are particularly important here.

180
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,260
NBC one, L one and ABC G five and eight.

181
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:46,910
Right? So these are the two key and parasite things. So they are made when cholesterol is low.

182
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:51,140
So we kind of recap the entire site, not the body.

183
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,710
The entire site is detecting how much cholesterol does it have?

184
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:03,890
And when its cholesterol levels are low, it is going to make a bunch of these two poorly named things.

185
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:09,710
Okay, which I will talk about. And that's because it is sensing this here.

186
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:14,150
I mention as we're going to earlier in the context of pilot.

187
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:20,330
Right. And it's doing the same thing in the liver in the context of milestones in that if there is insufficient cholesterol,

188
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,530
it will stop the production of of 71.

189
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,940
Right. So it's doing it's the same enzyme just playing a different role in the liver and in the entire site.

190
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:34,430
Okay. So what are ABC want to what ABC five and eight are they are really poorly name even pick

191
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:41,030
complex one like one an ABC game ABC transporter percent number g five or something.

192
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:45,200
Names do not matter. They're not properly so. What are they doing?

193
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:50,030
It turns out that NBC 1l1 isn't the cholesterol transporter.

194
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,470
That is the thing that enables cholesterol to get into our bodies.

195
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,560
All of our cells that need cholesterol have and PC 1015 This is what I was saying before.

196
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:04,760
We didn't know what a transporter was for the fatty acids. We used to say there was no transporter for cholesterol,

197
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:12,020
but then there was a person who was identified that had a loss of function and PCL one and was extremely hypo cholesterol.

198
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,440
It was actually a whole family of people that were found that had this disorder.

199
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,749
And then they said, Oh, what's this? And you see one on one thing.

200
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:22,700
And then through four or five years of biochemistry, we've identified that it is actually a transport.

201
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,459
Okay. So that's what you see one on one. That's right.

202
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:32,570
So if you have an ABC one on one on your entire site, that will enable cholesterol to get into your entire site and then out of your entire site.

203
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:39,680
And then it's the rest of your entire body. Right? What is ABC G five and ABC.

204
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:47,340
These are influx transporters. So what they do is they take cholesterol and they kick it back out into the living.

205
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,780
So they take cholesterol that is in the entire site and they kick it out.

206
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:58,610
Now, what they were identified on it was actually slightly differently. There is a condition called sitosterol imminent or quite old star Olivia.

207
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,400
Plants contain no cholesterol.

208
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:08,000
There is not a plant that has ever been described that has a single molecule of cholesterol in it unless you flip through it are right.

209
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,830
But they do have the plant equivalent of sterols which are called Phytosterols or Phytosterols, right?

210
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,780
They're not sure. We don't think they have any real biological function.

211
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:23,990
But plants, just like humans, need to have signaling molecules and ways just to add fluidity of the cellular membrane.

212
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,500
So they meet stairwells. These are some plants. They're all here.

213
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:32,060
You can see they look a lot like cholesterol. But if you look carefully enough, they're not exactly like cholesterol.

214
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:40,180
What ABC five and ABC eight do is they detect these cholesterols and they kick them back out.

215
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:43,580
Right. So they're like, this looks like a cholesterol, but it is not.

216
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:48,950
It is a brassica sterol and it's going to detect that and reflux that back out.

217
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:55,250
Right. The way we figured out where that existed, it was there were people that have plant sterols in their blood.

218
00:29:55,430 --> 00:30:00,110
They have high levels of plant sterols in their blood. It's mildly pathogenic, but not terribly pathogenic.

219
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:04,730
And those people were identified and they figured out they had a variant in this particular transporter.

220
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:12,559
So going back to here, what we're doing here is when there's insufficient cholesterol, we're increasing both the transporter,

221
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:17,570
which is going to let cholesterol in and the quality control mechanism, which is ABC five and eight.

222
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:26,410
Right. So it's going to allow cardboard in, but then also allow to check to make sure the plant sterols are are cleaned up.

223
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:31,969
And again, we all need all of these to because of relatively recent human genetic studies that

224
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:39,560
identify people that have phytosterols and and and cholesterol hypercholesterolemia,

225
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:46,070
which I'm sure that's pretty much anything I want to see.

226
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,460
So that's a cholesterol. Somebody has a couple of glasses. Go.

227
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:54,619
Is cholesterol uptake regulated? Absolutely. Cholesterol uptake is very, very, very tightly regulated.

228
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,859
If you have high cholesterol in your in person, you will not talk anymore.

229
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:04,730
If you have low cholesterol interest, you will absorb quite a lot is very, very highly regulated for sure at the level of the interesting.

230
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:10,009
Okay. So what about what else is going on here? There's a distinction here.

231
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,570
Now, moving back to the fatty acids and the main ways of glycerol,

232
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:17,660
there's a distinction here between the medium chain and the short chain fatty acids and the chain audiences.

233
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:21,440
So launching fatty acids are still relatively insoluble.

234
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:27,540
So the long chain fatty acids are going to be repackaged back into triglycerides and cholesterol esters.

235
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,460
Right. So it seems a little counterproductive. You start with the fat, you break it down so fatty.

236
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,750
As of Monoglycerides, they go through the transporter that I'm sure exists, but we don't know what it is yet.

237
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:41,330
Then they get repackaged back into triglycerides and that's because they're already pretty insoluble.

238
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:46,550
We need to get them out. And they are, as we'll talk about in a minute, is going to become packaged into kind of microbes,

239
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,620
meaning that short chain fatty acids, they just are going to diffuse right through.

240
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,700
Right. So they do not need to get repackaged.

241
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:59,320
If you look at triglycerides that are in the microns, they are very low in liver and or in short to medium chain fatty acids.

242
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:02,680
Right. So they are just generally passed right through, but they don't go through this column.

243
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:07,639
I contradict the other big difference between short medium comparisons and long and

244
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:12,500
very long chain fatty acids is that when they go with the medium chain protein,

245
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,230
fatty acids go through the entire site, they get dumped right into the blood.

246
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:22,009
Whereas in the case of column microns, when these things get reassembled, they're going to be kicked out into the lymphatic system.

247
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:25,040
So they're going to travel through the lymphatic system, which means effectively,

248
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,990
from an anatomical perspective, they're going to avoid the liver at first.

249
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:32,480
They're going to go everywhere else and then finish up finish up in the liver.

250
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:40,760
Okay. So kind of micron. Yes. We've got to see I don't know any medications.

251
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,410
Do they affect the transcription factor or do they affect the arithmetic enzyme?

252
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:54,440
Yeah. So so right now there's three different types of cholesterol lowering medication, but like 99.99% of people are on what's called a statin.

253
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:58,790
And statins prevent cholesterol synthesis, endogenous poly cholesterol synthesis.

254
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,139
There are two other ones.

255
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:06,150
One affects a transport mechanism, not this one out of one LDL receptor mechanism and another one that affects a sort of entity.

256
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,480
But those are pretty rare. Those are usually only for people who are not in cells.

257
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:17,090
But like I said, we've only discovered that you see one on one pretty recently,

258
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,940
and it's only really become accepted that this is a major form of cholesterol

259
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:27,099
uptake in the time I've been teaching this class like six or seven years. And so it is druggable for sure, but there are some drugs to it.

260
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:33,620
Thank you. So I'm going to move on to kilo microns.

261
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:39,110
So kind of microns are are our first lipoproteins.

262
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:45,020
And so as I've been saying, but big problem with lipids is we need to get them to be soluble somehow.

263
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,770
Right. And we went through all this trouble here to get them into a soluble form.

264
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:53,900
We put them back into triglycerides and then we need to get them from our interest to somewhere else in our body.

265
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,719
And the thing that does that is a kiva where there is going to be four different other equal lipoproteins we're going to talk about.

266
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:07,430
But this is the first one. So the neutral lipids in the middle, they have proteins on the outside.

267
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:15,079
These proteins are called equal lipoproteins and then they have surface that this is mostly phospholipids and cluster free cholesterol on the surface.

268
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,450
Right. So all the particles look broadly like this.

269
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:23,690
They have a phospholipid cholesterol coat and then a neutral lipid core with people with proteins on them.

270
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,209
Those people lipoproteins are unique generally to the lipoprotein particles and

271
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:33,170
they serve to sort of target the particle to the correct location in the cell.

272
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:39,200
So the column, Micron, the goal is it is going from the entire site to the periphery, ideally the fat into the muscle, right?

273
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,359
So it's going to have equal lipoproteins on it that are going to dictate that trafficking occurs.

274
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:50,930
So you can think of these proteins as perfectly like cargo carrying things, but also partially like post positive zip codes.

275
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,340
So these are made in the entire site and then they are excreted out of the entire site into the on paddock system.

276
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,559
Like I said, this is our first apolipoprotein.

277
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:08,060
They're all all the appealable proteins are called by a letter A through E and then sometimes by number 148, etc.

278
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:14,480
They have different roles and we're talking a lot of these when we get through to transport and regulatory transport.

279
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:19,460
But generally the way they work is by either activating a particular enzyme or

280
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,060
activating and binding for a particular receptor to involve the whole heart.

281
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:31,840
Right. So certain ones, for example, even SAGITTAL 100, has high sensitivity for the LDL receptor, which is in the liver.

282
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:38,330
Right. So that's how it gets targeted. So for some context, these are the ones really talk about how the microns are the first one.

283
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:42,950
They have the most triglycerides. They're by far the largest and also different by part of the shortest half life.

284
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:46,280
The other part of my current is like less than 30 minutes.

285
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:51,770
And then these are the other three we're going to talk about in a future classes, the LDL, HDL, and I told you.

286
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,540
So, where are these guys going?

287
00:35:53,540 --> 00:36:00,710
As I said, they are going from the entire site and they're trying to send lipids to the muscle and to the adipose tissue.

288
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:07,340
Anything that does not get taken up by the muscle or the adipose tissue eventually gets retaken up as part of the liver.

289
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:14,600
When column icon becomes depleted of most of its cargo, it's becoming something that is called a high micron remnant.

290
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,590
Right? So it's just sort of like an empty kind of micron and then it gets recirculated in the liver.

291
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,700
And then so kind of microns are absolutely essential for fat absorption.

292
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:27,709
The equilibrium proteins for over 12 microns are a one and equal will be 48.

293
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:31,400
Right. So they're the ones that dictate that the fatty acids are the triggers.

294
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:36,469
Are you going to go to the outposts in the most xenophobic people, to anybody in circulation?

295
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:39,880
So not in the interior site, but then they pick up from the individual cells within the.

296
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,140
But that and I think this is basically the same thing.

297
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:52,790
It just bypasses. I'm just saying that it bypasses the blood and goes through the system first.

298
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:59,780
Okay. So the last letter I want to talk about is a particular disease, again, relatively recent disease.

299
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,600
And it is the is called tidal micro retention.

300
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,940
So what that means is kind of like run can be made.

301
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:11,330
So we are allowed to be synthesized within the entire site.

302
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:14,960
They are just unable to be secreted into the lymphatic system.

303
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,940
Right. So that's what CRT means, right?

304
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:22,370
You're making the caller microns fine, but you are just impaired in your ability to secrete them into the lymphatic system.

305
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:28,370
And this is because of which you go from lots of money, which is important for exocytosis, these kind of migrants,

306
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:32,770
to the process of taking the cholera icons, which are made generally in the air and secreting it out.

307
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:36,280
Series pretty rare. So it's like glycogen storage diseases.

308
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,350
It's rare. So rare. Pretty uncommon.

309
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,309
So I guess what I have is this is kind of for everybody is are these two questions

310
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:49,900
what would you predict symptom logically for somebody who has Kyle Omicron retention.

311
00:37:50,120 --> 00:38:01,330
So we start with that. It's possible that you will have.

312
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:05,390
Yeah. So that's one for sure thing. The Houston area.

313
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:09,079
And that again dictates to me something that there must be some sensing mechanism

314
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,340
in the terrorists that is saying there's already too much fan interest, like I don't need any more, because you're right.

315
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:18,710
Did you get saturated? If it was just pure absorption, then I don't know why that would do it.

316
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:21,110
Yeah, that is one one phenotype. They have Santeria.

317
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:26,830
This is often diagnosed early in children, generally infants within their first few weeks of life.

318
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,890
To give you a hint of another type of scenario.

319
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:42,050
Institutional general. Failure to thrive. Failure to thrive. So that's the number one predictor of the nouveau CRT is failure to thrive.

320
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:47,810
And that is because about 90% of the energy of a newborn infant is being breast milk is coming from there.

321
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:53,690
That right is by far the highest energy. So again, if you cannot absorb and transport that fat over your entire sites,

322
00:38:53,990 --> 00:39:01,910
then you are going to not be able to rely on it so that you identify that, provide them some sort of carbohydrate or protein based energy source.

323
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:08,870
So that's another big one, is failure to thrive. Any other phenotypes that might impact nutritional deficiencies as well?

324
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:18,770
Yes. So I'm not going to let this exact so very, very, very, very likely to be deficient in vitamin D,

325
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:24,110
because, again, those are all absorbed in transport through our bodies using the same kind of microbes.

326
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:28,849
Right. So if you cannot make the color microns, you are very, very likely to be deficient in those vitamins.

327
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:34,070
And those are often also discovered frequently in particulates to lack of bone growth in humans.

328
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:37,370
Okay, let's see. There's no treatment for that. We know.

329
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:41,270
Well, what dietary intervention would you suggest for or d?

330
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:47,000
I can think of at least three one really obvious and then two that are somewhat less obvious.

331
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:58,510
Because it is reasonably manageable if you monitor your diet. A diet like a high carb diet for sure.

332
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:04,120
A low fat diet, high carb, high protein, probably either going to side, but certainly you want to limit your fats.

333
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,530
Can't completely block it, but you need to limit them. So that's one thing.

334
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:12,540
Maybe it more like short chain, fatty acids. Medium chain, fatty acid.

335
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:18,519
Yeah. Short and medium chain fatty acids. Right. So this is another example of why would somebody want to eat a lot of inside you out?

336
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,520
This would be an example of somebody who would benefit greatly from eating well.

337
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,170
They can get energy from the fat once the that is in their body.

338
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,560
Like what? It's in your fat. And it doesn't it doesn't matter that you don't have kind of microns anymore.

339
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:36,250
Right? So once it's absorbed and converted into energy, fatty acids in your muscle and your muscle, your fat, you're totally fine.

340
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:40,270
So that's two of the things I was thinking. Such wasn't the supplement, right?

341
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:46,570
And then supplementing with vitamins, right. So monitoring and supplementing of those, same for vitamin E and generally again,

342
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:55,450
usually what happens is it provided a fat soluble form that is easier, easier to absorb in this case because the transport is still impaired.

343
00:40:55,450 --> 00:41:00,399
You probably have to remember overdose with getting extra amounts of because the transport is going to

344
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,200
be very much you would you have to discontinue breastfeeding in this case because of the high fat.

345
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,739
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So you would. Yeah.

346
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:12,120
And usually it's like failure to fry plus nonsense, diarrhea, diabetes.

347
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:22,030
These are suboptimal to begin with. We should say them a very solid but yeah generally it seems instead started out you see kind of with that

348
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:31,930
would be delayed early like well so it depends so there's two types of people who are identified with CRT.

349
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:37,200
So most cases of CRT are from parents that also has your brain.

350
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:42,520
So you're already aware and probably you've never even initiated breastfeeding as I guess some people are identified leader failing to thrive.

351
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,069
But that's less common now because there's so much more genetic testing, right.

352
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:49,750
So I think among later, yeah, usually there's like reduced growth and then once you deny for change,

353
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:55,960
then there's usually early and again people live their entire lives with CRT and are largely okay

354
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,010
as long as they're carefully monitoring their diet and suffering with the fat soluble items.

355
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:04,230
And there's something quite serious. Sorry.

356
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,520
So now this is sort of the summary for today.

357
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:13,460
We're going to move on to synthesis and oxidation on Wednesday.

358
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:20,019
And again, like I said, you're doing it the exam review activity, which I highly recommend,

359
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:29,600
if you if you didn't do as well these and you wanted those are due, I believe on Sunday evening that's where.
