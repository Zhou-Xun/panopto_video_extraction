1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,229
Okay. Take it away, Mac. All right, hold on. But I just need to see if I.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,810
If you can see my if I can share the presentation, just let me know.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,090
I've modified the presentation so I'll make sure I'll send it to you straight after the talk.

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,130
Okay. So you can share. Can everyone see the.

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,160
You just have to put it in presenter mode. Oh, okay. Yeah. Present from here it is.

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:37,550
Clear. Perfect. Okay, so I might not be able to see people raising their hands to just shout if you have a question.

7
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,360
All right. Okay. Good morning, everyone.

8
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,930
My talk is entitled Egyptian Epidemiology, Preparedness and Response.

9
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:57,470
Again, I'm sure to everybody calls me Mack. I'm an instructional associate professor at the School of Public Health in Texas A&M University.

10
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:04,760
Again, just a little bit about me. I did my master's and my Ph.D. in the University of Salford.

11
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:13,310
My master's degree was looking at food hygiene in students living on university accommodation.

12
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:24,499
My PhD was looking at a relationship between the home environment and childhood obesity in Egypt.

13
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:32,990
It was a pilot study. Speaking of Egypt, I am Egyptian and I spent the last seven years teaching in the American University in Cairo.

14
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:42,290
I am a comic sorry. I'm a professor by day, comic artist by night, and I tried to merge my two passions together.

15
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:48,450
And this resulted in the first, at least the first.

16
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,550
This is an example of my use of comics in education.

17
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,960
The Arabic page was a project that I did with W.H.O.

18
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,780
It was to teach Egyptian rural children about certain diseases.

19
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:10,940
Mine was about iron deficiency anemia. So I liken that and I likened the child with iron deficiency anemia to a spaceship running low on fuel.

20
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:18,890
And obviously, I'm a big Star Wars fan, so you can see that some of the characters are inspired by Han Solo or Princess Leia.

21
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:27,920
And the last image here is the Arabic book that Aurora talked about rooted in the body.

22
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:41,330
I, I coauthored this with Lisa White, who's an Arabic instructor, and this was basically a unique comic education manual for.

23
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,400
Intermediate learners of Arabic. So.

24
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,530
This is how my presentation will go for the first 10 minutes.

25
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,150
I'm going to give you a brief introduction to Egypt to the context.

26
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,530
I How many of you have been to Egypt or. No.

27
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,210
No. Oh, one person. Okay. Oh, wow.

28
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:12,190
Where did you go? I went to Cairo and then I went to Sharm el-Sheikh.

29
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,420
Oh, nice. Nice. So you had fun on the beach? Perfect. And did you scuba diving to do good?

30
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:28,990
Oh, perfect. Perfect. So one person knows about this has been to Egypt, so I'll just give you a little bit of context of modern Egypt.

31
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,370
So. Oh, sorry. We have another one. Okay.

32
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,490
Another person. Where did you go? Everyone in Alexandria.

33
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,260
Oh, nice. I'm from Alexandria, but I live in Cairo. But how do you like it?

34
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,550
I liked Alexandria more than Cairo. Alexandria has a it's.

35
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,920
It's very charming. Yes. Okay.

36
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,620
It definitely better than Cairo.

37
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:05,190
So I'm going to give the introduction a little context of modern Egypt, just to give you the feel of the the what's going on.

38
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:12,330
Right. And and then I will talk about the history of public health and surveillance in Egypt, at least in the last three decades.

39
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:22,860
And talk briefly about a couple of successes in Egypt and then go into the acute respiratory infections and COVID response.

40
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,050
So that's the big bulk of the the the the the presentation.

41
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:35,610
And then I will wrap things up by talking about my personal involvement in Aoki's COVID steering committee.

42
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:44,430
So a little bit about Egypt. Egypt is located on the northeast tip of Africa and extends into Asia.

43
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:55,830
It is it was always known as the gift of the Nile, because Egypt is a desert environment and the Nile basically allowed for Egypt to be livable,

44
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:01,730
habitable, and for farmers to grow crops and benefit from those crops.

45
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:08,190
And so for millennia, you have had people live on the banks of the Nile.

46
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:16,860
And as you can see here, a lot of the cities in Egypt are located on the banks of night and in the Nile Delta,

47
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,490
which are at the very top, which empties into the Mediterranean.

48
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,900
And that was once known by the Roman Empire as the Roman Empire, as breadbasket.

49
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:33,650
So just to give you a little context about population in the last.

50
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:43,210
Half in the second half of the 20th century and definitely the first two decades of the 21st century, we've seen a population boom in Egypt.

51
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,440
And as you can see in these satellite images, this is Cairo.

52
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:54,429
This is a satellite image of Cairo in 1972. And this is a the same image from 2013.

53
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,470
So you see that there are. Let me just move this.

54
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,570
If you can see that Cairo has expanded, population has gotten bigger.

55
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:17,050
But the problem is that. Population all, at least most of Egypt, lives on only 3% of the land, which is basically by the Nile.

56
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:27,550
All right. And as you can see, the bigger the city grows, the farther the access to produce and fresh food and agriculture.

57
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:40,370
Though our population right now is around 102 million as of 2020, and only again, 3% of the country's area is inhabited.

58
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:52,080
We are a lower middle income country. 28.9% of the population earn under $3.20 a day.

59
00:06:52,490 --> 00:07:01,550
This is from 2017. We have a literacy rate of 71%, so that's 29% of people are illiterate in Egypt.

60
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:07,910
And we have a life expectancy of 74 years in women, 68 in men.

61
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:21,080
Now, last ten years, from 2011 to 2021, we're not the kindest to Egypt because 2011 started with the revolution and 2021 was the pandemic.

62
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:30,200
So in between that time, you know, when the revolution happened, the twenties, which was the period was from 2011 to 2013.

63
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,560
There was a lot of instability. And a couple of you have been to Egypt as tourists.

64
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,030
Tourism is one of Egypt's biggest money generators.

65
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:50,480
So all of a sudden, for two years, the the economy was short because of lack of tourism, at least when the revolution was happening.

66
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:58,880
Once Egypt tried to recover and recovered from the revolution, we borrowed we we borrowed money from the IMF,

67
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,700
which led to one of the conditions was devaluing the Egyptian pound,

68
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:11,090
which means that people woke up one day and found that, you know, their money was worth half of what it was.

69
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:19,190
And the COVID pandemic didn't affect Egypt's economy as much as it did other places.

70
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:27,050
But definitely with the Ukraine war happening now, Egypt's economy is badly affected by that, as is everywhere else.

71
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:36,560
Right. So just to give you a economic social background and you might be asking yourself, why is he talking about this?

72
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:40,520
But when we talk about response plans, you have to keep these things in mind.

73
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:48,800
Right. So in Egypt, we do have our set of diseases that are that have been around for a while.

74
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,090
Many of them or the most common ones are the neglected tropical diseases.

75
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,900
So we're talking about leishmaniasis, filariasis and schistosomiasis.

76
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:04,340
These are all parasites that that that inhabit or invade the human body.

77
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,070
And then they have their toll and type.

78
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:17,870
Schistosomiasis was a particular problem, basically river flukes that get into your system and they eventually cause severe illness.

79
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:23,540
So this was one of the main problems in Egypt and in the fifties,

80
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:35,300
they just they they learned that tartar emetic injections were a potential treatment for schistosomiasis.

81
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:45,410
So Egypt in the fifties to the seventies launched a massive vaccination injection campaign for schistosomiasis.

82
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:52,970
Sadly, one of the patients had or some of the patients had hepatitis C.

83
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,670
And so because they were reusing and sterilizing the needles, as they used to do,

84
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:11,209
they infected a lot of the population with hepatitis C and hepatitis C was actually Egypt's biggest health problem up until the last decade around.

85
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:18,050
So around 15, back in 2012, 13, around 15% of the population had hepatitis C.

86
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:23,200
We also have malaria, but not as much as other African countries.

87
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,830
And we also have the problems of nosocomial infections.

88
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:35,140
So in Egypt, we have hospitals that are perfect and obviously based on socioeconomic status.

89
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:40,090
Some hospitals do not have as much.

90
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:48,280
So that image right there is a hospital ward. And we also have.

91
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:53,620
So here in the States, when you go to CVS and you try to get a an antibiotic, it's very controlled.

92
00:10:54,130 --> 00:11:00,070
In Egypt, it is not controlled at all. You can just walk into a pharmacy and buy whatever medicine you please.

93
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:06,549
Right. So there is also the the potential, the threat of antibiotic resistant bacteria.

94
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:13,870
And that has happened in Egypt particularly. HIV numbers are under-reported in Egypt.

95
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:21,610
But, you know, it's it's definitely there, but it's not a big concern.

96
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:27,730
But because of stigma, because of other factors, the numbers are not very reported.

97
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:32,470
And we also have 20. So we also have COVID 19 as of 2020.

98
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,110
So now I move on to the history of.

99
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:42,570
So any questions so far? Just before I move on, I'll stop after every section.

100
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:51,480
No. Okay. So we can't talk about the history of public health in Egypt without talking about the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit,

101
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,470
which we called them, and that was established in the forties in Egypt.

102
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:02,670
And it was to mainly to conduct infectious disease research, to evaluate vector control measures.

103
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:11,640
And it was collaborating with big players, the Egyptian Ministry of Health, the CDC, US AIDS, W.H.O., NIH, its collaborative, all of these.

104
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:16,710
And it was one of the two institutions in North Africa that had a biosafety level three lab.

105
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:23,219
And the top priority of this of Cameroon was to strengthen regional infection,

106
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,500
infectious disease surveillance systems, public health lab systems and capacities to prevent,

107
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,989
detect and respond to infectious disease outbreaks in support of the international

108
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,470
health regulations and the president's global health security agenda.

109
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:44,280
And then we spent a lot of time in Egypt, and that's actually a picture of where Nnamdi was located in Cairo.

110
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:53,340
But in 2019, they relocated to Sigonella in Italy because of a necessary security upgrade.

111
00:12:54,420 --> 00:13:02,400
But they still operate in Egypt. But there was a big, big, big part of at least the development of Egyptian public health systems.

112
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:10,050
So when we look at the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Populations, there are four main branches.

113
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,840
The one that we are particularly concerned with is the Central Directorate for Preventative for Preventive Affairs.

114
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:22,560
Because we have the Department of Epidemiology and Surveillance housed underneath that particular branch.

115
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:31,890
We also have the Central Directorate for Endemic Diseases. So things looking at the last year, for example, or as just a census to summer, basically.

116
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,500
And we also have the Central Directorate for Environmental Affairs looking at

117
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,770
environmental health and occupational health and central public health labs.

118
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:46,740
So all of these all of these departments.

119
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:53,840
Report and communicate directly with the Departments of Epidemiology and Surveillance.

120
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,130
And as you can see in this in this diagram, this flowchart,

121
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:04,490
the Department of Epidemiology and Surveillance receives information, also gives information to all of these departments.

122
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:15,230
Then they they compile everything and send it to the relevant authorities to, to and then policy, etc.

123
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:22,850
Right. So the first thing I'm going to talk about is the National Egyptian Disease Surveillance System.

124
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,650
This was established in 2001 by the Ministry of Health and Populations in collaboration with W.H.O., with Cameroon,

125
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:39,350
with CDC to collect information on 26 notifiable communicable diseases and the annual they they

126
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,970
annually report on communicable diseases published by the Ministry of Health and Populations.

127
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:49,969
Oh, and by the way, what the Regional Office for the Middle East of W.H.O. is in Cairo as well.

128
00:14:49,970 --> 00:15:02,930
So just just to keep in mind, in 2006, they developed an electronic system for four meds and they are operational in all of Egypt's 27 governorates.

129
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:12,750
These are the governments of Egypt, by the way. Some of the diseases they look at, they required, they require immediate sort of reporting.

130
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,220
So. Meningitis. Tetanus. Diphtheria. MMR.

131
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,930
Measles. Mumps. Rubella. HIV. Unusual health events.

132
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:34,990
Ms. And for Group B that require weekly updates, you have hepatitis, seasonal flu, tuberculosis, typhoid, chickenpox, etc.

133
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:44,260
Oh, of course, mercy was added a bit later when the when the mayor's pandemic or epidemics already happened in 2012.

134
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:56,660
So again, this is a diagram from a Department of Epidemiology reports showing you how the hospitals.

135
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:03,590
So we have fever hospitals, just hospitals, general hospitals, private sector, central hospitals, chest clinics,

136
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:08,840
all of those reported the districts will report to the directorates and then

137
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,860
the directorates report to the Department of Epidemiology and Surveillance.

138
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:18,350
And then they talk to the Central Administration for Preventive Affairs.

139
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:22,130
So that's that's how reporting works in Egypt.

140
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:26,270
And these, by the way, are the the the numbers.

141
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,140
So these we have 43 fever hospitals, 24 chest hospitals.

142
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:38,900
And the green circles are how the number of staff these onsite that can report to.

143
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,160
To the to the authorities.

144
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:59,140
Now in 2007, the Acute Respiratory Illnesses Preparedness Plan was first developed with H Egypt in 2009 when we had the H1N1 pandemic.

145
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,590
This was set up a little bit, so in 2009.

146
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:14,550
And that's work of epidemiological and vertical that systems were were developed to report a rise.

147
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:20,220
And we had an error in preparedness plan, which I will talk about a bit later when we talk about COVID,

148
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:27,020
as well as event based surveillance that was introduced as a reaction to H1N1.

149
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:36,130
Now when you talk about event this events in Egypt, we have what we call media scans.

150
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,880
So we look at Google. We look at the news websites from Egypt.

151
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,340
We look at social media accounts in Egypt and keywords on Facebook and Twitter.

152
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,280
And these are a list of words. And that's basically the word in English, and it's translation in Arabic.

153
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:58,290
So we have environmental, heavy water pollution, thalassemia, etc., etc.

154
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,459
So we also have sentinel surveillance.

155
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:08,590
So we look, you know, there are hospital based surveillance for avian pandemic influenza,

156
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:14,950
influenza like illnesses, acute respiratory infections, severe acute respiratory infections.

157
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:26,320
And there is a framework that links epidemiologic and lab groups for both human and animal health so that there would be a better risk assessment.

158
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,510
And all of these, by the way, we're done with Namjoo.

159
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:38,979
So Normal has played a big, big part in the evolution and development of Egyptian public health needs.

160
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:47,940
Now electronically reports 41 infectious diseases including ARISE SARS, AIS influenza like illness.

161
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:53,620
Pneumonia. Avian Influenza, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and COVID.

162
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:07,150
So. One of the success stories in Egypt recently has been the Ministry of Health's campaign to eradicate hepatitis C.

163
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:17,590
As I said in Egypt, there was at least up until the mid-teens of this country, around 15% of the population was HIV positive.

164
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:23,890
This is definitely a a burden on them, a burden on the Egyptian public health system.

165
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:30,550
And obviously, their their lives are, you know, made a lot worse with the presence of hepatitis C.

166
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:38,140
So in 2014, a an initiative was started by the Egyptian government called Meet Millions.

167
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,400
That's where that that's the logo that right there. That means 100 million health.

168
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:55,960
And basically it's aimed to test every Egyptian to take blood tests from every Egyptian to determine, among other things, HCV being HIV positive.

169
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,220
And once you were diagnosed as HIV positive, you were placed on treatment.

170
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:12,700
So you were cured of HCV because at that time that was when the cure for HCV was was developed up until 20 1314, there was no cure for HCV.

171
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:25,360
So Egypt had to broker a deal with Gilead to produce the medicines to provide affordable medication to the Egyptian public.

172
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:30,400
And so they reduced, I think the if I remember correctly, they reduced the, the,

173
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:40,450
the price of a dose per person from I think it was from hundreds of dollars to around $84 per, per person.

174
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:45,970
So this is a huge feat and a very, very admirable feat by the by the Ministry of Health in Egypt.

175
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:51,950
So from 2014 to 2020, Egypt screened around 60 million people.

176
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:56,350
That's massive of 60 people. 100 of 100 million people.

177
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,960
That's huge. And it treated more than 4 million residents from HCV.

178
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:11,020
This is again due to the epidemiologic data, the robust public health infrastructure that was in place for about ten, 15 years.

179
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,850
It's inclusive care to all sections of sectors of society.

180
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:22,030
It's high. It was also very high on the political agenda, and it was affordable.

181
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:30,190
We also have a we also have some progress with HIV.

182
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:44,590
So when someone is diagnosed as HIV positive in Egypt treatment, these antiretroviral drugs are free to them, for them and for registered refugees.

183
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:56,729
The problems with dispensing HIV antiretroviral medication is that there is no community based dispensing.

184
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,040
You have to go to certain locations to get them.

185
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:10,020
There is no private market purchase of antiretroviral medicines and definitely it is very hard to find prep in Egypt and.

186
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,700
Sometimes, you know, with the COVID pandemic,

187
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:20,360
there were issues where there were foreigners who were stranded in hotels in Sharm el-Sheikh and in the resorts,

188
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,410
and they were HIV positive and they thought they were going for a holiday and coming back.

189
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:30,290
But then they ended up spending, you know, longer and they had no access to HIV medication.

190
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:39,530
So UNAIDS and several NGOs in Egypt made sure to get the the the medication to to them.

191
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:50,930
Obviously, you know, it is still underreported because of the stigma with HIV, because HIV in, you know, is often thought, at least in Egypt,

192
00:22:51,440 --> 00:23:00,680
to be a cause of either drugs or sexual activity or alternative sexual lifestyles, which which definitely is a source of stigma.

193
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:09,129
And we've tried to address this several ways, including this film.

194
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,790
This film was a it was an Egyptian film from 2009 called Ismet.

195
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:17,020
It's from a true story about a woman who was HIV positive.

196
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:25,870
She was widowed. She got HIV from her husband. She was trying to get an operation done for something.

197
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:30,759
I can't remember what, but the doctors refused to operate on her because they were worried about her HIV

198
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:36,400
and worried about getting HIV because there is a lack of awareness around that.

199
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:44,290
And so she went on national television to try to to to make a plea for physicians to to help.

200
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:53,230
So, again, you know, the presence of antiretroviral therapy free for anyone who was HIV positive

201
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:59,690
is considered a little bit of a success story in at least within HIV realm.

202
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:05,110
Now, before we move on to the big question so far.

203
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,540
I have a question, Matt. Sure. Oh.

204
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:15,550
What's what what is it like for people to try to get health care in Egypt?

205
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:21,850
Because now that you're you know, here in the United States, I'm guessing you have Blue Cross Blue Shield.

206
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:27,150
Yes. Right. But in Egypt, is there universal health care?

207
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:32,320
Like, how does that work for people? So in Egypt.

208
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:43,100
Well, definitely in terms of. Well, there isn't there isn't universal health care, as, you know, as as much.

209
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:48,499
But I mean, in terms of like the the the initiatives that that the Egyptian government has done,

210
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:53,570
like the like the 100 million health that was that was free of charge.

211
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,060
So, you know, it depends. It really depends.

212
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:02,070
But in Egypt, you know, you have hospitals.

213
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:09,110
I guess it's more like here, you know, where you have. You know, you go to you go to physicians.

214
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:15,380
You pay. You go to hospitals. You pay for this. So it's it's it's not it's not exactly universal health care.

215
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:23,210
It's it's hard to describe, but it's not, you know, in for these big government initiatives.

216
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:33,379
It is. So, for example, with COVID, we we all you know, we were we got vaccinated for nothing for HIV.

217
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:40,250
We got treated for nothing for HIV. We got treated for nothing but for other conditions.

218
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:44,370
You do. Yeah, that makes sense.

219
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:48,300
But it's not like the NHS in the UK. No, no, no, it's not like the NHS.

220
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:53,250
But definitely there are structures in place because we know that, you know, we know that.

221
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:59,520
That a lot of, you know, poverty is high in Egypt.

222
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:09,860
So there are structures in place to at least address some of the big health problems like hepatitis C, I think.

223
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,640
All right. All right.

224
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:21,860
Okay. So we do have we do have health insurance as well.

225
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:27,599
We do have health insurance in Egypt as well. So life insurance. So I had health insurance in Egypt.

226
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,910
And anyone who works in, you know, at least formal.

227
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:37,260
This is the thing, though. Half of Egypt's population is not working.

228
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,940
Informal employment. If you're working in formal employment, you are insured.

229
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:54,110
If you're not working in formal employment, you're not insured. So, you know, there's a half of the population who are who who might be at risk.

230
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,880
Zach. Thank you. I thought you. I thought I cut off for some reason.

231
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:10,370
Oh, no, you're good. Oh, okay. All right. So short acute respiratory infections and COVID response.

232
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:17,620
Our five pillars of the acute respiratory infection plan.

233
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:23,440
Right. First is crisis management. Second is enhancing surveillance systems.

234
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:27,670
Third is chaos in hospital management. Fourth is raising community awareness.

235
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:36,310
And fifth is quarantine and entry points. So why don't we talk about the first pillar, which is crisis management?

236
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:43,840
The first thing that was done in Egypt was to develop a Supreme National Committee for Crisis Management.

237
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:53,200
So who is involved? We have the minister, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Local Development,

238
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,549
the Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

239
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:01,150
The Ministry of the Ministry of General Information Authority.

240
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:08,290
The General Administration of Veterinary Affairs. The Crisis Management Room at the Council of Ministers.

241
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:14,890
And finally, the Ministry of Interior, preventative and Endemic Affairs of the Ministry of.

242
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:16,990
Of the Ministry of Health.

243
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:31,420
So this council would look at national and global pandemic trends and they would decide the necessary preventative and control measures,

244
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,080
and they would monitor these trends on a 24 hour basis,

245
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:40,150
and they would use these trends to implement all preventive and curative containment measures,

246
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:47,140
and they would ensure preparedness and response four of an emergency team on a 24 hour basis.

247
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:55,389
And not only that, they would have to also establish follow up treatments and protocols and ensure that medical supplies,

248
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:58,600
case management and equipment for ICU use were available.

249
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:04,000
Now, it's a little bit of history of COVID in Egypt.

250
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,690
When when the pandemic started in China.

251
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:15,500
On January 26, 2020, the flights between China and Egypt were suspended.

252
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:22,429
On February 14th, the first case of COVID in Egypt was confirmed.

253
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:29,630
And if my memory serves me right, it was a tourist in Hurghada, I think, who was found to be positive.

254
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:39,290
Now, at the time, obviously, you know, as public health professionals, we were a bit panicked, but people were not as panicked as we were.

255
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,000
That's that's always the case.

256
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:47,570
You know, we're the crazy scientists at the beginning of the disaster movie were screaming, but nobody ever wants to listen.

257
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:58,190
So. In early March, we had another outbreak, but this was a bit larger.

258
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:03,019
So how many of you. Well, I know you have it was going to ask this question,

259
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:09,440
but you said you've already been to Egypt in Luxor in S1, where all the pharaonic temples are.

260
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,759
We have now cruises and these now cruises are very popular in the winter.

261
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,999
So if you ever want to go to Egypt on the Nile cruise, always go between the months of October and March.

262
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,959
April, because if you go in the summer, they are horrible.

263
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,950
The weather is hot. So there were a couple of cases.

264
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,020
Sorry. I was always just clearing your throat.

265
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,460
Okay. Okay. So. So.

266
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,690
A couple of cases were found on those now cruises.

267
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:53,200
And this led to the government shutting down internal and external tourism to the resort sites in particular.

268
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:58,690
Now, between so on March 19th, 2020.

269
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,410
All flights out of Egypt and to Egypt were suspended.

270
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:09,460
Now just a little story. On March 18, 2020, I was teaching an epidemiology course.

271
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:14,980
Okay. And I this was a class that I taught from 5 to 8 p.m.

272
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:23,709
So I got into class at 5 p.m. and around 6 p.m., you know, one of my students says, Professor,

273
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:31,660
you know, there's a W.H.O. conference going on and they're declaring that COVID is a global pandemic.

274
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:37,690
So as an epidemiology professor, I stopped everything I said, okay, let me turn this on.

275
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,840
Let me put it on the projector. I put it on. So it's live.

276
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:45,459
We watch it and then we start having a discussion about it. We leave class.

277
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:52,370
And that's the last time I ever saw these students face to face. So March 19th.

278
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:56,570
All flights were suspended on March 21st.

279
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:04,970
All mosques and churches were closed. Now, Egypt, you have to know that Egypt is a very, very religious country.

280
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:11,000
We have a muslim majority and a Christian minority and both are equally religious.

281
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,810
So on Sunday, on Friday, everybody's in the mosque.

282
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:20,390
On Sunday, everybody's in church. So this.

283
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:25,320
Particular decision is not the easiest decision to make.

284
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:33,800
In that context. But to make that decision in that context meant that something was really serious and something was going on.

285
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:44,750
So what happened was for the rest of March, there was a curfew that was enforced until the end of March, and it was extended for another month.

286
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:51,840
Although the the the the curfew was different.

287
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:57,450
It wasn't as extreme as. There are issues around the world.

288
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:05,770
So our curfew started at 7 p.m. and went until 6 a.m. and this is where all public transport was halted.

289
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:10,650
All cafes were ordered to close. And the thing about us Egyptians is that we loved the nightlife.

290
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:15,149
We you know, we finish work. We go to the cafe, we have shisha.

291
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:18,180
We we said we drink. And, you know, it's.

292
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:22,319
Cairo is a city that never sleeps. It's always bustling.

293
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:31,840
It's always loud. It's always chaotic. And then you had newspaper articles in March saying Cairo, the city that never sleeps is dead silent.

294
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:37,020
And it was dead silent, you know. I felt it. I'm a person who likes quiet myself.

295
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,920
So I was like, oh, this is a horrible situation.

296
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:46,230
But maybe a little silver lining there. So.

297
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,860
All cafes, almost all outdoor venues were closed.

298
00:33:52,490 --> 00:34:01,850
The reasons for this, again, going back to my introduction of Egypt, is that a lot of people are you know,

299
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:09,860
you have a lot of people who are who need to work and who need to go to to to to earn their living.

300
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:17,520
So you cannot just. Say You you all have to stay at home because they won't listen to you.

301
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,800
They will do it anyways and you know it.

302
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,840
They need to. They can't afford to stay at home.

303
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:37,350
So they said that basically let's shut down the entertainment or the leisure aspect of Egypt, which is nighttime cafes, shisha, etc.

304
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,270
So restaurants would only deliver. Malls were closed on weekends.

305
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:46,620
So no, no going to any malls, reduced work hours for all businesses.

306
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:49,890
So they did say, you know, it could work but reduced.

307
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:55,880
And obviously masks were passed out. So.

308
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:06,230
Here we have evolution of stringency index for the closure measures in Egypt from North Africa compared to North Africa and the world.

309
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:13,250
So Egypt is the the dark blue. And we see here, like the rest of the world, there was a spike in stringency.

310
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:18,470
So they were they were they enforced a curfew. But then so this is March 2020.

311
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:23,480
And then in April and May, it starts to decrease.

312
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,840
Now, why is that? Can someone guess?

313
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,300
That's a cultural reason. Is it Ramadan?

314
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,110
Exactly, yes. So.

315
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,860
As Muslims celebrate holy month of Ramadan.

316
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:55,540
So it's a one month in the year where they fast from sun, sunrise to sunset.

317
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,620
And for those of you that have never been to the Middle East during Ramadan, Ramadan is like Christmas.

318
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:08,880
It's all about family. It's all about gathering. It's all about, you know, getting together and eating.

319
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:17,260
And these are some of the images from Ramadan Iftaar as in these are in some of the lower socioeconomic areas in Cairo.

320
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:28,990
Right. So the government having already imposed curfews and because there wasn't a huge spike in numbers yet,

321
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:34,510
they said, okay, let's let's ease let's ease restrictions for Ramadan.

322
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,720
So people pretended like COVID didn't exist.

323
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:46,390
And this led to the first major spike in COVID after, during and after the month of Ramadan, particularly in June 2020.

324
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:54,250
So Ramadan in 2020 was in May. So what followed was a huge spike in numbers.

325
00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:05,370
So when that happened, after Ramadan was done, curfew hours were extended at the end of May and a mask mandate was enforced.

326
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:16,180
So you would spend you would you would have to pay around 4000 Egyptian pounds for violating this for violating the mask mandate.

327
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:21,460
Now, for those of you that don't know, £4,000 is around $200.

328
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:30,550
Okay. I know it's much it's still a lot, but £4,000 is more than what many people earn in Egypt per month.

329
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:37,040
So it's a disaster. So people started to mask up and take masking up very seriously, even though some people did not.

330
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:42,640
But there was a lot more mask wearing when that mandate was was enforced.

331
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:50,890
And in July, cafes, restaurants and hotels were allowed to open, but at 25% capacity.

332
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:55,840
And they decided to reopen places of worship.

333
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:06,220
I see at the beginning of the pandemic, Egypt, like all other countries, had their issues with with with dealing with the pandemic.

334
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,650
One of them was underreporting.

335
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:19,750
And in Egypt's case, this is because they were trying to get the the testing kits from other places and other places were using them themselves.

336
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:23,320
So, you know, it was a struggle at the beginning.

337
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:34,269
And also because there weren't enough at the beginning of the pandemic, there weren't enough beds to deal with COVID cases.

338
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:41,380
And sometimes the doctors would get ill and they would have no, you know, no way of being treated themselves.

339
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,030
So a couple of hiccups.

340
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:55,630
Like everywhere else in the world with COVID before we get for 2020, you know, as a as a university, as AOC, we went online in March 2020.

341
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:09,540
Most schools. So. So the the government canceled or basically said we're not going to school anymore in March 2020.

342
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:14,010
So that term was lost for many students.

343
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,490
When Fall 2020 came around. US.

344
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:32,280
As you see, we're the only university in Egypt to stay online because we had the capacity to stay online and we were following US trends.

345
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:38,840
But most universities in Egypt went back to face to face.

346
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,069
And a lot of the schools in Egypt went back to a hybrid format.

347
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:50,630
So, you know, half. So they would, you know, students would come twice, twice a week and then take online classes twice a week.

348
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:54,440
But these are the schools that actually can afford to do so.

349
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:00,200
A lot of the government schools do not have access to that kind of technology.

350
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:08,270
So they had to go back to face to face. So this led, again to a surge in COVID cases.

351
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:15,590
And again, Egypt tried to respond to this with tightened restrictions, inconsistent.

352
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:20,840
So it was fall 2020 was quite chaotic in terms of COVID rules and restrictions.

353
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:30,260
And by the end of 2020, we had a surge again in cases in 2020, early 2021.

354
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:38,710
Now. The modest lockdown measures in Egypt meant that the economy was wasn't too badly affected.

355
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:44,470
And the thing is, we didn't have as much of a food security problem as some other places did because,

356
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:49,700
again, as I told you, as the city expanded, food got further and further away.

357
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:57,189
But one of the one of the one of the at least the good things that the Egyptian government did was that it still allowed food,

358
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:02,800
at least food handlers to operate. So they would bring food into Cairo.

359
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:06,310
That wasn't that wasn't as affected as other places.

360
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:15,130
And also, they would set up food trucks in some of the low socioeconomic areas where people could go and get food.

361
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,249
The problem with. Employment in Egypt.

362
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:29,579
Again, as I told you before, half of Egypt's employment is informal.

363
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:40,500
So there is no contract. There's you know, and these are people who work as cleaners, doormen, you know, that just no no formal form of payment.

364
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:46,230
So those people were the most affected. And those people are generally from the lower socioeconomic groups.

365
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,889
Women in particular were affected as well,

366
00:41:49,890 --> 00:42:01,110
particularly women who are married and have children of school age and were employed at the same time because all of a sudden they're at home,

367
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:09,180
they have to deal with the work duties. They also have to deal with the children at schools and trying to to to wrangle their children.

368
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,860
So, you know, it was it was particularly bad for them.

369
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:21,960
Several surveys have shown that in Egypt as well. So in terms of enhancing the ERA surveillance system, the second column.

370
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:29,040
Any questions so far? But I will just say we have only 8 minutes until.

371
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:33,269
Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I thought it was a private.

372
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:37,530
It was an hour. Okay. All right.

373
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:47,520
So basically, they trained the area surveillance systems for at least the medical officials to deal with COVID.

374
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:54,210
There was a lot of training that was done. Actually, one of my students did not have to stop.

375
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:59,160
He was a he was he was a physician who was employed at one of the hospitals.

376
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:06,540
And he had to basically quit the global health program because he had to deal with COVID

377
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:12,630
in hospitals and he just couldn't deal with juggling the two respect him very much.

378
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,460
We started COVID testing systems. We developed COVID testing systems over time.

379
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,810
This was a a testing center right outside my university.

380
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:27,720
It was a drive thru. So you would go and you would get tested and then you would be notified of your status online.

381
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:38,660
I'm. It was also, you know, training physicians in hospitals to deal with acute respiratory infections.

382
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:46,640
We also had the Ministry of Health did a great job of using social media.

383
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:50,490
This was a this was this page was etched in our all Egyptians memories.

384
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:55,100
This page that told you how many people died, how many people got infected on a daily basis.

385
00:43:55,310 --> 00:44:00,160
So we would check Facebook for this this particular image every day.

386
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:05,360
So they had a huge campaign. They had a hotline activated for any questions.

387
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:10,760
They broadcast awareness campaigns on social media.

388
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:21,110
These are some examples of the Ministry of Health's publications or a community awareness efforts.

389
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:26,390
And we started the vaccination effort very early in 2021.

390
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:34,880
In January, we bought doses from China, from Sinovac and from Oxford, AstraZeneca.

391
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:39,080
So basically we started the campaign early.

392
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:46,610
We basically started first with medical workers, elderly and underlying conditions, and then moved on to the general public.

393
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:53,330
At the beginning, vaccination was very slow, but as as we progressed to 2022,

394
00:44:53,330 --> 00:45:00,260
now we have around 50% of the population having had full vaccination against COVID.

395
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:06,590
We also had but strategies in place.

396
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:08,790
And Egypt and Jordan did something very smart.

397
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:15,800
They used some of the hotels that they have in the resorts to house people who were quarantined for being positive.

398
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:25,580
And these people were checked on a daily basis. So as a you know, in conclusion, Egypt, with the challenges that it had,

399
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:36,979
I think that they did the best of what they could do with what they had at the time, which is these are the most recent numbers.

400
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:45,350
We've had 515,000 cases. Obviously, it's underreported, but these are the official numbers and around 25,000 deaths.

401
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:49,460
We also manufacture the vaccine now and also.

402
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:55,780
We we've had support from the U.S., the $9 million.

403
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:59,680
Very recently to deal with it. Any question?

404
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:04,060
Am I doing good for time? I'm sorry I had to rush through the end.

405
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:08,950
Oh, no, you're good. You're good, Mac. And then we saved the questions for the end.

406
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:13,780
Or, like, if you want to leave for university, you.

407
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:17,080
Yes. I will send you the slides right after class. Yeah.

408
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:22,120
I really want to talk about this last for we can. Or if you want to take questions, we can.

409
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:25,740
What do you prefer? Up to you. What would the class and leave that to the class.

410
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:30,920
What would the class like? They said questions.

411
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,780
Okay, go ahead. Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

412
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:43,870
So sorry about that. We made this all beautiful presentation, but I'm just wondering, so you said at the like now it's only 45% vaccination rate.

413
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:51,969
Is that just because they can't get enough vaccines when people get, you know, aren't getting access to it?

414
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:56,350
Or is it the same like vaccine hesitancy here that we have in the U.S.?

415
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:00,520
So part of it is vaccine hesitancy.

416
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:07,569
You have a lot of people who are uneducated. And and there were a lot of rumors circulating around social media.

417
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:11,260
That's definitely an issue. And it was the first time this was an issue in Egypt.

418
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:15,880
So we never had vaccine hesitancy before, or at least it was very rare before COVID.

419
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:20,350
But once COVID hit, the conspiracies were all over it.

420
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:28,240
That's one thing. Second thing, and I mentioned this in my slides, but obviously I didn't have the time to to focus on it.

421
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:33,280
The portal for applying for vaccination was online.

422
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:45,160
And so, you know, part of being able to get vaccinated would be, would be you having a phone, having a smartphone, uh, being computer literate.

423
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:49,330
So this was an issue.

424
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:57,370
So we had to, I had to personally apply for some of the people that, that, that I knew.

425
00:47:57,370 --> 00:48:01,180
So the plumber that would come and fix our drains.

426
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:08,920
I applied for him and his wife online. So I took their IDs and I made their applications because they wouldn't know what to do.

427
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:17,800
Same with older people who are not tech savvy, you know, and they get very angry with with dealing with this.

428
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:21,970
So, you know, part of it is also this, you know.

429
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:32,120
Not taking into consideration whether people have access to or know how to deal with this kind of technology anyways.

430
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:39,340
But recently, more recently, there has been a bigger push to to.

431
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,660
You know, so now we have 50%.

432
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:54,710
The thing is, Egypt recently has not had huge surges of COVID, so people might not be taking it as seriously as they did.

433
00:48:55,830 --> 00:49:03,069
Does that answer your question? Yeah. I'm guessing those conspiracy theories are coming from social media.

434
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:06,910
From the US. Yes. Okay. But what?

435
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:09,860
Not just from the U.S.? I mean, there are internal ones as well.

436
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:16,480
I actually had a discussion with someone and it's it doesn't necessarily mean that they are they are uneducated.

437
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:20,200
I had a friend and well, I was out with a friend when they in Egypt.

438
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:24,190
And I met someone who was who was staunchly against the vaccine.

439
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:27,910
And she lived with her elderly parents. And I thought, well, how selfish of you.

440
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:35,530
She didn't want to take the the the vaccine. And I said, so what if you infect your parents?

441
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:36,490
Your parents are very old.

442
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:45,040
Well, you know, if I if I turn out to be ill, I'm going to be you know, I'll just stay in my room and I'm like, well, you've already infected them.

443
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,380
So, you know, there was there was quite a bit of.

444
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:55,530
Vaccine hesitancy and not just in people who.

445
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:01,010
Don't have the access to that education. People who are very educated as well.

446
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,100
Thank you. We have time for one question from the group.

447
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:10,170
I was just curious, like earlier in the presentation,

448
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:17,120
you mentioned how I think people are getting vaccinated for the like a parasite and that's infected with AMC.

449
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:22,290
Yes, that is that I don't know, maybe that was a long time ago.

450
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:25,860
But did that event spark any vaccine hesitancy or.

451
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:31,320
No? No, because we we we were very.

452
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:40,260
We were very for I mean, I did not you know, as as an Egyptian, having lived in Egypt in the eighties,

453
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:48,970
there was no issue with in fact, you know, people would take their children immediately to get vaccinated because we had so many,

454
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:57,830
you know, instances of infectious diseases that could be, you know,

455
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:04,990
avoided totally with with with with vaccinations, you know, things like polio, for example.

456
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:13,210
So, you know, that's that those diseases were still in Egyptian memory at the time in the seventies and eighties.

457
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:17,220
So this idea of vaccine hesitancy was very recent.

458
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:27,970
All right. Let's give Mark a big thank you.

459
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:32,190
And I'm sorry that it took longer. I thought it was I thought I had an hour.

460
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:34,490
So I do I do apologize.

461
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:43,399
Washington, though, we appreciate you because I know this is out of the scope of what you normally teach, so you get to make this whole thing.

462
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,520
So we're definitely posted on this.

463
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:55,790
And I don't know if you all know that like every lecture that we make, but it takes about 2 to 3 times as long as the time you actually deliver it.

464
00:51:55,790 --> 00:52:01,159
So I really appreciate Mark taking the time and teaching this class in the future.

465
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,370
So hopefully you get to raise this again if you're free. Yes, yes.

466
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:11,180
But thank you so much again, Mark. And I'm your friend for for for letting me do this.

467
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:16,100
Yes. Hopefully I'll see you and Bryan College Station soon and.

468
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:21,980
And I post the slides in a little bit. Okay. Perfect. Bye bye.

469
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,960
Have a lovely day. Bye bye, everybody.
