1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,320
But then the modesty panel ends up on the side with your legs. So many lives were my life.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,830
I mean, even my like, yeah, that's why you're really uncomfortable.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,640
Like, no, it's not you. It's it's the table.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:22,400
What are you going to do about it? So next time you want to wear a skirt, you don't have to sit like a lady.

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,729
It's cool. Okay, let's go ahead and get started.

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,020
So last time we worked in our groups on question three from the U.S. cancer exercise,

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,900
I'm going to go ahead and go through the the results, the answers to that now and then we'll start on global cancer.

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,540
Okay. All right. So question three was asking you about racial disparities.

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,610
You got to go play with Seer, who thought Seer was really fun.

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:50,640
Yeah, nerds like me. Okay, so you go to see where you go.

11
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,890
I always have a moment trying to find it. Serious flaw.

12
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,330
That's where you want to be. Okay, so this is really fun.

13
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,830
You can play with that in a lot of ways.

14
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:11,220
But I think the first thing I asked you to do was look at long term incidence rates, long term trends for breast cancer.

15
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:20,919
And I asked you to compare by race ethnicity. So you can have it all races and then white and black.

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:27,790
But what you find here, all races is shown in red. White is shown in green and black is shown in blue.

17
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:36,660
And what you find is that though all races almost always mirrors the white just because it is more prevalent.

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,720
Right. White is is more common. And so the all races ends up being a weighted average of the black and white.

19
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,960
And so you end up with the all races being mostly the white one.

20
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,530
So I usually don't include that just because I find it easier to compare the two.

21
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,830
If I want to compare the two, I find it easier to compare them when I don't have it together.

22
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,430
So. This is long term.

23
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:05,510
It takes you from 1975 to 2019. The reason they have recent and long term separately if you went to recent rates.

24
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,220
There are. Well, what's happening? Recent trends is what I wanted to do.

25
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:16,809
Sorry. He went to recent trends only goes back to 2000 because they started collecting data on other racial

26
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:23,170
groups with enough enough of them to actually look at them separately in Syria in that at that time.

27
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,490
But the 1975 data, you really have black and white to compare to one another.

28
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,500
Okay. So if you want to look at other racial groups, the more recent data is your friend.

29
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:42,460
Okay. So if we look at the longer term trends for breast cancer by race, what would you guys say is going on here?

30
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,610
How have they changed over time and which one has the higher incidence?

31
00:02:53,610 --> 00:03:04,349
What would you say? Yeah, well, right following 1976, which was, I think when the American Medical Society released the recommendation for mammograms,

32
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,950
there was like a huge increase in incidence and then kind of a planning of.

33
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,659
Yeah, so indicating that like, you know, there's just more cancers being caught.

34
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:19,500
But also we noticed there's a pretty big racial discrepancy in incidence rates up until recently.

35
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,850
Recently it really kind of converged, but kind of historically.

36
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,700
Yes. And who had the higher rates with white people having the higher rate?

37
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:33,809
And we thought that this might have like might be representative of underlying racial inequalities with access to mammogram.

38
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:41,490
Could be anyone could be. That is a possibility. The other thing to to note is, you know, the other thing you want to think of,

39
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:48,090
it could be inequalities in in access to care and therefore access to mammograms and diagnosed diagnosis.

40
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,710
The other thing you wanna think about is are there actual differences in risk factors between the two groups?

41
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,249
Could be differences in childbearing patterns. Right.

42
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,070
Remember that for earlier age at first birth, having more children.

43
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,939
All of those kinds of. Um. Reproductive factors.

44
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:13,760
I'm sorry I teach you class right before this too. And sometimes I come in here, my brain's like, Nope, we don't have any more words, so I apologize.

45
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,480
Yeah. So reproductive factors like that are actually protective.

46
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:23,750
And so it could be particularly in the 1970s and eighties, that there were differences like that.

47
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,020
Right.

48
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:33,020
And in that, if you think about women who are getting cancer in the seventies and eighties, their reproductive time was 30, 40 years before that.

49
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:39,259
Right. And there could be real differences between black and white women in terms of like childbearing patterns like that.

50
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,610
So that's another potential real reason why incidence might actually be higher in white women.

51
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:52,280
I also want to point out this little boob down. Anybody know what this is about, this trend downward, particularly for white women in the early 2000.

52
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:59,800
Oh, I thought you were answering me. I'm like, Oh, it's Hager now. Yes.

53
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,620
This is just a very wild guess. But does it have something to do with, like, hormone supplements and menopause?

54
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:11,800
Yeah, we started we stopped using age, HRT, menopausal hormone therapy, stopped being prescribed.

55
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,569
We used to think. Like in the nineties.

56
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:20,030
It was really huge too, to give menopausal hormone therapy to women or through menopause because it helped with menopausal symptoms.

57
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,930
It turned around and people thought that it was cardioprotective, right?

58
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:32,299
And then they did a trial that suggested that there actually was not cardio protection from the menopausal hormone therapy and that,

59
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:38,330
in fact, it increased the risk of cardiovascular disease. So that was an example of a trial and an observational study giving different answers.

60
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:43,050
And there has been a lot of. Back and forth in the literature about why that is.

61
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,330
Some people think that if you give menopausal hormone therapy the way it's intended, when a women is perimenopausal,

62
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:55,830
it actually does protect because the trial was enrolling women between the ages of 55 and 75 and giving them hormones.

63
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,950
So you could have a woman who was like 20 years post menopause and you suddenly start giving her estrogen again.

64
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,510
That's a very different thing than giving a perimenopausal woman estrogen to help with menopausal symptoms.

65
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,910
So some people criticized the design of the trial and said that they weren't really addressing the research

66
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:17,820
question of whether giving menopausal hormone therapy to perimenopausal women was cardioprotective.

67
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:25,260
And then there are people who argue that there was a better design and therefore is giving the correct answer compared to observational studies.

68
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,600
But everybody threw away their menopausal hormone therapy and it increased the risk of breast cancer just slightly.

69
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,930
So that's why you see this kind of population level decrease.

70
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,350
Okay. So now if we instead look at mortality.

71
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,330
For breast cancer by race, ethnicity. Very different, right?

72
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,410
What are you guys noticing here? Somebody else won't answer at this time.

73
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,460
Yes. Well, there's a higher mortality rate in the black population.

74
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,080
Yeah. Even, you know, even back here when we were still seeing higher incidence and white women.

75
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,200
Right. So that's actually flipped, which is weird.

76
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,259
And the new possibility behind the inequity in health access,

77
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:16,500
health care and then providers who are not qualified for millions of black women could be.

78
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,020
All of that is entirely possible. Yep.

79
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,959
If black women are not getting mammograms as much as white women,

80
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,180
they would be diagnosed at later stages, in which case treatment would not be as effective.

81
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,329
That's another possibility. Yeah, I know.

82
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,649
From like my thesis work, I'm working in a lab that's saying these disparities.

83
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:42,550
And I know that like specifically, black women are more susceptible to triple negative breast cancer and broilers.

84
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,270
You stole my thunder here again. No, that's great. I'm glad you did.

85
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,629
I was joking with you. Yes. And that is absolutely true.

86
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,950
And I'm going to totally get there. But and generally, I would say mortality has been decreasing over time.

87
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:58,120
Right. We have better treatment overall. We have earlier detection.

88
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,050
You know, more people are getting mammograms. So we're doing better with with treatment.

89
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:10,070
But. Yes, and so going back to my slides then. You know, uh, we are here.

90
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,000
All right. So one thing we talked about is this idea of screening.

91
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,149
You know, are people getting fewer mammograms?

92
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,590
Are black people getting fewer black women getting fewer mammograms than white women?

93
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:27,420
And actually, if you look I mean, kind of the same, right?

94
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,810
This is getting a mammogram. 51% of African-American women had one in the past year, 52% of non-Hispanic white women.

95
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,710
So maybe a little more. But it's not like huge.

96
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,710
Right. You really do see it for, like, colonoscopy.

97
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,380
Right, because that, I think, is where you start to see the effect of.

98
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,320
So for colonoscopy, you not only have to have the test,

99
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,120
but you also have to like basically take two days off work and somebody else has to take a day off work to take you.

100
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:04,320
Right. You have to do the prep the day before. I am the lucky winner of the genetic lottery.

101
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,160
And my mom had colon cancer when she was in her thirties. And so I get to have I got to have colonoscopy starting when I was 30.

102
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,860
I'm so excited. So I've done this like three times now.

103
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:24,060
It's no fun. The prep you do not you do not want to be anywhere but at your own house with your own bathroom while you are undergoing colon prep.

104
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,410
It is a at home private bathroom situation.

105
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:36,480
If you work at a cash register, if you work in fast food, if you work in food service.

106
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,940
You have to take a whole day off like you're not doing college prep while you're at your job.

107
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:47,360
Like, absolutely not happening. Right. And then the next day, you have to actually go for the colonoscopy, in which case you're put under.

108
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,760
Anesthesia and somebody have to drive you home like that. University of Michigan.

109
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,480
They don't let you come in the door unless you have a driver 18 or over to take you home.

110
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,729
And they actually hand you like as the driver.

111
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:04,250
They hand, you know, at a restaurant when your table's ready and the whole thing goes into like the hand you one of those for your person.

112
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,930
So like you can go in the parking lot or you can go in the cafeteria or whatever.

113
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:13,220
And when your person's done and you come back and you're like, My table is ready, you know,

114
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:18,140
I think you can you can take your very groggy friend or spouse with you to the car.

115
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:26,030
So but if you think about it, you know, people who have who are of higher socioeconomic status have more flexibility in their jobs.

116
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:30,320
They're able to do this right. And there's certainly an intersection between access and race.

117
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,000
Right. Okay. Stage distribution.

118
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:43,940
So if women. Black women were not getting screened or for whatever reason, were being diagnosed later because of poor access to care.

119
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:49,569
You would expect there to be higher. Them to be diagnosed at a higher stage.

120
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:56,230
And you see that some. Right. But I don't know if it's really enough to explain the big difference that we see in mortality.

121
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:02,130
It's a little bit. It is a bit. It is true that black women are diagnosed a bit later, but not enormously so.

122
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,299
And this gets said what our colleague here back here was saying,

123
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:13,850
and that is that black women are actually much more likely to be diagnosed with a subtype of breast cancer called triple negative.

124
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:20,930
So what that means is there are basically three tissue markers that they evaluate in a breast tumor.

125
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,700
So if a woman has breast cancer, they would take from the biopsy or from the surgical specimen.

126
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:32,540
They would take the tumor and they would look at it and see if these receptors are expressed in the tissue.

127
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:37,880
So there's estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and Herceptin receptor.

128
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:43,010
Okay. And that's e.R. PR and her two is what they call those for short.

129
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:50,660
So if you are er PR positive, those are usually called and HER2 negative.

130
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:57,200
Those are called luminal A luminal A just has the best prognosis for better prognosis.

131
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,590
It's just a less inherently aggressive tumor than a triple negative tumor.

132
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:07,790
HER2 positive tumors used to be bad news because they are kind of inherently more aggressive,

133
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,450
but we now have a targeted therapy that targets that Herceptin receptor.

134
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:18,560
So actually a HER2 positive tumor is actually not such bad news because there's a targeted therapy for it.

135
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:24,410
If you have triple negative cancer, it's much more aggressive and we have no therapies because there's no receptors to target.

136
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,240
So, I mean, we have therapies like chemotherapy and radiation and surgery,

137
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,870
but we have no targeted therapies like we do for the receptor positive tumors.

138
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,280
So here you got black women in pink lavender.

139
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,020
White women in green.

140
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:47,700
So you can see for the luminal, a, the best prognosis kind of white men are much more likely to get it compared to black women triple negative.

141
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,660
And do note here, the rate the scale is different here because luminal A is much more common.

142
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:00,480
Triple negative is an uncommon subtype of breast cancer, but black women are much more likely to get it than white women.

143
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:10,330
So some of the mortality. And Black women is probably due to the fact that they are more likely to get triple negative cancer.

144
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:20,200
What causes triple negative cancer compared to luminal, I say. We don't know.

145
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,200
We don't know what the risk factors are for triple negative cancer. They're not the same.

146
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:31,960
Right. So all the reproductive risk factors I told you about, like age of first birthday, menarche age and menopause,

147
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,679
all the stuff about breastfeeding and how many kids you have and all of that kind of stuff.

148
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:43,059
All of those risk factors are risk factors. For the more common receptor positive subtypes, the triple negative cancers,

149
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:48,100
we actually don't have a lot of like lifestyle kind of risk factors associated with those.

150
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:56,740
Black race is is kind of the big one, which of course is not modifiable and not super helpful.

151
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:01,990
So a lot of breast cancer research is kind of going into what are the causes of triple negative?

152
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,979
Is that like a genetic thing? And why particularly are black women more susceptible to it?

153
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:11,320
And what can we do about it? Right. So that is a big, big area of breast cancer research.

154
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:20,530
All right. So just generally cancer incidence rates, you've got men in blue and women in red and you've got white,

155
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,570
black, Asian, Pacific Islander, American Indian, Alaska Native and Hispanic.

156
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,640
So what you see over if we just lump all cancer together, which I told you not to do, but now I'm doing it.

157
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,200
Actually, American Cancer Society did it, and I just took their slides, so it's not my fault.

158
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,580
But if you just look overall, you know, men, as we've said, are more likely to get cancer.

159
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,870
In a kind of every racial group, mostly, but.

160
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,920
Black people are more likely to get cancer and it's about equal with white people.

161
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,000
I would say API and Hispanic lower rates.

162
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:02,570
A lot of people call this kind of a Hispanic paradox because a lot of the lifestyle type factors and so social ate be kind of factors

163
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:10,190
that you would imagine are associated with poor outcomes and higher disease risk are more prevalent in Hispanic populations,

164
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:15,799
kind of like analogous to how they're more prevalent in black populations in the U.S. than they are in white populations,

165
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:22,160
and yet they have this lower risk of cancer. So people call this the Hispanic paradox, and it's it's something that people are working on.

166
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:28,850
Yeah. Is that kind of theorized by maybe an actual genetic protective factor?

167
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:38,450
Potentially. Potentially. I think some of it is a mixing of people who have spent cause with Hispanic people.

168
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:44,200
In the U.S. you have some that are like immigrants as adults from their home country.

169
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,980
You have some people who are born here. If you split those up, you get different things.

170
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,470
We also just throw Hispanic all in one box and it's not the same.

171
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,900
That's not right. You know, there is Cuban, there's Mexican, there's Puerto Rican there, you know, a million, right?

172
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:07,760
Guatemalan. And so they're not all the same, but we don't generally have enough Hispanic people in any data set.

173
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,089
To appropriately subdivide them.

174
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:17,130
So there are certainly studies are looking specifically in Hispanic population because these are just in the US, right?

175
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,270
So this is US in Central America.

176
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:26,600
People are looking at that. So it's yes, these are all questions that people are asking, like why is it something genetic?

177
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:32,600
But then again, when you start looking at that or is this something cultural, then you get into the problem of like.

178
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:37,270
But we're throwing them all into one pot and it's maybe not appropriate, right?

179
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:42,799
Or it is not appropriate. Not maybe it isn't right. Especially if you want to address some of these questions.

180
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,810
And so it's difficult. To address, but people are definitely trying.

181
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:58,550
So that was your question kind of. Okay. So incidence wise, black and white are issue the same black men a little higher, black women a little lower.

182
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:07,760
This is probably smoking related. But when you look at death rates, both for women and men, non-Hispanic blacks are higher than non-Hispanic whites.

183
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:14,930
And again, you have, you know, fairly high rates for I didn't talk much about the cancer rates here in American Indian Alaska Natives.

184
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,590
This is definitely an area of interest. Right.

185
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,390
And populations are an area of interest. Little has been done.

186
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:27,260
It's a difficult area to work in because.

187
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,670
It's a population, marginalized population, with a lot of distrust.

188
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:39,290
Right. And so getting people to getting large numbers of people to be involved in a cancer cohort, right.

189
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:47,550
For populations is difficult. So it's a hard kind of a hard row to hoe in terms of community based participatory research.

190
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,629
But it's definitely an area of interest for NCI, for funding and that kind of thing.

191
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:59,940
So it's growing, but you don't just walk into an air and population be like, Hey, I'm here to study cancer, you know,

192
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:06,329
and that's not you have to really build trust with that population and there's not a lot of and researchers.

193
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:13,950
Right. You know, so having researchers who are members of that community goes a long way toward building trust.

194
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,370
And it's it's, like I said, just difficult. That's a difficult problem.

195
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,280
But one that we're trying to address. Hi.

196
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,930
All right. I'm not going to go through this.

197
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:34,260
I mentioned this where if you want to look at more racial groups than just black and white, you need to look at the more recent trends.

198
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,660
Unfortunately for some of these, the numbers are small and so you get kind of BS.

199
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,540
I believe that is the American Indian Alaskan native line.

200
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:52,080
So, you know, even in our in our population based registry, even though we try to oversample those populations, you can see that it's less.

201
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:57,400
It's messier. There's more jumping around because of smaller sample size.

202
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,020
Right. And the relative survival rates are different by race in the US too.

203
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:11,750
Right. And I think we alluded to this a couple of times, but basically if you look at all sides together, there is a difference.

204
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:17,360
Certainly for some size, there's an even bigger racial disparity in terms of survival.

205
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:30,250
Some of this is cigaret smoking related. If we think of cigaret smoking as being the number one risk factor for any cancer,

206
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:36,550
pretty much African-American men historically have had much higher has have had the highest smoking rates

207
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:43,390
among black women and white women have been pretty low together with white men kind of in between.

208
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:48,910
The black men's rates are coming down to kind of be the same as those of white men in more modern times.

209
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:57,490
Right. But historically, some of that disparity, at least in incidence, is likely due to this kind of difference in smoking rates.

210
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,350
You know, when you see a disparity like that, we all know that it's probably,

211
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:07,440
at least I would say in large part due to like social context kind of stuff in our country.

212
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:13,029
Right. But it also there can be some actual differences in risk factors by by group.

213
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:16,540
And if you find, for example, that smoking rates are higher in black men,

214
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,999
you might approach trying to do smoking cessation programs differently in that population.

215
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,959
Right. So understanding if there's a different distribution of risk factors across

216
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:31,300
these populations is very important because it can inform how you go about,

217
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:36,769
you know, there's not a one size fits all intervention necessarily, right? Overeating.

218
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,940
Obesity is also if we believe that that is a very important risk factor for cancer.

219
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:46,810
There are different rates of that by race, particularly in women.

220
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,629
You can see that the number, the the the rate,

221
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:58,610
the prevalence and not the rate the prevalence of overweight and obesity is higher in black women than white women.

222
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:04,820
And that is true in adolescent ages as well.

223
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,549
But of course, as we talked about, there are other potential reasons for racial disparities.

224
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:18,930
And that is, you know, as we said, there's definitely an overlap between us and race in our country.

225
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:28,050
This is in 2006 and before the Affordable the Affordable Care Act was enacted, there was a large chunk of uninsured folks.

226
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:33,840
Right. And 62% of the US under 65.

227
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:43,169
Because, remember, 65 is when Medicare kicks in. For people who are older, only 62% had employer based health coverage.

228
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:50,249
And this is just looking at, you know, in that time frame, right prior to the Affordable Care Act, you know,

229
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:56,280
insurer health insurance premiums, this is the increase compared to overall inflation and workers earnings.

230
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:05,900
Right. So kind of that divide, the availability of health insurance and health care was getting to be worse and worse and worse.

231
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,780
Right. And it matters, right?

232
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:14,490
So this is that, again, in that same time frame, if you look at colorectal cancer survival.

233
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,690
Among people, you know, not in the Medicare age range.

234
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:26,040
People who have private insurance do a lot better. Right. You know, at six months.

235
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:35,200
Those on private insurance, these rivals like 65, 70%, and it's down here at like 45, 50% for uninsured and those on Medicaid.

236
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:44,570
Why do you think it's a little better for uninsured than people on Medicaid? Said it was.

237
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:52,149
Medicaid is not for older people. Medicare is right. So this is in people 18 to 64 because we're not including the Medicare population.

238
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:57,850
So that's a good thought. The Medicaid is the the low income version.

239
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:02,620
I always get confused. You. Hey, that's the one.

240
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:09,220
Yes. Oh, I'm sorry you had your hand up first. I apologize. I was thinking because you have to go in that word.

241
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:19,000
Hospitals. So the hospitals that are getting things are medically probably aren't as stocked and not like state of the art.

242
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,270
Like could be, could be. And what were you going to say?

243
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:27,309
Yeah, just kind of get a jump on that and like talk about like the access to care,

244
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:31,690
but then also that people on Medicaid tend to like they are going to be low income.

245
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:36,190
They might have a lot of other risk factors that could be contributing like their location,

246
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,360
like a lot of low income neighborhoods have pollution and stuff like that.

247
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,380
So I would argue that a lot of those same things are probably true, though, of uninsured folks.

248
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:50,410
But I will also say that uninsured includes some subset of people that are extremely

249
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:54,190
rich and just don't pay for health insurance because if something happens,

250
00:23:54,190 --> 00:24:02,829
they're just going to pay for it, right? I can't imagine, frankly, being, like so wealthy that you're like, if I get cancer, it's fine.

251
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:07,299
I'll just use my savings. Like, but I think that's the thing.

252
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,200
It is. I mean, and that's a small percentage of people, which is why it's only a little bit up.

253
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,890
But like the uninsured includes those people, right?

254
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:20,299
Whoever they are. Who? All right.

255
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,460
And then we're just gonna talk briefly about geographic variation.

256
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:29,990
So there are geographic variations in cancer rates even within the U.S. We've been talking about the U.S. as if it is a monolith and it is not.

257
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,710
Right. So this is colorectal cancer death rates by U.S. states.

258
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:43,340
What you'll often see here is kind of overlap with things like the proportion of adults who are obese and also smoking.

259
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,570
So this is lung and bronchus and this is smoking.

260
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:55,180
This is the number of current smokers. Right. And of course, a lot of this with smoking is related to.

261
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,020
A lot of these a lot of these states that have the highest rates of smoking.

262
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,520
Are the states that did a lot of tobacco production. Right.

263
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:12,860
And therefore state, you know, they don't have as stringent of state laws like tobacco control laws or taxes around cigarets and that kind of thing,

264
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:17,030
because there's a lot of tobacco money and lobbies and things like that in that state.

265
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:29,280
Anybody driving through North Carolina from Winston-Salem, Durham, Durham, Durham, the Winston-Salem, there's Winstons, Cigarets.

266
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:35,569
And I mean, you know, there are there are towns in North Carolina that are named after cigaret companies.

267
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:43,790
Right. So and if you drive down 95 through any kind of this area of the country, you're going to pass by like the Marlboro plant and stuff like that.

268
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:48,830
But what were you going to say about Durham? Oh, they just had the huge Philip morris.

269
00:25:49,490 --> 00:26:00,020
And there's like they've converted the old factories into like these plush, new, trendy, like squares, restaurants like warehouse and then nothing.

270
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:04,880
All right, that's better. But we'll take it. Yeah. There you go.

271
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,350
Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, if you haven't spent a lot of time in those areas of the country, you probably don't even realize.

272
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,560
And like we talk about, there's the university there. What is it, Duke?

273
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,549
There's Duke. But in Winston-Salem, there's like Wake Forest.

274
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,730
Thank you. I had a friend who went there, and it just, it wouldn't come out of my brain, but.

275
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:26,480
Yeah, so. Oh, wait for it. Yeah, that's in Winston-Salem. And we just say it like it's a town.

276
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,740
And then if you think about it, like, oh, oh, oh, Winston-Salem.

277
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:37,850
Yes. Okay. So there's definitely like history of tobacco farming and tobacco production in these in these areas.

278
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:45,470
And then we are not going to talk about cancer in children much in this class, but I will touch on it here.

279
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:54,439
It is very low rate. Thankfully, the rate of cancer in kids is very, very low and incidence is a lot higher than mortality.

280
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,760
We have done pretty well comparatively at treating cancer in kids.

281
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:07,100
We are fairly, fairly good at it. Even if incidence has increased slightly, mortality has decreased slightly over time.

282
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,920
The other thing I want to point out to you is that, you know,

283
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:16,730
we do they do bring up children and adolescents because things are a little bit different in those two age groups.

284
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:23,240
But look at the tumors we're talking about here. These are the most common cancers in children and adolescents.

285
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:28,190
None of these things make the list for grownups, for adults.

286
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:34,490
Right. Just very, very different kinds of cancer, lots of leukemias, brain cancers, lymphomas.

287
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:41,630
You get some sarcomas like some bone and muscle tumors, which are really uncommon in adults.

288
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:46,430
Right. We're going to talk about kind of a nomenclature of cancers, but like.

289
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:52,720
Most of what happens in adults arises from the epithelium.

290
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:58,570
Whereas in kids, these, these, these lung cancer is from the epithelial lining of the lungs.

291
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:04,450
Colon cancer is from the epithelial lining of the colon. Bladder cancer arises from the epithelial lining of the bladder.

292
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,469
Breast cancer arises from the epithelium, the lining of the ducts and stuff in the breast tissue.

293
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:11,950
Right. So those are all epithelial cancers that happen.

294
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:16,510
And same with prostate, all happen in grown ups, these muscle and bone tumors.

295
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:21,610
That's that is real weird in an adult, but they're fairly common.

296
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:29,690
Not common in the sense that a lot of kids get them. But of the top cancers, they are certainly in the list of the top cancers that occur in children.

297
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:34,450
All of this is still quite rare, but just very different.

298
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,830
Right. So that just the pattern of cancers that occur in kids is very different.

299
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:43,360
So these are the top three causes of cancer, death in children and adolescents.

300
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:48,580
So, again, brain leukemia, soft tissue leukemia, brain bones.

301
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:56,499
I just had a question about the fact that like adult cancers tend to be epithelial and like most common cancers tend to be not.

302
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:05,040
Does that have something to do with like like the adult cancers being like due to exposure and like

303
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:11,170
mutations being gathered versus like childhood cancer is being like like probably more due to like.

304
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:16,630
Yes, probably. Yes. And we're going to get into that a bit when we talk about we're going to get into at least the adult

305
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:21,820
part of that conversation when we talk about our cancer biology and hereditary cancers lecture.

306
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:30,190
So yeah, absolutely. Probably that is true. Really hard to study childhood cancers because they're so rare, right?

307
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:37,910
So like looking at these is difficult. Studying them is difficult. But again, we do fairly well.

308
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,350
Right. These are the five year relative survival rates in kids and adolescence for all sites.

309
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:48,290
85, 86%. We're doing better with childhood leukemias than with adolescent leukemias.

310
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:55,070
And even with the brain cancers, which. Sounds terrifying and I'm sure is exceptionally terrifying if you're a parent.

311
00:29:56,030 --> 00:30:01,459
We do pretty well, right? Nobody wants to hear 75% when it's their kid.

312
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:05,570
Right. We really like to be at 100%. But we're doing we're doing okay.

313
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,850
Now, a lot of childhood cancer research. I told you, it's very difficult to study it.

314
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:17,060
But when you have cancer so young, one of the things you really worry about is consequences of treatment.

315
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:22,490
Right. A lot of the treatments that we have are cardio toxic, like chemotherapy or cardio.

316
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:26,150
Toxic radiation therapy can cause second cancers. Right.

317
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,860
So a lot of this is a lot of the treatment is really not nice and we want to save these people's lives.

318
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:36,590
But a lot of research around childhood cancer is looking at survivorship and like late,

319
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:44,900
late health effects of the treatment that they receive for their cancer in like adult young adult survivors, for example, that make sense.

320
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:56,090
So it's just it's kind of a very different different space and one that is not super common in terms of like people's careers being in that area.

321
00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:02,059
So the majority of cancer that occurs, the biggest public health problem for cancer arguably is among adults.

322
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,100
And so that's mostly what we're going to focus on in this class.

323
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:09,560
But I think it is important to kind of understand that the landscape is very different for child and adolescent cancers.

324
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,030
So these are the resources that we used for this.

325
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:23,500
And that is it for U.S. cancer. I will. Unless there's questions, I will now pivot to global cancer.

326
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:32,520
Okay. Oh, by the way, I did update.

327
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:39,419
I don't know what happened with the slides. I updated them and I must have, like, saved them in a weird place and then not upload.

328
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:45,389
I apologize. The slides were wrong last time I have changed them. They are not correct for yesterday's for the US Cancer Lecture.

329
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:50,730
So I don't know what happened. It was like a weird. Too many files, too many folders.

330
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,140
Canvas is weird. I apologize. Okay.

331
00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:00,649
So we talked about cancer in the U.S. now. And now we're going to move to talking about global cancer.

332
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,130
And again,

333
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:12,560
I do think it's important to note that cancer occurring in low and middle income countries is going to be a very increasing concern over time.

334
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
So this was came out in 2010. One of the key messages here and a lot of the global cancer stuff that we're going to talk

335
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,480
about and resources that you're going to use are coming from the World Health Organization,

336
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:28,520
specifically the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is part of the W.H.O.

337
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,389
Right. So what their key message here is that cancer morbidity data are essential for planning and monitoring.

338
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:38,230
Cancer control initiatives in the population based cancer registries play a

339
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:41,830
central role in cancer control programs because they provide the means to plan,

340
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:46,900
monitor and evaluate the impact of specific interventions in targeted populations.

341
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:51,940
And so we have to kind of definitive sources of global cancer information.

342
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:58,040
One is C5 and one is global. Can both of these come from Iraq?

343
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:07,400
Why do we have to? The reason we have two is that sci fi only includes high quality population based cancer registries.

344
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:14,450
You have to have a high quality, population based registry for your data to be included in sci fi.

345
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:21,620
If your data is included in sci fi, particularly if you're a middle income country, that is kind of just getting your cancer registry going.

346
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,990
Like being included in zero five is like a feather in your cap that you've done a good job of, like getting your cancer registry up and running.

347
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:31,080
It's considered high quality by our. Global can.

348
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,200
Includes kind of everything. So there's a lot of and we're going to go through this as we go.

349
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:42,830
I think it's from later. But global can includes data from.

350
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:52,060
Sometimes one hospital. Sometimes it's just estimated cancer incidence based on death records if they're there.

351
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:58,210
Sometimes if there's nothing for a country, they will make estimates for that country based on surrounding countries.

352
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:06,190
So when you look at global can in your exercises that you're going to do, you're going to see a very pretty map that has every country filled in.

353
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:13,650
But what you need to keep in mind is that you are not getting just because you're getting a number

354
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:18,630
for a country does not mean that the quality of data is the same as for another country and global.

355
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:25,180
Okay. So global can is doing its best to give you as much information as possible about as many countries as possible.

356
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:31,480
Understanding that we're making estimates and we're we're working with imperfect data.

357
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:36,580
C-5 is giving you only the best data. That makes sense.

358
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:43,860
Okay, so. Globally in 2018, I believe, is what we're using today.

359
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:48,519
It is the definitive global reference source for national and international agencies on setting priorities for cancer

360
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:56,110
control and includes information on incidence and mortality for all major cancer types of 36 cancers from 185 countries.

361
00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:03,309
They use the best available data from cancer registries worldwide and or estimates based on the most accurate alternative sources.

362
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:11,170
Together with the W.H.O. mortality database, they provide recent estimates, so it's not a substitute for sci fi.

363
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:20,560
They have this really nice web interface that you're going to get to play with, and it's building on the success of these previous iterations.

364
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:31,300
They don't update it like accept updates there and see her updates on a regular schedule like every year, every two years, whatever.

365
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:36,930
They don't seem to do that. They seem to update whenever they have new data.

366
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,060
So. Last time was 2018.

367
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:44,500
I expect to have a surprise at some point that they have updated.

368
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:50,650
Usually it happens right before I go to get ready for this class and I'm like going, Oh, it's all different and I have to update everything.

369
00:35:53,480 --> 00:36:01,150
Okay. So based on 2012 Global Can estimates, there are 18 million new cases and 9.6 million cancer related deaths in the world.

370
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:09,040
55% of new cases and 66.5% of deaths occur in developing regions of the world.

371
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,070
So not developed countries like the US developing countries.

372
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:20,860
That's more than half. And you're you're going to say, why isn't cancer more common in developed countries?

373
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:24,330
Well, yes, but way more people in the world.

374
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:28,290
Way more of the global population live in developing countries.

375
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:34,920
Right. And so that's why you get more cases, just a larger population living in those in those countries.

376
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,360
Okay. And of course,

377
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,460
the deaths are largely occurring in those countries because they usually don't have great screening and they usually don't have good treatment.

378
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:50,600
So these projections say that there's going to be 24 million new cases and 14.6 million cancer deaths by 2035,

379
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:56,540
representing increases of 70% and 78% from 2012, assuming no change in risk.

380
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,630
Okay, so let's talk about what that means. So this is in more developed countries.

381
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:06,260
You've got this is the incidence as of 2012 and this is the demographic effect.

382
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:15,130
That's going to occur by 2035. Compared to incidents in 2012 for.

383
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,280
Developing regions. And the demographic effect.

384
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:25,840
First thing to note here is the scale. Not the same higher down here.

385
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,520
Okay. So actually, this is 6 million. This is 8 million.

386
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,240
So more cancers are already occurring in developing regions.

387
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:38,620
In 2012. This is just the demographic effect.

388
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:42,340
This is assuming that there is no change in risk factor profiles in these countries.

389
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:47,680
This is only due to the aging of the population, the predicted projected aging of the population.

390
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:52,890
So you're going to get a huge increase in cancer, almost a doubling, right.

391
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,759
In these less developed regions,

392
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:00,310
just because the population age structure is going to change due to kind of moving through this epidemiologic transition.

393
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:04,830
Much less of that in developed regions. Right, because we've already undergone a lot of that.

394
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:09,030
We already have a pretty top heavy age structure. Yeah. Okay.

395
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,820
Do you think it's a reasonable assumption that there will be no risk factor changes in these countries over time?

396
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:21,820
Yeah. No. Why not? Yeah. Looks like people get more money.

397
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,980
They are likely to access more processed food.

398
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,570
Yep. They have more money for cigarets. Yep. With that? Absolutely.

399
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:34,000
Lots of risk factor changes occur as you go through the process of development for breast cancer too.

400
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,030
Like childbearing patterns are going to change. Right.

401
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,330
Which is great because it usually means that women are having more access to control their fertility,

402
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:45,399
more access to education, maybe working outside the home. And all of those things are good things for women generally.

403
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,080
Right. But it does actually increase breast cancer risk.

404
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:53,200
So a lot of these things are going to change as you move through these phases of development.

405
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:58,120
So the actually the actual increase is probably way bigger than men.

406
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:02,110
Right. So this is definitely an underestimate. All right.

407
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:06,429
So this is the projected number of people aged 65 years or over and more in less developed regions.

408
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:10,300
So this is this is what's driving the numbers you see here, right,

409
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,570
is that in less developed regions, you're just going to get you're really increasing by 2050,

410
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:22,900
the number of people aged 65 and older compared to what it is currently, whereas in more developed regions it's going to increase a little bit.

411
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:28,630
We've already kind of we already kind of had this big jump earlier in time.

412
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:37,630
Okay. So now if you go to our global cam, we're going to go and start working on our.

413
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:44,160
You're going to do all of the questions in the global cancer exercise.

414
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:52,990
Okay. So like last time we split it up, but go ahead and do through question for I think we have more than seven groups.

415
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:57,760
So if you're group eight du Groupe, what if you're nine, do group two, etc., does that make sense?

416
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,309
Just come around then or pick your favorite?

417
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:06,190
I don't care if you're if you're higher than seven, you can pick your favorite groups eight and nine you when you win the lottery today.

418
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:13,170
All right. So get started on this and we'll try to leave a little time at the end for discussion.

419
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,440
Okay? I know you didn't know I was going to.

420
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,790
It'll be okay. I don't think I have to thank you.

421
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:25,030
There's not going to answer to that in a different way.

422
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:29,310
I'm really. Are you sure?

423
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:36,819
Yeah, I guess. I just haven't. I haven't seen you coming out.

424
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:40,830
Just feels like I'm writing down the names of the group.

425
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:44,370
Definitely. That was fair or not.

426
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:52,570
Oh, definitely not sure. How do you know those two words I have to go on to shared with me and then.

427
00:40:52,780 --> 00:41:00,090
Yeah. Manually out of high school I'm pretty sure is automatically here, right.

428
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:07,480
Yeah, I know it's a big yes.

429
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:24,489
I think they're going to be the last week and if you click on do learn to to advance again I'm a little

430
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:30,100
bit confused I'll click on a link and hopefully if you're just having trouble navigating the website,

431
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,010
I will to raise your hand. I'm happy to come help. That shouldn't really be hard.

432
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:40,060
Very hard. Yeah, sure. There's some there's some value in struggling a little bit, but if you're struggling along, let me know.

433
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:43,650
Development regions of the Western Boulder. Yes.

434
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:57,669
You are concerned. I think these builders I think it's a great concern to go back and comparisons.

435
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:01,070
You're thinking, really? Yeah. There you go to the bottom, right?

436
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:09,370
Oh, I think there's probably a good argument to support this.

437
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:14,540
And, you know, I changed it in the high school.

438
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:19,659
Right. And then the little things like where did you get this?

439
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,160
Right click on the very key answer to that here. Okay.

440
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:30,970
And then you just click on it and then you go to anybody else who is not looking on the big versus the quick on the really big cancer today.

441
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:45,680
So that was or to that and it'll take you to the page number of people wanted to know if they changed it it's just because you can do it.

442
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:52,710
You're always there if you ever kind of like I changed their minds and want to.

443
00:42:53,200 --> 00:43:02,240
If you go down to the population review what's going on is you guys because I mean, she's the mother.

444
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:08,799
So the left is highest. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

445
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,790
That's right. Yeah. And then we want to do one or the other way.

446
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:17,170
Yeah. Wow,

447
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:35,200
I think I can the higher the low on the one like you go down my way or you I don't really want the passive in this kind of market higher than that.

448
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:38,770
We're going to take her. Oh, so you feel that way about it?

449
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:59,800
Actually, be a little bit of a heard in there now that the female one only adds to the numbers comparing cancer incidence and mortality.

450
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,330
All the warmest illustrations to check it out for me.

451
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:12,090
You know how you how do you you know there's a sense of, you know, sort of you know,

452
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:28,930
I don't know if it was like the personal injury high school or some of those have grammar schools and it's for all you.

453
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:34,630
You can go back the whole way to be restricted.

454
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:40,410
We want to do right now. Yes, hold on. And then I did like a man with a male and a female.

455
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,670
I think it's almost like the reverse. Yeah.

456
00:44:48,330 --> 00:45:02,980
So, I mean, it's pretty crazy that lung cancer is so much higher than it looks like in the high teens from those were really winning a lot of things.

457
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:10,440
Yeah. So, I mean, I think that worries me.

458
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:17,990
Yeah, I just knew that was weird. I guess the mortality to make sense of the mortality, diagnosing a lot of questions.

459
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:32,040
All right. Well, I think that step the and watch out for a little bit of you want to commend you guys it's.

460
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:44,940
Yeah. Liver cancer so I think you're getting it.

461
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:50,640
Yeah. Very well.

462
00:45:51,570 --> 00:46:01,180
Well, I'm assuming that you can turn down even more money to pay for Cigarets.

463
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:07,270
Yeah, I bet. So I was.

464
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:14,260
I was living here after my daughter was smoking and the U.S.

465
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:18,170
I'm sorry. Yeah, I don't have a I have a question.

466
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,350
Then I go for the president.

467
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:28,180
Yeah, but what if I told you that there are only a couple of places in the world that there is screening and they are the U.S. and Australia?

468
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:42,260
I would take them. Seems like the Chinese treatment is generally more effective than you know, because there's a bigger difference consistent.

469
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:46,920
And that's just one of the differences in.

470
00:46:48,740 --> 00:47:01,040
Sorry, I'm not coming up, and I don't want you to start leading a little closer to me.

471
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:20,070
I know. I think I was just a little bit, but I think it would seem to learn so much from a lot of different random person and I guess some other.

472
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:25,550
Think it's really important.

473
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:35,200
I don't have anything important because they don't involve their parents.

474
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,980
Oh, I guess that's possible.

475
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:42,500
I just don't know what actually happened.

476
00:47:45,840 --> 00:48:04,770
But if there's anything I would like to hear, anything different in terms of kind of where is able to access factors like about living in life.

477
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:12,710
Wow. It's really interesting that breast cancer has really higher risk for using your brain and what's going on there.

478
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:17,570
So the odds and assumptions you can make about what about high score inside there?

479
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:27,229
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you could also talk about the better access, the structure of the population themselves,

480
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:32,780
because while maybe I don't know, because these are looking at rates around numbers,

481
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:47,900
but I think you have a lot of people involved with the rates are probably going to be there to lower because there's not as much turmoil around.

482
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:53,660
And this is like standard and there a lot of them once a month or three.

483
00:48:54,200 --> 00:49:00,889
I mean, and the other thing to keep in mind would still in there somewhere.

484
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:08,460
But they're going to be a culture where like industrial hours or.

485
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,160
Yeah. Yeah.

486
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:22,090
So there's a lot of nutrition managers they just don't like stomach about, you know, if you're not having filtered water or whatever it is,

487
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:38,270
I would assume that that they can hide the fact that we see, which could be that like very early or you know,

488
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:42,110
I've mentioned I think there's a mismatch, which is kind of the point of this, right?

489
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:47,209
It's about being overweight.

490
00:49:47,210 --> 00:50:05,090
And only one of the factors of treatment looks really bad, probably because it was so interesting that you say we have to find that.

491
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:10,130
Yeah, yeah. So it's like deleted.

492
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:14,600
I feel like saying again, there's going to be a hamburger in a person's life.

493
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:21,270
I think that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

494
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:41,150
So it looks like cancer is much less common for men when they were talking about what else and what I mean.

495
00:50:41,150 --> 00:51:00,320
And I think some of those young men would just like to get lost in a school environment that is higher than the HDI incident which happened.

496
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:14,470
And so this is a lot more infectious and even makes up for also colorectal lung and that they're pretty oh you

497
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:24,469
know they couldn't have been surgically could be on its and I would just I would think that that would be a huge

498
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:40,140
screening actually this for older people and to find out what's in a lot of these programs or should I know it's like

499
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:47,690
I remember know I mean that's what you're supposed to find lots of ways to do this and often when you see high.

500
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:53,610
Versus low, they'll take very high. And then everything else together, they have very high at the very top of the list.

501
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:58,679
Alphabetical will be super helpful for the next session.

502
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,800
A very clear difference between men and women.

503
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:07,770
Yeah. So we're going through the process now.

504
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,720
Everything's okay.

505
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,180
Yes, those are really serving just for the second.

506
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,980
So I'm feeling very similar that I'm jumping around.

507
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:31,200
I can look at the questionnaire over here and here that looks like things are still so.

508
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:42,420
Yeah, it's probably yeah. I mean, what's the capabilities of the capacity for a specific answer?

509
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:57,209
But I'm guessing, but I would say that we are and it would seem like this for every eligible easy to do for nervous system where things are

510
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:14,850
very and having a very clear being hydrofracking which also is that it can be like an easy conclusion with high mortality.

511
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:21,500
HCI is very let's just say that Google Earth screened because if I were to be too late

512
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:30,170
to I mean there's also something that is emphasized or that might not be available.

513
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:36,240
You know that that's true. Or there's a medical science education through people.

514
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:40,830
Really? Yeah. Yeah.

515
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:56,940
And I actually other people there and those women are more and more of a man who is like very pretty much in all the category H except for prostate.

516
00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:03,210
Yeah. Yeah, I remember that.

517
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:13,940
I can still remember the if they really want the really high risk of developing hybrid cancer in women of reproductive.

518
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:30,350
Yeah and the difference in terms like these are things well you can't control over 100

519
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:40,850
or it's 10% or because but other than that seems pretty similar or like at the moment,

520
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:49,290
I don't know that it is. I think just because she mentioned in her first lecture that pretty much all you have to, you know,

521
00:54:49,350 --> 00:55:03,170
interest is always because I well, it doesn't seem to work for you to have this or the cervix cancers.

522
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:11,129
Well now I even make sense just due to differences in smoking rates because you know, so that smoking is more common.

523
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:16,860
And so I think women and what is going out there.

524
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:30,460
Yeah yeah I don't know what the difference in consumption and then they love would woman

525
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:41,530
that I love like violence against women I don't know that's just the opposite where

526
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:55,540
it's kind of because I think the use of you know I know hormone control because I go

527
00:55:55,660 --> 00:56:04,739
to the company or yeah I mean I mean I mean some sort of dysfunction that would be.

528
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:08,370
No. And and I still like the best logical information in my head.

529
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:17,630
And I don't even know. It's like a lot of this question of liars, and I don't even remember more than physiology.

530
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:22,440
But I also learned more. For me, like.

531
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,650
Just like it was like, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.

532
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:34,800
That's okay. That's what I do about.

533
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:42,870
How many groups are on question to two. Question three or four.

534
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,120
Okay. So we're all into. Okay, keep going.

535
00:56:46,020 --> 00:57:03,570
Keep on Truckin World is going to help you with cancer is going to get cervical cancer, know the chance of getting pregnant.

536
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:13,890
And it's one that is just not you know, they have a daughter.

537
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:20,819
Oh, that's handsome. And I think you're right.

538
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:29,760
It's just so sometimes. Yeah, I say, oh yes I tend to write.

539
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:48,600
Yeah. And then we're doing the research on my right to categorize The world is right behind me so everyone can have a certain kind of gratitude to me.

540
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:52,560
I think it's so. I have drawn attention.

541
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:58,950
Yeah. Where did you to change it? I guess so. Some of the world of cancer is here.

542
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:08,160
It says computer science. I had to actually go all the way back to, like, click on multi bars and, like, starting from scratch.

543
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:13,950
I will go back and click on that in the last minute because I don't know.

544
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:17,950
All right. Multi-part. Okay. Yeah, that makes more sense.

545
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:27,030
And then even the population of those cancers and then you can look at that, I was just thinking about 13 or something.

546
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:36,090
And then when you got me through those, I don't think the whole world area and then you can take it from there.

547
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:40,080
Okay. So then you kind of do it like that sort of stuff.

548
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:51,720
That's hard, you know? I know because you're supposed at incidence and mortality and where you if you go all the way.

549
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:56,250
So back to the original. So some people are confused about question two.

550
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:59,850
I'm going to go through real quick how I got this is entirely the wrong thing.

551
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,940
So just just so that you aren't totally confused.

552
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:16,440
You go to cancer today and then you do the bars and then actually have to go to the multi bars for the for question two.

553
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:21,480
And you can do it by cancer sites or by populations and you're going to do it by populations.

554
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:25,230
Right? And then you're going to want incidence and mortality on there.

555
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:29,040
And what did I say to do? Men and women separately?

556
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:32,490
No, no, no. Okay. So that's both.

557
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:38,250
And then you're going to pick rather than cancer, all cancers, you're going to pick a site.

558
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:42,510
Right. Like cervix was one of them, I believe. And then you're going to pick.

559
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:49,800
For your population, you're going to do like world areas, right?

560
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:57,120
Does that make sense? But the trick, I think, is going all the way back and picking multi bars instead of dual bars.

561
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:02,100
Multi bars allows you to compare populations, not just cancer sites.

562
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:06,180
So then you do populations and you can pick what cancer site you want it to be for.

563
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:09,900
Does that make sense? Everybody feel okay?

564
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:15,330
Oh, so this is what this is for you.

565
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:24,200
Okay, so I'm going to put this over on cancer. And I think every year this is like we change this website.

566
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:29,130
So every time I've been here, I didn't here I was just putting the one.

567
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:38,070
So we just kind of see that your I know everybody and everything since every time.

568
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:47,160
If you guys want to just confirm with me that's, you know, just doesn't seem like it's okay so sure yeah.

569
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:52,530
Third scenario and I just deleted the servers.

570
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:57,360
I can only say. Yeah, right.

571
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:03,820
Because it's just a surgery if you got to go, you gotta remember that probably.

572
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:07,700
I started with the 30 seconds remaining until we get.

573
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:13,710
In search of the rest.

574
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:26,210
Sorry. I didn't think so. So I met someone during the high desert.

575
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:31,350
You heard of him?

576
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:41,110
I know that this is very difficult. That's just sweet.

577
01:01:43,390 --> 01:01:51,250
Oh, I'm sorry. No, no. Because I was ignoring the guy down there.

578
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:56,590
No. Number three. One can only assume that she thinks.

579
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:03,730
Oh, sorry. Number three. Sorry. If your name is mine.

580
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,960
So a question. Yes, sir.

581
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,620
I just sat down.

582
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:25,030
Okay. Every time I'm going to say something, that's more area of concern.

583
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:31,200
So I want some of the other. You know, it's not okay.

584
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:39,020
I had a similar problem when I came from Kentucky and I didn't have a chemistry and differences.

585
01:02:39,220 --> 01:03:00,340
I remember everything. I think the coal mines are always more than 60 years old and there's a bigger incident.

586
01:03:00,370 --> 01:03:04,930
I also think there was an area that when I say undeveloped,

587
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:26,280
I think I you the first floor rectal cancer has a higher percentage since there are people who know what's going on.

588
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:29,260
It's in our own, you know,

589
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:41,770
never run into a different region and 71 out here and it's is as you can see right now she is one of the high school back out here.

590
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:52,210
It's like doing every month. So it's really interesting to see that like how the media is not really representative at all.

591
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:56,770
Yeah. In Colorado when it's like so strongly represented.

592
01:03:57,310 --> 01:04:01,520
The cancer can go out of sight. Yeah, yeah, I agree.

593
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:08,070
I understand that. And also the mortality rate seems the same, but wrong.

594
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:21,360
Definitely, because I think the same thing is going on here.

595
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:28,320
Now how many groups around question three in question for.

596
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:33,340
Question. Two sons here. Okay.

597
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:59,870
Here. Okay. Or two of them are like, super cool.

598
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:12,270
Cool. That's cool.

599
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:25,680
That's cool. Yes. Yes. I think we can put everything together for the cervical view where you are going to have a corner.

600
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:57,710
And the biggest concern is that we've figured out that they know there was no matter what you went through,

601
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:22,740
one of the things you're going to hear every time I was in our county is lower near where will it make a difference?

602
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:38,160
I mean, I used to sit with by my father and I think that's a very strong population, but a lot of different things.

603
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,880
Describe how the regional differences, for example,

604
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:49,320
in question or we don't have to really do anything when they want to check their

605
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:55,410
graphs and official figures because they don't like different tie wearing.

606
01:06:56,550 --> 01:07:15,830
Yeah. Well, here's the reason why.

607
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:38,650
I think most of us, in order to make their stories and wherever you get your reaction to what's going on there,

608
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:50,910
there's no data for the subject matter. So it's not just an excellent question.

609
01:07:51,720 --> 01:08:01,200
It says the number of police in the passing age standard it and I notice the bottom accesses that are reflected so I don't know.

610
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:12,809
When you think about it I actually think I hate it.

611
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:41,129
Just as there has been times when I was a student, there was an Atmospheric Administration's witnesses and then it says,

612
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:47,040
we have to show that, and that's what we're doing.

613
01:08:47,770 --> 01:09:04,380
Yesterday I was listening for people like in Sweden and then certainly you think that was amazing.

614
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:11,250
Oh, I know. Yeah, I know.

615
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:23,790
Look, I know you're an expert in all these different countries.

616
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:47,700
Yes. This is from the second quarter of this year.

617
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:55,440
And I think that makes sense.

618
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:08,940
And corrosion noting that here around here is some sort of residential area.

619
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:16,380
So crazy is that the incidence of African-Americans are so low in certain areas of the world.

620
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:25,290
What is it exactly? 20 Chinese.

621
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:32,819
And did you have similar incident or new cases?

622
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:38,580
100,030 4000.

623
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:43,530
How many groups are in question for a similar question?

624
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:46,889
Three were mostly. All right.

625
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:51,420
So we're going to go ahead and take the rest of this time to finish this up. We'll go over the answers at the beginning of next class.

626
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:56,310
Next class will be a week from today because we do not have class on Tuesday.

627
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:59,910
Because I have an all day meeting, I have to go to an offline. Okay.

628
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:07,890
So no class. Next Tuesday, we will have our next class action, the class session next Thursday.

629
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:11,580
So we'll finish this up today. We'll go over the answers at the beginning of class on Thursday.

630
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:16,610
Okay. Okay, good. So no class next Tuesday.

631
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:22,560
One person from each group please upload your U.S. cancer exercise that we completed today.

632
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:33,000
Okay. So what I did the first time and why they look different now.

633
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:44,990
It was interesting because there's an argument for something like this.

634
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,710
They have some type of one it needs to be.

635
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:54,130
I don't know why I. Oh, yeah, yeah.

636
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:59,970
I thought that was very unfair.

637
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:36,630
And when America doesn't meet their vision, you know, I guess we you have an incident like this with each other, so.

638
01:12:42,080 --> 01:13:13,200
I don't know. Yeah, I don't know how you I don't want anything like that when I know that there are groups fighting rebel who are right there.

639
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:20,140
You know, we're not inbred. I don't even like to read that.

640
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:29,050
I tried to stay away from her, her constantly trying to talk about it.

641
01:13:30,330 --> 01:13:49,500
Oh, no, I was fortunate enough through the strategies and the only thing I know is that you have to know how to do it.

642
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:53,730
Yeah, I'm sure.

643
01:13:54,780 --> 01:14:02,040
Yeah, I mean, the whole network for citizens of Europe and the European Western.

644
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:14,910
Was I'm never going to roll over. And how do you know when you have your life and then the prediction for certain two countries.

645
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:25,670
I didn't do the probation. The ones that are going to you know, I think.

646
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:42,450
So we can share the fun.

647
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:57,080
Very funny. You know what you're referring to?

648
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:05,370
Yes. We're trying to keep it off the Canadian islands population.

649
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:13,500
Yeah, I think I mean, I'm not sure exactly.

650
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:22,260
Yes and no.

651
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:26,700
I think it just maybe I think we'll see.

652
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:33,840
The population is just going to end, right? You don't have to do anything.

653
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:52,470
Okay. So I know we need to like something like. Right. I was wondering what you do when you get to understand what it's like to do just that.

654
01:15:52,470 --> 01:15:59,520
And then right now, as I got older, if you want to do that.

655
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:02,760
Yeah, there's nothing about these shows. I might be like, Oh, really?

656
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:05,750
I wonder, you don't even know anything that's top 15 or Part D,

657
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:12,780
you've already made the party and then you're just going to sit when she said it with this guy,

658
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:26,350
is this something that I can show you that you're gonna do?

659
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:35,230
Because it's more recent when you had 20 more years, like on Sunday.

660
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:45,790
Okay. They want to show the younger people here and they're all going to get older and they're more likely to survive into that.

661
01:16:47,050 --> 01:17:07,560
And we want to talk to people and this is the person who's very charismatic factor is for whatever reason that doesn't give you your cancer.

662
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:18,190
And I went to the doctor is interesting because it wasn't diagnosed with cancer it's a three year long separated by like thing and cybersecurity.

663
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:23,610
Yeah. And then the other thing and I don't know, I was just like nine people are like drinking, right?

664
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:27,870
You know, like in Russia and compared to like most of the euro.

665
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:31,830
Yeah. Like not to me make absolutely no sense.

666
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:40,060
So now I'm going to look at the treaties and see if we can find a local model that was driving me crazy.

667
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:45,179
But then again, I still think hepatitis is a little more positive than it is going to be.

668
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:56,000
Think, well, this is something that we're we're very social care, really.

669
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:04,469
Yeah. But then I think that like Russia would in the U.S. over this also isn't like

670
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:13,020
distinguished by the $12,000 his I'm don't have to be involved in the process of.

671
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:21,360
Yeah yeah I don't know I will I will look into that actually I got a 3%.

672
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:26,600
Okay. So here are her disabilities.

673
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:30,510
Yeah, that's really interesting.

674
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:34,500
I hear you're not me. Um, and then have you seen.

675
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:39,210
Not my business. I'm trying not to do.

676
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:43,790
I don't think that Russian soccer's here too, so I don't think it is.

677
01:18:45,740 --> 01:19:07,220
So maybe it's a question about is like the Russia and you and then like, you know there's different kind of medical care.

678
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:10,950
Yeah. I don't have a question.

679
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:25,500
Hey, if you do if you do like maps by needle indicators as opposed to maps by cancer sites ranking, I think it probably doesn't necessarily have.

680
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:31,910
Sure that my I don't think they have. Much difference in how we train.

681
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:36,709
I mean, I think you have to here, but I wonder if they are like I don't know.

682
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:39,710
Like, I feel like I really hepatitis isn't explaining it alone.

683
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:42,920
I mean, some of the trends that we're seeing in China.

684
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:50,090
But I think when we're looking at like Europe, it's being so much darker than Russia and Sweden.

685
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:58,560
I know. I don't know if a fan of this.
