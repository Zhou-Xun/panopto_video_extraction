1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:11,430
My thing. Wow. My mom had so much fun working this all by herself.

2
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,890
Oh, I don't know.

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:25,230
I guess that's why that is just my perspective.

4
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:50,910
Some days later, I was like, I don't want that to work out and only tell you about half a dozen other people that I've never seen.

5
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:58,590
Where I look at it and say, We're going to shift gears and we're going to start to explore.

6
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,280
That was clear to me. But, you know, as a parent.

7
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,700
So today we shift gears from the demand side, the consumer side of the market supply or the firm side.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,520
And over the next few weeks, we're going to kind of build that up in several steps.

9
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,450
And today, we're going to start introduce the idea of production technologies,

10
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,870
because we know dollar science in today's lecture today is going to be just about literally physical inputs turning to physical output.

11
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:36,030
So in other words, sort of the technical or engineering relationships of what firms can actually feasibly do as a firm, essentially,

12
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:43,020
we would argue, is an organization that exists to combine inputs to create some product or output for sale of markets.

13
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,160
So the production functions we are talking about today are going to be just these sort of technical relationships.

14
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:56,969
What is it feasible for a firm to do? And then we're going to move on from that to say, well, what are the costs of those different inputs?

15
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:02,250
And therefore, what would be the economically efficient way to engage in production?

16
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,570
And I finally say, well, what would why would the firm want to produce a certain amount of a certain good in the first place,

17
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:16,800
how to determine its profit maximizing quantity. So we're sort of building up in those three steps, kind of the firm side behavior.

18
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,580
So starting with what's feasible for the firm production function today, what do those things cost?

19
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,010
And then finally, what would the firms choice in terms of how much to produce in the first place?

20
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:37,590
What's the problem? That profit maximizing level of output? So we want to talk about today.

21
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,510
So who are the key actors on the supply side of the market? Who are the analogs to our consumers?

22
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,610
How can you describe the technology by which those actors can turn inputs into a final product?

23
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,820
You remarkable one substitute ability of substitutable are different inputs in the production process.

24
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,330
What choices are available to the firm? You say a very labor intensive process or a very capital intensive process.

25
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,820
And then how does the efficiency of production change with the scale of operations?

26
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:14,820
So all returns to scale. So you got the big places that are going to try to go today.

27
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,780
What you're going to see is that a lot of the graphs are going to look really, really,

28
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:25,680
really familiar because a lot of this is very analogous to the way we've talked about consumer behavior.

29
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,840
So in a sense, this is where, of course, starts repeating itself.

30
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:39,090
So there are some differences, but a lot of the graphs and a lot of their interpretation is very, very similar to what we saw in similar theory.

31
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,380
So that's the good news. Should be looking pretty familiar.

32
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,950
You kind of see that on a couple slides. So who are the key actors on the supply side?

33
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:58,410
On the demand side, we talked about consumers as the key actors or decision makers that we were looking at on the supply side is going to be firms

34
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:06,330
and the firm is nothing more than an organization that transforms inputs into some final product for sale in the market.

35
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,920
So that means the firm really has to decide two things, right?

36
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,520
What do I produce in the first place? What business I want to be in?

37
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,940
And then once I'm in that business, how much do I want to produce?

38
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:24,450
So that's a final step that we're going to get to in about two weeks and then how to produce it.

39
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,010
So the site I want to be, I want to make cars and I want to make 500,000 of them.

40
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,020
What production process should I use? What sort of inputs should I choose?

41
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,400
So that's we're going to start to talk about today. Today is what's feasible.

42
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,120
Next week will be well, what would be the cheapest way of producing that?

43
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,120
And then finally, why do you want to produce that in the first place?

44
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:50,040
So that's kind of we're building up sort of backwards in a sense to the firm's decisions.

45
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,260
And so the fundamental tool today, it's going to be a production function,

46
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:04,320
and that's just simply a function that transforms the amount of raw inputs that I hire as a firm into how much of the product I can produce.

47
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:13,180
So I could have a whole bunch of inputs called capital, labor, raw materials, utilities to really divide this into many different things.

48
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:21,480
So think of a hospital. How many types of labor does a hospital hire? Hundreds probably are ends at a maze.

49
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,049
Radiologists. Biologists.

50
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:32,070
Anastasia ologist. Food service workers, custodial workers, radiation techs, receptionists.

51
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:38,100
Billers. Hundreds of there are hundreds of job classifications within a hospital.

52
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:44,610
So kind of like where we talk about consumer theory, there could be thousands of goods in the world, millions of goods in the world.

53
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,140
But to be able to do things graphically, just sort of understand the intuition.

54
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,620
We're usually talked about a two good world generically.

55
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,909
Good, excellent, good. Why often we put names to those written how to do the same here.

56
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:00,149
So in principle, there are thousands of different inputs we could hire.

57
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,450
There could be hundreds of different categories just within labor.

58
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:11,399
What's capital for a hospital? Well, there's the physical plant buildings, but there's also the MRI scanners,

59
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:17,100
the radiation, the CT scanners, the radiation therapy, the beam generators.

60
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,740
There's all all types of different machinery and equipment of hospital.

61
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:30,240
So you have thousands of inputs. Typically, we're going to talk about two in order to keep this sort of feasible in a graphical analysis.

62
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:39,090
And most often we're going to use capital M, labor economists use K for capital because we can see for costs a seasonal intake.

63
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:49,360
So I simplify a production function in two inputs. Let's take a particular one.

64
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,979
Suppose the firm can combine capital and labor and based on how many units of each

65
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:58,310
it can hire to get an output which is equal to the square root of the product.

66
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:04,450
Okay. So suppose this firm were to decide, hey, I want to produce eight units of output.

67
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,810
What are some feasible? Input bundles for the sperm to use.

68
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:20,549
What's one way that I could combine capital and labor and usually you'll put capital on the Y axis and labor on the X axis.

69
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,390
That's arbitrary, but it's just kind of to be consistent with generally do it that way.

70
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:32,310
Let's one input, bundle the first, produce it into the labor to three to labor and to capital.

71
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:44,350
And so that's one way because 32 times to a 64 squared of 64 is eight.

72
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,700
And what's another input bundle? 16.

73
00:07:49,600 --> 00:08:01,890
16 by four. Actually the flip side of those 232 and two and 16 and four the other way.

74
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,629
Give me a couple more. Eight, nine, eight, nine.

75
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,100
Probably the easiest one. 88.

76
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:30,000
About 64 and one. So we kind of way out here or way out here, what does that starting to look like?

77
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,880
Square Williams Kind of looks like our standard indifference curve in terms of the shape.

78
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:45,900
So if I could draw a whole bunch more points in here that you're kind of already seeing the shape emerge, I connect all those points.

79
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:59,200
I would say that that's a graph of all the different ways the firm could possibly produce 80 units of output.

80
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:08,310
It could use an extremely labor intensive process. They could use an extremely capital intensive process, very high ratio of capital labor.

81
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,970
They could use a very balanced process where it's using a bunch of each.

82
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:21,160
And so we're going to call this graph the ice of what Isaac watches mean same quantity.

83
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,540
So is all the input bundles that were produced the same quantity of output.

84
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:31,390
In this case, it's the ice acquired for. Q equals eight.

85
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,979
So just tells a firm they're going to their engineering department.

86
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:42,180
They say we want to build eight cars. Tell us all the different ways that we could potentially choose to build eight cars.

87
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:49,200
And the engineering department comes back with this program. And what if they want to produce ten cars?

88
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:56,010
So we could solve basically plug turning to here and solve for all the capital labor

89
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:04,589
combinations such that K times L square of K times l equals ten suddenly be at like 1010.

90
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:11,909
And we could do a bunch of others, we could do, you know, 20 and five and ten and 101.

91
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:17,550
And so on the flip side of all those and we get a second I want.

92
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,989
If we did this for every possible quantity, we would get a whole map of ice supplies,

93
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:29,560
which would look exactly in this case, like a whole map of indifference curves.

94
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,790
So that's the sense in which there's nothing new right now.

95
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:39,160
It's not stuff you've seen before. And we even interpreted a lot of it similarly.

96
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:45,670
Now, what did we call the slope of the indifference trough? Gave it a name one way back now.

97
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,640
Marginal rate of substitution, of marginal rate of substitution,

98
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,440
that the slope of the indifference curve or more accurately, the negative of the slope of the indifference curves.

99
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,380
I get rid of all those negative signs as the absolute value of the slope curve.

100
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,099
So recall the absolute value of the slope.

101
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:10,150
And I suppose that the marginal rate of technical substitution exactly the same phrase we are going to throw in the word technical.

102
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:20,020
So that tells us the rate at which this firm could trade capital for labor in its input bundle, keeping output constant.

103
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,590
So for example, if they started out in a bundle like this, they want to produce eight cars.

104
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,300
They start out with a very capital intensive bundle, and then they might ask, well, you know,

105
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:35,530
capital is pretty expensive and I'll get into that next time it turns how they make that decision.

106
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:45,040
Let's just keep it out there for now. Capital is pretty expensive. Maybe I want to use more labor and less capital if I'm starting out at this bundle.

107
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:55,310
What is my ability to trade between those two of these I supply, which is pretty steep, implying I could reduce capital by quite a lot.

108
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:05,410
I could cut it from 32 all the way down to 16, and I only have to hire two more workers and I could produce the same eight cars.

109
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,640
So if I'm starting up here and say the marginal rate of technical substitution as high,

110
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,890
I could reduce capital by a lot and only a few more workers and keep producing eight cars.

111
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:21,340
And then I said, Well, what if I made that change? What happens if I went further?

112
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:33,690
Now the LRT is a little bit flatter, so this was -16 plus two.

113
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,230
All the trade off as minus four and plus four.

114
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:50,560
And so I made that trade. I kept doing it. I see that this curve keeps getting flatter.

115
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,040
So now my rate of technical substitution keeps changing. Now I can only give up a little bit of capital.

116
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:03,860
I have to hire a bunch more workers. So interpretation, very similar to the slope of the indifference curve.

117
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:12,160
For instance, if we use the same term, we throw one extra word in, such as tells the firm what's what's a feasible way of producing eight cars.

118
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:17,740
If I start out a certain bundle and I say, Well, what if I want to change that input model or pick a different one?

119
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,900
How would I have to trade between capital and labor if I reduce capital by a certain amount?

120
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:27,730
How many extra workers do I have to hire to be able to keep producing eight cars?

121
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,080
I make sense of coming back from the first week or two of class.

122
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:40,100
So it should be a little easier the second time because the graph is kind of very similar.

123
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,360
Now there's a couple assumptions that underlie the production function.

124
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,519
The first is we're assuming the firm is going to make technically efficient choices,

125
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:57,380
that the production function tells us the most output the firm could produce using whatever input bundle we plug into the equation.

126
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,610
There is resource, assuming the firm isn't literally wasting inputs.

127
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:08,720
If it could produce eight cars using the same amount of capital and fewer workers, it would do so.

128
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,940
So the production function is basically answering the question with a certain amount of inputs,

129
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,170
with certain bundled inputs, what's the most output the firm can be can create?

130
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:28,490
So issuing the firm is not sort of wasting inputs. There's a second assumption called diminishing marginal productivity.

131
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,270
It's kind of a mouthful. We'll kind of see graphically sort of what that means.

132
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:38,120
Says given a fixed bundle of other inputs, they will every input constant except one.

133
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,640
How we raise the amount of that one input that's variable one input that we're changing.

134
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,170
And at least eventually there's a point beyond which the rate at which output rises

135
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,890
when I keep throwing more of one particular input into the process begins to decline.

136
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:04,100
Let's give a couple examples. Suppose were running a restaurant and say this is the physical space of the restaurant.

137
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:09,660
The seating area is out there where you are and the kitchen is in front of the seats.

138
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,310
So this whole area in front of the seats, up to the wall is the kitchen space.

139
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:17,480
That's our fixed physical plant. That's the restaurant we have right now.

140
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:26,330
You can't build it out today. This is what we have. So we're holding constant that physical footprint of the restaurant.

141
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,620
We're holding costs of the equipment I have in here. I've got a couple of fridges over here.

142
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:36,290
Got a couple stoves over here and some other equipment prep area here.

143
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,770
Doing my shopping, and that's all I have.

144
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:45,620
Those fridges are all I have. Those stoves are all I have. That prep area is all I have holding that constant.

145
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,760
The fridge and the pantry are filled with certain amount of ingredients.

146
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:59,660
Those are our raw materials. Those are whole concept. And now we're asking how many meals can we turn out of this restaurant as we hire more cooks?

147
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,770
They supposedly, literally had no cooks. How many meals could we make?

148
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:11,030
Zero zero. Because in this in this process of a restaurant, this production process, labor is an essential input.

149
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,600
We literally could produce nothing if we didn't have at least one cooking here.

150
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,460
So we hire one cook. How many meals do you think we can produce?

151
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:25,360
I'm the only cook here tonight. Yeah. You're all the customers out there.

152
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:30,900
How many meals do you think I can make? Because it's kind of inefficient, right?

153
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,799
Because I've got to now do everything with this big menu salads.

154
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:42,770
I got soups, I got breads, I've got desserts, I've got appetizers, I've got entrees, and I've got to do all this stuff.

155
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:54,750
Now, these orders, there's 30, 35 of you in the room, you're all placing your order at the same time, and you place an order for sale in an appetizer.

156
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,710
I'm going to get you some bread and butter. Your entree, dessert.

157
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,750
I got to do all that stuff myself, running around here like crazy.

158
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:09,270
So I got your steak grilling over here. Now I'm prepping your salad over here.

159
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,299
You ordered that steak? Medium rare. Now I got into your salad.

160
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:16,920
Oh, that state's not well done. Throw that out. Start over. Okay.

161
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,860
Sounds like a good way to run a restaurant, right? I'll be able to get some meals out, but not very many.

162
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:28,550
So what if I hired a second cook? You think that would double the amount of meals or more than double that,

163
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:34,639
but more than double because we can probably run the kitchen more efficiently.

164
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,959
Now, you know, hey, I'm going to do the prep over here while you're running the grill.

165
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,070
So that steak that I ruined is not ruined because I got somebody paying attention to a line

166
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,590
prepping your salad so we can begin to specialize our tasks and operate more efficiently.

167
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:54,350
So getting a second cook is probably going to more than double the output. Does that mean the second cook was a better cook?

168
00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:00,710
I was not necessarily. We could be exactly equivalent in terms of how good we are and how hard we work.

169
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,709
Well-trained we are, but we're more than twice as productive when I hire that second cook.

170
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:11,870
Not because that second cook is better than me, but because we can now organize production more efficiently.

171
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,490
By our third cook, we can probably, you know, we can specialize even more.

172
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,950
So we got several areas of the kitchen and we can each have certain tasks we're responsible for.

173
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,490
All of a sudden those orders are coming in and now we can start to handle it.

174
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,290
But now, as we keep going, let's say we've already got ten cooks in the kitchen.

175
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,490
I see where I'm going here, probably. What if we hire the 11th cook?

176
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,400
Do you think that's going to make us more efficient? Because now we start running into what?

177
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,849
What becomes the constrained space. Crowded?

178
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:52,660
Yeah, the physical space. We said all other inputs are held constant. Now we have 11 cooks all operating in this little space.

179
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:57,609
We've already probably achieved most of the gains we need to specialize in tasks.

180
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:01,960
When we have ten cooks that you're adding, that 11th cook just gets in the way.

181
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:08,080
Now all of a sudden, this person's running over here to do this and they bump into me and I drop the salad.

182
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:18,640
I just need to start over. So the assumption here is that at least beyond on some point, if we keep adding more cooks to the fixed kitchen,

183
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:23,050
we're going to get less extra meals than we did from adding the cook before.

184
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,350
And again, it doesn't mean that 11th cook was a crappy cook. It could have been every bit as good as the first ten.

185
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,740
But we're putting them in a situation where they're not going to succeed.

186
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,570
Just leave them in a situation where they're just going to get in the way.

187
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:43,860
Or even outside of physical space, there are other things that cause causes sort of affect you guys.

188
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:49,680
Like you don't need five people making butter. At the end of the day, that's going to lead to less efficiency.

189
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:53,770
Like if you just keep adding people at a certain level of complexity of the task,

190
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,700
you eventually get to less efficiency just based on the complexity of the task.

191
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,170
So there are certain opportunities for it to gain from specialization.

192
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,009
At some point you've sort of tapped those out and you think of other inputs as well.

193
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:12,879
It doesn't have to be this labor. The idea is that if we fixed the entire input bundle except one thing and we can make it our

194
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,660
different thing and we keep raising that one thing eventually where we become less efficient.

195
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:23,920
So imagine we're a farmer and we irrigate our crops and we live in a very arid area.

196
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:30,820
So if we don't irrigate at all, we probably get no meaningful crop because we have to hope that there is some unusual,

197
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,150
atypical rain that doesn't occur in that season.

198
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:40,720
So maybe we'll walk out and we'll get a little crop, but probably won't get little or nothing as if we irrigate a little bit.

199
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,720
What's going to happen? The seeds are going to germinate,

200
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:51,940
but they're probably not going to thrive if we're just irrigating a little bit in the environment, irrigate a little more.

201
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:57,760
All of a sudden, all the plants are actually going to mature and there's going to be a couple sort of shrivel years of corn on them.

202
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,800
Okay, so we got something now irrigate a little more.

203
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:06,160
All of a sudden, we've got healthy plants that are producing a decent amount of corn.

204
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:11,290
Maybe not as much as they could, but we're getting something irrigate a little more now.

205
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,130
We've got really healthy, thriving corn field, lots of corn.

206
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,950
Now, imagine we keep irrigating more and more and more. What's going to happen?

207
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,620
What's going to happen beyond some points? Why is more water always good for plants?

208
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:34,510
Oh, it'll kill plants. You know, it's just like, well, water is necessary for human life and you can drown it utter as necessary for human life.

209
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:39,970
And if you have too much, you will go into cardiac arrest because your electrolytes will get all out of balance.

210
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:50,690
Know. So you keep irrigating more and more. Eventually the plants start getting sick, mold and fungus starts growing on them, the roots start rotting.

211
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,069
So eventually, not only does more water not yield more corn,

212
00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:02,990
it'll actually the yield less corn the same way they're putting maybe that 11th cook into this kitchen might actually yield even less meals,

213
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:10,940
because if there if the extra crowding and congestion in the kitchen more than offsets what they had 11th cook could actually positively accomplish.

214
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:14,660
We might actually get less meals out of this kitchen with 11 cooks than ten.

215
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:21,710
So will there ever be a scenario in which efficiency is linear and sort of plateauing off?

216
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,819
So I can't think of one easily because again,

217
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:35,870
if you're holding everything else fixed and saying we're going to take one input and just throw more and more and more for us,

218
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:41,690
you know, I mean, you can write down some extreme production functions where that would occur with

219
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:46,700
one that has the shape of a sequence like this that really shouldn't occur.

220
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:57,710
You could probably write down something in terms of input process that as say, perfect, perfect substitutes where they were.

221
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:08,760
Maybe that would occur. So now let's kind of put this to a breath.

222
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,920
So you've got these two panels. The lower panel is kind of derived from the upper panel.

223
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:22,680
We're going to talk our way through it. The upper panel shows the total amount of output this firm can produce.

224
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:27,990
We'll call it my restaurant as a function of how much labor it hires.

225
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:36,090
So we've got labor on the x axis, quantity of output on the Y axis, and we're playing this game of holding all other inputs constant.

226
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:43,680
So this is what's held constant in the background here is the size of the kitchen irradiance the equipment I have in the kitchen,

227
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,340
the serving space that I have, the tables, the chairs,

228
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:53,940
etc. So we're holding all that constant and we're just asking how does output change in this graph?

229
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,000
Kind of tells the exact story we just told about the restaurant.

230
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:01,980
What if I hire no orders? Those meals can't cook themselves.

231
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,960
Yes, in principle, we could tell the customers to come into the kitchen and cook their own steak.

232
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:15,370
But if we're not going to make the customers essentially become our labor force, hey, come to our awesome restaurant.

233
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:24,969
You get to cook your own meal. If we're not going to make the customers become the labor force, if we don't hire at least some workers, we can.

234
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,540
MacNeill's does hire a little bit of labor.

235
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,860
Okay. Well, that first chef, we're not one. I'm the only one alone in the kitchen.

236
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:37,660
It's big because there's just me in here becomes small and there's 11 of us in here.

237
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:43,900
I could make a few meals, but it's really pretty darn inefficient because I'm running all over the place.

238
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:49,360
I'm doing salads and soups and bread and entrees and desserts, and I'm making everything.

239
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,300
And I got all these orders coming in, and it's just kind of crazy.

240
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:57,459
I mean, all kinds of mistakes, and I have to throw all kinds of stuff out because I'm ignoring one thing.

241
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,540
I'm doing the other thing.

242
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:07,810
So now if we keep hiring more workers, we see this curve gets steeper and steeper is the rate at which output rises with labor goes up,

243
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:14,770
hire some more workers in the kitchen and we get more and more output.

244
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:18,400
We get output at an increasing rate as we hire additional workers.

245
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,890
So that's kind of what this sort of convex shape here means. It's getting steeper and steeper.

246
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:27,280
That means the rate at which output is rising as I hire workers is going up.

247
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:38,980
Now, eventually we see it kind of plateaus and then starts getting a little flatter in terms from your sales curve,

248
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:46,600
gets deeper and deeper and deeper and right about here, it kind of flips from being convex to being concave.

249
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,110
It's still going up, but it's kind of getting flatter and flatter. Flatter.

250
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:59,709
Eventually it actually reaches a peak. So with my fixed kitchen, maybe that was the ten cooks you have.

251
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:04,120
That 11th cook was the one that actually reduced our output because the extra

252
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,200
congestion more than offset whatever that 11th Cook was able to accomplish.

253
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,089
On the positive side, at that point, if we hire more workers, actually,

254
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:18,520
we're going to get less meals out of the restaurant because we're now becoming such an inefficient place to work.

255
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:26,529
So we see kind of three stages. First, the recall, the marginal productivity of labor, how much does output go up?

256
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:33,700
When we hire more workers, we see it rising when this total output curve is convex, when it's getting steeper and steeper.

257
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:45,070
This curve here, the marginal productivity of labor is just a graph of the slope of the curve of a top C that's going up,

258
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:51,830
meaning we're getting becoming more productive. Yep. So do you stop hiring labor when it starts to decline?

259
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,020
Not necessarily.

260
00:26:54,020 --> 00:27:01,190
And the reason is not necessarily is I haven't told you anything about how much does it cost to hire a worker and how much can you sell a meal for?

261
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:08,690
I can tell you, you can hire another chef for $0.10 and you can sell the meal for $1,000.

262
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:16,070
Yeah, I would hire a lot of I would I would get very, very close to here.

263
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:20,719
I obviously wouldn't go here because if I went to where it's negative, literally,

264
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,640
I'm spending ten extra cents for that worker and I'm losing money because I'm selling less meals.

265
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:30,950
So the only thing we can kind of clearly say without knowing what it costs to hire a worker and what and what

266
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:36,499
I can sell a meal for is that we would never go on that downward sloping tail because that's a lose lose.

267
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:44,630
My labor bill goes up and my revenues go down. So if my goal, if we're going to argue the firm's main objective is going to be maximize the profits.

268
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:52,690
If my goal is to maximize my profits, making a decision that simultaneously raises my cross and reduces my revenue is sort of a no brainer.

269
00:27:52,700 --> 00:28:00,800
Bad decision. If my manager ever hired workers on that lower tail, they would be fired on the spot for cause.

270
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:08,810
Give me the key. Clear your office. Don't ever come back, because that would be such a bad decision.

271
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:16,460
But the only. That's the only thing we can kind of rule out today is we haven't talked about input prices or what the product can be sold for.

272
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:24,200
So we can rule out the no brainer bad decision of hiring more workers to produce less meals.

273
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:32,200
I have a question. So how do we know if that 11th chef is the one?

274
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:38,690
It's going to look low? Well, it's the temp or Jackie.

275
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:45,139
So if we had numbers on this graph that we can sort of read that off there, we would say that, you know what?

276
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:52,510
What is the L at which their total output peaks? So kind of the story I was telling, it was sort of ten was he said,

277
00:28:52,550 --> 00:29:00,360
I'm trying to graph that story and I'd say ten would be what we call El Triple Star in the script from ten down here.

278
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:09,360
Ultra Will Star is the amount of labor at which I've maximized my output, and if I continued to hire more, I would see the output begin to decline.

279
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:21,370
So. Once we get in this area, we still see that output is still rising with extra labor.

280
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,610
So again, if the chef is cheap enough and the meals are expensive enough.

281
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:32,770
Yeah, I may want to keep hiring chefs even beyond the point of maximum marginal productivity of labor because it's still positive,

282
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,520
it's still getting more meals. We get more thousand dollar meals for having ten cent chefs.

283
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:46,190
That's still an awesome deal for me. Now, if I'm getting more to dollar bills for hiring hundred dollar chefs, that's not such an awesome deal.

284
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:54,610
I'm probably gonna want to stop pretty soon. Fact, if I'm selling my meals for $2 and paying my chefs 100.

285
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:59,680
I probably won't shut the restaurant altogether. Probably sounds like a pretty bad business proposition.

286
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:08,889
So marginal productivity rises until. I'll start to think in sort of math terms.

287
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:15,700
That's a point of inflection. Scrap. That's when it turns from being concave to convex to being concave.

288
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:22,240
It's not, however, your geometry point of inflection. That's kind of where the marginal productivity was maximized.

289
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,620
Now, even if we continue beyond that point,

290
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:35,920
the average productivity is still going to rise because even though the marginal productivity begins to drop is still above the average productivity.

291
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,930
You can see that in a numerical example, as well as, in other words,

292
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:46,810
hiring that extra chef still adds more meals than the average of all the chefs we hired before them.

293
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,030
So it's still going to pull the average up.

294
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:59,319
Eventually, though, marginal productivity keeps dropping and it crosses below the average productivity of labor.

295
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:05,850
Average productivity. Labor is just. Q divided by all. How many meals my producing in total by how many workers by higher result.

296
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:11,820
And then if we continue beyond the old all star, beyond that sort of intersection point say,

297
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:16,240
well, we still have positive marginal productivity of labor, we can still create more meals,

298
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:24,430
but now we would start dragging our average down with those extra chefs, even though they're still giving us some extra output,

299
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,860
they're getting less extra meals than the average of all the chefs that we hired up to that point.

300
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:38,770
So it's already averaged out. And yeah, we'd never want to go beyond triple star because that's sort of a no brainer category.

301
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,920
Why would I spend more on inputs in order to have less sales revenue?

302
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:52,900
I think that this line here is reflecting the average productivity of labor.

303
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,780
It's like a slope is rise over run and we're starting at the origin.

304
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:05,170
So rise overall is there's the rise Q -0 and the run is L -0.

305
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:17,049
So if I'm at this point, for example. Slope of that line connecting the origin.

306
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:23,830
And that point is just. Q Overall, so it's the average productivity of labor, and that's where it's maximized as a measure.

307
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:29,860
I drew a similar dashed line connecting the origin and any other point, that line is flatter, right?

308
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:33,130
So it's going have a lower average productivity of labor.

309
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,840
But if I connect to the point out here, that line is flatter than the original one that was off the graph.

310
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:44,320
So. Q Overall, at that level of labor is also lower.

311
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:51,910
So essentially this kind of imagine if I had already drawn that line in.

312
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:05,410
That's the steepest possible line that we can draw, connecting the origin and a point on the total output curve.

313
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:14,350
So it's the greatest queue divided by L, the greatest average productivity of labor by connect the origin with any other point.

314
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:22,580
All those lines are flatter, have a lower average productivity of waves, which is a geometric trick there,

315
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:32,060
that the average productivity is just the slope of a line connecting zero zero and any point on the total output curve and.

316
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:41,260
That's the steepest, such wide, therefore the greatest average productivity of labor we see right there.

317
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:44,710
So we're average productivity of labor is maximized when it starts to drop.

318
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:52,800
So there was these top these bottom two curves are literally just derived from the shape of the top curve.

319
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,230
You'll stop for a moment, see if there are any questions about that.

320
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,050
The margin of productivity of labor is just the slope at any given point.

321
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:08,940
Right. All right. And then we could do the same thing for capital. So what's the marginal property of a capital then?

322
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,620
We'd be holding labor constant and we would carry asking the opposite question.

323
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,690
We've got, say, five cooks in the kitchen.

324
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:24,180
And what if was it really tiny kitchen, so tiny that actually cooks is standing here like this and can't move?

325
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,530
Well, that's not very efficient. So what if we expanded the kitchen a little bit?

326
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:35,040
Okay. Now we can at least move a little bit and get some work done, expand it a little further.

327
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:43,920
Now, the five of us have enough room to work without, like, accidentally cutting each other with with our knives, which is a good thing.

328
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:51,820
Make the kitchen a little bigger, and now we can actually work efficiently. If I'm doing the prep, you know I'm going to need something over here.

329
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,250
There's not going to be a person standing outside. Excuse me. Can you move so I can grab this off the pantry shelf?

330
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,360
See. But now keep making the kitchen bigger and bigger. What? The kitchen was as big as this entire room.

331
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:11,870
All of a sudden, we're spending a lot of our time walking from here to here, and the productivity of capital would start to decline.

332
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:16,190
So capital in this case is how big our kitchen is initially.

333
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,530
We have rising marginal productivity of capital, expanding the kitchen,

334
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:25,940
giving us more equipment, more space makes the five fixed workers more productive,

335
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:33,590
but eventually it will make them less productive because the kitchen gets so big that if we're only staffing it with five workers,

336
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:39,800
it's kind of ridiculous because it's just getting the food out to the dining room becomes a huge track now.

337
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:48,470
So I put on my hiking shoes to get the food out to the dining room. So just to confirm this app, maximize the L2.

338
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:53,359
Yes. Okay. Double star. All right. So L stars were marginal.

339
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,550
Productivity is maximized. L double star is where average productivity is maximized.

340
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,780
Now triple stars where total output is maximized. The steepest.

341
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:15,900
If we draw a tangent lines to this curve, the steepest that tangent line ever gets is right there,

342
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:24,120
and I'll start the steepest that cord connecting the origin.

343
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:29,190
And any point on this total output curve gets is here at L double star.

344
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:34,260
And the highest the total output curve ever gets is where it's slope becomes zero.

345
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:41,550
There is a ten year line and l triple star output is maximized where the slope is zero.

346
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:50,159
Up to that point, the slope is positive, more outward. It's getting flatter and flatter though here its total output is maximized.

347
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,480
A slope is zero. If we keep producing more of the slope becomes negative, output drops.

348
00:36:55,050 --> 00:37:00,600
So the biggest output is ever going to get is an L triple star, where the slope of that tangent line is zero.

349
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:10,300
So that's kind of everything we just talk through and also to make up a name, for example.

350
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:14,489
So the graph is for those of you who are more visual on the charts,

351
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:20,220
for those of you more no more numerical in terms of sort of understanding the relationships between these three curves.

352
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:33,600
So here we've got a chart that just shows what is my output if I hire one through 11 workers, how is my total output change?

353
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:43,410
And then driving from that, the marginal productivity and the average productivity of labor, if you are be really complete, let's add zero.

354
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:55,030
And we get total output of zero. So if we hire a first worker, we see our output goes up from 0 to 5.

355
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,830
So it's our labor goes from 0 to 1 or output goes from 0 to 5.

356
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:07,660
What's the marginal productivity of the first worker? 85 is a delta output five -0.

357
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:17,470
What's the average productivity on this case? Since we also have a number of things where one worker, five units of output, that will also be five.

358
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,920
Q You divide by almost five over one.

359
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:30,890
Yeah. Now suppose guy or a second worker. Their output goes from 5 to 12.

360
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:34,729
Marginal productivity of labor is rising again.

361
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:41,299
That second worker is not necessarily any better of a worker. The first one is just it's a more efficient production environment.

362
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:45,470
When you have two workers are able to split up tasks that if we have one worker doing everything.

363
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:52,760
So there's our marginal productivity is 12 minus five or seven.

364
00:38:52,760 --> 00:39:02,420
The first month is five, -0 is five. But the average productivity is also rising, but it's lagging behind the marginal productivity.

365
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:07,790
It's 12 divided by two. Our graph.

366
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:14,279
Marginal productivity was rising. That caused average productivity to also rise,

367
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:24,120
but average productivity lagged the low marginal rate because the marginal only reflects the last worker,

368
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:30,990
which was more productive than the workers that came before. On this part of the graph, the average reflects all of them,

369
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,240
so the average gets the credit for the marginal productivity of seven or the second worker,

370
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:41,100
but is still held down by the lower marginal activity of five of the first worker.

371
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,579
So that's why the seven is greater than six.

372
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:51,390
Marginal productivity is greater than average productivity, and that continues to be the case if we hire a third worker.

373
00:39:54,020 --> 00:40:04,420
Output goes to 21. Marginal contribution of that third worker to our total production is 921 -12.

374
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:09,640
What's the average? It continues to go up. Why? Because nine is greater than six.

375
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,770
The marginal productivity of the third worker is greater than the average productivity of the first two.

376
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:17,770
So adding a third worker is definitely going to pull our average up.

377
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:27,339
But that average 21 divided by three is still lower than the marginal productivity of that third worker because

378
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:32,440
the average is still saddled by with the five and the seven marginal productivity of the first two workers.

379
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,680
It doesn't just get credit for that nine of the third worker.

380
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:51,580
How do you think these are just numbers that I've made up, but there are numbers that are consistent with this type of a shape.

381
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:58,620
And think of this as sort of the fundamental relationship.

382
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:05,010
Because if we know this, we can derive that and we can derive that, and that's exactly what we're doing.

383
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,460
So I say assume the total product of labor curves now.

384
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,049
So we're starting with the we're just starting with the data in this column along

385
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:16,650
with obviously how much labor is associated with each of those output levels.

386
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:23,460
And then we're using that information in the first two columns to derive these, just like on the graph here.

387
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:28,800
If we literally just started with that top panel and the bottom had been blank,

388
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:33,629
you could have moved from the top panel to create the bottom, the two curves in the bottom.

389
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:42,600
Now, that makes sense. Okay.

390
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:47,680
So if we go from 3 to 4 up, it goes from 31 to 21.

391
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:54,340
Marginal productivity continues to rise. Average productivity continues to rise.

392
00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:03,700
So four is kind of the equivalent of El Star. We were trying to translate these numbers back to sort of where they would be on the graph.

393
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:12,850
That's where marginal productivity is maximized. If we hire office worker, we see that marginal productivity falls to nine.

394
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:22,250
Average productivity, though, is still rising. Kind of like we argued on this graph.

395
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:25,790
Even though here marginal productivity is falling,

396
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:33,230
the average is still being pulled up because that marginal worker is still contributing more extra output than the average of all that came before.

397
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:41,890
And that's what we see here. Marginal productivity of the first worker is lower than the marginal productivity of the fourth,

398
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:47,230
but it's greater than the average productivity of the first four.

399
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:54,700
So adding that fifth worker and still going to pull up our average.

400
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:01,100
Now we get that sort of crossover point, sort of old double star.

401
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:14,640
Sort of around five my as if we had a sixth worker our output still going up we saw positive marginal productivity of labor.

402
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:19,049
We still get more meals out of the kitchen, but we only got seven extra meals.

403
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:26,820
It drops further and now some seven falls short of the average productivity of the first five workers.

404
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:30,000
If we add the next worker, it's going to bring our meals per worker down.

405
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:39,150
It's going to start pulling that down. So essentially four is kind of all star where the margin on productivity is maximized.

406
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:45,450
Five is EL double star and it's not the scale as I didn't make up these numbers to be exactly here.

407
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:49,679
But in terms of conceptually where you would go if you were drawing the graph and say, well,

408
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:57,060
l double stars where average productivity is maximized, that's five where total productivity maximized.

409
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,610
What's the most unpleasant this restaurant can produce given the fixed bundle of non-Labor inputs?

410
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:14,500
The only decision exactly so far.

411
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,770
So ten is all triple star.

412
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,489
Try to translate this back to the graph. So exactly.

413
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:28,690
At this point, this firm would say, well, it's kind of somewhere around here, you know, because, again, we're not you know,

414
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:36,400
we're doing these sort of full unit things and the graph is continuous of somewhere between nine and ten roughly is l triple star.

415
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:45,090
I don't know exactly where it is. It's somewhere around there. Certainly 11 is greater than triple star, like higher than 11th cook.

416
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:52,509
I actually produce two less meals. So that's in that sort of downward sloping tail, the total output curve, that sort of no brainer.

417
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:56,469
Bad decision. You're fired. Our portion hired.

418
00:44:56,470 --> 00:45:00,790
11th clock, you're fired. There we see. The marginal productivity is negative.

419
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:05,230
So I'm spending more on labor in order to have less deals to sell.

420
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:13,650
Not a good idea. So does it kind of makes sense or how we're translating back?

421
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:16,959
So if you kind of see the numbers and say, well, you know, so conceptually,

422
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,180
what were these relate to in the graph that here is where marginal productivity is maximized.

423
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,800
Average productivity continues to rise beyond that point.

424
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:32,650
What maximize of five? If we go to six, average productivity starts to drop as well.

425
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:38,200
If we go to around ten or so, somewhere around nine or ten, if we go beyond that,

426
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:43,000
certainly if you go to 11, total product, product of labor actually begins to fall.

427
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:48,430
We could produce more bills out of this restaurant. But what we have to do.

428
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:59,150
Pitching ability recession. Exactly. So the answer to the question of what's the most meals this restaurant can produce?

429
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:01,040
It sort of depends what you assume.

430
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:08,510
If you're saying the most restaurants as meals can produce within the fixed kitchen just by hiring more workers, the answer is 58.

431
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:15,680
They can't get beyond that. And so most meals we can possibly produce with that fixed bundle of non-Labor inputs.

432
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:22,850
If we allow the restaurant to say, well, we've got people standing in line to get in every night,

433
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:30,650
let's find a bigger location or let's remodel and tear down that wall and take the next classroom over as part of our restaurant.

434
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:37,480
Then we could lose more than 58 meals if we could change that. So the answer to that question is, so depends what you assume.

435
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:42,080
If you assume that everything else is fixed, the answer is we can't possibly produce more than 58 meals.

436
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,749
If you don't assume everything else is fixed?

437
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:53,340
Well, there's not really a clear answer to that, because you could imagine making the restaurant bigger and bigger and hiring more workers.

438
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:03,090
So we already saw that ice acquires all input combinations yielding the same level of output.

439
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,180
So we've got three different isopods here.

440
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:11,000
We see they have what we'll call a standard shape, just like we call standard shape, a difference curves when they look like this.

441
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,540
You can see where it goes sort of steeper to flatter.

442
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:20,059
So the marginal rate of technical substitution sort of declines as we move

443
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:24,140
from the upper left of an isopod down to the lower right part of what I want.

444
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,750
So the firm's ability to trade off between the inputs depends on what bundle of inputs it's starting at.

445
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,950
Exactly like a consumer's willingness to trade between two goods.

446
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,900
Depends on what bundle of goods. Starting at when you started at the.

447
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:41,060
I got lots of pizza and very little coke. End of the indifference curve.

448
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:45,469
Your willingness to trade between pizza and coke was very different than if you were starting at the

449
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:51,150
opposite end of the indifference curve with very little pizza and lots and lots of cans of coating fresh.

450
00:47:53,840 --> 00:48:00,440
See that? Already talked about the marginally technical substitution.

451
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:06,620
The convex indifference curves have diminishing marginal of technical substitution, just like convex indifference curves.

452
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,860
We call it diminishing marginal marginal rate of substitution.

453
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:19,389
These are lower and lower as we move down. Okay.

454
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:22,420
So a couple of little technical notes.

455
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:26,830
As we saw in the chart and in the graphs,

456
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:33,100
marginal productivity can become negative if we keep adding more and more one input to a set of other inputs.

457
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:41,560
So very literally, drawing I saw quite consistent with that idea, we kind of like putting a tail on it.

458
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:51,729
So we were never going to draw one like that, not because it couldn't happen.

459
00:48:51,730 --> 00:49:02,170
We actually a chart as demonstrated that it can happen. But because no sensible firm would ever operate on a positively slow portion.

460
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:10,780
This says, you know in our restaurant once we got to the that 10th cook, if we had an 11th cook, we'd actually have less meals.

461
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:16,840
So the only way if we hired let's say this is ten, this is 11.

462
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:24,970
Yeah, we could produce the same number of meals. So that's the 58 isopod equals 58 isopod.

463
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:31,390
But to do that, we would have to hire more capital as well.

464
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:35,650
Our labor would go up and our capital would go up.

465
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:41,649
And again, what? I fire my manager. Absolutely.

466
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:46,450
To produce the same number of meals. You're telling me we have to build out a bigger kitchen and hire more cooks?

467
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:50,840
Why wouldn't I produce 58 meals using a smaller kitchen and fewer?

468
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:56,830
Because I've got the same output to sell. I've lowered my input costs for both inputs.

469
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:03,220
So no sensible firm would ever, ever, ever operate at a point like that.

470
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:08,110
So we're just going to sort of assume that for practical purposes, those points don't exist.

471
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:13,569
We write down some of our mathematical production functions like we did the Q equals square of K times

472
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:20,200
L and we get these nice isopods that don't have these sort of silly upward sloping tables at the end,

473
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:25,570
and we kind of just practically ignore them. So I said, No, no reasonable firm would ever pick a point like this.

474
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:34,120
So if I told you you can produce the exact same number of meals using less capital and less labor, why in the world wouldn't you make that decision?

475
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:41,169
So the isopods we work with are going to always be negatively sloped.

476
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:45,730
There's always going to be that trade. If I hire more workers, I can use less capital.

477
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:54,060
Because if you if you did have isopods that had these tails which could exist, you would never choose to be at that point.

478
00:50:54,140 --> 00:51:00,440
So we might as well just ignore it. Now another difference is maybe a little bit of a more important difference to note.

479
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:08,159
Consumers always want to be in a higher indifference curve, right? If I gave you a choice between a bundle that was on a lower indifference curve

480
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,770
and a bundle is on a higher indifference curve and has to give you a choice. Are you not spending your money and say which one of these you want?

481
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:19,250
I'm give it to you. Which one are you going to take? Or the higher a difference for 100 times out of 100.

482
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:27,020
If I give you 100 different choices that I was giving them to you, you're always going to pick the one of the higher indifference curve.

483
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:35,150
Is a firm always going to want to be on a higher price of what you kind of think about that logically?

484
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,800
Is there an analog like a utility maximization? Because I want to be at a higher different.

485
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:47,850
It makes me happier. And happiness is my goal. As a firm always want to produce more output.

486
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:52,860
That's really what we're asking to see if a firm always wants to be on a higher and higher isopod.

487
00:51:56,090 --> 00:52:01,610
What's the firm trying to do? Is its goal to maximize output or to maximize profit?

488
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:12,020
To maximize profit? So the consumer wanted to maximize utility, which by definition means moving to the highest possible indifference curve.

489
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:21,080
The firm wants to maximize profit. So would Ford want to build 100 million cars this year for sale in the United States?

490
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:28,459
Probably not, because what would happen to the price they could charge for cars if there are 100 million of them piled up on dealer?

491
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:33,800
Lots really low. What happens to their production costs?

492
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:42,120
They'd have to build all kinds of extra factories they don't have now. Hire and train tons of new workers would be incredibly costly.

493
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:46,190
I don't know how many cars Ford builds for sale in the United States in a year. I'll say it's 5 million.

494
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:52,610
Making a reasonable guess. That's obviously a Google of all fact that we'll go with 5 million.

495
00:52:53,240 --> 00:53:00,080
If they were to suddenly produce 100 million next year. That would be an immensely expensive endeavor to accomplish.

496
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:06,440
And what could they sell those cars for? Very little, because they'd just be piled up on dealer lots.

497
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:14,930
So while consumer always says, If I always like a bundle, a higher indifference curve, better than a bundle, a lower indifference curve.

498
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:20,690
Given the choice, a firm is not always going to say, I always want to produce more rather than produce less.

499
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:32,400
That's going to depend on election technology, the price of inputs, and ultimately how the volume of output affects the price they can sell it for.

500
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:38,340
Those are all things that we haven't really considered yet, but you can kind of imagine as we consider them,

501
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:45,140
a firm is not always going to say, I want to produce more. So that's one.

502
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:53,899
Even though the graphs look exactly the same, I suppose indifference curves that underlying economic logic is different for the consumer.

503
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:57,320
There is a clear logic that more is better for a firm.

504
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,450
There's a clear logic that more profit is better.

505
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:07,460
More output does not always yield more profit or output might go less profit if it's really expensive to build the extra units.

506
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:17,020
And I can't sell them for very much. I guarantee you Ford would be less profitable if it built 100 million cars for sale on the US market,

507
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:31,990
as if those 5 million units had the final concept for today returns to scale.

508
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:40,690
And I just says what happens to a firm's quantity of output if it simultaneously changes all of the inputs?

509
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:46,030
This is now a very different thought experiment than we did with marginal productivity of labor.

510
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,380
Is there a thought experiment? Is every single input except labor is fixed?

511
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:54,219
We can't change anything else about our kitchen. We got our ingredients.

512
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:58,930
We got our equipment. We got our physical kitchen space. We got our physical dining space.

513
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,400
All those things are fixed and we're asking, how does output change when I change labor?

514
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:08,649
If we want to talk about the marginal provision of capital, we just serve on how we're holding labor fixed.

515
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:13,059
Now we've got to say the five cooks in the kitchen and we're asking how does output change if we go

516
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:18,610
from a little teeny tiny kitchen to a nice big expansive kitchen to a kitchen that's three blocks wide?

517
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:26,640
So returns to scale kind of requires a thought experiment. If we can, we can scale up the entire input bundle.

518
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:31,650
What happens to output if we say double the size of the kitchen, double the size of the dining space,

519
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:36,720
and double the number of cooks, and double the amount of equipment and double the amount of ingredients.

520
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,080
So it's a very different thought experiment.

521
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:47,640
So returns to scale thought experiment requires you to be able to change everything, not just change one thing, holding everything fixed.

522
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,350
So how do we define that with the production process?

523
00:55:52,470 --> 00:56:00,810
So we've got a production function and suppose we take that production function and whatever K and L, we start with the two input world.

524
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:09,060
We double it to two times K and two times L starting from any arbitrary K out and we observe

525
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:14,610
what happens to output and supposedly double all those inputs and are output less than doubles.

526
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:24,220
We call that a situation of decreasing returns to scale. We're doubling our inputs, but it's not doubling our output.

527
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,570
We're achieving less than double.

528
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:33,460
So if we ask what are the efficient way of organizing production, an industry like that would have one massive firm or a bunch of little firms.

529
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:43,970
Martial law firms would be more efficient. So if we took the total inputs that we're using in this industry and we divided them up into, say, two,

530
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:49,690
two smaller firms, we could get more output than if we consolidated all those inputs into one bigger firm.

531
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:56,650
So if a firm's typical production process or an industry's typical production process is decreasing returns to scale,

532
00:56:57,130 --> 00:57:05,320
we would expect to see the market structure be one where we've got a bunch of small firms in that industry is actually a bigger firm.

533
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:10,050
Would be less efficient. What if we exactly doubled our output?

534
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:15,820
We doubled all our inputs and we exactly double the output. Then we have a situation I call constant returns to scale.

535
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:22,600
In that case, it really wouldn't matter for terms of the overall efficiency of the industry.

536
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:27,729
If we have two smaller firms or one bigger firm total output we could create and

537
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:31,300
the total inputs we would use at the industry level would be absolutely identical.

538
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:38,680
And then if we've got a decreasing constant size and there's also increasing returns to scale.

539
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:44,500
Suppose we double all the inputs and the firm is able to more than double its output.

540
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,540
And this is a bigger firm is more efficient than two smaller firms.

541
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:58,840
So we would probably expect an industry where the production process looks like that to be dominated by a few big firms and not have a whole

542
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:04,540
bunch of little competitors because all the little firms would probably go out of business because they would not be cost competitive.

543
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,170
So bigger firms are inherently more efficient.

544
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:19,180
There's not really a relationship between diminishing marginal productivity of inputs and returns to scale.

545
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:23,830
So it's just about diminishing marginal productivity of, say, capital and labor in a production process.

546
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:28,000
Doesn't mean we necessarily have to reduce the scale, is there?

547
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:29,679
It's a different thought experiment.

548
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:37,720
The diminishing marginal productivity of inputs holds the other inputs constant and returns to scale requires us to change them all simultaneously.

549
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:42,220
So there are two different concepts no necessary relationship between them.

550
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:46,210
We can have diminishing marginal productivity of all individual inputs,

551
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,770
and the industry might have increasing returns to scale or could have decreased.

552
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:55,750
Interest is not necessarily relationship because that the underlying thought experiment is different.

553
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:02,050
Holding everything else constant versus holding nothing constant is very interesting.

554
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:07,750
So what type of factors might drive returns to scale?

555
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:12,030
What's an industry you think might have increasing returns to scale?

556
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:27,460
How about shipping things across the ocean? So we get transit.

557
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:31,940
Transoceanic, transoceanic, cargo ships. Do we ship things on robots?

558
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:38,600
No, we ship things on little fishing boats across the ocean.

559
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:43,460
We ship things on, like 100 foot yachts across the ocean.

560
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:49,420
We ship things on massive, massive, massive.

561
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:57,470
If you ever walk the length of a cargo of a transoceanic cargo ship, it takes a long time to walk the length of it.

562
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:05,510
So probably there's increasing returns to scale, at least up to some point where it's a lot more efficient to have one really,

563
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:11,060
really big boat, take a lot of cargo, then to have a thousand robots take the same amount of cargo.

564
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:20,430
So there's probably a lot of increasing returns to scale. Now, at some point, those increasing returns to scale might themselves peter out.

565
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:28,860
Do we have just one cargo ship that's, say, a thousand miles long that takes all the goods across the ocean?

566
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:37,580
We've got a bunch of them that are 1300 feet long for a mile or so.

567
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:47,339
Imagine the docking it would take. Could you know what port could handle a ship that was a thousand miles long and therefore one with a draft in the

568
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:53,790
water of that ship being how deep with the water have to be to load it and on to get somewhere to load it unloaded.

569
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:58,740
So even in that case, eventually increasing returns to scale are going to peter out.

570
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:03,120
You know, we don't we don't have a thousand robots. We've got one really, really big boat.

571
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:08,790
But we're not going to have, you know, one boat that's a thousand miles long.

572
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:12,680
We're going to have, you know, a thousand boats that report on this.

573
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:19,560
We're definitely not going to have 1000 robots for every one quarter mile long boat.

574
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:27,810
So there's a lot of increasing returns. There are transatlantic or Trans-Pacific shipping, but even they reach their limit at some point.

575
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:36,750
So we already saw one reason for returns to scale. We talked about the specialization of tasks.

576
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:46,260
Really, small kitchen is not very efficient because we can then only have one room for one chef in it and that chef's got to do everything.

577
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:56,190
And that's just a very inefficient way that results in the well-done steak that gets thrown in the garbage or the salad, something, something.

578
01:01:57,810 --> 01:02:01,390
So one reason for returns to scale is we can use more specialized inputs.

579
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:05,610
You think of like medical practice. If I'm a solo practitioner,

580
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:16,340
I'm probably not going to be able to have a large enough volume to keep a nurse practitioner or a registered nurse and LPN,

581
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:20,400
a nurse's aide, a receptionist and a bill are all busy.

582
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,129
So I probably going to hire somewhere in the middle.

583
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:34,230
And maybe that since I don't have a nurse practitioner, I can't delegate some tasks that would have been within the Nurse Practitioners license.

584
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:43,020
I've got to do those myself as a physician. I'm not going to hire maybe an hour A and a, I'm going to hire an LPN or a middle level nurse,

585
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,549
and that person's going to be working off of their license.

586
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:51,780
And some things they're going to be doing medical aid tasks that I really didn't need their training for,

587
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:57,930
taking a patient back to the room and taking their blood pressure. And that's going to be certain.

588
01:02:57,930 --> 01:03:03,210
Our antacids are not going to be able to do this. We have a receptionist who's also my bill.

589
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:11,010
Now, if I merge with three other physicians in town, we now have a four physician primary care practice.

590
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:15,540
All of a sudden it becomes efficient to hire those more specialized inputs.

591
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:21,510
And we can probably be more efficient because we can have everybody working at the top of their license.

592
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:28,439
We're not going to have somebody with the nurse nurses training, taking blood pressures and walking patients back to the room.

593
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:32,999
We have an inmate in that. We're not going to have a receptionist doing the billing.

594
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,240
We don't have a person who's really specialized in being a really good biller.

595
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:45,270
So for one reason or another is that sometimes there are fixed costs going to be spread over larger amounts of output.

596
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:48,440
So that's another source of increase in terms of scale. Okay.

597
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:53,820
So I'm a physician every year to be a physician, a state of Michigan, I have to maintain my license.

598
01:03:55,200 --> 01:04:00,780
That costs a certain amount of money. So let's say it's $1,000 to maintain my medical license for a year.

599
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:06,570
Suppose I decide I'm only going to see one patient this year, one office visit for the entire year.

600
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,490
Not spreading that fixed cost of my license very broadly.

601
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:16,170
It's now $1,000 per patient just to be licensed.

602
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:24,060
But if I see a thousand office visits this year, right now the cost of my license is almost negligible.

603
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:29,400
It's only a dollar per patient, but 10,000 office visits this year is only $0.10 per patient.

604
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:35,490
So I'm able to take that fixed cost of my license fee and spread that over a larger volume of output.

605
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:40,020
So we wouldn't expect to have a billion physicians each seeing one patient a year.

606
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:47,370
We are 2 billion physicians, each saying one patient a year. They each have to pay $1,000 license fee for that privilege.

607
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:51,719
The state doesn't charge me per officer. That doesn't charge me per day.

608
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:54,900
I worked. It charges me for a unit of time for a year.

609
01:04:58,050 --> 01:05:03,960
And again, that can be limited. In the cargo ship, example we saw was limited by technical factors.

610
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:09,059
Eventually, the harbor bridge, the port, where do I dock the ship?

611
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:14,730
And then how do I physically on and off load the cargo from something as a thousand miles long?

612
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:18,870
It would become incredibly complex and unwieldy.

613
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:22,920
So in that case, there sort of a technical limit to increasing returns to scale.

614
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:28,740
At some point, we've maxed out the size of a transoceanic cargo ship.

615
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:32,430
That's actually kind of feasible and sensible to run.

616
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:36,720
Even with those ships, there's only a handful of harbors that can take them.

617
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:42,540
And those harbors need a lot of crane equipment and very big equipment to do the loading and unloading.

618
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:46,500
And you're making those ships ten times larger or 100 times larger.

619
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:52,650
That would become ridiculous. Other times, it's just complexity.

620
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:01,760
We want one hospital in the state of Michigan with, say, 50,000 beds.

621
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:10,770
Even aside from patient travel costs, even if even if patients could miraculously all go to that hospital,

622
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:15,690
conveniently what we want are one hospital simply giving one to run that hospital.

623
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:22,410
So you might make a lot of money, but you're also go insane in the process.

624
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:28,410
Imagine trying to organize a hospital.

625
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:33,630
Hospitals are complicated to start with, aren't they? How many different departments you have?

626
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:37,860
You've got all these different types of physicians who some of whom you may employ,

627
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:42,000
other of whom are essentially independent contractors using your facilities.

628
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,930
You've got to staff up for very different and uncertain demand.

629
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:55,000
I have to have enough nursing staff in order to keep beds open and all of a sudden I get a surge and I don't have enough people there.

630
01:06:56,770 --> 01:07:01,720
So imagine doing all this of that type of a scale. Nobody would want to do that.

631
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:10,209
So the amount of how many levels of middle management would you have to have to run a 50,000 bed ospital and each one of those

632
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:17,260
as a reporting relationship and each one of those has information flow going up and down through the game of telephone.

633
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:21,100
You we start over here with for something in my ear.

634
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:25,360
I'll whisper it in your ear and we'll go around the room and then we'll see at the end what was said.

635
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:36,460
Exactly. Running an organization that complex, just getting information flowing up or down is exactly like a game of telephone.

636
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:45,700
So expect there are a lot of situations where there are increasing returns to scale,

637
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:53,020
but at some point they might peter out with this idea of how would I sequence

638
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:58,630
look like with different types of returns to scale to all three of these graphs

639
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:05,560
and sort of one fixed thing that first I saquon has been positioned so that

640
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:11,110
one unit of capital and one unit of labor lies on that Q equals tax acquired.

641
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:19,090
So I think we're starting with that first slice of cloud and then we're asking what happens if we double our inputs?

642
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,410
What happens to output if we choose the bundle?

643
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:35,410
Two units of labor, two units of capital? Well, I want to step on the line on our panel and even lies on the Q equals twice the client.

644
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:42,580
So that's constant returns to scale. We doubled our inputs and we move to an ISO quantum at exactly double the output.

645
01:08:43,570 --> 01:08:50,740
If we tripled our original inputs from our original output Drupal, then we can Google output.

646
01:08:52,120 --> 01:09:03,360
So we've got some returns to scale. What happens in panel B here, we've doubled our inputs.

647
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:09,440
Wait a second. The Q equals 20. I want is what?

648
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:21,370
So whatever. I support Ron. It has to be less than 20 decreasing.

649
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:27,010
That's decrease in insurance. Exactly. We doubled our dollar inputs and we did not achieve no outcomes.

650
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:31,520
But for an input bundle of one unit to capital one, labor to two capital to labor.

651
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:35,180
And we're somewhere below the Q equals twice of what we're producing.

652
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:38,930
Maybe, say, 17 units of output make up a number.

653
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:47,720
And what if we do that down here? There's our input bundle that exactly doubles the original one.

654
01:09:48,400 --> 01:10:01,170
Where's the Q equals 28 supply located? It's below that, which means whatever I want, we've actually achieved that is greater than 20.

655
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:15,940
So there's increasing returns to scale. So it's a three different types of returns to scale, really to consider.

656
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:21,260
You're sort of imagining that as we keep marching up one unit of capital, one unit of labor at a time,

657
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:28,580
we keep landing on an ice account that's ten units of output higher than the one at the start that we came before.

658
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:38,750
That's one unit of each input gets turned to units of each input gets 23 units of input, each input gets 34 units of each input gets 40.

659
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:43,550
So we're just to marching out and say, well, if we double that input bundle what I support, what are we on?

660
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:46,879
It's going to produce exactly ten more than what came before us.

661
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:55,730
Every one unit of capital, one unit of labor increase gets us exactly ten more units of output with decreasing returns.

662
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:02,390
She say, Well, wait a second, if we double the input bundle, we're falling short of the ice supply that doubles the output.

663
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:18,620
Becoming less efficient in a situation like this can actually I'll give you one that has all three because

664
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:24,650
one thing we'll talk about and we already mentioned returns the skill might not always be constant cost,

665
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:29,600
but I always look for cost that might not always be the same everywhere.

666
01:11:30,530 --> 01:11:33,890
If we look at the best evidence on hospital.

667
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:45,340
Cost curves and the sort of average cost per unit produced. And when we talk about cost curves, that's another way we can talk about returns to scale.

668
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:50,200
So it's going to just jump ahead a little bit. It's just sort of dollars per unit.

669
01:11:55,090 --> 01:11:59,080
And units. So there's this maybe like admissions if it's a hospital.

670
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:03,160
How many admissions do I have in a year? And then what's my average cost per admission?

671
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:18,050
Now with hospitals, we see is something like this. So a really tiny hospital has very high cost per admission.

672
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,040
Imagine of a five bed hospital. Does that sound very efficient?

673
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:26,750
So why are all small rural hospitals closing? Because they're too small.

674
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:35,180
Know if they're if they don't get some type of a subsidy, they're going to have a hard time staying open at five or ten or 15 or 20 beds,

675
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:40,150
because that's just a very inefficient way of running a hospital. You've got a lot of fixed costs.

676
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:47,120
You have to have a certain amount of staff, you have to have certain equipment. You're not utilizing that sufficiently to spread those fixed costs.

677
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:51,380
So you would probably have increasing returns in the hospital industry.

678
01:12:51,380 --> 01:13:00,200
If you're starting from a very small hospital, a 40% hospital is going to be more efficient than 220 bed hospitals leaving all that.

679
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:02,960
And it's pretty easy to believe.

680
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:09,650
So we'd say that the hospital industry would have increasing returns to scale if you were starting at very small sizes.

681
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:19,740
And then it seems like there's sort of a large region. So maybe it's about to a 200 bed hospital to maybe about an 800 bed hospital.

682
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:27,150
Where the average cost per admission is roughly constant. So.

683
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:36,120
A 500 bed hospital is kind of neither more efficient nor less efficient than a 200 or 800 bed hospital.

684
01:13:36,130 --> 01:13:42,430
They're all about the same terms of cost per admission. So we'd say here that there was sort of increasing returns to scale.

685
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:50,390
For the very small ones in this region, there's a probably constant about constant returns to scale.

686
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:57,110
But then you get into that. Nobody wanted the 50,000, but hospital comes out.

687
01:13:57,110 --> 01:14:02,850
Maybe you got about of 800 or so. You can start to get the cost per admission rising.

688
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:14,709
So when we define returns to scale with cost curves, we're going to sort of argue of average cost is declining.

689
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:17,800
He's got increasing returns. The scale of average cost is constant.

690
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:22,840
We've got constant returns to scale. If average cost is rising, you've got decreasing assurance at scale.

691
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:30,700
So in the hospital industry you actually see all three. There's increasing returns for hospitals, very small.

692
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:37,030
Eventually you've achieved those efficiencies, and there's a region where roughly it's constant returns to scale,

693
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:41,950
and then eventually the organization becomes too unwieldy to manage.

694
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:46,450
And you've achieved the efficiencies that you can achieve in decreasing returns.

695
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:50,110
That's not a good example. One industry has got all three.

696
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:03,890
Substitute ability of inputs.

697
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:11,710
So the ice, the quants are going to tell us how the firm is able to substitute and even call the slope the marginal rate of technical substitution.

698
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:19,110
For that reason, it is going to be very, very across production processes, across inputs measures.

699
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:23,150
Some inputs are very, very substitutable. So they doing an unemployment physical.

700
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:32,389
We need a neurosurgeon to do unemployment physical. We could have a general internist.

701
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:36,680
We could have a family practitioner. We could have an advanced practice nurse.

702
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:44,440
We could have a physician assistant. There are a whole bunch of different types of labor inputs that we could use to produce an employment physical,

703
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,990
approximately the same level of quality.

704
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:53,149
Wheat farmer.

705
01:15:53,150 --> 01:16:02,570
I could either have a big farm and not use a lot of fertilizer, or I could have a small farm and fertilize and irrigate much more intensively.

706
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:12,610
Well, it's influencer probably pretty substitutable is another and what if we are doing a neurosurgery and taking out somebody's brain to.

707
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:18,670
You think the neurosurgeons time and the O.R. nurses time are very substitutable?

708
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:27,010
Probably not. Is there certain tasks that only the neurosurgeon has the skill to do independently of having the license to allow them to do it?

709
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:33,100
Just having the skill to do it. So, you know, if we weren't worried about, you know, people practicing within their licenses.

710
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:39,790
And so, you know, I don't think I really want the nurse taking out the tumor or I'd prefer to have the neurosurgeon do that.

711
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:47,840
So some inputs are much less substitutable. And I'll say they're extreme cases.

712
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:57,500
We've got like 4 minutes left, so we cut through as quickly as we can find a shot next time for the same extreme cases we did with consumers.

713
01:16:57,650 --> 01:17:00,950
We talked about two goods that were perfect substitutes to a consumer.

714
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,290
We talked about goods or a perfect compromise,

715
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:09,770
and we talked about that as just sort of the extreme limits of substitute ability or lack of substitute ability.

716
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:14,530
Perfect complement, speak. No substitute ability that most things kind of fall in between.

717
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:18,800
And some might be close substitutes or kind of closer to that linear indifference curve.

718
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:26,690
They're not perfect substitutes like the different brands of pizza and all consider different pizzas, perfect substitutes for each other.

719
01:17:26,690 --> 01:17:31,700
As I can taste the difference between them, I have preferences between them for substitutes.

720
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:37,049
We can say the same thing for production functions.

721
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:44,700
Some production functions have inputs being very substitutable to each other and others have inputs that are much more complementary for each other,

722
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,520
much less substitutable. So the awareness time of neurosurgeon time, great, very complementary inputs.

723
01:17:52,390 --> 01:17:57,930
Each general practitioner time or nurse practitioner time and doing an appointment physical,

724
01:17:57,930 --> 01:18:03,600
those are probably very close substitutes as they probably do that job about as well as each other.

725
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:09,730
And so suppose we have a production function. Q equals two plus cell.

726
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:15,440
But we can easily figure out the slope of rice or the equation of an ISO client.

727
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:20,750
Take any constant level of output at little K, which is ten.

728
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:25,579
So the slope or the equation of the Q equals ten.

729
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:33,830
I want is just all the combinations of capital and labor such that you k plus l generates ten units of output.

730
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:41,540
We could do the cumulative 20 ISO five saying well, what are all the canals that generate 21 time returns?

731
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:45,660
The scale of this particular production function have of easy.

732
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:50,030
What if we. Doubled capital and labor.

733
01:18:50,050 --> 01:18:55,000
So we went from two K, from two to K and from L to two L.

734
01:18:57,810 --> 01:19:04,950
We can do that math and we can factor out the two and we say, well, wait a second, that means that's exactly double the original output.

735
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:11,790
So if we double the inputs, we double the output. So this particular production function as constant returns.

736
01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:19,499
So what would it look like? So here's three different. Nice. There's our production function.

737
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:26,880
So we had ten. For example, we could use five K and the zero L would get us ten.

738
01:19:29,610 --> 01:19:41,400
Two times five or we could use zero OC and ten l would get us ten or any combination along that straight line.

739
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:56,780
How do we solve for that in the standard form of a line of queues are y variable to K equals ten minus cell.
