00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,870
In this module, we will explore how government plays a role in public health.

2
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:20,650
We're actually inside of the Michigan State Capitol in one of the committee chambers for the House of Representatives.

3
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,570
Here we're going to talk about the principles of federalism and preemption.

4
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:31,990
We're going to explore the role of the federal, state and local governments in delivering public health services.

5
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:37,480
And then talk about the relationships between different levels of government in managing public health.

6
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,430
This is all part of our discussion of the structure and function of public health.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,850
So let's start by framing our discussion around the concepts of federalism and preemption.

8
00:00:50,810 --> 00:01:00,020
First, let's talk about federalism. Federalism hinges on the idea that the state and federal governments have what we call co-equal sovereignty.

9
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:06,800
What that means is that the federal government has those limited powers granted to it by the Constitution.

10
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,880
These include powers to enact laws where it has jurisdiction,

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:19,160
and the remaining powers of government are reserved to the states which broadly provide them with the ability to regulate public health,

12
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,570
cost, sovereignty. Meaning the federal government has its powers.

13
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:33,740
The state government has its powers. And there exists a tension between each one having their own authority over the areas that they oversee.

14
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:42,370
So we can approach the role of government in public health through two primarily constitutionally motivated questions.

15
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:50,390
Number one, does the governmental entity have the constitutional power to act in the interest of public health?

16
00:01:51,340 --> 00:02:01,600
Number two is the way in which the government acted in any way violate its constitutional authority or individual rights of citizens.

17
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:07,180
So this principle of co-equal sovereignty leads to a constant legal and

18
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:12,130
organizational tension that we're seeing play out in public health all the time.

19
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:20,020
But let's take an example so we can think about this a little bit more if we think about the evolving debate over health care reform.

20
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,550
Let's explore governmental responsibility for health care.

21
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,730
Who's responsible? Is it up to the federal government to be responsible for providing health care coverage?

22
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,030
Or is it up to the state to provide health care coverage?

23
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:41,350
If you flash back to the aftermath of the Affordable Care Act's passage, we saw that tension playing out very clearly.

24
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:51,090
The Federal government asserted its right to require states to expand Medicaid to larger portions of their populations and states.

25
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,660
They in turn filed suit and said that wasn't okay.

26
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,030
They were arguing that it was their right to decide whether or not they would expand Medicaid.

27
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:08,380
So this constant tension related to federalism is really critical to understanding the role of government in public health.

28
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,930
So in addition to federalism, let's talk about the second principle, and that one is preemption.

29
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:22,750
Preemption occurs when a higher level of government eliminates or reduces the authority of a lower level government.

30
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,060
For example, the state can actually preempt the local health department.

31
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,780
So let's suppose that local county A enacts a strong tobacco control regulation.

32
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:41,830
So this regulation basically says that all smoking in any public place is prohibited inside the county.

33
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:51,430
While the state can actually step in now and respond with a law that preempts the local regulation and the state law can actually be much weaker.

34
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,860
The state law might say that smoking is prohibited in a subset of public places.

35
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,630
Well, who wins? There's clearly a weaker regulation from the state.

36
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,670
A stronger regulation from the local government at the county level.

37
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:12,850
And the state's regulation prevails, causing the county regulation to have no force.

38
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,300
The state has preempted the local health department.

39
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:24,110
So as we discuss the structure and function of each of the different levels of government, federal, state and local,

40
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:31,070
consider the relationships between the different entities and how federalism and preemption are playing a role.

41
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,160
Think about some of these important questions.

42
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:41,360
How has the federal government's expanded role in public health impacted the state's management of public health services?

43
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,040
How are state health departments meeting the needs of their citizens while also

44
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:51,020
confronting challenges relating to competing interests and coalition building?

45
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:57,919
How can local health departments who have limited resources maximize their ability to

46
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:03,230
address critical public health challenges at the community and sometimes neighborhood level,

47
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:10,640
while also conforming to higher level governmental laws that might interfere or preempt their plans?

48
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,640
Finally, what are the expectations and needs of American citizens related to government?

49
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,920
How much do we expect the government to be involved in our health and wellness at all?

50
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:31,040
It's this final question that will be an important theme for you to consider as you think about the government's role in public health and how you,

51
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:39,410
as a future public health professional, will almost certainly be responsible for interfacing with various levels of government in your career.
