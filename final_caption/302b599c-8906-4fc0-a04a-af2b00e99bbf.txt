1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:22,490
There's no way that one's going to teach you something.

2
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,400
Yeah. Everyone's talking about that.

3
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:37,350
But I think that's a great thing.

4
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:44,910
Okay, so that's no problem. I feel like I'm recording a podcast with a live audience, so I'm grateful to you in the live audience here.

5
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,690
A little birdie told me that it's kind of a rough week in this program, so thank you for coming.

6
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:57,840
I hope this is entertaining and thought provoking and not a problem set. And it's going to be primarily a lecture.

7
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,790
It was going to be primarily lecture anyway for a few reasons, which I think are instructive and I can share with you.

8
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,300
So the first one is that the obvious one,

9
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:15,530
which is I couldn't find a reading that didn't quite what I want to do is some kind of a big gap in the area of law and writing about courts of law,

10
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,469
how they work in American politics and of course, in the pipe dream.

11
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,890
In that context, to expect really good writing about health care law and context.

12
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,060
And a lot of the problem is that the people who write about the law tend to be Americans.

13
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,770
Now, the core of social science, like the one thing that I hope you take away that is your users guide to any social

14
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,040
science you ever made is that we distinguish between what is and what ought to be.

15
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:48,660
Politics is a field that includes some fields like asked us to get to work out these three authors and all the things we've reviewed.

16
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,320
We have abundant fields of genocide studies. We have entire conferences dedicated to recent work.

17
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,530
Okay, we deal with dark sex. Comparative authoritarianism is a burgeoning field.

18
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,380
We look at censorship, we look at genocide, we look at all sorts of extermination.

19
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,090
What that means is none of us are any of this stuff.

20
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:12,719
So the language of social science is deliberately designed to back you away from the horror of what you're

21
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,000
looking at in order to be able to illuminate it and thereby come up with a more effective way to change it.

22
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,980
And that also goes for slightly less alarmist things like the state of American democracy.

23
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:31,970
So if you don't distinguish what is for what ought to be, I would suggest a very hard time understanding the role of pursuing social change.

24
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:40,890
That's not the game of law. The game and law is deliberately to collapse what is and what ought to be.

25
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,690
I hire a lawyer to tell you what's going to happen if you do a thing,

26
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,920
but your lawyer will try to make what you want be the thing that's going to happen.

27
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:55,000
So a lot of legal writing has a normative agenda that's absolute wolfsbane to a political

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,500
scientist because it's about deliberately collapsing the two of them and saying,

29
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,730
how do we figure out the problem taking what what what is into to be right?

30
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,480
There's a lot of wishful thinking from my point of view, but it's also an actual technique built into the practice of law.

31
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,910
How do you, as a clever lawyer, figure out how to turn reality into something more akin to the client's wishes?

32
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:24,409
This means that there's vast amounts of legal writing on topics that are interesting to you and it feels like,

33
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,489
I don't know, trying to jump on what stones across the river or something,

34
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:32,240
because you're constantly at the risk of losing your footing and sliding down into the

35
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,230
way somebody thinks the world ought to run instead of the way the world actually runs.

36
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,780
Just me determined that I have a lot of trouble coming up with any reading that approximated.

37
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:47,600
I like the readings we have and they capture something that is being very well documented, which is that the legal system is part of the five.

38
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,249
A lot of urgency in the United States right now but they didn't to we're going to talk about today,

39
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,770
which is essentially the mystery of why top drawer,

40
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:02,240
Silicon Valley and Wall Street lawyers were at JFK at SFO helping refugees and migrants on the day of the Muslim ban,

41
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,700
which is, in a sense, the question that we're going to be discussing.

42
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:14,940
The second reason is that laws about reading law actually have some training of this and it took a year was textual.

43
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,800
It was about making decisions. This is setting up what's going to happen the next class.

44
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:30,330
Which is when I would really like you to try and book some time to at least skim if not read a large document that is dogs and the animals.

45
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:35,670
Bruce Because there's no way to get around that, right? There's no real way to short circuit reading it.

46
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:41,320
And once you start reading it with yourself, up to the pleasure. Because these judges, they're good writers.

47
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:49,870
Their folks are even better writers. And let's just say they care deeply about this.

48
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,100
This isn't even just about abortion rights. It's not that level issue.

49
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,840
There's actually much more going on in cops.

50
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:04,470
And if you read the dissents by liberals, if you read it, just picture the capture, the tone of what Samuel Alito was saying in the majority opinion.

51
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,260
If you read and think through the implications of the argument that Clarence Thomas is making in his concurrence,

52
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,450
you can see emotion and you can see people who are quite explicitly arguing about

53
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,630
essentially the future nature of rights and personhood in the United States.

54
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,530
And like I said, they're talking about a much bigger abortion issue than just abortion.

55
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,940
I mean, although it. So try to read us.

56
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,040
Alito has like 50 pages of 19th century state legislation.

57
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:39,840
You don't need to read that unless you have hidden in the copy of reading 19th century state legislation as processed through conservative law clerks.

58
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,460
If you have that hobby, can I suggest model trains as an alternative?

59
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:52,620
But apart from that, try to read it and try to get a sense of what these people care about and what they really think they're arguing about.

60
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,760
Okay, so that's the reason this is a tricky one. That's the reason you're getting a lot of lecture.

61
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:04,560
It falls into a gap between social sciences and legal writing, which leads to a lot of unsatisfactory treatments.

62
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,910
And because to really understand what's going on at war, you've got to read the law, I realize.

63
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,889
DOBBS We're just as head up in the room about it probably is.

64
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:18,810
The Supreme Court justices were in their chambers to trying to get and when you read the omnibus briefs,

65
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,380
try reading one for whatever side you don't like. Right.

66
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:30,900
If you think Dobbs was wrongly decided, you're going to love the American historical associations, basically pumping up Samuel Alito's law clerks.

67
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:37,440
National Right to Life had to say about history, because remember, what is it?

68
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:44,460
What ought to be a collapsed in the courtroom. So this is the big was in the podcast.

69
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,850
She talked about the American legal system. It's like most things you know, like I try never to talk about the American health system.

70
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:57,450
I talk about the American health sector because system implies that it's organized for some overriding purpose where a sector lies,

71
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,640
a whole lot of people trying to make money, which is more accurate.

72
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,570
In this case, you have people trying to make money, also have people trying to make money,

73
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:11,730
and they're spread across a whole bunch of different systems. At a minimum, you've got 51 plus interconnected legal systems.

74
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:18,960
One of the classic things that happens, particularly among liberals, is an excessive focus on SCOTUS, the Supreme Court of the United States.

75
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,540
The federal courts do deserve a lot of attention. They're divided into three tiers.

76
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,300
District courts actually try cases.

77
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:33,840
Sometimes this means that if you were arrested for running a big drug dealing ring, you will end up in a federal court.

78
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:39,360
If you murder a federal inspector while on duty with a federal courts because that was a

79
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,599
federal crime and the height of the crime years as a favor of federal agents or off duty.

80
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:52,160
It's a state problem. The district courts also are the first port of call.

81
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:58,490
If you object to a policy so passes a bounty hunter law against abortion,

82
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:04,490
the first thing you do is you go to a Texas district court and you say, I'd like an injunction that this law is an unconstitutional.

83
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,730
Texas immediately says Allah is great and they go to an appellate court appellate from appeal.

84
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,129
The appellate courts don't do fact. If they think there was an error of fact,

85
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:21,200
they can find a reason to send it back down to a lower court to retry on the grounds that you should have thought about this fact.

86
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,390
But appellate courts do law.

87
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:34,999
So the appellate court says, is there some kind of a principle reason in the law why this challenge should go to the Supreme Court?

88
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,350
Is that the ultimate appellate court? It's the arbiter of appellate court. It covers it when it wants to make law.

89
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,870
It comes in when there is a divergence about what the nature of the law is between different appellate courts.

90
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:51,050
So you don't bring a new fact. What appellate court? We bring an argument about what American law is.

91
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,969
Justice John Roberts actually gave it away when he said literally about three weeks ago.

92
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:01,520
And I just love it when people have gaps being where you say the truth, you can't say normally.

93
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,000
He said, we don't want legislatures deciding what the law is.

94
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:12,950
So I think it was the Chief Justice Roberts his take on matters that most states, you know,

95
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:17,030
one state, you know, one state and here between here try to vote in Michigan yet.

96
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:25,889
And did you have the pleasure of having a Supreme Court challenge? No, actually, no.

97
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:33,840
I voted in the side I voted in the primary as a stupid ambition and in a real attack.

98
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:40,860
Yeah, I voted by absentee ballot yesterday. Did you notice a problem when you got down ballot, as they call it?

99
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:47,970
Down ballot is like, you know, sort of all the things that people don't think about, like having trouble voting on one specific kind of race.

100
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,040
I did have to look at the Supreme Court out of it,

101
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:58,410
because Michigan's form of respect for the majesty of the law is to have openly partizan candidates voting as the Democrats are,

102
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:03,450
as the Republican openly partizan candidates who aren't allowed to list their partizanship.

103
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,670
Voters use Partizanship as Eucharistic. I don't want to know where all these people are.

104
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,600
I wish to know their partizanship so that because that's the badge that says they agree with me.

105
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,470
So if I want a Supreme Court justice who agrees with me and I don't have a party label,

106
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:26,520
I have to go do research and figure out who all the consultants are. But all they've done is push down a patient.

107
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:33,569
You see it in Michigan, turnout. How many election? I guarantee you'll see sky high turnout for a midterm on the House.

108
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,860
You'll see really high turnout.

109
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,200
All the things that have partizan rules because people are going to be turning out in a very partizan way in the state in November.

110
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,110
And then you're going to absolutely go off a cliff all the way down Niagara Falls and have to pull at the bottom.

111
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:51,990
You'll find like a very much smaller number of people who went to the trouble of figuring out who Bolivians are and which one agrees.

112
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,550
By the way, since you hear all this, the Democrat voters, the Republican,

113
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:01,470
they're both completely aligned with their parties, but they're not allowed to say what their parties are.

114
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,770
Parties endorse that. The parties can campaign for them, but they can't.

115
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,720
It's nuts.

116
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:16,020
That is one quirk of Michigan, which has a very, very good money dependent Supreme Court system, like we in Pennsylvania, to make us feel better.

117
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:21,900
But they're all like this, right? They have different appointment systems. They have different Big Apple rules.

118
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,419
When the Republicans got control of West Virginia,

119
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,990
they impeached the entire state Supreme Court on the grounds that they had excessive expenditures on the furniture.

120
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:36,550
Think all out and replace them with people who are lined. And it means that state constitutions and state courts actually matter.

121
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:41,310
They also matter because most of the time the legal system you meet is about the federal legal system.

122
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:44,410
Legal system you need is the state you want to be.

123
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:49,090
You want to metabolize it. Or your point about your medical license. State You get arrested for drug possession.

124
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:55,540
State You die of your intestate. State The state legal system is the one that shape our lives.

125
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,340
I did just pardoned everyone who's in prison for marijuana possession.

126
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,900
Do you know how many people are in federal prison for marijuana possession? It's only marijuana possession.

127
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:12,690
600. Because the federal government doesn't take marijuana possession.

128
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,490
Right. You don't have like the FBI driving around in cars going, oh, you got a roach.

129
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,290
I do not want you police to do that.

130
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,070
So a lot of people, in a sense, just got their sentences cut, but they're still there because they were doing something else.

131
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,410
The point Biden was making was a political one,

132
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,410
not one that has actually led to somebody being released because marijuana possession alone is just not I think the federal government does.

133
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:46,320
And Biden is explicit about this. He's doing this to set an example and in a sense, to a power and no blue state governors.

134
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:53,700
Right. And if you think about the numbers, if you released everyone who's in, say, California State Penitentiary on marijuana alone,

135
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,560
you would have, I think, some very large numbers of people simply passing out in the daylight.

136
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,320
So you could see why governors didn't immediately do it.

137
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,340
Like they're all commissioning their staff to say how many prisoners and why releasing them up before election.

138
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,690
They had that's the different jurisdictions point right.

139
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,299
The cannabis possession most of the time it would be that hard to come up with a federal charge.

140
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,650
Right. There is a federal cannabis possession charge, but they don't do that.

141
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:27,219
You know the part about it's also not federal. Now, federal law does have life terms and do we have de facto Senate approval?

142
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,990
The Constitution says advise and consent. We interpret that to be the you have to get through the Senate to be a federal judge.

143
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,279
So, for example,

144
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:39,700
the illustrious University of Michigan graduate who has done such able service for Donald Trump and DeLay in the Mar a Lago document review.

145
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,740
Hello. She's there for life. It's a nice job.

146
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:51,010
She's a federal district court judge. This means no Democrat will ever get help within a hundred yards of letting her be promoted.

147
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,500
But she has a life job, despite the fact that debate raised her on qualified, which I think is an insult to our laws.

148
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:03,160
And finally, like I said, states have all sorts of systems for election retention appointments.

149
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:08,770
Once again in America, you know, one state, you know one state. Anything I've said about Michigan,

150
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,770
don't move to California or New York or Washington or Maryland or something and expect that you know anything about how the system works.

151
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:19,420
We need to take away some place like. And don't laugh too hard when they exploit it.

152
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:28,070
Now these cuts are all important public health issues, and we have a vaccine mandate and we have a state emergency law.

153
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:33,980
We went backward in terms of the quality of public health legislation, the powers of public authorities over the last couple of years.

154
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:39,800
Wisconsin, thanks to a very activist state Supreme Court, has no state emergency law.

155
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:46,309
Michigan had three of them, but it's now down to one. So public health matters.

156
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:51,260
It's also matters to the health of our democracy. The rule of law is a key part of democracy, the protection of rights.

157
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,350
You have to be able to go into a court and say, my rights have been infringed on.

158
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,020
Have the court stopped people infringing?

159
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,940
If you take the citizenship test for the United States, the definition of rule of law is nobody is above the law.

160
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:10,320
Our friend down in Florida, Glue actually attempted to introduce the doctrine that if you're really important,

161
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:15,670
you should be above the law, which is precisely the opposite of rule of law. But the problem is, what is the law?

162
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,330
What happens if you think the law is being hijacked by somebody?

163
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,989
What if you think the law is systematically unfair? I have news for you.

164
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:27,080
Most people who care deeply about politics at any given time do think the law is unfair.

165
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:32,290
I do think the law is being hijacked by somebody. They just don't agree on who is doing it, what the systematic conspiracies.

166
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,020
So let's back up and think about. Think about how lawyers think.

167
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:43,780
It was fundamentally about predictability. If you do X, Y will result.

168
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,760
If you speed to will result. If you die intestate, probate will result.

169
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,460
Now, the problem is it's very, very hard.

170
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,540
That's a technical term for it possible to write what you call a complete contract.

171
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:07,610
You can't specify everything. It will happen. Take the example of the insurance of the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001.

172
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:19,040
It was in the process of being sold. There was a kind of gap insurance coverage on it between when the transaction had taken place.

173
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,380
The new owner had not yet taken possession. The previous insurance had ended with the contract.

174
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:31,310
There was gap insurance and the new owner didn't have insurance yet. Nobody anticipated both World Trade Centers falling down.

175
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,980
That was not in anybody's minds when they wrote the contract on this thing.

176
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,149
They thought they were insuring against like a fire in an era. Guess what?

177
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:47,630
We're still in litigation about that one because nobody had anticipated the complete destruction of both towers of the World Trade Center.

178
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,380
That's why we say all contracts are incomplete,

179
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:58,220
which gives you the absolute dictum that successful business contracts in many ways are all ultimately handshakes.

180
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:04,910
You write a contract in case it goes wrong, and the process of writing the contract could stabilize expectations.

181
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,840
But by and large, if you're a successful repeat player over each other,

182
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,130
there's a ton of handshake things, which is precisely we will work it out in good faith.

183
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,330
And people who actually try to stick to the letter of the contract and sue each other in oblivion tend not to have long term business relationships.

184
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:27,010
In politics, you have more incentive to sue each other in oblivion because it absolutely are supporters of the you know,

185
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,050
you're not trying to have long term relationships. You're trying to win publicly in a way that your supporters will like.

186
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:32,910
Different game.

187
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:42,930
But because all contracts are incomplete, because nobody wrote a supply contract for hospitals in 2019 that involved coping with a pandemic,

188
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,790
nobody wrote an insurance contract for the World Trade Centers that involved the falling down.

189
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,210
Judges are the ones who fill out the contracts when the two parties can do it over a cup of coffee.

190
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:02,700
This is why constraining judges and making judges predictable is such a problem, and that's why we care so much about precedent.

191
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:10,590
Asterix There are other ways of handling this in other legal systems of the world, but we're not talking about other legal systems in the world.

192
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:16,340
Because precedent is how you say X caused Y before there. It should lead the way again.

193
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,780
We're still performing the legal system service of say do x, you'll get Y.

194
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,720
Renege on your contract.

195
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:31,800
You'll have to pay a penalty back specified in the contract to the people who failed to get the food they promised to deliver.

196
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:44,010
So if I find an elaborate new way to renege on my contract or to do something wrong, we'd have to know how the judge is going to deal with it.

197
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:49,200
Right. And that's why precedent matters, because what lawyers will do is they'll go find a previous case.

198
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,969
The last time something like this happened and here's why that is like this.

199
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,950
We decided this and therefore, we're going to decide it again. So let's import some precedent.

200
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:04,320
It makes the law even more predictable in all the gaps in the contracts that we can't write well.

201
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:12,060
And for a variety of amazing reasons, there are certain contracts that you cannot write, but you will never litigate for that reason.

202
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:18,629
The judge is still in it, but you want the judge to be predictable, and the judge is made predictable by precedent.

203
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:29,100
And if you're not following precedent, you're not being a good judge. This is why the legal system was so resistant to Trump's actions.

204
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:37,409
So go back to the Muslim ban. You remember that once when you suddenly had these explosions of protests at airports around the United States,

205
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:42,510
because literally the Trump administration said we're not going to admit people from the

206
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,660
following list of predominantly Muslim countries while their airplanes are in the air.

207
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,519
Right. Like you're watching a movie where you land in JFK and suddenly Customs and

208
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,870
Border Protection takes you into a room because you want to muzzle that country. Okay.

209
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:03,720
How much protesters descend on the place? So I never thought in my life I would see a huge protest at the baggage claim of Detroit Metro Airport.

210
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:09,899
Right. This is a novelty, but two, $3,000 an hour.

211
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,680
Lawyers from major firms are at these airports.

212
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,130
And this is just not a thing that they do. Right. First of all, where is your $3,000?

213
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:25,710
Secondly, Sunday night, really lawyers at an airport helping people they've never met before for free.

214
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,430
This is like this does not compute. Why are they doing it?

215
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:37,510
Was it because they were liberals? That's a good that's a very. Partly some of them were liberals.

216
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:41,770
But I hesitate to tell you that the elite of Wall Street law are made up of liberals.

217
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:47,530
I think I'd be wrong if I were to claim that because they're lawyers.

218
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,690
What's the point of a life lawyer job is to tell you how the law works.

219
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:59,920
If you could do something that's lawless, what's the point of a lawyer? It's really that simple.

220
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:07,030
It's lawyers, power and influence and self esteem and everything that they bloody will be doing with their lives since they left undergrad,

221
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:13,290
by and large, are tied up with knowing the law and knowing how to do all the professionals.

222
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,930
That's what professionals like. So I professional was thrown out of their field is often a very miserable

223
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:25,610
person and this gives them an intense level of resistance to lawless actions,

224
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:32,450
no resistance whatsoever to bad actions that are lawful. Because I would also not be the one.

225
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,650
Local bad actions. All right. I'll do it. I'll charge you $3,000, but I'll do it.

226
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:46,290
Problem? But on the other hand, are they going to tolerate and endorse lawlessness?

227
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:51,510
No, they're not. This is a very profound source of antibodies, in a sense, in the legal system.

228
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:55,970
It wants things to be lawful. And you see this around the world, right?

229
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,900
I mean, look at Russia, which is pretty much the definition of a lawless country.

230
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:07,200
They're nonetheless going through all of these legal wars because even these degraded Russian judges who do what they're told,

231
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:14,240
the Russian conviction rate is like 99 plus percent. If you tell me that Russian cops are actually that good at investigation, well, for myself,

232
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:19,510
like Russian courts do what they're told, the Russian courts are still a formality.

233
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:26,189
So you get all these comic scenes going on in the background of the Ukraine war where like the media releases,

234
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:33,630
Putin signed a decree before the parliaments got around to voting on it, which is on one hand saying how much they care about legislative process.

235
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:38,820
Okay, got to do it because that's what Russian lawyers and judges need if they're going to do their jobs.

236
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:47,520
And so we're not party lawyers as heroes. I'm painting the law as a structural constraint on what you could do in politics.

237
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:57,450
And that's why you have. I'm disguising the firm, but that's why you have firms that any ambitious lawyer would be very,

238
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:04,170
very excited to work at, whose partners drop everything and go to SFO Sunday night to work for people they never met.

239
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,200
And by the way, that that signals to people who are thinking that they'd stay in and watch the football highlights over again.

240
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:18,060
If that level of lawyer is going to SFO, you better at least show up on monday talking about how you don't approve of the Muslim ban.

241
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:24,210
That's how signaling works. We're going to field. All the associates in the office are like, Oh, I just learned something about the law.

242
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:30,470
Now, the implication, though, is the legal writing is really careful.

243
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,170
This is what I want you to try and read as much about Dobbs as you can, because you want to see your facts and why.

244
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:43,350
And you look at a case. If you say if X, then Y. Example Department of Commerce.

245
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,140
Somebody is looking at an absurd outcome from what the law says on his face.

246
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:55,760
Just it was a really it was just something that shouldn't happen. He says, and he writes, and the judge approves.

247
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,890
It is clear that the inherent power of the Department of Commerce includes the power to do this.

248
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,680
In other words, use of the phrase inherent power, the Department of Commerce.

249
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:13,920
Later along comes a case where somebody cites the language of the inherent power of the Department of Commerce to do something that they want to do.

250
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:19,660
In the words of time. One, You create a loophole to avoid getting a stupid result.

251
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:26,680
But the problem is you have to anticipate that's no precedent, and that's not part of the law going forward.

252
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:34,220
And somebody is going to use that. And now you created the inherent power of the Department of Commerce as a legal thing.

253
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:40,670
And if another judge approves a decision based on the inherent power of the Department of Commerce, we're starting to get something going here.

254
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:49,320
See how this works. That's why legal writing is so convoluted and careful and why they teach a class upon class upon it.

255
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,879
Combined with real research.

256
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:58,830
Legal writing is being very careful when you say inherent power of the Department of Commerce legal research is find somebody

257
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:06,030
having got a case decided using the inherent power of the Department of Commerce and then use it to create the power of HHS.

258
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:16,230
That's why legal writing is so hard to read. You're trying to create a loophole for your purposes which will not.

259
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:22,820
How the truck driven through it later by somebody for some completely different purpose to participate.

260
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:30,670
Difficult, right. So be kind to lawyers when you give them some immensely complicated legal documents.

261
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:38,050
This is the thing they're doing. They're basically in an arms race with other lawyers to figure out how to produce outcomes

262
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,340
that work within the law without producing outcomes that they don't want to see.

263
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,610
Now there's a bit of an asterisk on this with the Supreme Court ruling.

264
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:53,080
Now, of course, people go into this law with the judges, and if you're an appellate federal judge, you have an agenda.

265
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,720
You know how I know you have an agenda. You're an appellate federal judge.

266
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,250
We are not approving people to be appellate federal judges because they're good at law.

267
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:05,380
First of all, I don't know that kids, lot of lawyers are good at law. And I'll get to the appellate federal judges.

268
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:12,700
It's because if you're as powerful as the US federal judiciary, as I, as a working politician,

269
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:17,830
a presidential or a senator, I'm not going to approve you until I'm 100% sure you're on my agenda.

270
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,400
Now, there's arguments about what exactly the agenda may be,

271
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:29,800
but I am not going to have somebody who's just a skilled legal technician of no fixed opinions using one of my precious federal court seats.

272
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:34,929
I'm a partizan politician, and I'm going to appoint Partizans who will be signed onto my agenda.

273
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:39,090
And ideally, young and healthy and articulate. Because it's a life term.

274
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:47,870
So because they have agendas. This is where, for example, John Roberts gets a lot of points for legal craftsmanship.

275
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,990
Other people do not like Chuck often Chief Justice Roberts,

276
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,350
but half the population would not like to see Chief Justice Roberts as they did when he was.

277
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,640
You know, I can say that with confidence, but half the population are Democrats.

278
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:04,340
They wouldn't like Chief Justice Roberts. Roberts is really smart.

279
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,770
Roberts stuff is you know, he creates loopholes and he cares about two things.

280
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:16,190
One is business deregulation and the other is voting rights. And he creates breadcrumbs, trails and breadcrumbs.

281
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:25,310
In each decision on these topics, he basically instructs you on how to design the next challenge that will allow him to push his agenda forward.

282
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:31,399
So if you read Roberts on regulation and he likes to write the controlling opinions on those because he

283
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,500
can see what he's doing or voting rights and restricting them has been his hobby since he was a college.

284
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,870
Roberts is very voting rights in private easier one because you don't have to know anything about the regulatory system.

285
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:47,629
And voting rights is very clear that Roberts lays out exactly what states that wish to do restrict

286
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:52,280
voting rights should do in order for him to take the next step in restricting voting rights.

287
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,480
He's done this extremely well and basically got no public response.

288
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:01,640
So he's doing your job. He's building the precedents to create the loopholes.

289
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,740
He's building the precedents. He's creating the loopholes through which somebody eventually drives a freight train.

290
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:14,220
That's why a lot of people admire John Roberts of the law. Dobbs is a great example of it.

291
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:20,690
Now, Alito is a much less subtle writer than Roberts.

292
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:28,409
I think you'll perceive that when you read the Dobbs opinion. But one of the things that Dobbs is doing in the majority opinion is setting up the

293
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:33,440
framework to a overturn any national legislation that guarantees abortion rights.

294
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:42,270
So Dobbs has set up exactly the framework that tells Right to Life how they sue to overturn a prospective federal entrenchment of Roe.

295
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,690
So Alito has clearly anticipated there's a chance Democrats will turn around and pass essentially Roe v Wade as law.

296
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,120
And he's setting up exactly what the opposing attorneys need to know in order to overturn it.

297
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:59,370
Do you want me to grab the cube and start throwing it or not? If everyone can hear it, it's fine.

298
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:04,680
I was just wondering if Judge wanted to use President from a dissenting opinion.

299
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:09,150
Does it hold as much weight or any weight or the same amount?

300
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:14,010
It is asking for about half of the next slide. So great question. What is the point of dissents?

301
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,790
Right. Is the question really there?

302
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:27,470
So I was listening to some of the arguments for the voting rights case right down the whole gamut.

303
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:32,380
And some of the liberal justices, for example, like don't understand.

304
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:39,220
The conversation about like basically calling out the conservatives is on what they

305
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,960
were actually doing and the podcasters were saying like this is kind of a new thing,

306
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,520
do that. And so I was kind of wondering what your expectations were like a lot.

307
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:54,130
They were both asking great questions and I think my fabulous next slide or maybe the next two slides.

308
00:29:54,460 --> 00:30:00,040
So we get to the end of the next slide to have an answer like I think that you're with it.

309
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:07,720
But so when you read Darby's watch, what's going on? Alito is explicitly telling Congress,

310
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:16,990
he's explicitly telling people how to block the national entrenchment of Roe v Wade by creating fetal personhood as a constitutional concept.

311
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:24,400
And B, he's explicitly telling a putative future Republican majority how to pass a nationwide abortion ban.

312
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,990
That's what's going on in the Dallas Opinion, is doing a bunch of other things, which we'll get to.

313
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,160
But Roberts is very subtle. He leaves a trail of breadcrumbs.

314
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,780
You need those $3,000 and our lawyers to find them. Alito is not being subtle.

315
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:42,340
Alito is essentially writing to state legislatures and the National Right to Life Committee and the Congress.

316
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:48,530
So the courts are getting political here. Yeah.

317
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:54,999
It's not going to be quite the next slide. Okay. The top two points I'm willing to bet are going to be pretty obvious to you if you live

318
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,840
in 2022 because of political because they're making decisions about political issues,

319
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,350
there is no way to make decisions about abortion without being political.

320
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:08,950
Just no. Okay. And there's no way you make decisions about the meaning of the Clean Air Act or the Voting

321
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:13,960
Rights Act or the policy towards refugees on the U.S. border without being political.

322
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:18,880
This is not possible. Politics is everywhere, and it's certainly present in the federal courts.

323
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,920
If it were easy and consensual, it wouldn't be a court. This means.

324
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:27,120
Therefore, like I said, any good working politician regards the federal courts as political actors.

325
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,540
Now this is asymmetrical for decades because the Republicans basically got really,

326
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:40,040
really mad about Roe versus Wade and Brown and a few other decisions and ran overtly on style activist courts.

327
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,950
Right. That was a very, very big conservative talking point for decades.

328
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:49,610
Now you're seeing the flip where you see Republican voters get more fond of activist courts because of their activist courts.

329
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:53,040
Democrats have had a significant loss of respect.

330
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:58,780
We'll discuss that. Now, here's the thing. Courts are acting, which are terrible, right?

331
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,109
What the majority wants doesn't matter. It takes place.

332
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:08,239
The whole democracy. The courts are on the liberal side. Meaning rule of law, individual rights, not the democracy side.

333
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:15,070
We need collective self-government. So you're going to particularly be fond of the courts if what you want is not popular.

334
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:22,360
This cuts in all directions, right? Every single one of you probably belongs to at least one group,

335
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:29,730
which is fundamentally unpopular and depends on the courts to preserve their rights to do whatever it is we Juggalos.

336
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,370
You know, local governments hate Juggalos for some reason.

337
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:41,480
Unclear. So you depend on the courts to preserve the rights of Juggalos and those obviously groups that are, you know,

338
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:47,469
without with all due respect to Juggalos, there's a lot of other rights that are more important than your rights to dress like each other.

339
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:50,950
Local, state clown posse. Which are defended by the courts.

340
00:32:52,940 --> 00:33:01,070
So if you're not popular enough to let us get legislation so there is essentially no support for dirty air.

341
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,300
If you think that the Clean Air Act is too restrictive,

342
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:11,710
you're really going to be interested in the courts because the courts can overrule application of the Clean Air Act that would be popular in public.

343
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:18,530
So politics in courts looks different because the law works differently from the overall political system, right?

344
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:22,940
Precedent. Predictability means you have to ground the decisions in existing law.

345
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,780
You can't say that my substantive goals are the reason this is worthwhile.

346
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:32,330
You can't say I'm protecting Donald Trump. You have to say the FBI misbehaved.

347
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,230
Although Trump's approach to law is endlessly fascinating, right?

348
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:43,370
Like, I don't think any trained lawyer would have initially come up with the the FBI might file a criminal case against me any day.

349
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:50,180
Therefore, I'll sue the FBI, followed by a judge saying, oh, you know, that's actually reason to interfere with the FBI's investigation.

350
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,920
That sort of thing tells you that the legal system is not running in top effectiveness.

351
00:33:56,290 --> 00:34:02,859
So here's why. Dobbs isn't just about abortion. Because since the case called Griswold versus Connecticut,

352
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:08,110
which hit upon the hotly contested issue of whether a married couple could use contraception within their marriage,

353
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:15,200
something that I'm sure you all fight about regularly, I. Not even the right concepts for single people.

354
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:24,230
It's the right to contraception for married couples. And in Griswold, the Supreme Court a long time ago, 1960s, overruled Connecticut's ballot.

355
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:29,690
They call these old Comstock calls from the 19th century. So they created a right to privacy.

356
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:34,520
What they said is that the Constitution and the number is famously, as the phrase implies, the right to privacy.

357
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:40,700
It enumerates a lot of rights which are appropriate when the amendments were passed, but they add up to a right to privacy.

358
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:45,109
This is not a stupid reading of the Constitution. Now it gives you all sorts of things.

359
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,809
For example, the right to Privacy Undergirds Loving versus Virginia,

360
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:54,650
which struck down statewide bans on interracial marriage, which is kind of a big deal.

361
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:02,430
Watch. By the way, when you read. Dobbs and you read the dissents, search on these cases, right?

362
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:06,580
Amanda loving Amanda Obergefell.

363
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:17,140
And look how Clarence Thomas had talks handled. The two cases he is loving versus Virginia is unquestionably based on Griswold versus Connecticut.

364
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,920
Obergefell, which is same sex marriage, unquestionably based on the right to privacy, Roe v Wade.

365
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:30,130
Right. You can see how the courts are developing and fleshing out this right to privacy and what it means.

366
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:35,410
And even to Dodd's decision, Alito is pretty explicit.

367
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:38,950
The Griswold was wrongly decided. He's going to cut this whole tree at the base.

368
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:49,270
The media is reporting as that he's clipping off a branch called abortion rights. Thomas is the one who actually went there.

369
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,070
Key fact about Thomases is like slight shift.

370
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:03,750
So we'll see what happens to Loving versus Virginia. The Thomas concurrence not to be different, but major questions don't abide by the signing.

371
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:06,639
You will see press reports on the history of the major questions doctrine.

372
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,680
And then I decided that the days are getting shorter in terms of getting along.

373
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,200
And you didn't really get to read the CRC history in this.

374
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:21,849
West Virginia versus EPA was West Virginia in its function as an avatar of the coal industry?

375
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:26,800
Suing the EPA efforts to restrict carbon dioxide on the grounds of carbon dioxide is bad for the planet.

376
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:34,470
What happened in the West Virginia, West Virginia versus EPA case is the court ruled.

377
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:43,049
The six ruled that the EPA was exceeding its authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon dioxide

378
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:48,130
because it hadn't been discussed by Congress when passing the Clean Air Act like 40 or 50 years ago in 1970s.

379
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,250
The doctrine they used is is a major question because it is a major question.

380
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,670
Congress has to go back and speak explicitly.

381
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,050
After the Congress classes, I hope we don't think this is going to happen on a reasonable short term schedule.

382
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:09,340
What is the major questions? Doctrine. This is the first time it's been the basis of a controlling opinion.

383
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:14,470
But if you go back, conservative judges have been adding it because conservative judges would like

384
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,910
Congress to do more regulating and have less regulation delegated to the agencies.

385
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:24,130
They want regulation to be through legislation. As a legal point of view.

386
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:30,790
You could debate this as a way to get conservative policy objectives into politics is a great idea because I'd love to win, although it.

387
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:34,040
And Congress is very open to industry lobbyists.

388
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:40,910
So pushing regulatory policy back toward Congress achieves conservative, substantive objectives, but you can't say that.

389
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,120
So instead, you have to say that there's a major questions doctrine.

390
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:48,530
Now, if you just come rocking out in West Virginia versus EPA, go, hey, check it out.

391
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:53,690
I invented a new doctrine. Here is everybody is not going to be perceived as good law.

392
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:57,530
So instead, you have to go back and cite all the other times. And guess what?

393
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:03,769
It turns out the conservative judges have been adding the major questions, doctrine and references that didn't determine the law,

394
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:07,880
but stacking up a bunch of decisions where major questions doctrine was used,

395
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,940
all of them saying there is a theoretical possibility not present in this case, that there's a major question,

396
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:18,710
which means Congress should have to speak instead of the agency using what appears to be clearly delegated authority.

397
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,090
It's a way to clip agencies wings.

398
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:26,930
But you have to have built it up by creating all these precedents that there is such a thing as a major questions doctrine.

399
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:35,800
Finally comes busting out. EPA can't regulate under the terms of the Clean Air Act because that's a major question Congress has to decide.

400
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:42,220
Good luck with that. The key thing is that they worked at this for years after a very long time frame to think about this stuff.

401
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:47,290
I remember I popped up on some panel about abortion right after Trump was elected.

402
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:53,529
I said, Really? What is over here is, well, it's probably due to the students rather like what government like.

403
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:57,220
Trust me. Just the time frame. It's over.

404
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:06,070
Even last year when I was teaching, nobody said nobody knew it was what was scheduled for the EPA.

405
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:14,530
Since they're now bringing the one about the wetlands forward is not probably going to be built on the same idea, quite possibly.

406
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:19,360
Well, the wetlands cases coming out of the Clean Water Act probably invoke the major questions doctrine.

407
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,620
Very easy to answer that. There's generally a thing called non delegation,

408
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:29,980
which is the conservative idea that we delegated too much authority to the administrative regulatory states since the 1930s.

409
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:34,720
So potentially we roll back all the way to the 1920s if you follow this logic all the way through.

410
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:39,280
What they're doing is they're chipping away at something you call Chevron. Deference after case about Chevron.

411
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,750
Chevron deference is deference to the agency operating within its legal scope

412
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,739
gets deference for competence if it follows the Administer Procedures Act,

413
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:54,850
which is the regulatory structure. We talked about the chipping away at that and the collective phrase for that is not delegation.

414
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,520
They don't want Congress to delegate to agencies. Yeah, they don't.

415
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:05,860
The IRA settled the major questions doctrine specifically in regards to greenhouse gas emissions, defining them as pollution.

416
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:11,860
Yes, that is part. Did the IRA settled it by defining the house gases as pollution?

417
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:16,210
Yes, it did. Is.

418
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,420
The problem is. This is Congress pushing back.

419
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:25,939
This is a thing that I mentioned in the podcast and I hope we get to. But that's where they basically are following along behind.

420
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,360
We see this all the time. Remember the Lilly Ledbetter Equal Pay Act?

421
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:34,940
Basically Lilly Ledbetter. I forget what company she worked for. I want to say it was a big manufacturing company.

422
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:40,940
I think anyway, she had been underpaid for a long time. She didn't know it until the salary information somehow got out.

423
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:44,870
She realized that as a woman she had been a victim of like really up access discrimination.

424
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,370
Like, this is $0.95 on the dollar. It's like 50. And guess what?

425
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:54,770
$0.50 on the dollar over your career adds up to a lot of money, times the size of a class action lawsuit.

426
00:40:54,770 --> 00:41:01,299
That's a very, very large amount of money. And the court said that's outside the statute of limitations because you're asking essentially

427
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:05,440
for money with interest from when you were being discriminated against when you were 22.

428
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,460
And now you're like a statute of limitations to that system.

429
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:15,310
So the first thing Obama signed basically was the Lilly Ledbetter Equal Pay Act, which said, no, that's not what we meant.

430
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,160
The problem is, if you depend on Congress to say, no, that's not what we meant.

431
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:28,070
You see the first mover advantage to whoever comes along and finds a federal court judge who agrees with them.

432
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:33,170
And then you need to assume somebody who agrees with you holds Congress and the White House.

433
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:41,560
And is willing to bend the rules of reconciliation to say that carbon dioxide is a pollutant.

434
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:47,049
And if you then get the court, redefining the IRA was an inappropriate place to say it.

435
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:50,230
For example, then come back around and legislate again until the court gets the message.

436
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:57,510
So this kind of summarizes the last couple of slides, right. Let's start with the system has a lot of antibodies.

437
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:04,740
Okay. If you come in with an explicitly political results driven jurisprudence, it will the immune system will kick off.

438
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,720
Think about it this way.

439
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:14,120
Most of what judges do, most of what lawyers do is going to cases where by definition is presumed, somebody is wrong, lying or bad.

440
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:23,159
No, that's kind of what a cases. Listening to heart rending stories or saying I objected.

441
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:28,319
I personally have this policy objective is obviously going to be wildly dysfunctional in such a system.

442
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,340
Right. So I can't impose my policy objective outside the law.

443
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:37,020
I have to say what I'm doing is what the law says. And I have to figure out how to make the law say what I want to do.

444
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:44,700
So how do you do it? When you get something, looks to you. WALLACE How do you do it when you get a case like the Texas body of the law?

445
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,480
Well, what is your boy deciding on procedural grounds?

446
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:58,070
But a friend of mine now, the judge spent like a month interrogating the procedure on this case before it got to his chambers.

447
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,879
What was he doing? He was trying to find a way to say this.

448
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:12,120
Kate shouldn't have come to me because there was an error in procedure. So you find procedural grounds for saying, I don't want to make this decision.

449
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:21,930
So why did it take until 1973 to get role versus weight, bearing in mind when most women other pregnant for six weeks to months.

450
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:29,790
There is no way you're going to get something that is not a burning question of national security to the Supreme Court in seven months.

451
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:34,320
By which point a baby has been born. You have no standing.

452
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:38,820
Standing means that you are directly affected by the case. We can't all pile in every case we care about.

453
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,420
You need to have standing. Standing means you need to be involved. Well, you had the baby.

454
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,880
If you don't get pregnant again, we. Pregnancy is not standing.

455
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:53,040
You're not pregnant. Pregnant people have a standard. Therefore, we can't decide the case.

456
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:57,720
There can be no federal jurisprudence on abortion. That was the line until 1973.

457
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:02,399
What are the innovations in Roe versus Wade to say people who aren't pregnant might become

458
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,570
pregnant and people who are doctors who might see people who are pregnant have standing.

459
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:12,540
There was innovation in standing to get around the procedural dodge that you can't have standing because you already have the baby.

460
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:19,420
So that's the kind of thing courts do all the time. I don't want to decide this case.

461
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,000
I don't want to support this thing that's going on.

462
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:28,059
Therefore, I invent some complicated procedural reason, such as you don't have standing because you're not pregnant,

463
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,790
because we get a [INAUDIBLE] of a lot more to have the servants look up.

464
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:36,890
So the Supreme Court wanted rule versus way and they changed the rules of standing to get it.

465
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:43,170
Now, the second one, if that's the way I remember it, was about predictability.

466
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:51,700
So find a reason why a holding does not apply to your specific case. So, for example, Bush versus Gore involves a reading of the 14th Amendment.

467
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:57,790
It's essentially the right to vote. That is entirely at odds with pretty much all conservative doctrine.

468
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:04,960
Like legal conservatives would not endorse the reading of the 14th Amendment, that was the basis for putting George W Bush in office.

469
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:11,979
And this decision explicitly says this isn't precedent. Recounts what this means.

470
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,180
In a sense, that's bad law, right? So on one hand, they don't care.

471
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:21,280
They got George W Bush put into office. But it means that George W Bush gets memory holds by the entire story,

472
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,200
that Bush versus Gore gets memory all by the entire legal field, except as a case of bad law.

473
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:35,200
So what you do is if the Supreme Court goes and says something that anybody would say to major questions,

474
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,910
that you don't agree with the major questions doctrine and you can't get rid of this case on procedural grounds and produce the right to vote.

475
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:48,909
Then you say this isn't a major question because downside now we're further entrenching the major questions.

476
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:54,790
Doctrine upside. I is a federal appellate judge and getting my role in making it harder to be a

477
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:59,079
major question so maybe I can eventually contribute to the major questions.

478
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:03,399
Doctrine apply only to things that are so immensely important against the Supreme Court

479
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,520
instead of having it be an all purpose puppet for people who don't want to be regulated.

480
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:12,680
So you find a reason why the whole thing doesn't apply to your specific case.

481
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:18,120
This is really a major, basic judicial technique. Courts don't want a Republican president.

482
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:24,570
Remember, I mentioned the 14th Amendment. This is part of the reconstruction amendments which were being litigated live last week.

483
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,790
Astonishingly, most black people's rights actually come from the Commerce Clause,

484
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:39,149
not the constitutional amendments explicitly passed after the Civil War to guarantee rights for black

485
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:44,910
Americans because the court didn't want to overturn the precedent of lovely cases like Dred Scott.

486
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:53,519
So instead it comes out of the Commerce Clause. So the Voting Rights Act legal basis is in part that Congress and the course

487
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,480
of regulating interstate commerce has the ability to regulate who can vote.

488
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:01,200
The Civil Rights Act is the clearest case of that not being able to present.

489
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:08,860
Relitigating matters happening live right now. But what you see there is the extreme reluctance to overturn precedent.

490
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:13,960
Brown versus Board of Education. Does it really overturn Plessy versus Ferguson?

491
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:23,250
Because I don't like overturning precedent. Instead, what you do is you chip away until there is no case in which you can actually apply Plessy.

492
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:30,480
Right. The exceptions to Plessy are now 100% of the situations in which you could conceivably apply Plessy.

493
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:35,790
Therefore, you have to overturn the precedent. That, by the way, was Roberts's plan for Roe versus Wade.

494
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,480
You simply allow every form of restriction without ever overturning Roe.

495
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:48,760
So. It is, by the way, hard to get the right cases under the spotlight because they have to bring their own cases.

496
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:52,830
So I would have a couple of confusion about that.

497
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,990
So it sounds good.

498
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:07,059
So I understand like initially kind of the, I guess, foundation, for lack of a better word,

499
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:13,780
for trying to overturn Roe versus Wade, was establishing the fetus as a person by establishing that person.

500
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:20,670
So you can say that abortion violates the principle of life, which is in the Constitution.

501
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:24,429
You can find one in the Constitution if you really want that to be one.

502
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:29,920
But the Constitution doesn't really say, okay, life, liberty and pursuit of happiness is the Declaration of Independence.

503
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:33,820
Very well, that one. So seriously, it matters.

504
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:41,410
Most Americans forget that distinction. So I guess my question or what I'm confused about is how do you.

505
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:55,600
I must not have or be unable to overturn Plessy versus Ferguson or laws like that, if you're able to establish, I guess, like the racial aspect of it,

506
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:06,090
because I was kind of listening to Justice Jackson kind of going over like establishing that that is based in racial precedent.

507
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:11,470
And I'm just wondering, I feel like I can't really say my question.

508
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,999
I think I think I have to address the Justice Jackson issue now because.

509
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:23,350
Okay, first of all, if you like, a fist pumping legal performance, like it was kind of amazing, right?

510
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:29,269
The case is Alabama. Alabama is doing what John Roberts effectively told him to do,

511
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:34,850
which is passing restrictions on voting rights that are going to make it harder to create districts in which black people constitute a majority.

512
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:39,350
Newsflash Alabama politics is black people don't constitute a majority of the district.

513
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:43,550
They're not going to get their candidate, period. Alabama has extremely racialized politics.

514
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:52,219
So therefore, this is deciding the extent to which the predominantly white Alabama state government

515
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:55,970
can decide how many black members of the House it's going to send to Washington.

516
00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:01,490
That's the decision. Does the Alabama state legislature get to gerrymander or to decide how many black members go to Washington?

517
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,790
They're doing they're playing by the rules Roberts set up for the rest of this time, it's Andrew Brown.

518
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:13,399
Jackson gets put into the Supreme Court. She proceeds to go in heavy.

519
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:19,820
And basically what you're normally supposed to do with these oral questions when it's almost basically didn't say anything out them for 20 years.

520
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,990
Like one time he mumbled some joke and everybody got excited. The legal press.

521
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:29,450
But Thomas's point of view is that oral questions are pointless. We should just skip the whole thing.

522
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:33,050
He already always knows what he thinks, so I suppose that's fine for him.

523
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:38,030
But she's basically arguing from the bench.

524
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:44,290
She's essentially schooling Alabama's lawyers on a different reading the 14th Amendment,

525
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:47,889
which is far better historiography, because what they're doing is originalism.

526
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:54,910
Right. What did the what did the founders intend? Well, the founders were all dead for 50 or 80 years when we passed the reconstruction amendments.

527
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:58,719
So it is irrelevant what Thomas Jefferson would have thought about the 14th Amendment.

528
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:04,090
You might as well ask what Tutankhamen thought about the 14th Amendment, the equally irrelevant in legal terms.

529
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:10,390
What Jackson is doing is she's saying, look, there is a vast historiography.

530
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,380
Nobody at the time. And they there was a congressional record.

531
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:18,400
We know their speeches. We have their campaign stuff. This is immensely well documented.

532
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:25,959
We are about the Constitution. You're arguing basically from James Madison's notes is an extremely self-interested player with his own agenda,

533
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,610
is taking notes for his own purposes on the deliberations of a bunch of drunk people in a hot building in Philadelphia.

534
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:37,840
That's the original evidence base on the First Amendment and their Constitution at all.

535
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:44,140
We know enormous amounts from multiple sources, and God knows how many historians have written,

536
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:50,460
God knows how many pages about what the reconstruction amendments were intended to mean by people past and brought.

537
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:54,700
Jackson was bringing this straight into moral questions where normally judges are very

538
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:59,740
passive and ask leading questions that allow attorneys to elaborate on their views.

539
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:08,419
She instead went in and basically two things. One is she humiliated the Alabama lawyers who were simply there to deal with Justice

540
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:11,420
Roberts told them to do in order to further restrict the Voting Rights Act.

541
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:14,660
And they didn't expect the sample should be and.

542
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,280
Pointing out the hypocrisy of her ostensibly originalist colleagues.

543
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:29,669
So it's a strategy. It's a strategy to rein it in by having an extremely public showcasing of the extent to which they're going to

544
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:35,430
make up the history that they rely on when they decide to cut back the Voting Rights Act in the Alabama case.

545
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,650
So she's using the public weapon of shaming and an implicit accusation of hypocrisy.

546
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:44,130
Now, this isn't something judges did. She several trailblazer in this.

547
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:48,690
I think the reason she's doing it is partly that this is a63 court with an agenda.

548
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:58,350
If she's got nothing to lose, she can't force trade and talk her way into changing what these six judges think better.

549
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:04,400
Ginsburg did that and maps on H. Bader Ginsburg had been around in the era when you could horse trade your way shows

550
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:08,070
she did a great job with Scalia like she and Scalia traded favors all the time.

551
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:16,440
There is no Scalia and there's no better Ginsburg. And I think just Justice Jackson is in many ways what you would expect as the liberal

552
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:22,170
antidote to the extremely strong ideological force that you get at second marriage on Alito.

553
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:29,940
So that's what I would say is going on. She's trying to rein in the Alabama decision by essentially using the one public forum.

554
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:37,440
She's got to speak aloud to accuse her colleagues of hypocrisy because they claim to be following history and they aren't.

555
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:45,200
And the history is overwhelmingly on her side. Anybody who tries to tell you the 14th Amendment is race neutral has not read a page of history.

556
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:51,840
So that takes us to the sense. Pundits question.

557
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,150
There was a self-conscious preferential system. Okay. Go back to Dobbs.

558
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:03,650
The law on abortion is Dobbs. The correct reading of the Constitution for a working lawyer is Dobbs.

559
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:08,610
I can read the Constitution any way I want. I'm not. The Supreme Court doesn't matter.

560
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:15,720
You have to recognize that there is no is there's only is is what ought to and will not get decided by the Supreme Court.

561
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:21,840
So. Dobbs as a whole, you discovered a lot of. We thought a lot.

562
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:29,180
So what are the dissents? Do the dissents introduce other ways you can think?

563
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,460
That's why they're really important.

564
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:37,910
So it's a smart thing to say on political Twitter or what have you that like writing great dissents is one thing, but winning is better.

565
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:41,600
Well, yes, breakthrough. You know, winning is better.

566
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:48,640
The West. The Detroit Lions. Right. But. The dissents mark out alternative ways.

567
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:54,220
It could be in a way that is ratified, if not by the whole Supreme Court, at least by most of the Supreme Court.

568
00:54:54,250 --> 00:55:01,230
Some of the concurrences. Right. So Thomas is go for broke down the torpedoes, cut off Griswold versus Connecticut, his base.

569
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:04,420
Alito says, oh, no, we're trimming the branch called abortion.

570
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:11,560
The Democrats, the liberals on the court said, no, you're going to cut off Griswald and base other things.

571
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:18,200
Making the point that there's alternative ways to argue this in alternative ways to think because it's totally legitimate to cite a dissent.

572
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:24,680
It's less powerful. But it now means that within the lawyer head, there is a just the truth of Dobbs,

573
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:30,110
which is American law today is also these are alternative ways we could have thought of.

574
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:37,780
Dobbs even if they had the truth of American law today. And that's much more powerful than anybody out there writing in a Law Review article

575
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:43,000
or delivering a speech about other ways you could think about abortion law. So that's why the dissents matter.

576
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:48,490
The other things that higher courts could have said and to keep the alternatives in place.

577
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:53,080
So those dissents are going to be very, very important documents for some decades to come.

578
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,720
And the system is not foolproof, but it is strong.

579
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:06,210
Mar a Lago has wasted six weeks, and now we'll see if the Justice Department gets scared when Trump announces his candidacy.

580
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:10,290
But the 11th Circuit Court took that judge to the cleaners.

581
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:13,589
They basically said she's wrong. On the key point, we were asked and furthermore,

582
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:17,309
here's 40 pages of us completely humiliating her because we really want to make

583
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:20,400
it clear to every single attorney and every single judge who ever sees this,

584
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:25,370
this is radioactive. Do not ever do it again. And it probably works.

585
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:31,950
So she has a favor to cash in with Donald Trump and she's completely her reputation on fire in the entire legal profession.

586
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:38,820
Somewhere in the age of six, three under five four,

587
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:43,709
you had the very subtle John Roberts trailing breadcrumbs so that we could eventually get rid of Roe

588
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:47,520
and the Voting Rights Act without anybody noticing and make it impossible to regulate businesses.

589
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:53,830
Singapore. There is a U.S. president. He's the one who saved the ACA by rewriting it.

590
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:58,570
I suppose everybody got mad at the world.

591
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,060
Now you can lose a judge and still win. So decisions are far less settled.

592
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,160
These guys are really legislating. Like it's obviously a Freudian slip.

593
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:12,340
These guys are really deciding decisions impartially, like there's no tomorrow.

594
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,390
I think it's because they're worried about somebody's health.

595
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:23,400
I think they think they can go back to fight for very easily and therefore, they are going to try and entrench as much law as they possibly can.

596
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:29,670
These are not subtle decisions. When you read the majority opinion on dubs, it is not subtle.

597
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:38,960
It is a sledgehammer of legal rights. They're trying to move as fast as they can on as many fronts as they can while they got their majority.

598
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:45,500
That's not my strategic reading of their situation, but my position in the world and their position in the world is very, very different.

599
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:48,960
Federal judges do not live at the same information we do.

600
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:57,500
So that's why you get more of the conflict, because the liberals realize that their influence on these decisions is essentially nil.

601
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:03,110
So again, for example, Justice Jackson's thesis, I would hypothesize,

602
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:09,230
is that making democracy visible is the best way to rein in the VRA decision that's coming in the Alabama case.

603
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:14,450
And the dissents are about saying very clearly, this is not a unified view of the court.

604
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:20,359
There's other strong views available. Now, this matters in part because of the antibodies I described,

605
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:25,000
which are common properties to essentially every federal judge, but also a member of the federal bench.

606
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:30,690
Biden, unlike his previous boss, Obama has been really, really good about filling court positions.

607
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:36,500
This is a thing that Democrats learn from the Obama administration. So the federal bench is about even Democrat-Republican.

608
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:40,580
Trump and Biden are two of the most efficient judge appointing administrations

609
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:43,610
we've ever seen because they both realize you've got to fill up those seats

610
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:51,680
because they both realize that's how you constrain all these people who are trying to achieve substantive ends by writing the law at the lower courts.

611
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:57,550
And don't forget the legislature, Congress can constrain the court space couch, Jonathan.

612
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,240
They also did it on the $35 court expansion.

613
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:08,179
The liberals were arguing the court's already been packed right by keeping Merrick Garland off the court until there was an election.

614
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:12,040
And then by rushing Congress through the months before an election, you could take that argument if you want to.

615
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:17,440
But the fact that the conversation is being held could be like the filibuster, where we went from,

616
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:22,840
essentially no Democrats seeking its abolition to 48 Democrats seeking abolition in the course of a couple of years.

617
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,870
And also courts. This court is legislating that there's no tomorrow.

618
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:32,710
I think their hypothesis is Clarence Thomas had a heart attack one day. They go back to fight for John Roberts as a charge.

619
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:36,090
Never. And again, I think that's probably something like the hypothesis.

620
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:41,730
The Supreme Court makes you do this calculation because you have to be morbidly right.

621
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:46,500
You're not asking me what I thought about Ginsburg's decision making the Obama presidency.

622
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:51,600
So. But Congress can signal the courts. Right.

623
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:57,330
So if Congress is already pushing back and when you start actually seeing conversations about court expansion,

624
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:01,320
that is a message to the courts that they might want to drawing their horns a bit.

625
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:11,850
So here's the age of 63 and they are arranged by presidency with John Roberts in the middle of the clock.

626
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,180
And then you put the by time on the court.

627
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:20,009
So Clarence Thomas is the person who's been on the court longest, and then they arrange it that way all the way around to Justice.

628
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:21,870
Jackson was left, was the newest member of the court.

629
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:28,080
So you might think you've achieved one of the coolest jobs on the planet, and they want you to know the Italy senior person.

630
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:34,100
As people die, get a potential move right and eventually make it all the way around to work 24 hours.

631
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:42,020
So this term alone, we have the Clean Water Act, Wetlands and Statics for Development, the Voting Rights Act.

632
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:48,020
That's what they're arguing right now, university admissions. So we're going to knock down the University of Michigan case that says the universities

633
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:51,800
basically have latitude to take diversity into account as objective admissions.

634
01:00:54,170 --> 01:01:01,120
We do a lot of revisions to this, but we could literally lose the right to use diversity as an objective.

635
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:05,990
Diversity in the procedure was the First Amendment.

636
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:09,589
This is a thing that I think is underplayed, which is the expansion of religious liberty,

637
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:15,050
which is loosely grounded in the First Amendment, to say that if your religion says you don't have to abide by a civil right or B2.

638
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:20,700
I think this is, by the way, in the history of American religion, something we see a lot, which is one theory.

639
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:25,040
You should go out there and make the whole world adhere to your religion. The other is that the world is hopelessly corrupted.

640
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:29,840
You should develop a community of people who are not corrupt and let them do their thing,

641
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:35,060
which means not applying civil laws that object to their that these are objectionable in their community to them.

642
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:40,240
Watch this space because in health care in particular, this is an extremely big deal.

643
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:46,850
This amounts to if I'm the only pharmacist on duty for 100 miles and I don't want to prescribe a morning and somebody at work after pill,

644
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:53,930
do I have a right to do that? And the independent legislatures, state elections, in which case the United States ceases to be a democracy.

645
01:01:54,440 --> 01:02:00,740
This is the thesis that if you read the Constitution says the state legislatures can decide how votes are held for the presidency.

646
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:05,450
And if you read that extremely literally and in contravention of a section of all American history,

647
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:09,170
it says state legislatures don't apply, so state constitutions don't apply.

648
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:14,670
State supreme courts don't apply. State governors don't matter. The legislature should appoint the slate of electors they want.

649
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:17,810
So the hypothesis is that Wisconsin votes for Biden in 2024.

650
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:21,890
The gerrymandered Wisconsin legislature says that that doesn't actually matter.

651
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:25,310
That was advisory. We support Donald Trump in Wisconsin.

652
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:28,310
Electors go to Washington and Donald Trump becomes president.

653
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:35,480
If the independent state legislatures theory is adopted, you will get an essentially undemocratic results of the next presidential election.

654
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:40,370
So it's kind of a big deal closer in a sense.

655
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:54,890
I look at that. What do you think's going on? Which means you can infer the average.

656
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:01,860
Jonathan. Oh, it's just. Sorry.

657
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:10,290
Oh, okay. Thank you. It's interesting that you see the spike in Democrat support for the course in 2012 2013,

658
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:16,650
which is right around when someone like I first case is before Obergefell.

659
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:25,010
I think what you see is the Republicans tanking after you see the Republicans tanking at that time, a lot of are going to use of the court tactic.

660
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:30,139
Yeah, exactly. As they start having support for gay rights on gay marriage.

661
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:40,430
And then you see a Trump get elected in 2017 having to start to fill the court with his own appointees and Democrat supported abortion types.

662
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:44,960
And you see a little bit of an inversion in 2020. What was the role of federal courts in 2020?

663
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:58,680
Think about the election. Why would Democrats like the federal courts more and Republicans lose faith in the courts in the course of 2020.

664
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:04,370
So something to do with not overturning the election decided to do it.

665
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:10,130
Not overturning the election, you said? Yeah. I mean, we had 70, 63, something like that.

666
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:17,640
I don't remember the exact number of cases in which federal courts decided against challenges brought by Republicans on the election cases.

667
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:21,360
So federal courts were not delivering if what you think the federal courts were

668
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,600
supposed to deliver was second term of President Trump like they were doing that.

669
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:30,080
And you can see how Republicans might say, well, what is this? I got a bunch of unelected people delivering speeches, judgments.

670
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:39,710
I don't really. Do you think I think you would take away is that in the course since we got six three which remember happened at the end of 2020.

671
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:45,900
You're seeing a very significant, unprecedented low level of Democratic support for the court.

672
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:51,540
The independents are tracking the Democrats, which is never a good thing for the president.

673
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:58,230
You always watch who the independents are tracking and the independents here appear to be tracking the Democrats.

674
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:06,990
So that would suggest and obviously, if you average these numbers, you get in basically the lowest level of public support the Colts ever had.

675
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:12,060
Two years ago, John Roberts was the most trusted figure in American politics among Democratic voters.

676
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:16,150
He's now absolutely a total. People living in.

677
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:24,610
And 39% of Republicans support the court. So this is an overall collapse in support, which is in large part,

678
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:32,080
I would say you can watch over about the last four years as Democrats clocked something that Republican voters had always known,

679
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:37,870
which is the court is fundamentally political and in many ways can be quite dangerous because it's not left to the left or legislature.

680
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:48,580
Do you think it's going to affect the sex? You know, John Roberts doesn't like this at all.

681
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:56,450
Education is not very you.

682
01:05:57,990 --> 01:06:03,330
I feel like they don't want what it seems like they were trying to put this, like, happy face on.

683
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:10,530
Oh, we're like all best friends and we work together. But I think that they've now changed their influence on that and are more like we're not.

684
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:14,370
The points are an afterthought. We don't care what the solution has to say.

685
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:20,930
For me, it's the same with the families. Said they were very educated on 22.

686
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:27,510
Yeah, I think you're right. I think there's one correction which is that in the world of federal judges that I've described,

687
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:29,850
is there any point where you say, I care about public opinion?

688
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:39,870
You know, therefore the law legislatures legislate so they make law, but public opinion has to be filtered through that.

689
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:46,890
Now, the fact that you go, oh, we turn on Fox News or whatever is like your personal sources of outside information,

690
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:55,680
but you're seeing an increasing elector appreciation in the electorate of the partizan nature of the court is what I read.

691
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:00,060
And given the Republicans have been campaigning against activist judges for 50 years,

692
01:07:00,090 --> 01:07:04,650
you would expect Republican voters would be much more attuned to all of the political will to the court,

693
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:08,040
which is why this little, in the end is potentially interesting.

694
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:13,619
But I would suggest that Republicans and Democrats are both starting to do what they do for every other branch of government,

695
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:19,040
which is they evaluate it based on their partizanship. Now for the Senate.

696
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:22,279
Yes. I'd like we all know the rules. You don't like the Senate?

697
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:28,170
Vote for Republicans. You don't like the Senate. Vote for Democrats. You don't like the Supreme Court?

698
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:36,100
In the next section of that sentence involves things that's going to make a lot of judges minds, views.

699
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:39,400
You don't like the Supreme Court vote for more Democrats on the Supreme Court.

700
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:45,340
Oh 15 You see where that goes?

701
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:56,160
So for a long time I would bang on in this class about how Griswald mattered and existed and was endangered in the courts or fundamentally political.

702
01:07:56,170 --> 01:08:00,460
And I got a polite non-response. So you guys are probably among the most informed people in American politics.

703
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,399
Not a super huge threshold, I have to say.

704
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:12,300
But to people who have any idea what happened in the Supreme Court oral argument argues like brilliant quote, always find yourselves on the back foot.

705
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:24,520
When we talk about elites. It was really such an imposter syndrome, you know, you have any idea what I just said?

706
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:29,740
You will be. And at least the 80th, if not the 90th percentile.

707
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:34,240
Even if you don't know a thing outside, that's the level of political knowledge.

708
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:39,670
So Supreme Court has introduced itself to the public as a partizan actor, and that's hard to take back.

709
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:46,130
Okay. X-Class is about tops. We're going to practice.

710
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:50,540
Pretend you're in law school and you're talking about people doing absolutely horrible, horrible things.

711
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:55,730
And criminal cases, for example. You have to back out your emotions.

712
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:00,610
We have a social science class. You have to pay attention to what is and not just what.

713
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:07,650
We're not going to talk about our views of as law and policy. I have extremely strong views and I've been having them since the last century

714
01:09:07,650 --> 01:09:11,250
and can see it if you dig far enough into my employment record as we speak.

715
01:09:11,790 --> 01:09:18,180
We're not going to talk about whether or not this is a good idea. We're going to talk about the political system within the courts.

716
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:23,080
The data stops. So read as much of the decision as you can.

717
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:29,730
Middle of read until you feel like you're getting a sense for how Clarence Thomas thinks or how Samuel Alito thinks.

718
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:37,370
Frank devices, you all do that in order to refer back to them, because we're going to be discussing that.

719
01:09:38,610 --> 01:09:46,320
I'd read at least to have this brief to find out how people like us and not federal judges have one last throw to try to influence the debate.

720
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:51,060
Ask yourself what they're actually talking about. Thomas is word I'm talking about.

721
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:53,520
Alito is overt.

722
01:09:53,580 --> 01:10:01,950
I'm not talking about Griswold, who's working with you, and ask about what you think ought to happen next, realistically and in reality.

723
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:13,520
Thank you. So, Terry, I screwed up.
