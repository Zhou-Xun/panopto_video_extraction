00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,590
This is each MP 826 Chapter one Introduction and Math Review.

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:14,450
We're going to start with Factorial. Factorial is denoted X with an exclamation point.

3
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:20,360
It means x times x minus one, times x minus two and so forth, all the way down to one.

4
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:26,210
So for example, three factorial is three times two times one, which equals six.

5
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,420
This notation is for integers with exit greater than or equal to two.

6
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:43,400
The one odd thing about factorial is, is that while one factorial is equal to one, zero factorial is also equal to one, not zero.

7
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:51,380
Next we'll talk about the Chus function, which is also very useful in statistics and probability.

8
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,970
The combinatorial choose function is. Then you can think about it two different ways.

9
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:06,680
One is the number of ways to choose x unique items from a larger set of N unique items without any regard to order.

10
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,500
The second way is that it's the number of way to order a set of binary outcomes.

11
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:20,760
So first I'll give notation, then I'll go through a couple of examples. The combinatorial function and choose.

12
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:30,320
X is written as an over x all in parentheses equal to end factorial over x factorial times rn minus x factorial.

13
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,390
Can we need non-negative integers and an x with and being at least as large as x?

14
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,640
So let's go through two examples that hopefully will make this a little clearer.

15
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,560
First is, if you have a standard deck of cards with 52 cards and want to answer the question,

16
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,720
how many unique poker hands can you create from a standard deck of cards?

17
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:59,540
A poker hand has five cards. Every card is unique, but order is irrelevant.

18
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:05,450
So that's we'll be able to use the combinatorial function to answer that.

19
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:20,080
The second one is if you flip a coin ten times, fair coin ten times, how many ways can you get five heads and five tails in any of the various orders?

20
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,680
So we only have two outcomes and now we do care about the order.

21
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,599
So for the unique poker hands, we have 50 to choose five.

22
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:37,200
So we start with 52 unique cards and we want to know how many unique set of five card hands there are.

23
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:43,190
So it's 52 factorial, over five factorial times 47 factorial.

24
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,450
A lot of that cancels out if you write out the math.

25
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:57,140
So you have 52 times 51 down, two times 48 and all over five factorial, two and a half million unique poker hands that are possible.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,430
For the coin spinning example,

27
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:15,140
there are 252 different ways that you can arrange heads and tails if you have five of each in in in order for ten different outcomes.

28
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:23,620
Next, we'll talk about the probability density function and the cumulative distribution function.

29
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,989
These two functions are closely related to each other and they're slightly

30
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:33,840
different for if you have a discrete distribution or a continuous distribution.

31
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,850
So we'll start with discrete, then move on to continuous.

32
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:45,669
Also notice that the every time I refer to things with the probability density function, I use lowercase letters.

33
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:54,370
So pdf I always write in lowercase letters. The cumulative distribution function I always write with capital letters CDF.

34
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:04,080
So the PDF is the probability that a random variable big x takes on a specific value equal to little x.

35
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:10,510
So Big X here is a random variable little x which looks the same but it's really different.

36
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,400
Is is equal to some specific value.

37
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:28,730
The cumulative distribution is the probability that a random variable Big X takes on a range of values less than or equal to a specific value.

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,070
Little X All right, so for discrete distributions, we write it in the following way.

39
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:47,360
Little F of x is equal to the probability that the random variable capital x is equal to little x.

40
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,829
There are two properties for the discrete pdf.

41
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:57,680
One is that these probabilities are bounded by zero and one you can't have a probability that's negative.

42
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,490
You can't have a probability that's greater than one. That's what the first thing says.

43
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:07,070
The second is if you add up all the probabilities, they have to add up to one.

44
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:14,230
So hopefully that makes sense. Thanks to talk about the CDF, then we'll go through an example.

45
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:22,030
The cumulative distribution function is denoted capital F of Little X,

46
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:30,190
and that's the probability that the random variable Big X takes out a range of values up to little X.

47
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:40,960
So you can also think of it as the sum of a bunch of PDFs from whatever the smallest number is up to X.

48
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,450
So the discrete CDF has a couple of probabilities.

49
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:58,750
It's monotonically increasing in X and the lowest possible value for capital F is zero and the highest possible value is one.

50
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,750
So again, it's bounded by zero and one.

51
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:11,000
The CDF is a probability. It's the sum of probabilities and it is also a probability on its own.

52
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:20,210
So it has to be bounded by zero and one. So for example, suppose we spin a coin five times.

53
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:27,050
So capital x is a random variable that will equal the number of heads.

54
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:36,170
So the possible outcomes are that capital x could be zero if you happen to get all tails or one or two or three or four or five.

55
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:49,010
If you have no tails and five heads, it turns out that the probability of getting exactly two heads if you spin a coin five times is just over 31%.

56
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,510
You can go back a couple of slides and calculate that number.

57
00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:03,990
But that that is the probability this CDF of two is the probability that the random variable X is less than or equal to two.

58
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:11,760
That is that you either have zero heads, one head or two heads as opposed to three, four or five.

59
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:22,530
And that probability is a half. We can graph these two functions, the PDF and the CDF, and you'll see a couple of things.

60
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,580
First of all, all these probabilities are bounded by zero and one.

61
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:39,330
The PDF has the six dots that are positive corresponding to values at zero one, two, three, four and five.

62
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,620
But everywhere else, every other possible value of x is zero.

63
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:51,780
That is, you cannot have one and a half heads. You can't have negative three heads has to be there zero one, two, three, four or five.

64
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,840
And the sum of those six probabilities, the PDFs have to sum up to one.

65
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:05,400
So for the CDF, any value that's to the left of zero is going to be zero.

66
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:11,340
And then there's a small probability of getting exactly one head out of five spans.

67
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,780
By the time we get up to two, we're at a half.

68
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:27,100
And then it keeps rising until we get to one. Continuous distributions, the notations a little bit more complicated, unfortunately.

69
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:36,160
And we're going to start this time with the CDF because that's actually well defined and then figure out the PDF from there.

70
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:44,230
And then again I'll show you an example. So the the CDF, the cumulative distribution function is defined in the following way.

71
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:49,780
Capital F of X is the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to some specific value.

72
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:56,740
That's going to be this integral from minus infinity all the way up to x of F of udu.

73
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:02,230
All right. That's possibly not very helpful.

74
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:08,410
As before, the CDF has the same properties as before.

75
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:16,540
It's bounded by zero and one and it's monotonically increasing and it's not strictly monotonically increasing, but monotonically increasing in X.

76
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:29,989
The pdf is the derivative of the CDF with respect to x, so that may or may not be helpful at this point.

77
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,800
I think if you see the example, it'll be a little more useful.

78
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:43,549
There's an interesting thing here, although the second property is if you add up or integrate over all of the PDFs,

79
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:50,740
you still get one that F of little x while it's greater than zero.

80
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,800
Actually the PDF can be bigger than one,

81
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:06,200
and that's for kind of nerdy math reasons that the probability that a random variable lies between two values,

82
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:14,989
let's say A and B actually could be the probability.

83
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,979
Sorry, you put it this way the probability that the random variable lives between two values,

84
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,910
A and B, that is always going to be less than or equal to one.

85
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:32,060
But F of little x actually could be larger than one for at least a few values.

86
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,690
And then if you integrate, you're always going to get a number that's less than one.

87
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:41,300
Okay, let's look at an example that's a little more real world.

88
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,930
Let's look at the standard normal PDF.

89
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:54,079
So this is a continuous function X can take on values that are negative or positive.

90
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:04,100
It's centered around zero. It looks like a bell curve, and in this case it is positive and less than one.

91
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:14,540
Everywhere the shaded areas are above 1.96 or less than -1.96.

92
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:20,300
There's in each of those tails there's two and a half percent of the total area.

93
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:27,140
The normal CDF is the integral of the area under the normal PDF.

94
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:37,120
So since the bell curve is symmetric, half of the areas is negative and half of the area is positive.

95
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:45,940
So the normal CDF when x equals zero F of x is 50%.

96
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:53,640
So the normal CDF is this we call it an S-shaped curve bounded by zero and one.

97
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:01,220
And the slope of this CDF is that is the PDF.

98
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,760
So if you look at those two curves, you can see at the left hand around negative three,

99
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:15,760
the CDF is very close to flat, the slope is close to zero and the corresponding PDF is close to zero.

100
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:30,409
As you move towards x equals zero. It's steepest there and therefore the PDF is at its highest point when the CDF is at its steepest point.

101
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:37,340
And then for x positive, as you keep going to the right, the slope gets flatter and flatters.

102
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:42,320
You go out to the right and therefore the PDF comes down and asymptotically approaches zero.

103
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,330
That's the end of the first part of this lecture.
