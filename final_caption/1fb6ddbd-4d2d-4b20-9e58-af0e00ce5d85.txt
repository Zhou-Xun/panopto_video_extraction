1
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:20,480
Somehow this is like switched around. And so I will we will figure out how to fix it, I hope, but I can't really move it.

2
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,559
And I messed around with this thing and the previous person said she couldn't move it either.

3
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,719
So if I stumble backwards like I don't know what to call it, but I will try to fix like this big for here.

4
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,940
So I. So.

5
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,070
Welcome back, everybody. Thank you for turning in those babies papers.

6
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:51,930
And I will. I'm a little bit overscheduled this week, so I just know I'm not going to get to give feedback on them for a little bit,

7
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,030
but I will try to get them going within the next two weeks and give feedback.

8
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,940
And let's see also thank you for the developmental contacts paper topics.

9
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,739
I, I realize that the I'd like to make like a little, you know, the little word cloudy things around people's topics.

10
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,280
So maybe I'll be able to do that for next time. I was not able to do that this time, but there's a good range.

11
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,900
It's almost it's like interesting to me. It's like data. So change across time to see like what people are interested in.

12
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,659
Okay. So today we're going to talk about early childhood.

13
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:34,860
There is that mini lecture just kind of ticking through all the things around early childhood and like what makes it different from infancy.

14
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:42,479
So, you know, there's certainly these like massive themes of growth and all the different domains that we've already talked about.

15
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,310
And they look really, really different.

16
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,880
And then kind of by the end of this early childhood period, kids sort of just start to look like kids that are not,

17
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,110
you know, like special infant toddler types by the end of this time.

18
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:01,470
So we'll dove into some topics that are particularly relevant for starting at this age.

19
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,250
Well, not even start, but, you know, pop out at this age.

20
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:13,290
And we'll talk a bit about self-regulation, which is something that I study and so have lots of thoughts about.

21
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,940
Hopefully not too many digressions, but it's kind of a core construct at this age.

22
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:26,130
And people like to talk a lot about interventions around self-regulation, like the different ways that we talk about this kind of construct.

23
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,690
And then I want to also make sure to talk about this implicit bias study and sort of

24
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:36,900
teachers roles and how to kind of promote teacher family connection at this age.

25
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,330
We will talk more about, I think someone asked last time about early intervention.

26
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,959
So we have a session on early intervention in like a few weeks.

27
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,630
And so we'll talk more about family like school connection because that's really early intervention.

28
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,950
That's kind of really a place where we talk, where we see that and where it's kind of regulated.

29
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:07,650
Okay. I wanted to get some of your thoughts on that mini lecture and thinking about those milestones over time.

30
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:14,549
Any any reflections on what you guys saw like in the babies film with regard to

31
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,480
these baby film like stops here and then early childhood kind of continues.

32
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,420
Over time. So what did people.

33
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,890
Anything people noticed.

34
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:35,780
Around different domains or things that like kids could do things that kids are thinking about at this at this time at this age.

35
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:43,250
So what I'm saying, early childhood, it's like 3 to 5 year olds. People sometimes actually like email me years later and they're like,

36
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,720
how old are toddlers that I'm like, it's like a rough guide, but, you know, infancy, zero.

37
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,700
And toddlers like one, two, three. Early childhood, 3 to 5, like preschool.

38
00:03:53,900 --> 00:04:00,710
So it's hard and fast, but those are how those like ages are linked to those terms, kind of in the broader literature.

39
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,719
But. So what did you guys think?

40
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,230
Any particular concern? Oh, my gosh.

41
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,090
That's the next door. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

42
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,570
Emily. Oh, I thought it was really interesting. What was the magical thinking?

43
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:24,420
How? Like a tribute. Like an interesting cause.

44
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:32,520
Something that happened to. I think that's always a good one to highlight because remember the girl with conservation and she was

45
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,040
like thinking that the glasses were different quantities even though she witnessed the person pouring.

46
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:43,199
So they're still kind of detached from like our shared reality as adults.

47
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:51,659
And I think that's so important to keep in mind. And magical thinking is one of those examples where like, you know, if a toddler or two year old,

48
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:58,860
three year old is really terrified of monsters under the bed like to that child, they are much more real than they are to us.

49
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,990
And sort of anybody who's like managed a child through those kind of scenarios can relate.

50
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:10,770
It's just a good way to remember like, oh, it's actually their brain, their cognition is not quite there yet.

51
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,040
They can't integrate that yet.

52
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:24,270
So I think that's a good example. And if we think also back to that conservation video,

53
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,260
magical thinking is important to understand when you're working with kids of that age in some

54
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,950
way or designing intervention for for kids of that age or for parents of kids of that age.

55
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:42,840
Other things that people notice from there, from the video in terms of early childhood development.

56
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:58,640
Is that like emotionally or actually? You know, I don't know.

57
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:07,620
Terms of their availability and yeah. Or when they have a meltdown like the initial.

58
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:22,280
Giving them something. You're still kind of grasping those skills.

59
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,300
Like if they get past a certain point of they're upsetting us.

60
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,470
It's really hard to bring them in themselves.

61
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,070
They need those external external regulators.

62
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:42,260
Absolutely. And that's true emotions and eating a lot of us to think about nutrition interventions and eating behavior,

63
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,719
physical activity, like a bunch of the things that we like to intervene with and we think, oh, we want to go early,

64
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,610
we want to intervene early, but like, what do you need to know kind of about that broad,

65
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,120
those broad components of development in those domains of development and how

66
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,109
they interact with each other in order to really effectively intervene early.

67
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:05,780
So I think that's always something to to contemplate other things.

68
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,800
I can certainly chime in as we go through.

69
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:22,900
Jennifer. But I remember from the wall around the age of two.

70
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,460
But like not being able to do a lot of things in my life, helping me frustrated.

71
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:33,010
And I think like I often when I like babysat like that can be really crushing cause I'm just like, you can't do it.

72
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,790
So I'm like, All right, I'd be like, okay, let me help you up now.

73
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,450
Yeah, like that. For them, it's just like, I can do it, but it's like, really not.

74
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,379
They're very limited. Yes. Yeah, that tension. Yes, it is.

75
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,910
It's like a mismatch, right?

76
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:52,810
It's that mismatch of and like you said, sometimes you kind of have to just let them do it and they kind of learn on their own that they can't do it.

77
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,180
And then that's hard as like somebody who's a babysitter or a parent or somebody trying to get a

78
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,620
bunch of kids to do something at the same time because you're like on a timetable and you can't,

79
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,949
you know, wait for them, but you kind of have to wait for them sometimes.

80
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:29,060
So that's a good example of. Yeah. Huh. And the.

81
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,450
Being. Absolutely that what you said about kids don't know.

82
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,790
Kids don't know what's going on and I'm like, super hot, huh?

83
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:06,920
It is kind of our job as their educators or their parents or their interventionists or whatever.

84
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:15,799
If we get to interact with a kid to kind of make those links to the kid and just like I think I probably said, we can talk more about it.

85
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:24,980
But one of the big emotion regulation interventions for adults and for kids is name the emotions that you're feeling.

86
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,810
And if you don't have a name for those emotions, it can be really overwhelming.

87
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,440
You can be like, I just got hit by this loss of emotions like what happens.

88
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:42,860
And for a kid that's happening all the time, or hunger or tiredness or some sort of physiological, regulatory need, that's like going off the rails.

89
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:50,870
And without being able to label that and connect like, Oh, my meltdown right now, and I'm sure we've all had this experience as adults.

90
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,899
You're like, Why am I so crabby?

91
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,910
And you're like, Oh, I didn't sleep or I'm hungry. Like, we kind of have a list of things to like run through.

92
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:06,380
And I will say I do this all the time still with my kids who are now old and I'm like, Are you a little hangry?

93
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,940
Like, is there something going on here? Like, is there some other need that is then?

94
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:16,940
Cause it's like lowering your like level or filter or bar for like flying off the handle.

95
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:22,489
So I think that linking up and that is kind of across different domains, right?

96
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:27,830
Like you can be frustrated, you can't say something and so you get emotionally frustrated, which we're talking about.

97
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,710
And then if you're able to like state what you want, that can kind of reduce the frustration.

98
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:42,139
If you're able to practice adaptive skills as you get your motor behavior more online and your cognition to like,

99
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:46,370
remember, this is how you tie shoes or whatever that skill is this high?

100
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,360
Is it my you know, nobody no kids have zippers but like Velcro things.

101
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,060
So those all really play together.

102
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:59,690
And we also know, I'm sure I said in the lecture and I said in the lecture that the development across these areas can be uneven.

103
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,280
And when you're making great strides in one area, you can have this regression in another area.

104
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:08,410
And I think that's one of those like helpful things to, you know,

105
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,469
remind ourselves and also parents, if we're working with parents and they're like but just,

106
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,400
you know, they were so good and now this, you know, like, well, maybe it's something else is happening.

107
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,379
And you may not see the results of that for a little while, but that's kind of a powerful thing, I think,

108
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:28,250
for parents to like hang on to, you know, somebody with like potty trained and is progressing is a common example.

109
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:35,240
Yeah, I think that's where I was interested in terms of like the self regulation of like emotions.

110
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:43,460
So seeing like the babies video where like the kid bear in Mongolia, like when his brother,

111
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,270
their kid was like hitting you with the blanket like that and versus the other

112
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:55,690
girl would have like a tantrum and it was like rolling around and then go on.

113
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:03,590
And how do you say it? Like I'm. Like he didn't really seem to cry that much at all.

114
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,160
And then when he did, though, he would like go to like one of the mothers.

115
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,549
So it was interesting seeing how it differed.

116
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:16,390
And I was trying to understand, like if it was culturally related or if it was like the state of development,

117
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:22,700
that there was like a society of like independence versus interdependence.

118
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:31,250
I mean, all of the above. Right. So I think that that baby's movie and I think I love that.

119
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,569
I love that movie. And I. I forget I forget all of their exact names.

120
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:42,660
But I love that it does show all those kind of classic moments of, like, toddler meltdown as a good,

121
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:49,070
classic moment, like feeding, you know, these sort of key milestones that all babies kind of progress through.

122
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:56,540
And then thinking about like, how did these bigger kind of cultural layers like get in and shape this child's response in this moment?

123
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,769
And how much does that have to do with the individual child, too, right.

124
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,559
In terms of their temperament and, you know, how they you know,

125
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,430
are they kind of a chill baby or are they like really tightly wound and so that it's going to take them?

126
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,710
But that's like I think I like to show about the baby behavior impacting the parent.

127
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:18,980
How does that play out in these moments when you're kind of faced with the challenge and the baby's going to be?

128
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:28,459
And yeah, I think that there are just a lot of hilarious moments in the movie because they all go through the same things and like, you know,

129
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:38,990
respond differently and have different, I would say, like differently supports for those responses across the different acts that we're watching.

130
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:52,600
Any other observations from babies? No.

131
00:13:53,480 --> 00:14:00,129
Spent a lot of time talking about, like the support around the children and how different that was and how that may have affected.

132
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,290
But it didn't affect, you know what I'm saying?

133
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:09,040
Like, you know, some of the books had like some of the children have, like they've got to go down and do like,

134
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,639
you know, they would go to like these like sing songs and stuff like that.

135
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,150
Mother just kind of burden me. They both developed like, fine, you heard things.

136
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:25,090
I sounds like they don't mean all the like. Of course, passing judgment on either either culture either.

137
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:36,579
But it's just it's been amazing for me to just see all these different cultures and how they all develop, you know, so that there's this,

138
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:42,760
like, sort of train of development that like and I always think about that motor development slide with the red lines.

139
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,830
Like it's just like powering through and like you can shape it in different ways with this diverse study.

140
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:54,040
But at the same time, like it's kind of just on this trajectory, hopefully this great upward trajectory in development.

141
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,769
And of course there can be things that happen that derail that. But I think it is it is really fascinating.

142
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:07,090
Like, do you have like the know hitting book moment, which is sort of just a hilarious thing but at the same.

143
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:43,060
And just kind of noticing like this, like. Like the kind of like eating itself out.

144
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,860
That does come up. And I don't know, you know, again, this is documentary film, you know,

145
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:05,259
but I think they did try to kind of loosely, you know, link the ages that they were showing.

146
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,639
And at each time point.

147
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:17,380
And I think the other the other comment that I think people often have or thought is like when they type a little boy, baby, they have to keep him in.

148
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:26,740
And then he's like crawling on that like rusty bed or whatever people, you know, kind of comment on that, like, you know, safety and I would agree.

149
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,310
But at the same time, like, he's kind of managing his environment reasonably well.

150
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,190
He's got the brother sort of like a lot of sibling conflict going on.

151
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,129
Yeah. Like there's so much around, like, those sibling pieces.

152
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:49,030
And then the the the girl in San Francisco who, like, walks out of a little yoga class, you know, there are just all sorts of moments.

153
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:53,919
And clearly, you know, they're filmmakers, so they're like trying to pull out these these differences.

154
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,420
But I think all of them, you know, clearly happens.

155
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:05,200
And, you know, they they just sort of show the range of environments that were that were kind of exposing kids to.

156
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:13,260
Okay. Okay. So let me kind of dove into a little bit of what we might see.

157
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:22,640
Speaking of kid interaction with each other, this is just sort of a section of dialog from a study about peer play.

158
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:30,770
And I'd like to kind of just go through it because I think we can see a lot of these developmental milestones contributing to how they're talking.

159
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:37,540
And then also think about what kids are kind of getting from this kind of interaction.

160
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,230
So these are three kids who are kind of playing over in a preschool classroom.

161
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,930
And Christopher says, you know, come on, Rainbow Brite. I hear a sound in a dark corner.

162
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:53,000
I think it's a. So there's like invoking a little bit of like magical play, magical thinking.

163
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,700
MOLLY Okay, Starlight. MARGARET You can be rainbows. KITTY Starlight, horsey, come get your food now.

164
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,910
Once more. Now time for bed. Now, horsey, go to sleep.

165
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:11,410
And so I like to point out this one, because clearly this kid has had some sort of like bedtime routine activities right.

166
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:18,770
In their life. Right. So they're sort of saying, like, okay, I'm going to now act what I experienced in my house to start like horsey.

167
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:26,510
And also she's kind of taking control a little bit and assigning roles of, you know, the different things.

168
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:31,550
So maybe, you know, does she have a sibling who's, like, doing that with her in her house?

169
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,989
And Christmas is a trip to Rainbow Brite. Lucky is coming. He's coming in the back of us.

170
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:42,649
He might be scaring us. I think it's also kind of fun here because he's like using some emotion words.

171
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,740
He's like, I'm going to present a big, scary situation, but I'm going to label it.

172
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:51,740
So it's kind of contained and we're going to go through this like fantasy play and make it scary.

173
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,450
And then she says, Don't worry, Starlight. I put the magic trap under the door. Then we'll give him the poison to drink.

174
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:03,080
Don't touch this poison drink. So again, I just feel like there's so much socialization that's like coming out in this dialog.

175
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:09,290
And so they're, like, creating a scary situation. Then they're solving it with this magical thing.

176
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,420
And, you know, also, again, like this is we'll talk next week about, like,

177
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:20,060
injury prevention, but like, that's a good, you know, thing to have to tell your peers.

178
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,510
And then he says it's poison, but I'm afraid of lurking.

179
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:28,249
So, Margaret, like she notice she doesn't come in for a little while and so she, like, comes in with her thing.

180
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:34,280
And it's pretty simple. She's playing her role. And so maybe she's just playing her role or maybe her language isn't, as, you know,

181
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,670
richly developed as these other two kids are, like running the show a little bit.

182
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:46,910
And she says, I'll keep you safe because Rainbow Brite has powers. And that's that really powerful idea of, you know, superheroes, magical thinking,

183
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:52,160
what's big and strong that can, like, keep you safe and says, Yeah, but I got a superpower.

184
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,660
I'm super star. Like, so it changes.

185
00:19:53,660 --> 00:20:00,830
Like it changes the goalposts move the goalposts that are not phrases super stylized never got to sleep for bad twice for bad guys.

186
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:08,720
I kick it with my hind legs, so they're kind of playing out all of these things that we know are developing at this stage.

187
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:15,440
And what I think is so cool is that that's just like a tiny snippet of the many

188
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,190
conversations that kids are hopefully having across the course of their day.

189
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:25,070
And the other thing is that, like, they don't like they do maybe have some,

190
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:29,870
you know, toys or something with them, but they wouldn't necessarily need to.

191
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:34,879
Like, it's a very imaginative conversation. Um, what else?

192
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:47,200
What else do you guys notice about that? Any other fun? Do you think these kids know each other?

193
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:05,540
Day Care Center, but. Feels like there's aren't they're not with a parent or with a teacher.

194
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:09,580
Right. Feels like they're just kind of like having their own chit chat over here.

195
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:15,260
Like there's not an adult interfering, if you will, with the conversation.

196
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,190
They do kind of share like shared worlds a little bit.

197
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,040
So here, like these are old, you know, cultural pop culture things, Rainbow Brite.

198
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:35,329
Maybe it's having a come back. I don't know. Um, but, you know, like, you can see, that's really fascinating.

199
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,230
People who study like language development.

200
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:43,910
Now there's we'll talk a little bit more about these like voice recorders you can give to to families to sort of enhance.

201
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:50,960
The idea is like if you're recording the things that you're saying, you're going to talk more and have more exchanges of conversation.

202
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,860
But it's really interesting to see like the specifics of what comes up.

203
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,650
And they do they kind of have the shared world.

204
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:05,720
So I would argue that this kind of conversation that we know that this kind of conversation also helps,

205
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:12,800
like with perspective taking in terms of what other kids might be thinking or feeling and wanting to be.

206
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:24,349
And this is sort of an example of why peer play and peer interactions in that kind of loosely structured way can be so rich and really,

207
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:30,319
really important for development. So not only language, but like that social.

208
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:37,010
So that social cognition perspective taking as well as emotion regulation.

209
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,870
So like you might be scaring us.

210
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:49,010
We have a language and then we have these like ways of coping with something scary as well as bedtime routines, which I just love that that comes out.

211
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,740
Okay. So I, that's okay.

212
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,890
I think that's a good example of just also kind of getting into the kid's brain.

213
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:12,170
So we've talked about temperament a number of times already, certainly with infancy and temperament.

214
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:21,470
Is this construct that sort of sticks with you across life basically is like becomes personality in the psychology literature.

215
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:28,910
And if you think about these different kinds of temperaments, we've talked already a fair bit about negative emotionality.

216
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:35,990
Effortful control is really what is kind of the core of what we think of as self-regulation.

217
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,190
So how much can you control your behavior in the context of something tempting that you are?

218
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,050
Have you ever been told you can't touch you know you're not supposed to touch or something like that?

219
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:54,139
So it's a very much it's like this push, pull and want something.

220
00:23:54,140 --> 00:24:01,130
And yet I'm going to inhibit my behavior, my thoughts, like I'm not going to think about it, so I don't want to touch it.

221
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,270
I'm going to like sit on my hands. I don't want to touch it. That's all effortful control.

222
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:12,980
And then this negative emotionality, just like how, you know, how how are you wired as a person and what this looks like in early childhood,

223
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:21,980
you know, a little bit different from infancy because they're older and they can say things like, I'm scared versus like having a big cry.

224
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:29,060
And sometimes they have a big tantrum, temper tantrum. But you can really this is like a really active place for.

225
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:39,020
Seen regulation practicing, talking about strategies to make ourselves feel better and talk about calming our bodies down.

226
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:46,299
So anybody who's worked with like little kids and any of these kind of preschool classrooms or intervention type programs,

227
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:51,610
we talk a lot about this aspect of your temperament, our emotion, regulation.

228
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:59,379
And if you think about it, it's really important. And there's research to back this up from some as reviewed in that mental health piece.

229
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,160
But like managing, like everybody has negative emotions.

230
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,470
Sometimes it's just a part of the human condition.

231
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:11,650
Kids who tend to have more negative emotions or like have sort of a temperament that's like amped up.

232
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,879
They need to kind of learn either earlier or better or more frequent use of emotion regulation,

233
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,140
strategies to sort of be able to cope with, you know, the vagaries of life.

234
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:34,450
Um, kids who tend to, um, you know, have just an easy disposition, you know, they're engaged, they're social,

235
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,150
they're verbal skills, possibly are pretty good so that they can chit chat with adults more easily.

236
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:45,040
Those are sort of this idea of peers, this idea of more positive emotionality.

237
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,879
So you can kind of see how these like temperament features are like growing up and

238
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,940
how they can impact an interaction like the one we just saw or read among kids.

239
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:05,420
Those are good to keep in mind. I would say, you know, I'm presenting it as temperament.

240
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,910
But of course, all kids have all of these, right?

241
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:16,370
They just kind of have different amounts of each one. And that particular combination is kind of what can be a struggle.

242
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:26,540
And the other thing, the way one one way to think about it, that we at my post-doc and I were working on a lot of papers on this for a while.

243
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,929
And I'm really trying to think about reactivity.

244
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:36,650
That's like how much positive emotionality, how much negative emotionality, how much effortful control like, you know, is sort of do you have.

245
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:43,429
And then regulation is like what happens when the contents of your cup are sort of shaken or challenged?

246
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:51,890
And how many of you guys, well, before listening to the little radio piece, had heard of that marshmallow task?

247
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,140
Yeah, a lot of some nods. Yeah. Yeah.

248
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:03,860
So what did you guys think about what do you think about the marshmallow task in general after listening to that radio piece?

249
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:13,980
What's your take? Full disclosure, I totally have used the personal attacks and a lot of my research.

250
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:33,000
I have a lot of critiques about it. So friend of mine. When they spoke about the trust for the parents, like following through with what they said.

251
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,330
Usually I forget. For a country, whatever that they were looking at in comparison.

252
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,319
You should know that your parents are reliable. You can trust them.

253
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,000
And so you're going to wait because you know that the reward is going to be better.

254
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:03,970
Yeah, definitely like your what's your lived experience and how does that play out when like we're, you know,

255
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:09,540
seeking your comfort when you're like, we're putting you under this condition of waiting, which is challenging for all of us.

256
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,430
Also, I think they talked about trust in the examiner, too.

257
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:23,570
That's a way you can actually if you're doing this, the study you want to put in, the marshmallow task in your study,

258
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:31,470
have to think about like who the examiner who is telling the kid to wait is that a trusted person is a stranger.

259
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,059
Remember back to like the strange situation, like how do we set up that interaction?

260
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:40,230
And that can really shape how the child responds in the interaction.

261
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:48,720
There's lots. Just like the marshmallow itself.

262
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:04,670
With a different culture than. You know, I think it was I think it was a marshmallow, whatever it was.

263
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:14,650
Yeah. I was just wondering, like, I wonder how. Yeah.

264
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:23,010
Well, especially around this construct that like people love.

265
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:29,990
People are like, Oh, this is it. Right. People are very, very interested in this area of research.

266
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:36,040
And absolutely right. A marshmallow. No one can vary on that.

267
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:42,400
I have used this task in eating behavior studies and we totally obsess on what the food is.

268
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:46,510
We ask the parents of the child, have the food before. Do they like the food?

269
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:53,950
We've administered this this task in like preschool settings and settings where like you don't have an adult,

270
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:59,500
you know, because the kid is supposed to be waiting by themselves. And so we've done it with Eminem's.

271
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:04,359
And we always have this, you know, stressful conversation, like, are they going to choke on Eminem?

272
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:09,850
How little do they need to be, you know? So, like to think about doing this with an infant or a toddler.

273
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:15,340
A, do they have the cognitive skills to kind of understand the goal of waiting?

274
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:22,650
BE Are they going to choke on the Eminem? First made in facilities that have not.

275
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:28,889
So we've also done Skittles. We've had like many hour long conversations like are Skittles and Eminem's comparable.

276
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:34,980
So we did. So you can really go down the rabbit hole in the task and we've tried to do it.

277
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,910
I think the youngest we were able to do it was was like 30 month olds.

278
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,930
And we just basically everybody immediately touches it.

279
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:52,110
But you can do a version of tasks that that tap into this idea with like 24 month olds, but you have to really structure it tightly.

280
00:30:55,340 --> 00:31:05,840
Another thing that I always like to mention is that with regard to like this question of like how long can you wait for me with.

281
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:15,310
Of this task kind of came about 40, 50 years ago.

282
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:25,920
We see this idea of like waiting for the treat, like delaying gratification as something that's really good, really desirable.

283
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:29,480
Like in our culture, we have to wait for lots of things.

284
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:33,280
We have to work hard before we get like the payoff, right? That's part of this construct.

285
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:41,980
But what we've seen in more recent research, which I think is really fascinating, is that kids who are growing up in environments where,

286
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:49,450
like Emily had said, that the parents were were so trustworthy in the Cameroon example that they were going to get the treat no matter what.

287
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:55,840
So the kids waited. But if you can imagine kids who are growing up in a condition of scarcity,

288
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:03,040
like food insecurity or other situations where they're not necessarily reliably have the experience that they get the treat,

289
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:09,729
if they wait, then I would argue like it's not very adaptive to wait in that circumstance, right?

290
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:15,280
The kid might be like, You're giving me a treat. And yeah, that's great things, you know, like, why would I wait?

291
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:20,920
Because my lived experience has been when I wait, it goes away, you know?

292
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:26,230
And so there's some really interesting research that's coming out that sort of shows.

293
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:37,690
It's like kids who are growing up in an environment of scarcity if they don't wait in the task for those kids who don't wait in the task,

294
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:44,769
they actually look much better on these kind of outcomes that we typically associate with waiting on the task like emotion,

295
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:48,010
regulation, mental health outcomes, achievement, that kind of thing,

296
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:56,740
because they are adapted to their context of not waiting for this, you know, marshmallow or whatever treat it is.

297
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,170
So it's very complicated,

298
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:04,330
but I like to sort of harp on this task a little bit because you hear about it all the time and you hear about it like in the media.

299
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:10,360
You hear about it getting debunked. You hear about it like, Oh, it predicts everything because it's from the original study,

300
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:17,259
which if people don't know and I think it did say the radio thing, but it was done with kids of like Stanford professors.

301
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:27,579
And it's data or studies from that dataset have been linked to like brain MRI functioning.

302
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:38,110
When kids are when kids are 45 years old, for example, obesity rates in adults who waited or didn't wait, salaries, S.A.T. scores.

303
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:43,060
So like all these things have been linked to the kids performance in that original study.

304
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,570
And it was a very unique population of kids. And yeah.

305
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:50,860
What? Yeah. Oh, I think so many things.

306
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:15,790
Yeah. Like when you're. Well, like. There's a lot of intervening processes and a lot of other factors.

307
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:28,910
So I totally agree. At the same time,

308
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:38,180
like thinking about early childhood and this idea of like what is happening in early childhood that could set the stage and why might that

309
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:47,380
set the stage for these later kind of achievements and stick to itiveness or whatever we want to talk about in adults and and think.

310
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:52,780
Hold that thought. Everybody should hold that thought, too, over thinking about early education,

311
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:58,160
early childhood education and child care, because it comes up again like what people really want.

312
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:03,229
Like as in so many things in public health and everywhere. Like people want like a magic solution.

313
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:10,580
And that's like saying, Oh, if we just do this and we inoculate our kids in their effort for control when they're little,

314
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:15,890
we, like teach them how to wait for the marshmallow. Then they'll be all really successful adults.

315
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:21,200
And I think we would all agree, like there's a lot of other stuff that has to happen between there.

316
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:27,830
But I would say like there's some things you can pick up in early childhood, particularly for kids who are kind of on the extremes,

317
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:32,840
like on the extremes of positive emotionality, on the extremes of negative emotionality.

318
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:38,659
Those things do kind of carry forward through life, like the little kid who's like, you know,

319
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:44,389
the president of the preschool is probably going to go out and be like pretty outgoing and social and extroverted and get all these,

320
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:48,470
like, kind of accumulated rewards from having that kind of personality over time.

321
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,580
But so that's balanced with, you know, the other things that happen in their life.

322
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:57,860
And so this construct does come up so much under lots of different names.

323
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:02,000
And delayed gratification is kind of a big the big one.

324
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:09,560
But I just I think it is really important to just bring it up as a so why you know,

325
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:14,900
why would this matter and sort of issues with the experiment that's cited all the time?

326
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:21,560
Yeah, exactly. I was also thinking about kind of like the negative behaviors that could be coming from,

327
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,840
especially with like kind of there's a lot of talk about using food as rewards.

328
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:36,260
And also you familiar with the area of like also like alcohol or anything else for that matter.

329
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:42,140
And essentially, I mean, at such a young age that you can like assign a value,

330
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:51,260
but then thinking about how time can also increase or decrease the value of like that reward and understanding that.

331
00:36:51,260 --> 00:37:00,890
But I remember like with food sometimes it by if you're in a restriction mentality, by the time you do it, you might end up overindulging.

332
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,920
And so it could be training a potentially unhealthy behavior.

333
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,610
Yes. Well, yeah, 100%.

334
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,659
And if people are familiar, this is like really going down the rabbit hole and then I'll I'll move on.

335
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:22,760
But the construct of delayed discounting, if people are familiar with that, comes from psychology and people.

336
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:30,080
I always kind of struggle with it because I have to think about it like 15 minutes before I can say which direction the right the right way is,

337
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:40,070
but it has to do with that time element. So it's like, how far in the future am I going to wait to receive this amount of money?

338
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:44,540
And how much is that like money valuable to me the longer that I wait.

339
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:53,090
Basically it's sort of this idea of like being future oriented and like putting all your eggs in the future basket versus like having some reward now.

340
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:58,490
And I think that the potential danger, like you said, is that putting all your eggs in the future basket.

341
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:07,200
Sure. In some ways that way. Can that lead to other other concern?

342
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:35,349
Attica. And if you like, don't. Uh, and that yeah, that very first comment about like how trusting are your, you know, is your lived experience.

343
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,500
That's that idea of like relational health, right?

344
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:45,760
Like you have this sort of trust and relationship with your caregiver and that can set you up to expect a world that is good and trusting,

345
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:53,319
which, you know, that can be a challenge in itself. But this idea of balancing our reward,

346
00:38:53,320 --> 00:39:00,250
seeking ness with our like effortful control and figuring out how to live with that balance, I think is really important.

347
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:04,509
So we'll I'm happy to have you to talk more about that too.

348
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:11,889
But, um, okay, so again, this is kind of like the why we care about this measure.

349
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:19,780
And this is not only found in like that Stanford kids study, but it has been replicated in many times in many different studies.

350
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:24,159
And so this idea of in that preschool setting.

351
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,190
So I remember their conversation about like Rainbow Brite and Starlight they were taking.

352
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:35,169
They were, you know, talking a little bit about emotion regulation.

353
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:41,499
And so these skills, I don't mean to like present the marshmallow task and then say like, it's useless.

354
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:46,149
Don't think about effortful control at all. Like, effortful control is actually something we all use every day.

355
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:49,930
Like, you guys now have effortful control that you're, like, sitting in and not, like, looking around, right?

356
00:39:51,040 --> 00:40:00,189
And and not preschoolers, but why we think it is important to some degree, again, like more or less for different kids or different situations,

357
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:06,250
is that it has been also associated with lots of different things in early childhood functioning.

358
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:10,600
I think this question of why we'll get back to as well.

359
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:19,570
But, you know, if you think about social relationships, for example, in preschool, a big theme of social relationships.

360
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:24,740
And certainly conflict is like sharing, not sharing limited resources.

361
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:30,910
Right. Like there's a whole thing of blocks that there's only certain blocks that are, like, really cool that everybody wants.

362
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:35,110
So you have to kind of wait your turn, you know, share with others.

363
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:40,750
All of that is delayed gratification and effortful control to not, like grab the block out of somebody else.

364
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:48,670
But it's just sort of what we what we tend to socialize around a lot in the preschool time.

365
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,180
And that's why it's a really important construct in this at this point.

366
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,360
Okay. Oh. Features of the preschool context.

367
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:04,520
Just a click through. Definitely.

368
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:10,880
It's a huge take for kids and for families as well.

369
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,650
Preschool. Sort of a little bit like kids.

370
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:24,500
A little bit unlike sort of infant care or daycare. There's many more kids typically per adult in the preschool setting,

371
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:30,800
and a big focus of preschool in part to sort of support self-regulation and make the day run smoothly,

372
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:35,960
is that there's a big focus on routines like expectations for your behavior.

373
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:43,970
Here's how we can all get along in a group because it's like 17 preschoolers and lead teacher and assistant teacher, for example.

374
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,830
So that's a lot of little bodies for a few adults to manage.

375
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:53,900
And so kids need to sort of master these things in the preschool context.

376
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,640
The other thing they have, they have new peers, role models.

377
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:05,810
So that idea, that dialog these kids are learning from each other and the teacher is a new authority figure, not a parent.

378
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:13,549
And then the other thing, which is wonderful and not always true, but often true,

379
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:18,140
is that we have kids and teachers from different backgrounds and kids from different backgrounds with in the classroom.

380
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:26,180
And so I would say, like, to kind of summarize like those preschool classroom settings like big family transition.

381
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,380
Exciting. But they can definitely pose a lot of challenges.

382
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:35,930
And so that idea of like parents experiencing like regression and frustration with their kids,

383
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:43,969
if the child has started preschool or any other kind of big transition that in this case preschool, it can be really tiring.

384
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:47,209
Right. We hear that phrase all the time with preschool is, oh, you're going to be a big boy.

385
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:49,800
You can be a big girl. You're going to, you know, go in the party.

386
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,400
You're you're going to put your stuff away or can you get your shoes off, all of that kind of stuff.

387
00:42:54,410 --> 00:43:02,840
It's like really tiring, right? And it's really exhausting to be a preschooler and like to be have your behavior structured like that all day long.

388
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:09,560
And it kind of needs to be functionally because we have this big classroom of kids and we can't have everybody

389
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,850
putting their shoes on at different times all day because and all you would do would be put their shoes on,

390
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:20,659
especially like Michigan winter. Right. It only takes like 20 minutes for like three year olds to put their all their

391
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,020
jackets on and their boots on and get outside and have like 5 minutes outside.

392
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:27,620
And you come back and, you know, it's a lot, but it can be really,

393
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:35,570
really tiring at this age and also put the sibling point in there because new siblings you have like your your leading edge kid.

394
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:42,620
So three year old or four year old, there's often some baby at home and that baby is getting to stay home.

395
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:48,259
Maybe at least with the parents, they don't have to go to preschool if they're having a hard time at preschool.

396
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:55,010
And so a lot of those like sibling dynamics can come into play around this age because it's just a really common time to have a sibling.

397
00:43:56,390 --> 00:44:01,040
Um, and so I love the preschool age,

398
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:10,450
but I think it's also just a really important time to kind of connect families because it's also that sort of start of like formal schooling.

399
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:16,700
It used to not be really, but I think now it really is considered a bit more of the start of formal schooling.

400
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,170
Well. As well as like younger, younger daycare.

401
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:38,459
Hey, one other thing to say just about preschool is that this is a time period where kids can come in anyway from any any age,

402
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:43,290
from age three to like kind of up to age six, because we have these young fives programs.

403
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:50,460
So this is a multiyear span and kids like maybe with the same teacher, they may not be with the same teacher.

404
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:54,900
Classrooms vary in terms of whether they're all three year olds or like a mix of three and four year olds.

405
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:02,760
And as we saw in that like early childhood lecture, that's kind of a big gap, a big span in terms of what they're able to do.

406
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,969
And so there's different research out there.

407
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:13,380
But usually the advice is to have like a mixed age classroom, at least for part of the day, because all that peer learning can happen.

408
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:21,569
So remember the little the kid who made like the one statement being the cat, maybe she was three and the other kid sounded more like four year olds.

409
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:25,290
They were like chatting and had like lots of different imaginary worlds going on.

410
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:30,360
And so she's going to be learning from those kids if she's in a big stage classroom.

411
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,730
Okay. Not a preschool classroom.

412
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:45,070
It is fascinating. The. I've been lucky to be able to do that.

413
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:49,719
Like for large chunks of, like training time and research time.

414
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,530
So it's just just kind of like, puts things in perspective, you know?

415
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:59,530
Anyway, um, so what did you guys think about this, this article?

416
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:10,540
This is like, you remember the those the black and white little drawing one about parent stress and executive function.

417
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,680
This is that same group. It's the Center for the Developing Child based at Harvard.

418
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,820
And I recommend their stuff a lot because I think it's very accessible.

419
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:22,240
It's very like good cutting edge science.

420
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:29,620
And I think they work hard to make good like communicate communication translation materials.

421
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:34,180
And so just, you know, bookmark that site.

422
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:45,010
We're. But some people you're working with, colleagues, etc., in your future lives need to know anything about child development stuff.

423
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,910
But so in terms of just reading, what did people what did people think?

424
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:56,260
What did you think about the either that what we know about science.

425
00:46:56,590 --> 00:47:04,810
Did you feel like you knew all those things were from science? I think there's that and then common misperceptions and talk about medication.

426
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:22,380
Yeah. I think.

427
00:47:47,900 --> 00:48:01,520
Increased medications that we're giving because. You know, that's like my personal.

428
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:16,470
So you've mentioned a few reasons why we might. Right. So I've mentioned that I've described this like kind of busy classroom setting.

429
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:21,240
People vary in their self-regulation and kind of ability to cope with that setting.

430
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:33,629
Was anybody surprised by that, those sort of medication numbers or aware that kids could be medicated at this young age?

431
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:37,200
Like you said, that might be a reason for.

432
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:43,380
It's to be medicated. Yeah. Well, that's like.

433
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:52,500
Ask me about that specific. But there was I think they said they're being scrubbed off a little bit, that there were no clinical trials.

434
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:59,069
The testing is out in children. And like my future, I guess, factory.

435
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:05,620
Really interesting. I want to go to my sense of thinking about how that could impact their physical health later down the road.

436
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:15,550
If their brain chemistry is being altered by these medications so young and in medications and most likely doses that are meant for older people.

437
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:20,410
I was thinking that, but it's really a lot.

438
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:27,760
And you think about just like the things that I kind of outlined in that lecture, like here's the rapid trajectory of brain development,

439
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:34,330
physical development, motor development, lots of different streams of development happening so rapidly.

440
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:45,690
And to, you know, be giving medications that we don't totally understand the long term implications of is concerned.

441
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:53,470
Yeah, I just had a question. It sounds like there's a graph or a table.

442
00:49:54,610 --> 00:50:00,450
I guess it's a graph in this meeting and it says mental health problems can occur across childhood.

443
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:10,020
And it shows that I mean. Like two or 3% of age, 2 to 5 year olds experience depression.

444
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,660
And that surprises me.

445
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:21,630
And I'm kind of just wondering, like, how do you even assess for that in a child so young and know that, oh, yeah, this child is clinically depressed?

446
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:26,100
Mm hmm. Yeah, it's a great question. It is controversial a little bit,

447
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:35,220
but there are studies that have done that in sort of a different way than we assess clinical depression symptoms in adults.

448
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:40,650
One main way that's different is that for clinical depression assessment in adults,

449
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,610
you kind of focus like we were just talking about future oriented thinking.

450
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:50,100
So you focus on like, do you have a sense that things will get better in the future?

451
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:55,139
So and people with depression often say like, no, it's not going to get better and it's going to be stable.

452
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:59,670
It's going to be this way forever for little kids because they don't have that cognitive capacity.

453
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:07,320
That's not like a criterion that we consider. But there are things like sad, depressed affects with.

454
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:14,030
Sleep is another difficult thing to map on because of little good sleep.

455
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:19,459
But those sort of like they don't take joy which to think about.

456
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:24,140
A 2 to 5 year old who doesn't find joy in something is really, really hard to think about.

457
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:25,220
I totally agree.

458
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:36,860
And there's a woman named John Luby, a Y, who she has really led the research in this area because it's really a controversial concept.

459
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:44,000
Like, how can kids that level have depression? And I would say it's kind of not how we think about it, but you could in grown ups.

460
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:50,090
But you can certainly track certain things that are present, even even in young kids.

461
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:58,850
And I will say to you, it often is co-occurring with either a parental, significant parent history or sort of early life trauma.

462
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:07,860
And that's sort of when we see that for sure. If people just sort speaking medication.

463
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:15,120
This is with adolescents. But there is a New York Times series that came out just in the summer that's pretty interesting in terms of

464
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:23,640
sort of medication and like off label use and I would say like rampant prescribing of different medications.

465
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:31,049
And people are interested in really good series. One thing to think about in terms of really any medication,

466
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:37,620
but certainly psychiatric medications is that they change a lot and they, you know, we want them to get better.

467
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:46,109
And so we, you know, have different formulations or we learn something that's not great about a first line type of, you know, older, older medication.

468
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:47,310
And so we start doing this new one.

469
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:54,810
But when we're trying out little kids, even, you know, ten years ago we were using different medications and little kids.

470
00:52:55,290 --> 00:53:03,270
And so we don't know when we're prescribing the new medications, what those long term impacts are, because studies just haven't.

471
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:12,810
Okay. I guess I was like, I didn't get from this article.

472
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:16,900
I was trying to understand what was the process of prescribing something off label.

473
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:24,850
I'm like, There hasn't because I'm like, I know pharmaceutical industry do massive amounts of clinical data for a long time.

474
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:32,800
Yeah. Whether it's children or not. So if the doctors prescribing something like how does how does that even happen?

475
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:37,650
And then how does it even get covered by insurance? But.

476
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:48,010
That I would definitely ask those questions to people who are like deeply, deeply informed in all those processes.

477
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:55,060
What I will say, though, is that this is not like run of the mill, right?

478
00:53:55,090 --> 00:54:00,639
Like people aren't taking this lightly, I would say, in terms of prescribing to young kids.

479
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,930
And it's usually in a situation that's like pretty.

480
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:11,139
The desperate from the parents, like my four year old,

481
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:16,540
is routinely like flinging the car door open and trying to jump out of the car and I cannot restrain him.

482
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:21,490
So it's not that parents are like, Oh, my kid seems a little off.

483
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:25,270
Can I get medication? Like, that is not happening.

484
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:36,030
But I would argue it is. Probably too frequent and that it has to be monitored really carefully.

485
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:48,299
But families who are. Hesitating because like, there are other reasons why people get prescribed medications that we can delve into.

486
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,810
But it's not it's not something that one would do.

487
00:54:51,840 --> 00:55:03,730
Like at the drop of a hat. Right. It's definitely driven by pretty severe concerns, behavioral disorders, that kind of thing.

488
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,540
We were just talking about depression.

489
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:16,230
One thing to note here in terms of mental health and early childhood, we saw the seeds of depression or anxiety in little kids,

490
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,610
but it's often a lot harder to detect than what we call that's sort of more like

491
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:24,780
this internalizing type of behavior and what we call externalizing behavior,

492
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:32,639
which is like disregulated behavior, excessive anger, you know, impulsivity, throwing chairs, that kind of thing.

493
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,760
It's like much more easy for teachers certainly to detect.

494
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:41,520
And families then, like this kid is sad, kind of over in the corner and they don't have friends.

495
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:49,870
Schooler's that sort of internalizing behavior if they're not socially engaged,

496
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:56,410
that is kind of a red flag because that, you know, especially in early preschool, they're just kind of learning.

497
00:55:56,410 --> 00:56:04,230
But really by the end of preschool, they should be able to have, you know, kids who they name as friends that they know and they're.

498
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:11,520
But. The school behavior is that kids who don't have any friends in the preschool,

499
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:19,350
in their preschool group that is associated with more loneliness and more depression kind of later on.

500
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,120
So the longitudinal studies have looked at that,

501
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:27,509
have sort of picked out those behavioral features of these child early childhood mental health indicators.

502
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:43,229
I would say. Else aside from the medication, I think we've talked about a number of the different things that they references,

503
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:48,660
protective factors, which is also I kind of like this piece that's like, oh yeah, what did we say was important?

504
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,560
Like a lot of it's in here. Yeah.

505
00:56:54,930 --> 00:57:01,140
But they talked about how kids just don't forget their experiences, like they could go through something really early in their life and.

506
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:07,750
You know, they don't know and how that. Okay.

507
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:13,600
Parents and family members will. It's happened to me and I turned out okay in your life.

508
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:28,600
Oh, yeah, but. But. It's such a powerful moment.

509
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:31,689
It's such a powerful kind of counter argument, like, look at me, I'm fine.

510
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:37,920
And that that'll happen. That a lot of things can be fine.

511
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:50,010
We're going to acknowledge that those early experiences and that so that sort of trauma things like the body keeps the score the body remembers.

512
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:55,740
And back to that idea of linking what you're feeling with like emotion words.

513
00:57:56,190 --> 00:58:02,459
That's why that's so powerful, because your body can be like remembering something triggered by something.

514
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:11,590
And if you can, like, name that. Sort of a way to help manage it and get your arms around it and control it.

515
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:15,190
So. The. Um.

516
00:58:15,590 --> 00:59:01,090
Yeah. I. Based on.

517
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:24,240
And they're trying to fit into a context that there's that priest with that busy preschool classroom environment, like I was saying.

518
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:57,130
And it's a challenge. Right. And we'll. So I think that when we talk about early classroom based, early childhood classroom based interventions,

519
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:02,950
that's such an important point to hold on to because thinking from a public health frame,

520
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:13,180
what can we do at a broad level for most kids to to to, you know, infuse our messaging and reach a broad swath of people?

521
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:21,070
Right. And I think it's important to hang on to and that's why I often harp on the kids vary and kids are not all you know the.

522
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:30,190
Events are also really important to keep in mind as well as whatever context is going on that they're trying to fit into or be a part of.

523
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:32,940
And so absolutely, I think that's important.

524
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:42,570
And we'll also get into a little bit of that and making things more inclusive in early childhood intervention.

525
01:01:42,600 --> 01:02:32,280
Early intervention. Looking like not on track.

526
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:36,130
And that's. It's kind of potential.

527
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:44,139
Right. And that's it's it's like you said all this comment,

528
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:54,370
because I think that that variation is what makes it so hard sometimes to think about policy in early childhood.

529
01:02:55,060 --> 01:03:04,629
And it's why it's also so important to think about what families need and what that individual family child context fits in this time,

530
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:10,210
because development is so varied and has a lot to do, like the, the,

531
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:15,819
the policy piece has a lot to do with like identifying where something is going wrong.

532
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:24,150
Maybe with a child then. So like medication, language development, motor development, you know, family functioning.

533
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:29,219
Like, where do we need to think about this sentence? And then again, from that public health frame, like,

534
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:35,190
how do we take it big and reach a lot of kids and how do we make sure our policies that we might recommend?

535
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:49,549
I. Intervention. I want to make sure that I feel like this actually leads right in that we talk about this

536
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:55,510
culture of bias stuff because I gave that Gilliam reading and they've done some pieces.

537
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:59,030
We've talked a bit about self-control and when is this helpful?

538
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:01,430
Is it always helpful? We're talking about that in the beginning.

539
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:13,040
And this idea of like, why is it important to consider how culture of socialization, individual child factors as well can shape child responses again?

540
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:16,969
And I always like to just show this picture because it's it's a busy environment and this

541
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:20,910
is kind of a call environment like everybody is like sitting criss cross applesauce on are,

542
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:28,490
you know, little spots on the rug, but it reflects like so much demands to kind of get to the preschool day.

543
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:37,580
And so if a child is not having that, it can kind of start to disrupt the classroom.

544
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:42,530
Right. And that's when a teacher is like, oh, my, is going off the rails, I need to do something.

545
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:51,290
And so this preschool expulsion study, like when it first came out, people, it made like a big splash.

546
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:55,760
People were like, oh, kids are being expelled from preschool. What's going on?

547
01:04:56,300 --> 01:05:05,030
And it's kind of like along the lines of the medication discussion a little bit because it's like, well, you know,

548
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:11,750
what are we what expectations are we kind of putting on preschoolers and are they going to sit criss cross applesauce all day?

549
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:17,540
That's a physical impossibility. You know, for them to do this is a physical impossibility.

550
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:22,160
Right. So what are our expectations in that classroom environment?

551
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:25,220
How are those expectations formed?

552
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:31,790
And I think a really big important question here, too, we'll talk more about is like who are the teachers who are setting those expectations?

553
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:36,050
What backgrounds are they from, what kinds of experiences that they had before?

554
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:47,930
And so I think all of these things really come into play. And what happens in that preschool context with a teacher who's like this child, you know,

555
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:54,950
it's often like this high energy child is, you know, making the day not run smoothly.

556
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:58,249
And I need support. But it's not often phrased as I need support.

557
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:03,200
It's often phrased as this kid's got to get out of my classroom because I'm disrupting the classroom, right?

558
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:09,470
And so there's a whole like preschool mental health consultation type of intervention, which is.

559
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:15,690
And to support teachers to manage all students.

560
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:21,880
And if they need extra support to manage their students, that is where that comes in.

561
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,200
So it's like a teacher's support.

562
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:30,540
So I think that I think of that as in this in this context, a little bit more public healthy because it's working like from a teacher perspective,

563
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:33,810
teacher kind of education as opposed to with individual children.

564
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:44,640
Okay. And so what happens if preschoolers are suspended? Joe brought up the labeling like absolutely like kids can a miss out on preschool experience.

565
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:50,999
Maybe it wasn't going great for them. Maybe they need a different kind of experience, but they're missing out on all that socialization.

566
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:58,680
Rainbow Brite. It also disrupts the family because if you're like, Oh, great, my child's now in preschool, I can go to work.

567
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:05,940
Like, if they're not allowed to come to preschool, that's problematic as well as kind of bias and labeling going forward.

568
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:15,690
And so I want to just click through this study. And this was again, this is kind of made big headlines when it came out.

569
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:20,750
And basically what they did is that they had kid actors.

570
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:25,979
So again, I would argue these are the kind of self-regulated kids to be able to be kid actors in a study.

571
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:34,830
But and the teachers who are like experienced teachers at preschool teachers were told to watch for the challenging behavior.

572
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:44,070
But the key was that these guys just played with the Play-Doh and like cut, you know, a little Play-Doh and just did their thing at the table.

573
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:49,650
And teachers reviewed little clips and watched for challenging behavior.

574
01:07:49,770 --> 01:07:53,520
Okay, so here's who they watched.

575
01:07:55,310 --> 01:08:01,050
And they worded or supported self-reported that they watched.

576
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:03,410
So here's the kids know challenging behavior.

577
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:14,050
Just watched the models they use like eye tracking equipment to basically track where teachers were looking during these 32nd videos.

578
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:16,280
And that's when all those those were like the eye tracking data.

579
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:26,210
But teachers kind of, you know, admitted I was watching the boys more for the challenging behavior and I was watching the black boys the most.

580
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:32,450
Right. And so, again, thinking about like how these bigger social context factors get in.

581
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:43,969
Those are in the teachers. And thinking about who you're watching for challenging behavior, even if there's no challenging behavior.

582
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:46,070
They said they saw challenging behavior. Right.

583
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:54,680
So how that teacher bias is getting in and, you know, making them think about the kids in their classroom.

584
01:08:54,800 --> 01:09:00,880
And so what can we do about this from a. Teacher training, teacher support type.

585
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:04,480
I would say like intervention and.

586
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:12,819
The other thing that's interesting in this study, so they've done a few different versions of this, but the teachers,

587
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:19,140
the black teachers were actually more likely to watch the black boys than the white teachers, which is also an interesting finding.

588
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:24,220
They're like, oh, my gosh, there's like so much to be done here and so much we can think about here.

589
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:30,410
It's such a formative early experience. And the other reason I,

590
01:09:30,610 --> 01:09:39,610
I talk so much about preschool is that we'll talk much more about Headstart and early childhood education and intervene as an intervention context.

591
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:49,750
But I think this is critical, right? If we're going to recommend early childhood education is great, we don't want to think of it as like a panacea.

592
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:52,969
Like self-regulation is great. It's going to solve everything.

593
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:58,270
Right. There's a lot of dynamics when you think about in the early childhood education context as well.

594
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,810
And so I know this is a lot of info on the slide and I'll put the slides up.

595
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:14,500
But one of the things that I think has emerged from this study in a good way is thinking about this preschool context and what kind of,

596
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:17,590
you know, like anti-racist bias training we can do.

597
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:25,930
I think we know that we don't know yet how to solve this problem.

598
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:35,320
But at least in the discussion in early childhood contexts, which again, like if you think about the ways I was describing preschools,

599
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:39,490
kids meeting kids from different backgrounds, kids and teachers from different backgrounds,

600
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:43,360
like it's such an opportunity for growth and great whiteness.

601
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,270
You know, preschool can be wonderful,

602
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:56,649
but we really want to think about this sort of from a systemic point of view and think about ways that we can promote positive engagement,

603
01:10:56,650 --> 01:11:05,020
anti-racist engagement in the preschool setting and as well as an awareness of trauma.

604
01:11:05,230 --> 01:11:12,340
Because that's the other thing that can happen with a lot of kids and that they're acting out their feelings through their behaviors.

605
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:21,340
And that can be hard to handle because the behaviors can be big, that behaviors can be like throwing a chair at another kid that's not safe.

606
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:26,709
And a teacher needs to address that. But the teacher needs to be thinking about why is the child throwing the chair and

607
01:11:26,710 --> 01:11:31,180
what can we do to sort of prevent the actions that lead to throw in the chair?

608
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:36,459
That's sort of what that preschool mental health consultation does. It's like working with teachers.

609
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:40,660
Let's go through your day. Let's think about preventive, you know, actions you can take.

610
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:44,180
Maybe give that kid a job who can't sit in the circle, you know,

611
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:51,250
get them to be the one who turns on and off the lights to signal that it's going to be doing something else like this.

612
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:55,600
You can use and work with teachers around. That's a lot of info.

613
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:00,249
I'll just say a few more things here. We'll talk more about this.

614
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:07,879
An early intervention, but thinking about kids who have special needs or who have, you know,

615
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:17,170
a support person in the classroom even, there's a lot we do with children in this early childhood stage 3 to 5.

616
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:22,720
And we also do a lot with kids earlier on to early 0 to 3.

617
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,580
So we'll talk more about the differences here.

618
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:34,870
But basically a takeaway is that kids who are receiving services from age 0 to 3, they're in a family context.

619
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:38,200
And that's a really important part of early intervention that's a requirement,

620
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:44,770
has to have a family element to it, kids who are receiving services after age three.

621
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:53,380
So it's a more it's a classroom kind of based, individualized education plan, which is what older kids have, too.

622
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:59,709
So that's a big switch at age three for families and for kids, not only going to preschool,

623
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:06,100
but a kid is receiving services for speech, for language, for other things.

624
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:08,020
That's also a switch.

625
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:14,589
And so the families may start to feel like a little more disconnected from school because like, wait, I had my case manager there coming to my house.

626
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:22,419
We had these like family sessions. Now my kid turned three and I've got to go through like the schooling context for those services.

627
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:24,610
So that's something to keep in mind.

628
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:36,250
And then I like this was from a study where they interviewed teachers about what's helpful for a successful transition to preschool.

629
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:44,950
And it's these ideas that, you know, may seem really obvious, but these are like in sort of should be in people's minds.

630
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:48,580
They're talking to parents about like, oh, my child is starting preschool.

631
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:49,090
What should I do?

632
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:55,150
So this idea of like preparation for the classroom context, like I talked about the sort of busy people are going to be sitting on the mat.

633
01:13:55,150 --> 01:13:58,480
There's going to be all these rules, there's going to be like expectations.

634
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:05,620
So not necessarily like do you know your ABCs, but sort of maybe see if you could find out.

635
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:10,249
Without the routines, the preschool doesn't start them at home so that they're familiar to your child.

636
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:14,920
When you're like, Is your child going to nap on a mat? Maybe you could talk about that at home.

637
01:14:14,930 --> 01:14:23,120
So it's sort of prepping, wrap up rituals I've talked about already for daycare, but it's similar for a preschool.

638
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:33,920
You know, keep them brief, predictable and consistent. And then this idea of reinforcing behaviors at home and I think for teachers,

639
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:40,879
teachers think a lot about that sort of difference between home and school contexts because it shows up in kids behavior.

640
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:45,830
Right. Like kid teachers on a monday will say like, oh, my gosh, you can tell so-and-so is at,

641
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:49,669
you know, at home for the weekend or at a different house or they went on vacation.

642
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:53,330
Like, you can just tell them kids behavior when their routine sort of gets shifted.

643
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:58,730
And then I think, you know, communication, of course, always important.

644
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:05,059
But also if they're going to say, oh, don't know that I said this, I probably said this on the video.

645
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:10,940
But the other thing here that's really beautiful about preschool is that all those

646
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:16,429
17 kids and the teachers are like teaching your child the child new routines.

647
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:22,700
And often those routines are great, they're adaptive, they're like potty training, which is a goal of all parents.

648
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:31,910
And you get that like kind of positive peer pressure in the preschool stage, and that's another reason we'll talk more about it.

649
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:37,219
But that's like another reason why early childhood education interventions can be very powerful.

650
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:41,150
So things like trying a new green vegetable, you know, going on the potty,

651
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:46,640
like these sort of new experiences that in the family context, the kid might be like, I'm not doing that.

652
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:52,430
If they see other peers doing it, they might try it and they might be more likely.

653
01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:56,060
So that's another reason why it's like a powerful intervention context.

654
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:02,780
I got, like 2 minutes. But do you want to say quick?

655
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:10,400
Sorry. Yeah. Oh, that is a great question.

656
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:20,250
And when I say it varies, it means like sometimes it can be placed in a building of a K-12 system.

657
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:26,910
With universal pre-K, we'll talk a bit more about this when we talk early childhood, early childhood education.

658
01:16:29,190 --> 01:16:32,620
But they can sometimes even be connected to K through 12.

659
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:39,930
And that's not typical like a parent at an administrative level, but they can sometimes be placed in a k-through-12 setting.

660
01:16:43,690 --> 01:16:52,730
But no. Be.

661
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,960
Same from pre-K through 12th grade.

662
01:16:58,890 --> 01:17:14,860
The. But yes, it's I love that question.

663
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:18,010
We'll talk about we'll talk more about that increased child care and access.

664
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:26,080
Access. But that is a great thing to ask because it's very erratic and it's a patchwork system is the upside.

665
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:35,810
And when you guys watch the the raising of America video, it delves into lots of those issues and you'll be like, That's okay.

666
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:39,849
Um, yeah, so great question. Um, let's see.

667
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:43,030
Okay. I think. Okay. Yep.

668
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:46,149
That's everything. Yeah.

669
01:17:46,150 --> 01:17:50,590
So hopefully today we've talked about like that early childhood space preschool context,

670
01:17:50,590 --> 01:17:57,010
which is really important and kind of previewed some of these issues that can be challenging in the preschool context.

671
01:17:58,270 --> 01:18:03,159
And then we'll talk more about preschool and early childhood Ed as we go go forward.

672
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:07,150
So thank you, guys. Kids, I love preschool.

673
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:42,200
Um. I know that you. Yeah.

674
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:52,240
Or. That's fine.

675
01:18:58,290 --> 01:19:04,140
Oh, yeah. Yeah. When is the goal for that to start?

676
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:09,790
I'm. Mr. Mean is.

677
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:16,670
We're trying to do our best right now.

678
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:27,740
She's my colleague and intuition. We had this study where we were looking at kids who have diabetes and areas with moms of kids who have diabetes.

679
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:34,040
And you're asking them self-regulation, actually. It's like what gets in the way of their child management.

680
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:40,310
And so we're looking for we talked about we'll have some people in our orbit who could maybe be good,

681
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:43,660
but we were like, Let's put out this job application.

682
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:47,300
Yeah. See if we can get people like Don.

683
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:56,160
He said all were project management would be another skill set.
