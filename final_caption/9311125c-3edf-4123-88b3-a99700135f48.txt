1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,990
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,235
This is the quick review for the first lecture in the lipids unit,

3
00:00:06,235 --> 00:00:09,340
the Lipid, Structure and Properties lecture.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,040
So I'll be covering it very quickly and briefly.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,331
So the roles of lipids.

6
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:18,093
They have many functions in the body for structural and

7
00:00:18,093 --> 00:00:20,030
functional components of the cells.

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,350
They are used as an energy source.

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,898
They're important for insulation and

10
00:00:24,898 --> 00:00:29,860
generating heat and also they're important for inflammatory responses.

11
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:35,240
The current guidelines are 20 to 35% of energy intake for a day.

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:40,137
The types of lipids, you have a triglyceride which is a glycerol that has,

13
00:00:40,137 --> 00:00:43,040
I'm just going to assume that page.

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,744
So it's a glycerol and three fatty acids, a glycerol backbone three fatty acids.

15
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:53,851
And phospholipid that has a phosphate glycerol in two fatty acids and

16
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:58,694
a steroid that looks somehow different, it's a ring shape, and

17
00:00:58,694 --> 00:01:03,731
that's the structure so that you can see what glycerol looks like.

18
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:08,143
And then cholesterol esters that have fatty acid ester in this case.

19
00:01:08,143 --> 00:01:09,441
Role of cholesterol.

20
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:11,981
So cholesterol is not considered to be essential.

21
00:01:11,981 --> 00:01:16,835
So by non-essential we mean that you do not need to obtain it from the diet

22
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:19,720
because you can synthesize it in the body.

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,672
It's important because it's a precursor for making hormones like estrogen and

24
00:01:24,672 --> 00:01:28,840
progesterone, which are reproductive hormones basically.

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,040
And bile salts and vitamin D.

26
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,202
Now as for phospholipids, so phospholipids have a unique shape by which

27
00:01:39,202 --> 00:01:44,810
they have a hydrophilic head which allows them to be facing water for example.

28
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,174
And they have hydrophobic tails which need to be away from water

29
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,140
because they're hydrophobic.

30
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,416
So this makes them very crucial and

31
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:58,410
membrane structure over here.

32
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:03,137
So this can be the phospholipid bilayer that's really important for

33
00:02:03,137 --> 00:02:07,292
a membrane where you have everything hydrophobic inside and

34
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:11,054
then everything hydrophilic can be facing outwards.

35
00:02:11,054 --> 00:02:14,100
This is structure that you do not need to know.

36
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,100
So let's talk about Choline Deficiency.

37
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,290
So why is choline important?

38
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:23,465
Because a major phospholipid, [COUGH] Which is what we've been discussing

39
00:02:23,465 --> 00:02:28,000
over here as phosphatidylcholine that has to come from choline.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,648
So you need to have choline sufficiently in your body to be

41
00:02:31,648 --> 00:02:36,540
able to make phosphatidylcholine, which is a major phospholipid.

42
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,873
And humans can barely make it so it's considered to be semi-essential.

43
00:02:41,873 --> 00:02:47,300
And it's also very important during phases of growth and development because you

44
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,041
can imagine, for example, during pregnancy that this new baby that's developing,

45
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:57,701
the fetus needs more membrane and has more cells that are developing.

46
00:02:57,701 --> 00:03:02,126
So you need more membranes per cell and so on, so it's really important.

47
00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:07,340
Deficiency can result in NAFLD, anxiety and developmental defects.

48
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,290
So some people have the PEMT variant over here.

49
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,941
So if they have the PEMT variant, then that means they have some genetic

50
00:03:16,941 --> 00:03:23,540
polymorphisms which makes them less capable of endogenously making choline.

51
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,661
So those people might have to increase their choline intake in the diet.

52
00:03:27,661 --> 00:03:33,530
So how did we know that some people have this PEMT variant over here?

53
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,269
It was I believe a study where they had people go on like choline deficient diet,

54
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:42,447
and they started showing symptoms which meant that those people could

55
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:47,211
endogenously make choline, although it's not an essential micronutrient.

56
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:52,832
But for some people who have this variant they need to obtain it from the diet and

57
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:57,605
cannot rely on their endogenous PEMT synthesis of choline because

58
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:59,328
they have the variant.

59
00:03:59,328 --> 00:04:02,741
And 28% of the population have this allele, so

60
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:05,740
it's relatively a very high number.

61
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,170
So, triglyceride as we said has a glycerol backbone and three fatty acids over here.

62
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,100
And this is the form by which we store lipids and

63
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,364
the adipocytes as triglycerides.

64
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:19,295
And then we need to break them into free fatty acids to be able to utilize the free

65
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:23,440
fatty acids for energy.

66
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,820
[COUGH] So nomenclature, a short chain fatty acids that has less than 6 carbons.

67
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:35,247
It's not in the diet, it's produced in the gut microbiome by the bacteria in the gut,

68
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:40,661
medium chain has 6 to 12 carbon, long chain is 13 to 21.

69
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:45,740
And then anything that has more than 22 carbons is considered a very long chain.

70
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,800
And we also classify them based on saturation.

71
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,065
So if we look here and we say we have linolenic acids for example,

72
00:04:54,065 --> 00:04:59,151
18:3, then that means it has a C18 and 3 double bonds.

73
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:04,140
So we take into account the number of carbons and the number of double bonds.

74
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,542
So if you have a longer chain over here, then it will yield more energy and

75
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:12,250
it will have more energy stored in it and it tends to be solid.

76
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,528
And the more double bonds you have, so the more desaturated,

77
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:21,548
the less energy you can generate from the breakdown of that fatty acid and

78
00:05:21,548 --> 00:05:26,740
it tends to be more liquid and more prone to oxidation.

79
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,286
This is what I just mentioned, short chain fatty acid derived in the gut.

80
00:05:31,286 --> 00:05:36,758
Medium chain fatty acids are by default short and they're metabolized quicker

81
00:05:36,758 --> 00:05:42,067
than the long chain fatty acids, they're high in palm oil and coconut oil and

82
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:48,640
they're generally saturated, so they do not have a lot of double bonds.

83
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,840
I'm going to skip that.

84
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,831
Okay, so effects of dietary fatty acid composition.

85
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:59,512
So the highest mortality risk over here has been associated

86
00:05:59,512 --> 00:06:04,057
with trans fat because trans fats are partially

87
00:06:04,057 --> 00:06:08,731
hydrogenated fats that do not occur naturally.

88
00:06:08,731 --> 00:06:13,377
So this is an unnatural source of fat basically that we

89
00:06:13,377 --> 00:06:18,250
make a non-industrial way or an industrious and so on.

90
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:24,240
Saturated fat has also been modestly associated with mortality.

91
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,905
Mono and polyunsaturated fats, so MUFAs and

92
00:06:27,905 --> 00:06:33,900
PUFAs have been shown to be reducing the mortality percentage over here.

93
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,604
So you can think of mono and

94
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:39,110
polyunsaturated fats as being maybe healthier fat.

95
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:44,740
And trans fat is the type of fat that you might want to steer away from.

96
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:51,635
So, this would be the delta end over here, which is closer to the acid end or

97
00:06:51,635 --> 00:06:57,436
carboxylic acid group over here, and this would be the omega or

98
00:06:57,436 --> 00:07:01,501
the end over here, so just keep that a mind.

99
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:06,351
So here we have delta 9 fatty acids over here because we have

100
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:10,640
a double bond at the 9th position.

101
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,440
Or you can say that this is an omega-7.

102
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,740
It's the same thing depending on which side you're looking at.

103
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,091
So cis and trans.

104
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:24,710
So, this is considered to be saturated because you do not have any double bonds.

105
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,074
This is considered to be a trans fat because we've inserted a double bond but

106
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,140
we are still in the transposition.

107
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,706
So think of it if it's a linear chain over here,

108
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:39,540
everything is in a zigzag line then this is considered trans.

109
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,387
And this is a cis fatty acid which is the natural form whereby every time you

110
00:07:44,387 --> 00:07:47,921
insert a double bond there's a kink that's formed.

111
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:52,026
So think of it as when you insert the double bond,

112
00:07:52,026 --> 00:07:58,337
the carbons need to kind of diverge slightly and move away from each other so

113
00:07:58,337 --> 00:08:04,440
they can't be as compact as a trans fat over here.

114
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,107
So we mentioned that there are some health problems associated

115
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:11,013
with trans fats like higher LDL, cholesterol and

116
00:08:11,013 --> 00:08:15,120
lower HDL which is like considered the healthier blood cholesterol.

117
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,401
You also have higher triglycerides and increased inflammation and

118
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:24,140
it's linked with obesity as well.

119
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,820
So our trans fat consumption over here.

120
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,978
So people have consumed a lot of lard and butter over here,

121
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:37,799
margarine and more recently all of those have kind of plateaued.

122
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,589
And we've increased our intake of palm oil because we're thinking

123
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:47,221
that palm oil is saturated and considered maybe to be healthier.

124
00:08:47,221 --> 00:08:52,252
So I think the takeaway from this is that we keep

125
00:08:52,252 --> 00:08:57,300
changing our fat consumption over the years.

126
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,480
And it's not until like, let's look at margarine for example.

127
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,483
So it kind of started peaking in the 1950s, and then it wasn't until 2000s

128
00:09:06,483 --> 00:09:11,150
that people started saying, maybe it's bad for you, so let's limit.

129
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,988
And think of margarine and let's try maybe coconut oil and

130
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,980
palm oil and maybe healthier alternatives.

131
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:23,157
But like who knows in 2020 what will be the outcome from palm oil and

132
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:26,771
in 2040, for example, what would happen?

133
00:09:26,771 --> 00:09:30,731
Maybe we'll have another alternative and so on.

134
00:09:30,731 --> 00:09:32,870
So this is very dynamic.

135
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:38,053
And since those studies to discuss the effects of those fats

136
00:09:38,053 --> 00:09:42,840
on our health and metabolic profile, they need time.

137
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,768
So we can't really say that, yes, palm oil is the healthiest alternatives so

138
00:09:47,768 --> 00:09:53,540
far, because who knows what will come out In the next five and ten years and so on.

139
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,640
I think that's the take home message.

140
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,580
So palm oil is solid at room temperature over

141
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:11,040
here because it has more saturated fats.

142
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,505
Okay, so these desaturases are enzymes in the body that can insert

143
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:21,600
a double bond and alter the shape of the fatty acids over here.

144
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,381
So on the body we have the delta 4, delta 5, delta 6 and

145
00:10:27,381 --> 00:10:32,561
delta 9 desaturases, we do not have delta 12 and

146
00:10:32,561 --> 00:10:38,240
delta 15 desaturases which plants have but we do not.

147
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:45,671
And then fish oil supplementation, so omega-3s are really important.

148
00:10:45,671 --> 00:10:47,620
They are anti-inflammatory.

149
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,877
We cannot endogenously make them in the body because we don't

150
00:10:52,877 --> 00:10:58,740
have the desaturase which is that far to delta 12 and delta 15.

151
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,240
So we can't make omega-3 or omega-6.

152
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:07,021
And studies have been showing that you need to consume fish.

153
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:08,276
So if you eat fish,

154
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:13,240
you have a better outcome than just taking supplements of fish oil.

155
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,331
So that's really important and we'll talk more about

156
00:11:18,331 --> 00:11:25,193
this in the next lecture where we look at the differences between the two,

157
00:11:25,193 --> 00:11:29,521
and how omega-3 and 6s share desaturases.

158
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:32,361
So they share similar pathways over here.

159
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:37,828
And if you're consuming more Omega-6 compared to Omega-3, then the omega-6

160
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:42,614
cannot compete for those activities over here, enzymatic activities.

161
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:48,664
And kind of if you have a very high ratio of omega-6 to omega-3,

162
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:53,742
then the omega-6 will not compete and it will seem like

163
00:11:53,742 --> 00:12:00,900
you are deficient in omega-3 even if you're consuming at fairly modestly.

164
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:08,140
But the omega-6 will not compete and be the more dominant one in the body.

165
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:13,420
So efficiency of ALA to DHA/EPA conversion which is over here,

166
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,681
the ALA to EPA and then DHA.

167
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:18,700
So that's how we are metabolizing omega-3s.

168
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,760
So females are more efficient at converting it.

169
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,485
And people in Hispanic populations

170
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:30,741
also have a higher conversion.

171
00:12:30,741 --> 00:12:35,675
Whereas people who have African ancestry are shown to have lower conversion and

172
00:12:35,675 --> 00:12:38,240
lower abilities.

173
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:45,049
Okay, also PUFA's, they [COUGH], Sorry, so the omega-6s which are polyunsaturated

174
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:50,710
fatty acids have inflammatory responses, so they cause inflammation.

175
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:56,651
They increase leukotrienes, thromboxanes and prostaglandins.

176
00:12:56,651 --> 00:13:00,340
So, all of those promote like inflammatory responses.

177
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:05,987
And this is arachidonic acid which is I believe over here,

178
00:13:05,987 --> 00:13:09,580
so it's the omega-6 derivative.

179
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,833
So we're saying that omega-6s are proinflammatory,

180
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,560
whereas omega-3s are anti-inflammatory.

181
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,926
So EPA/DHA derivatives of omega-3,

182
00:13:18,926 --> 00:13:25,361
DHA's anti-inflammatory EPA is like moderate inflammatory derivative,

183
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:29,421
and arachidonic acid is very proinflammatory.

184
00:13:29,421 --> 00:13:33,861
So this is the omega-6 derivative and those two are omega-3 derivatives.

185
00:13:33,861 --> 00:13:38,746
And as mentioned if your omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is very

186
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:43,460
high then you will show as pseudo-deficiency over here.

187
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,298
So it will seem like you have very low omega-3 just because

188
00:13:47,298 --> 00:13:51,617
the omega-6 will be out competing for the desaturase activity.

189
00:13:51,617 --> 00:13:54,433
And that's it.
