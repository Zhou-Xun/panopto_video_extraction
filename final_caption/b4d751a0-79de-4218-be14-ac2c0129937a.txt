00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,814
Hi this is jennifer Sweeney from the infection prevention department and

2
00:00:05,814 --> 00:00:10,783
today I am here to talk to you about catheter associated urinary

3
00:00:10,783 --> 00:00:15,472
tract infections we're gonna start with the background,

4
00:00:15,472 --> 00:00:20,653
what exactly is a catheter associated urinary tract infection?

5
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:25,351
Just in general, urinary tract infections are the fifth most common

6
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:30,292
type of health care acquired effect infection that patients can develop

7
00:00:30,292 --> 00:00:33,293
while they're in in the hospital setting.

8
00:00:33,293 --> 00:00:37,806
63,000 urinary tract infections are identified in

9
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:43,156
hospitalized patients on a yearly basis, so they are quite common.

10
00:00:43,156 --> 00:00:48,742
About 12-16% of these of adult patients in the hospital setting

11
00:00:48,742 --> 00:00:55,290
will have an indwelling urinary catheter placed during their hospitalization.

12
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,250
Urinary tract infections.

13
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:02,507
In patients that have an existing urinary indwelling urinary

14
00:01:02,507 --> 00:01:07,963
catheter are at risk for what we're going to talk about today and

15
00:01:07,963 --> 00:01:12,613
that is a catheter associated urinary tract infection

16
00:01:12,613 --> 00:01:17,384
Each day that a patient has a urinary catheter in place.

17
00:01:17,384 --> 00:01:21,059
They're at a 3-7% increased risk for

18
00:01:21,059 --> 00:01:26,624
developing a catheter associated urinary tract infection And

19
00:01:26,624 --> 00:01:30,614
any time one of these infections developed,

20
00:01:30,614 --> 00:01:36,080
it can increase a patient's length of stay by up to 10 days.

21
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,541
What exactly is an involving urinary catheter.

22
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:44,960
There's a picture on the slide showing an indwelling urinary catheter.

23
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,267
It's essentially a drainage tube that is inserted into the urinary bladder,

24
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:54,897
through the urethra, it stays in place for

25
00:01:54,897 --> 00:02:00,246
Whatever time frame it's needed for and on one end it's connected

26
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:05,240
to a drainage bag where the urine drains out of the bladder.

27
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,368
The slide also includes information for

28
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:12,699
what is not counted as an indwelling urinary catheter.

29
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:18,211
So there are super pubic catheters that are inserted directly

30
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:23,310
into a patient's bladder through the exterior skin.

31
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,991
This is not considered an indwelling urinary catheter, nor

32
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:32,057
is a straight intermittent catheter considered an indwelling urinary catheter.

33
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:36,702
A straight catheter is something that is temporarily placed up the urethra to

34
00:02:36,702 --> 00:02:39,711
empty the bladder but it is immediately removed.

35
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:41,481
It does not stay in place.

36
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:46,496
We'll look at some external alternatives in a second but

37
00:02:46,496 --> 00:02:53,599
none of the alternatives that we will discuss are inserted into the urethra and

38
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,250
they are also not considered an indwelling device prevention.

39
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,519
What's the easiest way to prevent a catheter associated urinary tract

40
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,311
infection.

41
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:08,443
Really, it's not inserting the catheter in the first place.

42
00:03:08,443 --> 00:03:13,054
The best way to prevent a device related infection is to not have

43
00:03:13,054 --> 00:03:14,625
the device in place.

44
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:19,996
So part of the education that we provide surrounding catheter associated

45
00:03:19,996 --> 00:03:25,455
urinary tract infection prevention are providing indications for when to

46
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:31,449
use appropriately indwelling urinary catheters and certain types of patients.

47
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:35,069
So if a patient has acute urinary retention or

48
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,531
an obstruction and they are not able to avoid easily.

49
00:03:39,531 --> 00:03:45,225
It's absolutely appropriate to place an indwelling catheter if there is a need for

50
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,805
accurate hourly measurements of urinary output and

51
00:03:48,805 --> 00:03:54,335
critically ill patients to insist in healing of sacral or perennial wounds and

52
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:59,300
incontinent patients if patients require prolonged immobilization,

53
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,853
such that they're not able to easily get up and attempt to avoid and

54
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:07,312
to provide comfort for end of life care if needed.

55
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:13,442
I will also tell you that in some of these cases a lot of our alternatives

56
00:04:13,442 --> 00:04:19,490
can accurately measure output in patients that do need measurements.

57
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,581
So some of the information on this on these slides.

58
00:04:22,581 --> 00:04:28,621
Still we can transition to using alternatives in some of these situations.

59
00:04:28,621 --> 00:04:32,938
But this is the basic list that we provide for

60
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:37,145
providers to use to make an assessment of when

61
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:41,476
they can use an indwelling catheter or or not.

62
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:46,380
Catheters are also commonly used in the surgical setting,

63
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:53,354
especially when we have patients that are having surgery on the euro genital tract.

64
00:04:53,354 --> 00:04:55,863
If there is going to be a long surgery where

65
00:04:55,863 --> 00:05:00,746
the patient's going to be under anesthesia for a really long period of time.

66
00:05:00,746 --> 00:05:05,459
If the patient is expected to receive a lot of fluids or

67
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:09,758
undergoing diuretics during surgery surgery

68
00:05:09,758 --> 00:05:13,530
if the patient has urinary incontinence or

69
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:19,211
if there is a need to monitor urinary output during the surgery.

70
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:23,776
So these are times when we would find it appropriate to

71
00:05:23,776 --> 00:05:27,940
place an indwelling catheter for surgical use.

72
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:33,213
Now, these are some of the alternatives that I mentioned previously that

73
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:38,912
can be used and actually we suggest if there is an ability to use an alternative

74
00:05:38,912 --> 00:05:44,460
versus placing an indwelling catheter that we attempt these options first.

75
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,250
So there are condom casts the straight cast that we spoke of earlier.

76
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,560
There are urinals that can be used at a patient's bedside.

77
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,821
There is a new device called a pirouette.

78
00:05:55,821 --> 00:06:00,701
So this is considered an external device sort of the female

79
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:05,083
version of a condom cath it's placed externally and

80
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:09,276
it removes the urine away from a patient's body.

81
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:14,691
We also have bedpans, absorb it pan pads and diaper.

82
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:18,140
So the absorbent pads and the diapers can be weighed.

83
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:24,350
If we do need to measure urine output we also have some of the indications

84
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:30,777
of when these types of alternatives should not be used to guide our staff.

85
00:06:30,777 --> 00:06:31,570
Another prevention.

86
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:36,556
So if we are forced to place an indwelling urinary catheter,

87
00:06:36,556 --> 00:06:41,850
we want to make sure that it's inserted in the correct fashion.

88
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:45,395
So this slide includes some of the steps that we would

89
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:49,920
expect to happen if an indwelling catheter needed to be inserted.

90
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,163
First off with any insertion is hand hygiene.

91
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:57,536
It's sufficient to use hand hygiene with soap and water or

92
00:06:57,536 --> 00:07:02,192
a waterless hand hand rub are sufficient for this purpose.

93
00:07:02,192 --> 00:07:05,982
We would use sterile technique in order to insert and

94
00:07:05,982 --> 00:07:10,889
we expect that the insert is properly trained and has already gone

95
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:16,572
through competency for how to appropriately insert all of these devices.

96
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:21,361
All of our kits come with a distant a soap product

97
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:25,210
you would use to prepare the urinary.

98
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:31,549
So this is where the catheter is going to be inserted into the urethra and

99
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:36,764
then make its way up to the bladder ideally you want small size

100
00:07:36,764 --> 00:07:41,776
urinary catheter to be used as possible to reduce friction

101
00:07:41,776 --> 00:07:46,890
that is occurring in the urethra and likewise to continue to

102
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:52,313
reduce friction once the urinary catheter has been inserted,

103
00:07:52,313 --> 00:07:56,097
we secure the device on the patient's leg so

104
00:07:56,097 --> 00:08:00,838
that doesn't continue to move and cause problems.

105
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:05,341
One of the things that we are working on and we have been working on for

106
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:10,318
quite some time is having conversations with the emergency department and

107
00:08:10,318 --> 00:08:14,979
the operating rooms and attempting to remove enduring catheters that

108
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:19,640
are placed in these settings as quickly as possible so that they don't

109
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,640
inadvertently remain in place for longer periods of time than necessary.

110
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,106
Once the catheter is inserted, we fall into what we call the maintenance phase.

111
00:08:30,106 --> 00:08:34,485
So the the catheter needs to be taken care of and

112
00:08:34,485 --> 00:08:38,754
made sure that it's flowing correctly and

113
00:08:38,754 --> 00:08:42,478
being managed in the appropriate way.

114
00:08:42,478 --> 00:08:47,732
So some of these bundle elements that we refer to our first of all

115
00:08:47,732 --> 00:08:53,083
talking every day if and determining from a clinical standpoint if

116
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:59,600
the indwelling catheter is still necessary and removing it as soon as possible.

117
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,145
If it's no longer needed any time you will be performing any of these activities.

118
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:09,082
Hand hygiene is always important.

119
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:14,464
So if you are manipulating the device, if you are joining the urine out of the bag,

120
00:09:14,464 --> 00:09:19,300
we always want to make sure that you're using aseptic technique as much as

121
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,510
possible, the system should be remain closed.

122
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:27,104
So if you recall that picture that I showed you about the device in

123
00:09:27,104 --> 00:09:32,114
theory there is a bag at the end of it and we really don't ever want.

124
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:36,931
Staff disconnecting the catheter from the bag.

125
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:43,499
And there is a special report where staff can empty the urine out of the bag safely.

126
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:49,048
So the more often you completely open up the system and remove the bag to empty it,

127
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:54,189
the more the likelihood is that you could contaminate the bag in some way and

128
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:59,670
it's the indwelling catheter is a direct line up into the patient's bladder.

129
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:04,311
If there any bacteria that are incorporated at any time,

130
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:09,733
it can make its way directly up into the patient's bladder Again.

131
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:14,106
We would also like to keep the bag below the patient's bladder but

132
00:10:14,106 --> 00:10:15,785
not laying on the floor.

133
00:10:15,785 --> 00:10:18,580
The floor is a very dirty surface.

134
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,797
The urine flows out of the bladder from the indwelling catheter in

135
00:10:22,797 --> 00:10:24,415
a gravity type fashion.

136
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:27,821
So that's why we want to keep the bag below the patient's bladder.

137
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:32,193
So that gravity will work and it will flow directly into the bag and

138
00:10:32,193 --> 00:10:36,421
not back up into the catheter and into the patient's bladder.

139
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:41,333
Once it's already made its way into into the indwelling catheter,

140
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:45,495
We also want to make sure that the urine is flowing nicely and

141
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:48,075
that there is not some obstruction or

142
00:10:48,075 --> 00:10:53,340
sediment in the tubing that's causing the urine to not empty into the bag.

143
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,672
We mentioned securing the catheter and parry care is actually very important.

144
00:10:56,672 --> 00:11:03,631
We place a lot of wait around making sure that the patients perry area is

145
00:11:03,631 --> 00:11:09,121
cleaned at least once for men and twice a day for females.

146
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:13,946
And that's using soap and water and some special wipes

147
00:11:13,946 --> 00:11:19,285
that we have to make sure that that area is cleaned every day.

148
00:11:19,285 --> 00:11:26,085
And really one of the other more important things that we haven't talked about so

149
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:31,685
far is sending urine cultures when it's clinically indicated and

150
00:11:31,685 --> 00:11:36,585
not sending them for for reasons that are not relevant

151
00:11:36,585 --> 00:11:40,791
to the patient having a urinary tract infection.

152
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:45,778
That concludes our background on catheter

153
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:50,235
associated urinary tract infections mm.
