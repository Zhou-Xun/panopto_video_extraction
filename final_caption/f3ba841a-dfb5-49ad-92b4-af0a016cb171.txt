1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:12,990
Hi everyone. I am here to give a few thoughts and personal reflections on the idea of.

2
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,120
Racism being a public health issue.

3
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:31,270
So I will try not to ramble. And I have an outline in front of me that I'm I'm hoping to follow so that I don't ramble.

4
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,810
You know, I've been asked to give. Our lectures on this.

5
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:45,480
I've been asked to. Talk to health departments about making their.

6
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:52,370
Strategic plans. Anti-Racist. I've been asked to speak to students before.

7
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,759
I am in my position now.

8
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:06,430
They as a. As a black woman who has interests in health equity and justice.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,350
And how that works its way into our bodies is a few policies.

10
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,410
I'm asked to talk a lot about how the intersections of.

11
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,499
Race and research or race and policy or race and equity.

12
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:34,570
Like how all these things often intersect. And now in 2020, we are.

13
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,360
Openly talking about racism in a way that I don't think has occurred for a long time.

14
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,760
When I worked at the CDC between 2005 and 2000 and.

15
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,200
13. I.

16
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:04,430
I worked with Commander Jones, who's one of the premiere scholars on racism and how.

17
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:14,720
And she was adamant about the ways that racism inscribes itself into the bodies of.

18
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,140
Populations and and affects health.

19
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:25,390
And she was hired to create an office of racism within the CDC.

20
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,240
And at the end of the day, there was not enough political will to actually make it happen.

21
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:42,860
And she ended up leaving the CDC. And now she speaks very, very openly about her time there and what happened when it was there.

22
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:48,739
And even now, CDC has been called out for its internal mechanisms of racism,

23
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:58,070
even though as a huge institutional proponent of public health, it should be doing better because it allegedly knows better.

24
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:08,940
Right. So in my research, what I have found is that particularly in the United States, we haven't liked to call out the R word.

25
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,170
We like to say disparities. We like to say inequality.

26
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:24,120
We like to say inequity. We like to say socioeconomic status is a huge part of health determinants.

27
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,970
But very rarely have we've really called out racism as a social determinants.

28
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:37,209
And then by that the R word is finally getting used in a way that hopefully will

29
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:42,340
help us move the dial in terms of an acknowledgment that then leads to change.

30
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:53,350
So my work on sickle cell disease is about the ways in which policy gets developed.

31
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:01,629
And in Brazil, this policy that was developed around sickle cell was developed because the people who were

32
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:09,410
living with sickle cell involved in social movements felt that they were still subclass,

33
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:17,710
subclass, that being a Brazilian citizen, which afforded them a right to health vis a vis the constitution,

34
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:26,200
it still wasn't enough that as black citizens they were still being neglected and that the neglect came down.

35
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:34,850
These are the mechanisms of racism. So when we think about racism, I use comfort.

36
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:47,690
JONES Three tiered levels of racism, which are institutional racism, personally mediated racism and internal racism.

37
00:04:48,760 --> 00:05:05,380
And is that institutional or structural or systemic racism that came embedded and codified in policies and programs in health care that really.

38
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:11,630
Um influenced how these social movement people thought that.

39
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:24,380
War influenced them, wanting to increase their voice about acknowledging the racism, such that they had to have a policy that addressed that racism.

40
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:32,380
So. Racism and health.

41
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:39,450
Um. I think. Now that we're using the R word more.

42
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:45,010
It just became super apparent during this last summer with COVID 19.

43
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,120
Right. All of the.

44
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:56,010
Underlying issues that came into play with.

45
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:05,320
How COVID 19 showed up disproportionately in communities of color, particularly black communities.

46
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:12,930
All of this was about a mechanism of race, racism and health.

47
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,620
And if we if we could think about racism as a virus that infects everything.

48
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:24,820
It might serve us well, right? Racism at the top.

49
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:35,799
Whether it be personally mediated individual to individual, whether it be systemic and baked into the institutions or whether it be internalized,

50
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,160
which is the third level of convergence definition of racism.

51
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:53,920
All of these levels of racism trickle down into health behaviors and health status and explains why there was segregation.

52
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:04,569
Racial segregation, which then led to populations being exposed to certain toxins, which then led to an increased number of people having asthma,

53
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:11,320
which then led to this comorbidity that made people more vulnerable for COVID 19.

54
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:18,220
Right. So there's this systemic infusion of racism that trickles down and.

55
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:32,010
And somehow. And that somehow. But. It makes it makes people more vulnerable to the actual health outcome or the health stuff that that happens to us.

56
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:45,510
So when we think about COVID 19 and racism and we think about all of the underlying issues that might have brought people into the health care system,

57
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:58,410
we have to think about who have higher rates of being uninsured, who have lower rates of of income.

58
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,799
Where is the limit to health care access? Who has distrust in the health care system?

59
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,750
And why is that? A is that something that that needs to be discussed on?

60
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:16,230
In terms of blame on the individual, or is that something that needs to be discussed in terms of blame on the institution?

61
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:24,880
Who's at fault there? That systemic distrust, of course, is going to lead to certain health outcomes in particular populations.

62
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,120
Racism has been embedded in all of these things.

63
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:42,330
And. Even though you have someone like.

64
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,750
Me, who has a Ph.D.

65
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,690
Who had access to higher education.

66
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,920
Who have has lived in.

67
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,910
Non redlined neighborhoods. Who?

68
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,510
Currently is, you know, a professor in Ann Arbor.

69
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:23,660
None of that. Protects me or shields me from the outside world and their perceptions of me due to my skin color and those perceptions.

70
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,850
Work their way into all aspects of my life.

71
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:35,560
So they work their way in when to from you know from infant until death.

72
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:49,270
And this is not a black woman thing, right? This is a anyone who is not part of the majority demographic in any given place.

73
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,330
And so race and racism operate differently in different places.

74
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:02,760
South Africa operates differently than Brazil operates differently than the U.S. But in the U.S., right.

75
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:08,169
The dominant the dominant demographic is white.

76
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,290
And so most things are then.

77
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,800
Assumed for the norm to be white and everything else is an anomaly.

78
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:28,840
That's not white. So, you know, the racism conversations that that are happening and will continue to happen.

79
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:38,290
I hope that they not only talk about the populations of color that are affected, but they also have to talk about the whiteness part.

80
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:45,900
Right. And what that means in terms of the conversation that needs to be had for for all races.

81
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:57,760
So I'm rambling now. So now we're talking about racism as a public health issue.

82
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:03,040
Right. And earlier I said, what if we thought about racism as a virus?

83
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:11,140
And in this moment, when our lives are being affected by the virus due to COVID 19,

84
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:24,310
also happening during this past summer and continues to happen and has been happening has been the racial violence towards particularly black men,

85
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,290
but also black women, also black transgender individuals.

86
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:37,300
And this nexus of racial injustice and COVID 19.

87
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,470
Can't be untangled.

88
00:11:43,400 --> 00:12:00,530
And so people are understanding that the same racism that has killed many people due to police brutality and due to vigilante actions,

89
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,310
due to, you know, you name it.

90
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:19,040
That's that same racism. It's the same racism that is the root cause of the many deaths that are occurring for four and around COVID 19.

91
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:30,890
And so with the nexus of these things happening, I think this has really gotten the attention of the general population.

92
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:42,559
But certainly it has allowed people who have some power to then clamor to make some sort of systemic change,

93
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,150
or at least an attempt into calling out racism as a public health issue.

94
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:57,050
And it makes sense, right, that racism is a social determinants of health and is very active, very pervasive.

95
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:04,990
And concerning. Part of it's a public health issue.

96
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:13,770
So then. What happens? The.

97
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:19,580
The way that systemic racism works is that.

98
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:24,520
You don't necessarily see it as it's happening.

99
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:35,170
I'm part of a research study and we were collecting these statements from people about privacy.

100
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:42,020
And data. And one of the respondents said, you know, it's like sugar.

101
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:51,410
If you look at the packaging of any of your food products, you think you're doing well by avoiding the sugar, but literally sugars everywhere.

102
00:13:53,150 --> 00:14:00,020
How. How am I supposed to be sugar free when sugar creeps up everywhere and.

103
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:11,790
That is. That is how this works.

104
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,320
So the sugars everywhere. Meaning that the.

105
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:37,900
But even in the ways you can't think. Of in terms of the codification of racism and the innovation of racism, it's.

106
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:45,550
It's there and taking place such that it's almost normalized in a way.

107
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:51,320
There are institutional norms that support the systemic racism.

108
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:59,290
I was listening to a really great NPR interview and I will link it.

109
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:11,430
And to this video, if I can. And it was talking about the ways that you can change systemic racism is to begin to add punitive elements.

110
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,090
And so this punitive elements on a systemic institutional basis.

111
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:27,170
Right. So I discriminate against somebody because of their name, but then I'm called out and something actually happens to me.

112
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,729
And those things get normalized. Those things get codified.

113
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:41,270
And all of a sudden, institutions are recognizing and playing a role in making sure that fairness is being delivered,

114
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,459
not turning a blind eye, not contributing to things.

115
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:54,590
Or if you are contributing to things, there's a mechanism in place that your hand gets slapped, that rewards get taken away, that you get fired.

116
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,139
And that eventually creeps its way into the norm.

117
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:04,440
And people start to think twice about acting the way that they act in terms of their racist behaviors.

118
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,179
And that eventually will trickle down into individuals that they have to kind of

119
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,870
think about their actions and think about the consequences of their actions.

120
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,149
And then whether you like it or not,

121
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:22,530
this codification that has happened systemically trickles down individually and there's some sort of behavior change.

122
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:34,840
So fingers crossed that naming race is a massive public health issue with governments and cities and these higher institutions,

123
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:42,910
that there is actually a process that gets embedded in which the fairness piece.

124
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:53,990
Gets delivered in a way that's measured and that there are punitive pieces to it if things aren't fair.

125
00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:08,080
You know, I consider myself an anti racist scholar and I teach my master's level course on designing,

126
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,390
redesigning programs and policies with an anti-racist lens.

127
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:18,940
And to be anti-racist is to trouble all the time.

128
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:25,420
The normative narrative writes, No matter how uncomfortable it is, it's to disrupt.

129
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:33,710
When something is happening that you think is racist, it's to intentionally center.

130
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:45,890
The voices that are being marginalized. It's about making sure that all the voices are being heard in the room as opposed to the normative

131
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:53,420
disciplinary voice which is usually held at a higher steam than the community level books.

132
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:03,380
Anyway. Here we are almost 20 minutes and Dr. Perry is just talking and talking and talking.

133
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,330
I think that racism as a public health issue is important.

134
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,400
We have a lot of work to do before it actually starts to matter and is.

135
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:22,930
And goes beyond just virtue signaling. And I am hopeful that.

136
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,200
By using the R word more and more and more and more and more.

137
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:36,540
That we can then untangle and call out people and create the policies,

138
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:43,620
the interventions in a really meaningful way to address the fact that racism is literally everywhere.

139
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:48,470
It is. It's. It's in the sugar, right?

140
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:59,800
It's. It is everywhere. And you as public health scholars, you're going to have such a pivotal role in.

141
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,870
Recognizing. It's a placement.

142
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:15,510
And recognizing it and then calling it out. And recognizing it and then doing something about it.

143
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:25,390
This doesn't have to be a depressing story. Anything with racism is a depressing story, as I'm seeing in her in her video.

144
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,850
It's depressing and distressing. But the hopeful part is that.

145
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:38,160
By naming something. That it can become a process of.

146
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:44,840
Freedom that it can be a process of getting us to the next place.

147
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:50,930
And so I'm hopeful with this new generation of public health scholars that.

148
00:19:52,300 --> 00:20:00,400
You are not afraid of calling things out, but you're not afraid of doing the research to find out why things are the way that they are.

149
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:04,260
That you understand the root causes and.

150
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:12,130
And that you honor and value and center the voices of all.

151
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:20,560
That's really what I think is, you know, step one in in any attempt to be anti-racist.

152
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,790
Okay. I'm going to leave it there. I'll see you guys in class.
