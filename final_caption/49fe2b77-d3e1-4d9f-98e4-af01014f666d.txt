1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:28,990
Should you have tried to talk to, you know, make sure that all the various things you had to do, you should have cleared out the.

2
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:50,820
I had no idea what to do. You started doing random, how much you got to jump out, which pushed off.

3
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:15,180
And of course, we still got to do it as opposed to just do it in your house.

4
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:23,220
You know, it's fine if you've been tested.

5
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,149
Do you like.

6
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:48,910
I was really, really want to avoid going under the water because I was really excited because I needed to dust because of that, my concerns.

7
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,430
And I got the points back on that.

8
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:13,300
Also, we figured this stuff is going to be awfully I'm not sure what it was to wash your hands.

9
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,970
Really. I have to tell you something.

10
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,060
What? I don't know.

11
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,210
What is the matter with you?

12
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:43,590
Or how could you get through? That is what I thought.

13
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:49,390
You were in trouble. Okay.

14
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:58,140
Hope you had a good second term. No, you.

15
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:06,110
It started for a few minutes later. I was having to deal with that because.

16
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,560
But that's continue on this honor statistics.

17
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:18,570
So last time a record out, we talk about the United States and how to derive this redistribution by the other statistics.

18
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,079
And this time,

19
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:29,790
we're going to continue our talking about that drawing distribution for a multivariate in order to be essentially for a random sample size.

20
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,860
And we have and our statistics mean all the way to the facts.

21
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:42,510
Right. So last time, we only focused on the bars and also each on our statistics and the special case.

22
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,470
We looked at how to divide the distribution by the mean statistic,

23
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:53,070
how to derive important median multivariate for any other statistics about the maximum.

24
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:04,180
And this time let's look at the joint distribution. First, let's look at the joint of any pair of otter statistics in particular.

25
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,220
Consider these two.

26
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:23,670
Why are and why as the art and ask order statistics how to divide that to one distribution points to speak and without loss of general generality,

27
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:38,280
we just assume this are is love that has so why are is always similar or equal to not has for the way to derive the drawn distribution for this to?

28
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:45,929
Well, the most rigorous way is to first gather join for all our statistics and then

29
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:53,490
integrate out the the rather than once and then we get the marginals for this part.

30
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,690
So that's the most rigorous one at the birth force approach.

31
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,219
Alternatively,

32
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:10,570
we can use this informal idea precisely because example driving the marginal distribution of our single order statistics by considering the.

33
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:18,210
Generals in this case we want to divide this joint distribution of others to are specific.

34
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,260
But we need to consider five intervals. Set the three intervals.

35
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,910
Last night we called that.

36
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:35,070
Now our primary goal is to derive this distribution pdf the drawn pdf who are.

37
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:55,360
Our choice as far as this joint pediatric respiratory function is our target.

38
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:08,170
And again, we use the same idea. This one, pediatrics does not carry a straightforward, probabilistic interpretation by its own,

39
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:13,540
but we can do a modification of this function by multiplying this.

40
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:22,660
Three What are the you want us? And then it does have this approximate interpretation in probability.

41
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:42,580
So it's approximately equal to the probability of y are between y, r and R plus three, y, r and y as small as y plus the wires.

42
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:49,720
Once you multiply this to a small quantities to this joint pedia function,

43
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:58,300
then the entire thing as a probabilistic interpretation that is a probability of this joint event

44
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:08,650
and the order statistics in my interval and the as start order statistics in another small animal.

45
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,899
You recall that we mentioned R is smaller than the task.

46
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,040
So this interval definitely has to be to the left of the second animal.

47
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:26,080
All right. And those two small animals essentially separate this entire axis into five segments.

48
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:33,159
That is not clear to you or is a slightly different notation.

49
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:48,050
So you and the V, so you is our Y, R and B is our class here so that the affinity to you, you to you plus t you u plus t u v, v plus dv.

50
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:54,340
And we have been so we essentially have these five segments.

51
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:02,860
And then you can think about finding the equivalent event or this event in the parenthesis,

52
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,990
a big company equivalent event whose probability is easier to evaluate.

53
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,670
Know where to find the equivalent event.

54
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:20,860
Evaluate that probability. You can plug it in and get this formula of its joint area function.

55
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,990
But then basically the idea is the same as before.

56
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,040
We know these are all our statistics.

57
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:42,520
So once we divide the access into these five intervals, having the hours, our statistic in this interval, in the second interval,

58
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:56,260
I mean this is why are in the second row and why s in the in the fourth interval is equivalent to say you have our minus one

59
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:06,400
observations from your random sample from the first of all exactly one set of the interval as minus R minus one in the third interval.

60
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,680
Exactly why the fourth interval at a minus as in the third.

61
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:33,820
So. Or why 1 to 1 as this distribution as this is and I suppose pausing to these five categories with this distribution.

62
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,840
Exactly of this distribution.

63
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:48,360
So that's the equivalent event with this honored statistics between why are and why are plus the UI are and statistics why why is it plus D what's.

64
00:09:50,360 --> 00:10:00,520
Now the problem is how do we evaluate the probability of having a random sample that has these distributions?

65
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,309
And we know that these samples are highly maintained.

66
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,890
They are independent and identically distributed.

67
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:20,300
So you can consider each random bar, each random variable, the value of each random variable being in each interval having the same probability.

68
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:27,320
And so why one falling into the first of all has exactly the same probability as why to falling to the first interval.

69
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:35,790
And that probability is just a clear function of why evaluate you write.

70
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:42,770
Similarly, you can evaluate the probability products that are available as this PDF function.

71
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:51,680
You buy the value times to you. And similarly, the third one, these quantity one and fifth one.

72
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,530
So that defines the probability of each random falling into each interval.

73
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,220
Since all of all of this round of variables, they are independent.

74
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,200
How are they going to be distributed into these five intervals?

75
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:16,580
Becomes a five nominal distribution or a special case of this multinational distribution with five categories?

76
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:24,470
And we can evaluate that probability using the PM of that five multiannual distribution.

77
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:36,290
And here is the piano bar. The five normal distribution or this end is the number of samples that you have.

78
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:46,160
And these as eyes are these numbers, how many how many of this ten samples actually by each interval.

79
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,850
Last one is our minus one. As two is one.

80
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,630
A three is as minus R minus one. So on, so forth.

81
00:11:54,020 --> 00:12:02,510
And the pie are the probabilities. I would just counter if you put everything together, we can get a probability of.

82
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:16,150
Of the equivalent event of a more recent year equal to the probability of.

83
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,380
Our minus one samples. You.

84
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:59,130
And once all. This is the equivalent event that has this year.

85
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,380
So to put everything together, here is what we can find.

86
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,260
And if you take the limit of this due at DV to zero, we got the p,

87
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:21,120
the drawn PDF for the honest and out order statistic that takes this points and allows slog to help you get an idea of how to drive.

88
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:29,040
If you look on the right hand side folder on any of those terms, we can actually evaluate them.

89
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:38,100
The first way is just a concept, right? These are is and as they are the order of this to our statistics.

90
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,779
So these aren't constants and there's a number of samples, you know,

91
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:53,340
random sample and these are capital AB and smaller are the CTA and the PDF for each individual random variable.

92
00:13:54,210 --> 00:14:03,840
Just the value of them at u R&B. So that's the formula of this half the drawing distribution of this to our statistics.

93
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:16,610
It's. Right in question.

94
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:27,420
Yes. Why are we using our constituents this way specifically like they use, you know.

95
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:33,800
So why do we choose the animals even this way? So let's consider, first of all, your random.

96
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,810
Why 1 to 1 is going to fall into this axis. Right.

97
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:44,000
And what do we care about is the hours order statistics.

98
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:49,010
Why are they as order statistics?

99
00:14:49,370 --> 00:15:05,900
Why apps? Right. And we want to know, what's the probability of wired in this wrench this in this you plus you do the B plus DV, right.

100
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:12,350
We want to know what's the probability of why are falling into this small animal and a wise volume through this.

101
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,550
My. That's what we are trying to calculate in the first place.

102
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,320
Is that clear? But that's the probability that we want to help.

103
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:29,900
But it's not very straightforward how to directly calculate the probability of this that joined up this two events.

104
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:37,880
So we need to find an equivalent event that is easier to calculate.

105
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:45,980
So think about how this why are at a White House is defined is the hours on our statistics and ask our statistics.

106
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,070
So why are calling to this interval and what has fallen to in this interval is

107
00:15:52,080 --> 00:16:02,180
exactly equivalent to say you have our minus one samples here and one sample here.

108
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:08,240
If one sample is if you have one sample in this interval and our minus one sample in front of it,

109
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,500
that just means your hours on our statistics is in that right.

110
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,640
Similarly, the order statistic in this interval is equivalent to say you have as minus

111
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,800
one in front of it and one in the interval it has minus one in front of it.

112
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:34,790
That just means as minus R minus one in this interval, because we already said, you know, the distribution for before this you plus two you.

113
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:44,150
And finally we have a minus as minus one plus.

114
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,700
In the last, you know,

115
00:16:50,260 --> 00:17:01,589
the majesty of I say equivalently but so why are light as falling to those two interval is equivalent to say you have a distribution

116
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:12,000
like this are minus one or assignable one second well as minus R minus one third Y in fourth and minus as in the last name.

117
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,930
And the probability of that equivalent event is much easier to calculate.

118
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,209
Due to the poverty of this random sample.

119
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:32,230
His idea is essentially just repeated experiments in the trials.

120
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,490
Each child had five possible outcomes depending on where it falls.

121
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:46,480
Right. And that exactly is a five domino distribution or multilevel distribution with five possible outcomes.

122
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,050
Yes. What about this approach to the proof makes it not rigorous.

123
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,580
So again,

124
00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:02,230
I see you said like the technical correct way to go about it is to find the general joint distribution of all the statistics and integrate things out.

125
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,800
What about this approach makes it not rigorous?

126
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:15,720
Very good question. So this approach, we call it informal M.A, because here.

127
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:20,980
So when in the first place, what do we want to derive is the joint opinion.

128
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:30,520
Right. So that's what we have care about. But the PDF itself cannot be directly derived using this idea because the PDF

129
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,930
file continuous random variable does not carry this probability interpretation.

130
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:41,890
So we have to multiply these small quantities to make it approximately equal to a probability.

131
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:48,400
So that is the part where it's involved. But you can make it more formal by taking the limit.

132
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:57,670
I use them a limited operation because essentially this PDA function is the limit of this probability divided by this small animals.

133
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,110
If you take the limit of the Y art, the house goes to infinity.

134
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,850
The ratio of this probability and the Y are the White House is essentially the PDA.

135
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:15,340
In that sense, if you read this rigorously, write it out using this limit language, then it becomes a form crook.

136
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:22,130
Okay. But again, the most standard way I mean,

137
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:30,740
the way that that that is guaranteed to give you the final result would be first find that

138
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:39,290
drawing distribution and that marginalized market integrate out the irrelevant random oracles.

139
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:49,160
That would always give you that the correct answer regardless of whether it's continuous or discrete or about a mix of this two random,

140
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:57,290
two types of random animals. So that is always the, you know, the most standard way of deriving the job distribution.

141
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:06,200
So here in this particular case, for deriving the distribution of order statistic, we can take this this clever,

142
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:16,010
more clever approach and it's, you know, give us easier way of finding the final expression, but it's not always the case.

143
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,850
This treatment obviously may not work for other statistics.

144
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,550
It works for other statistics or for statistics.

145
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,540
Right. And other questions. Okay.

146
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:37,330
So again, here, this ugly form is the drug distribution for this to honor statistics.

147
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:44,700
You can you can say for hours and hours, they can be any integer about it from 1 to 10.

148
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,700
And we just need to make sure that our last sentence.

149
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:55,680
And with this polymer, you can also derive the drawing distribution for me and the max.

150
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:04,780
For example, by taking Article one as and or you can take any pair from the order statistic you get to the joint distribution.

151
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:17,290
And another observation is that if you look at the expression of the and the you and these are not separable.

152
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:21,370
The other words, you cannot write this right hand side of the equation,

153
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:29,800
right hand side formula as a part of a function that only about you and a product of the function that only about V,

154
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:37,390
which suggests that these two antivirals may not be independent, which is very reasonable.

155
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,640
Right. Because the other statistics. They should not be independent.

156
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:52,680
It depends on one another. At least we know that y our is always the last number to nurse ratio between the two animals.

157
00:21:54,340 --> 00:22:05,500
They are not independent. All right, so y example we can think about what is the expression for a uniform random sample?

158
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:15,190
Assume that you have a uniform random sample. So, yy1, two, y and I I.D. from this uniform.

159
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,990
Zero one. As a result,

160
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:32,530
we know the PDA app is equal to one on this zero one interval and CDP is equal to the identity function and is equal to Y 0 to 1 interval.

161
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:40,240
If we plug everything in together joint distribution for the hours and hours order statistic for this uniform,

162
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:45,129
we can make this expression a constant multiplier.

163
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:56,080
This due to the power of our minus one b minus due to the power as minus R minus one and one -72 hour and minus S.

164
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:10,110
And what is the support for this? What is the support in terms of who you want to be?

165
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,060
First of all, think about what is the park for you? What is the ranch that they are attempting?

166
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,590
Air is the smaller one of this two.

167
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,870
Right. So the smallest variant can be as small as zero.

168
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,040
Right. So it's greater than zero.

169
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:59,239
But what about the largest value you could. Beat the very good cop to be right, because this y r is a smaller while.

170
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:08,870
This two if we know the y has to be done, y are must be smaller are equal to be or in this case it's continuous.

171
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,230
So it doesn't really matter whenever we take this equal sign or not.

172
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,160
So you is between zero and a v corresponding a v.

173
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:23,060
The smallest matter is you and large amount is one. So this is the support of it's joint distribution.

174
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,860
So if you're drawing on this plan. So this is you this is.

175
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:34,230
We have. Zero one.

176
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:42,780
So you smaller. This is a support for that joint distribution.

177
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:54,330
You can only take this this pair of honor statistics how it takes values in this triangle area outside of the triangle area.

178
00:24:54,510 --> 00:25:00,870
The PDF the drawing period is always zero. That's this.

179
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:07,920
And then you can also think about integrating out one of this order statistics and check whether

180
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:14,310
the marginal or the other order statistic agrees with the formula that we derived last time.

181
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,440
So that's an exercise that you can do after cost.

182
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:25,290
And when you do the integration, make sure you use the correct integration limit.

183
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:39,900
Okay. If you want to integrate out of you, you want to integrate all this that y are, then this view has to be from zero to a V instead of 0 to 1.

184
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:47,200
Right. So that will give you a function of V and that function is the marginal period of life.

185
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:51,600
That's the has the order statistics and vice versa.

186
00:25:53,970 --> 00:26:02,490
Any questions? So that is the joint distribution for a pair.

187
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:11,910
And we can further extend it to the joint distribution for all of them and for all of them.

188
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:20,640
Again, there are different ways to think about how to divide this joint distribution for all of our statistics.

189
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:27,780
The solution is that the joint distribution is the PDF of the joint PDF.

190
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:32,340
All this order statistics is own factorial times.

191
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,460
The product of this marginal. Yes.

192
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:41,880
For each individual random out of a y. Right.

193
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:51,360
So originally you have this random sample y one to y and the drawing distribution for y.

194
00:26:51,360 --> 00:27:02,450
One to y. And. He's our I.D. at the y y.

195
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:08,410
So the drawing distribution for the original random sample is what is the paradox right now for us?

196
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,740
I, for one, has asked why what?

197
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:19,759
Why I want to try and distribution for this.

198
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:27,060
All our statistics instead of, you know, additions to this card out of this marginal.

199
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:31,790
You also have one additional term as an factorial.

200
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:40,550
So there is a difference between this to the drawing distribution of the original random sample and the drawn distribution of this order statistics.

201
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:46,010
So now let's try to consider why there is a difference between those two.

202
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:57,500
So that's to recall, thus the number of permutations or and distinct items.

203
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:06,350
If you have to consider how many different ways to organize this and distinct items, there are other factors in total.

204
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:14,090
Organize them in a lot. So that's the number of permutations for these items.

205
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:20,150
So essentially one way to think about why the joint distribution for this other statistic

206
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:29,780
take this form is to think of this order statistics for each given value you want to use.

207
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:41,030
First of all, we have to be ordered. All you want has to be less than you to less than three all the way to you.

208
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:45,800
So that's the support of this joint distribution of order statistics.

209
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:55,400
For any given value you want to use and satisfy this ordering, how many different ways that you can create the original random sample?

210
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:04,170
That's exactly right. Given an order sequence,

211
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,930
you want to you when you can arbitrarily move that sequence to get a different copy of the original

212
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:18,220
random sample and in total now will be own factorial different ways to got the original random sample.

213
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:22,540
So that's one way to think about why you need to have this editorial.

214
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:32,170
The second part of this joint PDF function essentially tells us what's the probability of observing this different values in the original sample.

215
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:40,210
And the first just tells us how many different ways we can reorganize this and items to get our original sample.

216
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:50,020
So that's why you have an factorial in front of this product term in order to divide the drawing area by the order statistics.

217
00:29:53,590 --> 00:30:05,450
Other words, for each sequence you want to use, it corresponds to which you want to use.

218
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:27,380
And this way. And.

219
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:06,860
For each sequence. You want to use this y one to y hand this order statistic.

220
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:12,710
Taking the value of this sequence is corresponding to factorial cases.

221
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:22,870
In the original sample space where Y went to Y and can either take the original sequence or any permutation of that sequence.

222
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:32,830
So there is this one two factorial relationship between this order statistics and the original samples from the samples.

223
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:41,890
So that's why our reason why the random sample, the probability of y one to y and taking this value is the product of this PD out function.

224
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:51,730
Evaluate that you want to do. Now, the probability of this all statistics taking this sequence is battery of the same product.

225
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:01,090
And there is the support for the statistics.

226
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:08,020
So that's one way to think about why the joint distribution take this particular box.

227
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:15,190
Alternatively, you can also think about using this interval idea to break this down into.

228
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:23,560
Essentially break this down into this and different intervals.

229
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:39,190
And that's the extreme case of this multinational case, where essentially they have to break it down into this two and plus y intervals.

230
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,710
Right. So so this is one way of thinking about it.

231
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:54,020
Alternative way of thinking about it is this same idea you want, you want, you want, right?

232
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:03,810
Then you have YouTube, YouTube plus YouTube all the way to the last one, you and the end plus unit.

233
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:15,879
So the probability of this one falling to the first thing of all y to follow it to the second level and all the way to y and the hands order

234
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:30,790
statistic falling to the last interval is equivalent to say you have a random sample with distribution of 0101 and one zero in this two one,

235
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:43,450
two, one plus one animals. So then you can use this maltin on the idea multi nominal pdf partner to derive this joint distribution same as before.

236
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:55,090
Just need to work out what's the probability for each interval and then plug it in to this multinational my function to evaluate this joint opinion.

237
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:06,040
I'll take that as a exercise for you. And so there are two different ways to think about why we think got this joint PDF in this in this department.

238
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:15,980
After all this. This is the joint PDF for the end all statistics.

239
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,770
The format is much simpler compared to the previous ones.

240
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:29,140
It's just factorial times the product of individual premiums divided into different bodies.

241
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:33,050
Okay. And pay special attention to this support.

242
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:40,100
You always have to make sure that you wise the last time you tune all the way to you in its order sequence.

243
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:47,960
Any questions? All right.

244
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,210
Now, since we know this joint distribution,

245
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:59,150
we can rework the marginal distributions for order statistics and the marginal distribution of pairwise order statistics,

246
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,820
in particular to get a marginal distribution for our eyes order statistics.

247
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:12,799
As we are here. The most brute force way to do it is to first plug in this joint distribution

248
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,410
for an order of statistics and then integrate out the irrelevant random hours.

249
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:34,250
12i might want and I just want to add the words to this marginal PDF or why we just need to solve this m minus one integration.

250
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:44,150
So. Not clear.

251
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:49,220
So that's the most per false way of deriving the marginal distribution a while.

252
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,210
We just need to solve this up and minus one integration.

253
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:03,890
It's actually it's pretty straightforward how to do it, but practically it's much more complicated.

254
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:12,980
A computation is much, much more involved compared to the previous idea of using this material to approximately derive a PDA function.

255
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,440
So let's see how we can actually solve this a minus Y integration.

256
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:26,480
So first, let's do it for the first run, a variable to it for this Y one.

257
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:33,380
In other words, we are trying to solve this integration of that joint PDA.

258
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:47,350
With respect to you want to recall that the values this a U values has to satisfy this sequence you want has to be strictly last thing.

259
00:36:48,170 --> 00:37:00,110
So when we integrate and integrate this joint PDA with respect to you want the integration limit going to be not to infinity to you to right.

260
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,770
So that's the first same equation that we take for this joint PDA.

261
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:14,190
Why don't you take a couple of minutes, try to solve this call this joint media have the format of factorial.

262
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,870
Murdoch Oh, I won't mind.

263
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:22,710
Uh, why you.

264
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:31,230
This is what you mean. So this.

265
00:37:41,730 --> 00:38:46,340
Yes. Because work on this first step first to get it,

266
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:58,250
a first step of solving this minus Y integration is just to solve this univariate integration with respect to if you want.

267
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:47,950
And we got it. All right.

268
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,620
So let's look at this together and see how to do it.

269
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:58,850
Now, in order to solve this univariate integration, we just need to look inside this integration.

270
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:02,600
Which term actually involves you? One, right.

271
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:07,850
And if that does not involve you, what is the second step in this problem?

272
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:13,640
Factorial doesn't involve you. What doesn't?

273
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,880
Right. It's just a constant. So you don't have to worry about it.

274
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:24,260
And in this product term, only one term that is involved here, one that is at Y,

275
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:32,569
you want all the other terms they are at y UI are not equal to one in this problem.

276
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:35,810
Again, they are just constant. I don't have to worry about them.

277
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:41,510
As a result, all I need to do is to take all this constant, irrelevant counsel.

278
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:56,990
Right. And apply it and solve this integration from 1920 for you to have y you want you want.

279
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:02,000
So what is the integration of this at y you want?

280
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:07,460
The integration of the pdf is one CDM.

281
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:13,790
Right? So this is exactly at y you are to.

282
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,370
Because we are integrating from nothing infinity to YouTube.

283
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:22,880
So that gave us the answer to this first integration.

284
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:30,690
I own factorial my problem to divide and why do I have to laugh?

285
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:34,320
Why YouTube? Right.

286
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:41,280
So that is the first step. So we are one step closer to our final result.

287
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:52,980
So next we kept doing it. And next one, we need to solve the integration with respect to you, to recall that you want is out of the picture now.

288
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,450
So we don't have to worry about you.

289
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:02,820
Now we are dealing with this function that is a minus one dimensional function of you two, you three, all the way through your hand.

290
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:09,010
So what is the range? Are you two? What is the smallest model?

291
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:13,580
You two? Is it you want to negative infinity?

292
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,230
It's not going to infinity. Right?

293
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,730
Because again, you want has been integrated out.

294
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,050
So you do not have to concern you want anymore.

295
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:31,470
You always come. So now the lower limit for you two becomes negative infinite.

296
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:41,940
But upper limit is a you have three Ukrainian for you, five all the way to U.N. is still in the function.

297
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:48,750
So that's the integration limit for you, too, is from nothing to infinity to you or three.

298
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,580
And we plot what are we just got in this integration?

299
00:42:54,180 --> 00:43:01,800
And here is what we are trying to solve in this step. I am factorial or not I from two.

300
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,780
And why?

301
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:12,810
I have to ask why go to the YouTube?

302
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:25,430
This is one of our consultants. This is slightly complicated on the previous step because if you think about which terms involve YouTube,

303
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:35,410
not only there is one term inside this product that allows you to, but also this last term also involves you to write the contract.

304
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:47,450
So what's the integration? Let's take all this house and outside this integration three.

305
00:43:48,630 --> 00:44:07,220
As much. What is our original function?

306
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:14,110
But this time. Part of this pdaf and CD.

307
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:26,190
The Square of Syria. All right.

308
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:37,230
So if you take the derivative of the square and CDF that gave you two times the CDF times the derivative of that Syria,

309
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:41,490
which is the PDA in a constant one over two in prime.

310
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:47,790
So you essentially solving this integration, you also have this close form solution.

311
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:56,820
So that is this one over to the CDR function squared evaluated from negative infinity to three.

312
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:05,790
Once you plug it in, you can say this guy is equal to one over two and y you a three squared.

313
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:13,980
So that just gives us a solution to the second integration, which is just like three.

314
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:28,380
And if I ask one square you three, that is a solution for the second integration.

315
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:35,250
Then you just keep doing it until you got the I minus once term.

316
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:42,690
Namely, you integrate out all the items before the eyes order statistics.

317
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,520
And if you do it, you will be able to get this result. Okay.

318
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:54,300
So every time you find the original function evaluated the corresponding integration limit.

319
00:45:54,930 --> 00:46:06,690
And finally, joint distribution of why I am plus one by a plus two all the way to why is this and factorial over II minus one factorial times.

320
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:21,960
These are not of the PDFs and the CDF at UI to the power of I minus one because do it by six by induction or you can just do it.

321
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:32,280
So repeatedly do what we just did. Okay. Now we are at this ice order statistic.

322
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:39,630
You cannot repeat what you just did because ice order statistics is exactly what do we want.

323
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:47,730
So we have to start from the other side of this of this sequence and integrate out this other.

324
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:53,010
You are minus one, you minus two all the way to you and UI plus one.

325
00:46:53,830 --> 00:47:00,210
Right? So now you start doing from the other in particular, if we do it from the other end,

326
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:04,050
the first step, whether we need to do is to solve this integration.

327
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:08,820
Okay. So integrate out this function, integrate out this unit.

328
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:13,350
And if you would have this function, the only terms that involve you.

329
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:17,190
When is this app? You want? Exactly the same idea.

330
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:27,270
All right, so you solve it, and it can say one thing that is different from the previous one is that now the integration

331
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:32,070
limit becomes slightly different as you go from the largest one to the smallest one.

332
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:37,500
So the largest one have a gross limit of you and minus one to positive infinity.

333
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:45,290
Integrate that term and evaluate it from you in minus one to the positive entity.

334
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:48,510
You got this survival function set up to see the our function.

335
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:54,720
We got one minus the senior functions. That's a the idea is exactly the same.

336
00:47:54,930 --> 00:48:08,100
You do it one step at a time. Finally, after solving all of it, we can got this equation a marginal PDF for the eyes order statistics.

337
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:13,950
Take this particular point, this constant times, this PDF function.

338
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:24,690
Sorry, this CDF function to the power of Amos one and this survival function to the power and minus side and this PDF function.

339
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:30,960
And if you look back to the previous slides from the last lecture,

340
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:39,750
that's exactly the same function that we have at ten for our univariate order statistics.

341
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,330
Right? Previously we do it, do them in three intervals.

342
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:51,600
Now we do it. You did this joint integration and we got the same solution.

343
00:48:55,790 --> 00:49:02,480
This kind of competition can be a little bit tedious, but hopefully you got the idea.

344
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:07,180
So the idea should be relatively straightforward to do on our set, right?

345
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:13,490
We just start from the drawing distribution and then integrate, integrate out irrelevant variables.

346
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:20,240
We've got what I want. If you do it step by step, you can gradually go to this final solution.

347
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:25,690
All right. Any questions?

348
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:43,070
All right. So let's take a break and come back to you.

349
00:49:45,420 --> 00:50:13,060
Absolutely. Do you have any idea at all?

350
00:50:13,190 --> 00:51:04,459
As you know, this has either one of these you know, I will tell you why it's so sequential.

351
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:27,960
The chocolate bar in this case, if you look at what we're doing here,

352
00:51:31,730 --> 00:52:26,950
it's almost as if you really want to do your due diligence is going to show you how to do it.

353
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:57,110
Well, you should do it all back to your options so that you don't have to congregate because you've also been comfortable.

354
00:52:57,110 --> 00:53:04,290
We all know what to do if you if you find out what's going on.

355
00:53:04,880 --> 00:54:16,310
Well, good, though. I was just going to look, I hope that we can help with that, but we also do our own and watch what it feels like.

356
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:23,720
You're probably functioning well, I mean, a lot of people.

357
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:42,730
But, you know. To do it this way.

358
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:49,120
And then it's like, well, you know, when you think about it,

359
00:54:49,190 --> 00:55:19,480
but you think about it like it makes sense with the right people, if you know what I mean.

360
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:23,790
I think so.

361
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:31,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

362
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:44,390
So, you know, I just, you know,

363
00:55:46,150 --> 00:56:16,690
that was just how do we make more sense to talk about that but added controversial issues that I do hope to be able to do that squared as it

364
00:56:19,810 --> 00:57:48,000
for if you know you have a decent job you work with a lot of guys that are working mothers and you don't want people to want to talk to,

365
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:52,470
you know, highly.

366
00:57:52,480 --> 00:58:16,150
And of course, you know how they're doing, what you're going to do.

367
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:41,400
You know, it's all about whether or not you're entitled to have the notion of what makes no sense at all.

368
00:58:46,470 --> 00:59:17,560
Well, yeah. He was asked to tell us how to operate in this country.

369
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:26,550
We want to.

370
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:45,150
Just having. Don't want to talk to me.

371
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:54,710
You know how to play with fire.

372
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:17,450
So you should try this.

373
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:29,480
All right. That's reasons for removal.

374
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:36,090
Any question about this derivation? I.

375
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:47,330
Let's. That's another very important statistic that is induced from this statistic.

376
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:51,380
That is the range of a random sample.

377
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:58,880
So the range, as the name suggests, is defined by the max minus the means of a random sample.

378
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:04,520
And so this is also a function of this random sample.

379
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:10,400
So by definition, it's a statistic by just so we can derive is distribution.

380
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:16,370
And in particular, we can derive the distribution using the joint of this Y one.

381
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:24,110
And why it is that me and Max statistics assume that we have a random sample size and

382
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:30,589
we set our to be one as to be add this to our statistics from the previous slides.

383
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:37,140
We know that joint distribution for this me and Max statistics take this area

384
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:44,870
showing PDA and factorial divided by two factorial in other words and times n

385
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:52,020
minus one times the difference of the function of the values to the power of I'm

386
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:59,000
minus two and the print out of this to the part out of this to pd l function.

387
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:08,760
And what is the support? You must be okay.

388
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:15,919
That's the support with this joint distribution of the ME.

389
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:23,780
And we can consider how to drive the distribution of the reg, which is defined by y and minus one.

390
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:34,690
You cannot directly derive the distribution for lion minus one from this choice.

391
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:46,689
But what we can do is we can introduce one redundant variable so that we can make it a two 1 to 1 transformation of a spiral,

392
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:49,629
a random variable from the Myanmars to this.

393
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:59,940
Ah, and the one way to introduce this additional redundant vulnerable is just saying this means statistics to be adopted.

394
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:05,760
That way we have a 1 to 1 transformation from the original pair to this new part.

395
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:12,010
Once we have this 1 to 1 transformation, we can take advantage of what we have learned.

396
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:17,479
Well, there's joint transformation that you're at play right now with the joint distribution for our

397
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:26,110
and W and then marginalize it to get the margin of our which is our on our being interesting.

398
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:38,890
All right. So you can take that out to got the distribution for this branch statistics and that's actually a very common technique used in practice.

399
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:50,710
If you have the joint distribution for multivariate random matter, but we want to get the distribution for some function of those random actors.

400
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:56,290
Then instead of directly working out the distribution for that function,

401
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:03,910
you can think about whether you can create some redundant random variables so that to make a 1 to 1 transformation.

402
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:13,750
Originally, if the dimension is P, you can create a P minus one to make it up to P transformation, as that's a 1 to 1 transformation.

403
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:18,670
If I always use that joint transformation that we have learned, right,

404
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:25,150
you can always use that formula to help you directly write out the drawing PDF for the new parent variable.

405
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:32,740
Once you have the joint new P join to run a variable distribution, then you can do the integration,

406
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:37,570
integrate out and run up and run observables to get the marginal of what you want.

407
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:42,560
So that's a very common technique to use in practice.

408
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:57,710
And so in this case, we just introduced one additional value so that we can have a mean max transformation to R and W again,

409
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:01,670
that's our to do our to 1 to 1 transformation. Okay.

410
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:11,480
So in order to use not joint transformation, we need to follow this the steps first work out this image transformation.

411
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:27,470
If R is defined as Y and minus one is defined as y one, it's workout y one is equal to W and y and equal to W plus r, right?

412
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:36,350
That's the inverse transformation which we're going to need subsequently to write out this joint distribution for our topic.

413
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:48,140
So we need to derive that jakobi and this that's a copy of Matrix which is defined as R over one,

414
01:05:48,920 --> 01:06:08,210
R over and w over one w it take this partial derivatives, we'll find another 1110.

415
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:24,980
And that's. So this determinant of this y absolute value inverse is just equal to one, right?

416
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:29,040
So I think that determinant, that's not what they want to do about it.

417
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:32,250
That's what the inverse is still one.

418
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:36,120
That's the outcome. These in a strong transformation.

419
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:43,320
So good. All right. And that's we can put everything together.

420
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:50,460
And so the joint distribution for this RW is essentially the joint distribution for Y one.

421
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:57,090
And why are y, y, y and evaluated at this?

422
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:14,010
Of these values. Right. So that's the W and W plus R times a determinant of the code in absolute value universe.

423
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:20,890
But the point in this W and W plus R to the strong distribution for Y one.

424
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:40,190
And we got this other. And timezone minus one is to see the function difference and minus two and this two PDL function minus W one at W plus r.

425
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:49,940
So that is that joint distribution or our end up finally to got the marginals for are we just need to integrate out.

426
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:56,660
W And one more thing before we do the integration.

427
01:07:57,260 --> 01:08:04,900
What is the reg what is the support for this new round of arrivals are in Dublin now think about how our w our

428
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:16,850
define avenue is defined as y one right and r is defined as the difference between the maths and the mean.

429
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:25,240
Is there any constraint on that? There's no compromise.

430
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:29,840
What about arts greater than zero?

431
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:33,890
All right. So that's the support.

432
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:38,570
From now that it's free, R has to be greater than zero.

433
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:49,910
This is the support. So when you derive this marginal part is the integrated out that says it's free.

434
01:08:50,290 --> 01:09:01,210
The integration limit is from that to infinity. So there is no close form in general for this integration, but for specific problems.

435
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:10,370
Once you plug in the corresponding pdf CDF, you may be able to solve this integration explicitly, but there is no generic form of its.

436
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:22,840
So that's how we can derive the distribution PR function for the ranch.

437
01:09:23,110 --> 01:09:26,440
Another very important statistic from the random sample.

438
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:35,350
Let's take a look at an example to derive the ranch that the a out of a range of uniform distribution.

439
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:50,820
So if a uniform we know the PDF is cast that CDP is identity function, so we just plug it in.

440
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:57,960
So we call that distribution. The PDL function is to say integration of this guy.

441
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,950
So you can plug everything in. This is what we try to solve.

442
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:12,600
And minus one, the integration. Now for W recall that W is defined as y one.

443
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:21,330
Right? It's no longer an infinity. Infinity because of the support of the original random variable is not from 93 bit.

444
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:28,140
So we need to recognize the support of the original retroviral.

445
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:34,410
So the original variable is from 0 to 1. So the first order statistic is also from 0 to 1.

446
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:45,420
All right. And the more that we have, this falls apart.

447
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:04,850
So let's start our regional farm in our first.

448
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:48,050
If. This is the origin of.

449
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:58,030
All right, and we know this w1r is one minus one.

450
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:05,030
So in order to solve this integration, we need to make sure that the integration limit is correctly specified.

451
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:12,080
In this case, it's a little bit tricky because the original line of our is both from 0 to 1.

452
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:20,450
So we know this guy is equal to one. W is from 0 to 1 and this guy is also from 0 to 1.

453
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:30,950
If W plus R is from 0 to 1, but to take both into account that defines the limit of this integration.

454
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:34,880
And that's going to be from 0 to 1 minus.

455
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:41,160
This one minus already comes from the fact that this is the second opinion.

456
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:48,530
In order for it to be a constant equal to one established boss, R has to be bounded from 0 to 1.

457
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:55,550
So this is where this one minus R is obtained.

458
01:12:57,530 --> 01:13:04,880
W has to be in this branch and W plus are also to be in this branch.

459
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:16,400
Solving this together we got W we are zero less than one minus R and R is greater than zero.

460
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:54,030
So now you can plug in the corresponding values that are solving this integration to solve it, and then minus one or two.

461
01:13:59,590 --> 01:14:13,710
Are between zero and one. So what is this distribution? R is between zero and one, right?

462
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:18,370
And this is a PDA function that has support from 0 to 1.

463
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:28,990
And if you look on the kernel, it is are two a power and one minus R to another power to the distribution.

464
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:36,810
Our distribution with parameter and minus one and two.

465
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:47,090
Minus one minus one. And this was too much for the promoter, but the beta is a minus one to.

466
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:58,410
So this case we have the exploited distribution for the range of a uniform random sample.

467
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:04,950
The ranch follows a beta distribution with parameter and minus one and two.

468
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:21,559
Questions. If I change this random random sample distribution to another one, for example,

469
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:28,250
the normal should also be able to derive what is the wrench following exactly the same idea.

470
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:33,890
I plug in the corresponding values and pay special attention to this integration element.

471
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:49,730
The generic format does not change. It only change because base PD functions and will be zero outside the support of the corresponding random animal.

472
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:54,320
That gave you this integration 11 times.

473
01:15:58,730 --> 01:16:12,410
Since it's far from that distribution, we can also easily derive the mean for this range statistics.

474
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:15,859
Since it's a beta with parameter and minus one and two, and no,

475
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:33,710
the mean is an plus and minus one plus two over and plus one all minus one over m minus two plus one minus one plus two.

476
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:40,490
So that is going to be a minus one over M plus and plus one.

477
01:16:42,350 --> 01:16:52,160
As you can say, I'm gonna say infinity. This guy goes to one, which means the larger the sample size is, the larger the ranges.

478
01:16:52,430 --> 01:16:56,329
And the upper bound is just the one which makes sense.

479
01:16:56,330 --> 01:17:03,650
Right? Your random sample cannot exceed 0 to 1 animal for the largest possible branch you have even better sample run.

480
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:06,950
The sample on this interval is going to be approximate equal to one.

481
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:17,740
And on the other hand, if you only have to run the samples from this uniform distribution zero one,

482
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:23,680
then the expectation is two minus one or two plus one,

483
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:33,160
which is one third, which is the expected value of the distance between two uniform run of animals.

484
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:46,030
So this when you pointed to two, we no expectation of our is equal to one third and that is the expectation.

485
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:59,610
Of the difference of the distance Ukrainian distance between this two numbers on the uniform on this is zero.

486
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:12,290
Both are uniform. Since you randomly throw two values onto this zero one interval, then the expected value of the distance is one third.

487
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:19,459
That actually corresponds to a one of our previous example where we ask What's

488
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:24,230
the probability of the distance between those two numbers on the interval?

489
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:32,860
That's one third. Any questions?

490
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:46,300
Right. Another statistics that we can also derive from this order statistics is called the spacing statistics.

491
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:51,330
Consider a set of statistics. Why one to why and where?

492
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:56,590
Why? I mean, these are all positive, positive, random variables.

493
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:59,110
Recall that the drawing distribution,

494
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:08,979
the drawing period is equal to this guide with factorial times the product of this pdp's embodiment of this variance.

495
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:16,510
Y1 two y and we can define this the following set of invalid barrels.

496
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:20,830
And we call them the normalized spacing.

497
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:31,270
In particular Z one is defined as end times Y one the two defined as a minus one times, y two minus one, and so on, so forth.

498
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:36,610
The Z is defined as Y and minus y and minus one, right?

499
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:43,630
So graphically what that means is there you have these all of these random arrivals that are positive.

500
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:55,590
That's our assumption. Okay. So we can consider everything start at zero or y1y to be ordered all the way to y.

501
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:08,650
And so what the Z want is you think about this distance, that's z one overhead.

502
01:20:10,290 --> 01:20:14,670
Right. And it's about the distance between why two and why one?

503
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:21,210
That's the Z two over and minus one and so on and so forth.

504
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:28,500
Every conservative, every pair of conservative, that consecutive order statistic, the distance is just that.

505
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:34,650
The corresponding this spacing, normalized spacing run a variable divided by a constant.

506
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:41,190
So the last one is zero, which is the distance between Y and Y and minus one.

507
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:48,030
Alternatively, you can also think about drawing line segments from zero,

508
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:56,730
always starting from zero and drawing to ay1, two, y two, one, three, and all the way up to wire.

509
01:20:57,410 --> 01:21:04,379
Okay. If you sum up all these distances, that's exactly Z.

510
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:16,410
Once you add up all of these the line segments that starting from the zero to this Y, one to Y and that's how z once it sum up all this distance is.

511
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:29,470
That's our Z two and so on. So a pause. And the last one segment, if you just sum up this one, this one alone is the best.

512
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:32,320
So that's what this Z1 is. The end is.

513
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:45,960
Responding to this are order statistics we want to aren't in 2014 they want to see and that's why we call it the normal spacing.

514
01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:54,150
Right questions. Then the question is, what is the joint distribution for this?

515
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:58,620
They want to ask again and what are the properties on this is that you want to as in you.

516
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:11,800
Another property based on how these busy watches are created.

517
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:21,760
You can see some of this 012 as the end is essentially the summation of why one to win on this question, because if you sum up Z one, Z two,

518
01:22:22,030 --> 01:22:30,670
all the way to the end is just summing up all the baseline segments, starting from 0 to 1, one to y, two to y three, all the way to y.

519
01:22:31,270 --> 01:22:38,020
So the summation of Z is equal to the summation of the Y and the summation of this order.

520
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:44,980
Statistics, by definition, is also equal to the summation of the original random sample split.

521
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:49,660
That's a nice property for this all of this normalized spacing.

522
01:22:49,930 --> 01:22:55,060
So now the question is, what is the joint distribution by this normalized spacing right about.

523
01:22:56,740 --> 01:23:02,080
I give you a couple of minutes trying to derive the drawing distribution or this normalized spacing,

524
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:11,950
random variables to think about how to derive this distribution using what we can see on this page.

525
01:24:57,830 --> 01:28:38,290
It's. Added.

526
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:07,530
Let's look at this together. So the goal is to derive the drug distribution policies, spacing the statistics.

527
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:14,880
And if you think about the original statistics, this is why I use.

528
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:21,370
She ordered statistics.

529
01:29:21,550 --> 01:29:25,840
I write about her which has a size n right.

530
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:31,300
And for this new statistics Z, it also has size.

531
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:34,660
And so it's an end to end transformation.

532
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:40,570
But in order to apply the formula that we have learned for the joint transformation,

533
01:29:40,930 --> 01:29:49,090
we need to make sure that this is a 1 to 1 function, even if it's an orange or our n is not necessarily mean.

534
01:29:49,270 --> 01:29:50,650
It's a 1 to 1 transformation.

535
01:29:51,670 --> 01:30:00,489
We can only use that result if it's a 1 to 1 transformation and to verify that it's a 1 to 1 transformation, one way to do it is work.

536
01:30:00,490 --> 01:30:12,639
How this inverse transformation person and say whether that is 1 to 1 these we know that for a given set up y12y and we only have a unique z one, two.

537
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:19,810
Is that right? If we kind of work out this a reverse formation, then with a given set of z one to the N,

538
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:25,630
we know there is only exist one set of y12y, and then it becomes a 1 to 1 transformation.

539
01:30:26,530 --> 01:30:31,450
So that's one way to, to verify that this is a 1 to 1 transformation.

540
01:30:32,020 --> 01:30:41,820
In particular, based on how Z are defined, we can work out what this image transformation is particular.

541
01:30:42,190 --> 01:30:50,350
We got yy1 equal to one over and z one.

542
01:30:50,650 --> 01:31:01,530
Hey, y two, you've got to. The one over and lost the two over and minus one.

543
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:05,700
And now you can work out iteratively until the last one.

544
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:16,350
The ends order statistics is equal to Z, one over the Z, two over the minus one all the way to the end.

545
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:25,620
So indeed, this is a 1 to 1 transformation with one side of y, you've got a one set of Z and with one set of Z, you've got a one set of Y.

546
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:30,420
Okay. And we can also work out the to copy a matrix.

547
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:50,080
It's the partial derivative of the Z over Y, and that gave us this lower triangle to our triangle in our matrix of the 000 this.

548
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:59,210
Two and minus one and minus one 000.

549
01:32:00,150 --> 01:32:09,090
And so on, so forth. So you can say the output triangle is always zero, the diagonal is now zero, and the lower triangle is now zero.

550
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:17,060
Says We only care about the determinant of this. Tobin All we need to do is to look at the dial, right?

551
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:26,580
The diagonal going to be a minus one and minus two. I lost my way to calculate the determinant of this Jacobean.

552
01:32:29,890 --> 01:32:35,780
That's going to be that's hard right now.

553
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:44,040
With that, we can put everything together to try to derive the joint distribution for the Z you want to see.

554
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:51,340
Is that joint distribution or this y order statistics?

555
01:32:52,570 --> 01:32:57,140
Why? Why y. Yeah.

556
01:33:05,130 --> 01:33:13,100
She? I am chairman of that recording inverters.

557
01:33:13,910 --> 01:33:19,370
So we have an actuarial I'm a part of.

558
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:25,320
I want to figure out why the.

559
01:33:27,830 --> 01:33:47,900
Time is. And it's not why.

560
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:53,030
And that's why.

561
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:17,040
As a final expression for this normalized space in random.

562
01:34:19,410 --> 01:34:28,860
Part of this and. Each one being the period of the original random variable evaluate different variants.

563
01:34:29,310 --> 01:34:37,860
The first one divided by 2z1 over and second y value is z one over and z two over the last one and all the way to the last one.

564
01:34:39,890 --> 01:34:49,220
And finally, what's the last? Are we down here or do we need to do one more step?

565
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:59,540
And to consider deriving this joint distribution.

566
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:07,000
Yes. The support the support never forgot the support.

567
01:35:08,050 --> 01:35:11,380
And so the support is very important. So what is the support in this?

568
01:35:15,730 --> 01:35:19,960
Recall that we talked about, if you want to ride the support,

569
01:35:21,190 --> 01:35:29,800
you can take advantage of this immersive transformation because we know what the support is for the original right of animals.

570
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:42,729
And from these humorous transformation, we can got this constraint on this new transformed set of animals on our original run of our eyeballs.

571
01:35:42,730 --> 01:35:48,040
We know, first of all, all of them has to be positive, right.

572
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:51,820
Second is, we want to win. They are all our statistics.

573
01:35:54,130 --> 01:35:57,850
Those are the two constraints that we have on our original run of ours.

574
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:03,790
If they are positive, then everything here has to be positive.

575
01:36:04,330 --> 01:36:08,410
So that's one constraint and it is our statistic.

576
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:14,740
That just means y two has to be greater than what one by three has to be greater than two, and so on and so forth.

577
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:25,210
And if you particularly look at this, how this Y one and one, two and three are expressed using these Z one, two is again very common terms.

578
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:28,030
And each time you only add one additional terms.

579
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:37,030
So in order to make an increase in making an increasing sequence is to make sure that this added terms are positive.

580
01:36:38,650 --> 01:36:47,830
Right. So combining both, you can say the support is going to be z one greater than zero, the two greater than zero all the way to zero.

581
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:55,299
We are then zero. That's the support for this normalize spacing.

582
01:36:55,300 --> 01:37:02,170
Right about again, it's derived from these numbers.

583
01:37:04,530 --> 01:37:09,090
Transformation and the support of our original run of animals.

584
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:15,570
Using those two, you can drop the support of this transform, right of animal.

585
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:20,160
In this case, it's very special. It's in the first quadrant.

586
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:31,110
Okay. So all this run of animals, anyone who is the end has to be greater than zero and there is no constraint between different rhinovirus.

587
01:37:33,050 --> 01:37:36,050
All right. Any questions?

588
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:43,410
So that is the distribution, joint distribution by the normalized space.

589
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:47,700
Now, let's look at a special example, a special case of that.

590
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:57,960
Assuming our random sample is a exponential random variable so that they are positive and the pdf of individual media is this exponential anyhow,

591
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:03,690
with lambda being the parameter, I'm not asking for the y.

592
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:10,379
The drawn distribution for this random sample is lambda to the power of an exponential to

593
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:16,520
this not have lambda so y and the jaundice this unable to alter statistics at this point.

594
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:28,530
Okay, so this these are times and factoring and here you have y10 all the way to y and greater than zero.

595
01:38:28,770 --> 01:38:43,710
And here notice that because the different support so y and we result y minus one greater than greater than one greater than zero.

596
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:50,370
So not only they differ by this concept, but also the support is different.

597
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:54,990
So that's the drawing distribution for the order statistics.

598
01:38:56,580 --> 01:39:01,140
Now what is it, this joint distribution for this normalized space statistics?

599
01:39:05,310 --> 01:39:08,530
You can plug in. Why don't we just got this?

600
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:10,920
Okay. And furthermore,

601
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:22,950
show that all of this spacing of statistics by the end are independent and identically distributed with the same distribution as before.

602
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:35,990
That is, this content is always from time. I also see why they can show this result.

603
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:43,220
Show that they want to see the high the exponential which.

604
01:41:15,350 --> 01:42:43,080
It's. I think they all got it.

605
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:52,860
So here is how we can show it. So the joint distribution of this normalized order is normalized based on statistics.

606
01:42:53,280 --> 01:43:03,719
We can use the formula that we just derive by employing a plug in this Z one to the end into this marginal PDFs of the original right environment,

607
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:11,190
which is exponential distribution with this Z one over and Z one over, two over the last one and so on.

608
01:43:11,190 --> 01:43:18,030
So once you plug it in, you'll notice that these financial terms, all of this variables are in these financial terms.

609
01:43:18,030 --> 01:43:31,280
So it can be combined. In particular, you have an Z one over in terms A minus one, Z, one Z, two over a minus one terms, and lastly, just a1z Enter.

610
01:43:31,890 --> 01:43:41,820
So that is to say you have this expression lambda to the end times e to the negative lambda times, this Z one plus Z two all the way to zero.

611
01:43:43,980 --> 01:43:49,140
And from there we can further separate them with respect to each Z.

612
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:52,300
All right. So you have this Lambda Times.

613
01:43:52,320 --> 01:44:00,740
Each of the active is obviously once lambda time, each of the active last two all the way to lambda and z to the number them.

614
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:12,380
And each one is a PD function for each of the because z the support does not interact with one another.

615
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:20,730
They always integrate out all of the others and it must remain for this or HCI and it show

616
01:44:20,730 --> 01:44:30,810
that this is the PDA or Z one and this is the PDA or this view and so on and so forth.

617
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:40,400
So if your drawing PDA is equal to the part of individual PDA, that means Z one is again, they are independence.

618
01:44:41,610 --> 01:44:53,230
All right. And furthermore, given this PDA for each Z, I hope you are able to see that that is exactly exponential distribution with proper labs.

619
01:44:53,970 --> 01:45:00,750
So as a result we can conclude Z one. The and the R are the.

620
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:10,640
From what I saw, distribution was propped up. So that's a result.

621
01:45:12,350 --> 01:45:17,480
So from this example, you can see that sometimes with specially designed distribution,

622
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:22,850
these normalized spatial statistics can be independent and identically distributed.

623
01:45:23,030 --> 01:45:31,790
That's actually a very strong result. Considering how this normalized ordering statistics are constructed.

624
01:45:32,990 --> 01:45:38,510
It's not very straightforward. Two are not very easy to see why they could be independent.

625
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:42,740
But indeed, if your original run, Morales has a special distribution.

626
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:51,350
In this case, I saw distribution there normalized in statistic space and statistics can be independent.

627
01:45:54,550 --> 01:45:58,160
That that's not a by no means a generic result.

628
01:45:58,370 --> 01:46:02,300
Or other distributions may not hold the distributions.

629
01:46:03,050 --> 01:46:07,040
It's not necessarily that the space and statistics are independent.

630
01:46:07,610 --> 01:46:14,390
It could well be highly dependent. Any questions?

631
01:46:19,610 --> 01:46:27,830
Yes. Is there any benefit? Like the ordering part, is there any benefit to being in these things?

632
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:36,830
In a conditional sense? Any matters for it? Is there any benefit to thinking of these statistics in a conditional probability sense?

633
01:46:38,570 --> 01:46:44,020
The conditional probability in terms of the order statistics, especially with those.

634
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:48,050
Yeah. Um, it's a good question.

635
01:46:52,490 --> 01:47:03,050
I think you can calculate to derive the conditional distributions for this order statistics given the joint distribution.

636
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:08,120
Essentially, you can go to any sort of distribution, any sort of combination,

637
01:47:08,390 --> 01:47:12,530
either strong distribution or conditional distribution you can derive all of.

638
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:20,270
Right, but I don't recall we have any special properties for any conditional distribution.

639
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:26,660
I'm giving it this because it's because of the memory loss of property and the exponential.

640
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:38,410
You mean for this particular exponential example? That's a good point.

641
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:46,060
And in this case, we know it has this memory loss in this property.

642
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:48,950
Right. So, gamers.

643
01:47:51,980 --> 01:48:00,520
Well, the short answer is, I don't know, on top of my head whether, you know, has interpretation from this conditional distribution.

644
01:48:01,150 --> 01:48:05,950
But that could very well be explained in that regard.

645
01:48:06,340 --> 01:48:12,220
So I just have to think a little bit more about it. I'll get back to you and come up with that.

646
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:16,750
But that's a good question. Hey, all questions.

647
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:28,300
All right. So no question that we all thought today and this Friday, we're going to look at an example,

648
01:48:28,570 --> 01:48:33,910
actually Friday to look out for the recommendation of the problem.

649
01:48:33,910 --> 01:48:47,530
We're going to look at a very interesting example of what a probability problem can be solved using this order statistic that we just learned.

650
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:52,180
Okay, so feel free to join the discussion session tomorrow.

651
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:57,230
Look at that example. We don't know what to do.

652
01:48:57,240 --> 01:49:08,180
What we think it should be split into two.

653
01:49:22,810 --> 01:49:41,860
Yes. I have no idea what the reason for that.

654
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:57,280
I think you will give us a lot of reasons to keep this.
