1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:21,930
That's very. Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,760
What are you guys doing with our second fire alarm clock today?

3
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,660
Well, I'm hoping that that's it. And we're done with the fire alarms for today.

4
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,440
And I'm glad it did. A painter of our class, even though it may have interrupted a class before.

5
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,730
So welcome and welcome to our final session.

6
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:57,590
I will start with some announcements. Just a reminder that the final project was three in extra credit, all due on Friday 1014 by 1159.

7
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:06,200
So please pay attention to the time frames so you can submit your assignment on time.

8
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,410
Okay.

9
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:22,500
So we've had an opportunity to cover different types of databases in this course, and we are going to wrap it up with infectious disease surveillance,

10
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,599
which I think most times when people hear surveillance, we're thinking infectious disease.

11
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,309
But of course, through this class,

12
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:40,200
you've come to know or at least seen examples where surveillance could be a whole number of data types and different data sources.

13
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:52,600
So we'll start with an overview. We'll cover infectious diseases, some of the terms use for infectious disease surveillance,

14
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:59,260
and then we'll do a quick overview of major infectious disease surveillance systems in the U.S.

15
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,850
Again, the goal of this class is really to introduce you to these different data sources to know where to go find them,

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,220
and then just sometimes have some examples that show you the types of data that can come from those sources.

17
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,450
Any other data sets that you might be interested in will take a lot longer than

18
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:25,660
a semester to become familiar with the variables and how to access the data.

19
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:38,330
So we start with us thinking about at least, you know, reviewing how people become infected with different infectious diseases.

20
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:49,160
So there are multiple transmission routes. So it could be where you have a transmission as to contact, direct or indirect contact.

21
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,010
You can have transmission by way of food and water.

22
00:02:54,020 --> 00:03:01,850
So you have to figure out your route. You can also have airborne transmission and then you can have vector borne.

23
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,820
And then sometimes in extreme cases you can have perinatal.

24
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,590
Well, the infectious disease is passed from mom to chance.

25
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,960
So multiple ways that people can become infected.

26
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:23,360
And whichever way you are interested in the transmission route or the particular infectious disease that you may be interested in,

27
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,420
you have to pay close attention to how people are becoming infected.

28
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:36,110
That way, that allows you to find cases that allows you to understand or at least to ask questions related to how people are becoming infected.

29
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:45,700
So how do we go about determining infection? So of course, you have to be specific to a particular condition.

30
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:52,640
But in general, we look for asymptomatic presentation and that's the first step where people show

31
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,470
up with symptoms and then you try to understand what kind of infection they have.

32
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:05,450
You might have some who's depending on the symptoms. They have to kind of give you a short list of which infections that you might need to

33
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:11,990
then try to narrow it down to at least to be able to identify the causative agent.

34
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,510
But using an asymptomatic presentation has limitations.

35
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:23,659
We have a lot of instances where people could be infected, but they don't have symptoms.

36
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:33,650
So just using symptoms to identify cases can sometimes be problematic or allow that lead you to capture on a subset of cases.

37
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:41,760
So on the screen, it just shows a visual of you have this iceberg of cases,

38
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:50,690
but you have just a few or a smaller subset where you have you're able to visibly identify them based on the symptoms that they have.

39
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,460
But then there are some subset of cases where they have no symptoms.

40
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:01,129
It could be clinical, subclinical, or they can have persistent infection or latent infections.

41
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:06,560
So these are instances where people do have the causative agent,

42
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:14,180
but they are not exhibiting symptoms for you to be able to identify them, just using symptomatic presentation.

43
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:25,310
So this is one just one example where we are showing you how symptoms can be nonspecific, in some cases nonexistent.

44
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:36,620
So the image here is is an image from the CDC and is specific to COVID 19 among pregnant women.

45
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:43,940
So at the bottom of the image, you have the percentage of individuals with a science center.

46
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:50,150
And then on the Y axis on this, in this case, you have signs and symptoms.

47
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,840
And then the colors here represent what are the pregnant women we're presenting in the first

48
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,120
or second trimester for the darker blue and then in light of blue in the church on Mr.

49
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:18,530
So you can see among people who were hospitalized for COVID 19, you see that it's just around almost 70% had a report.

50
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:29,030
It was a chill and a smaller percentage among those who were in the third trimester compared to those in the first or second trimester,

51
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:36,950
and then decreased smell, which was one of the symptoms associated with COVID 19,

52
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:42,319
we see that there's a smaller percentage of pregnant women who reported this,

53
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,540
and there was a difference between those in the first or second trimester versus the third trimester.

54
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:56,750
So we see how symptoms can vary among people with the same diagnosis and how we need to be mindful what we are generating.

55
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,160
Maybe a case description based on symptoms.

56
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,200
So additional information related to hospitalized pregnant women.

57
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:17,920
So we have almost 8000 hospitalized women in the age group of 15 to 49 with COVID 19.

58
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:24,280
And from among those, you have 598 pregnant women with COVID 19.

59
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:30,460
And from that group, only 45.5% showed symptoms.

60
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,560
So more than half of these pregnant women had no symptoms.

61
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:40,320
So this is just another example that we need to be careful what we are doing.

62
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:49,990
Infectious disease surveillance in absence, a laboratory testing to be mindful about how we set our case definitions based on symptoms.

63
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,340
And then while we wait for laboratory reports,

64
00:07:54,670 --> 00:08:02,049
how to use the availability of information on symptoms while also having that in

65
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:07,030
mind that you may not be capturing all cases related to that disease of interest.

66
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,990
So how do we detect infections? We talked about symptomatic presentation.

67
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,569
You can also use microbiology and this is where you are collecting samples,

68
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:30,650
small participants or sick individuals to test for active presence of the pathogen that you're interested in.

69
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,700
And then you have immunologic pathways,

70
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:41,930
and this is where you are getting information about whether that person has been previously exposed to a particular agent.

71
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:51,590
So there's nothing quite clear whether the person is actively sick one or more, whether the person has a response to being exposed to that agent.

72
00:08:52,460 --> 00:09:01,100
And then you have molecular epidemiology where you can use molecular information to track cases

73
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,720
and to see which cases might be associated with the same source or from the same location.

74
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,170
So multiple ways that we can use to detect infections.

75
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:19,550
Of course, symptomatic presentations would be one of the first that we are able to use in the investigation of infectious diseases.

76
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,559
So how do we go about coming up with case definition?

77
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:33,240
So sometimes when we present information in a class setting is seem like everything is all nicely defined.

78
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,200
People are able to identify individuals at the first round of of contact.

79
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,420
But sometimes this is not the case.

80
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:51,930
Sometimes you might have an outbreak where you are starting to collect information on individuals until you can get laboratory testing.

81
00:09:51,930 --> 00:10:01,260
So in that case, you will have to make some sort of case definition for the infectious disease that you are investigating.

82
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,970
So you might establish a case definition based on symptoms.

83
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,710
It could be diagnosis, criteria or characteristics.

84
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:18,570
It is sometimes laboratory testing. So if you recall when COVID 19 started.

85
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,870
Testing for COVID wasn't done at the local level.

86
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:32,580
So those samples were collected and then it was sent to CDC for testing in microbiology

87
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:39,270
before people were able to get a definite diagnosis about whether they had COVID 19 or not.

88
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:48,719
That process can take a long time. That process can lead to infectious disease spreading in the community because the person

89
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,300
is going to not know that they had the disease of interest until maybe a week later.

90
00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:00,520
So in those instances, maybe the local health department might use a case definition.

91
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:08,790
People are presenting a fever, their parents are presenting with shortness of breath, cough,

92
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:16,570
and then they will use that case definition in the meantime until they can get laboratory testing.

93
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,070
With the case definition, you have some challenges.

94
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:28,530
You could include people who do not have COVID 19, or you can miss some people who may not be exhibiting symptoms.

95
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:36,240
So with this type of case definition, we know we have the ability to capture some cases, but not all cases.

96
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:45,849
And then sometimes we identify people as cases, one in. So sensitivity will be the measure that we can use while on case definition.

97
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,670
In this case it will be our screening definition.

98
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:56,350
And it says, David, it will be the proportion of true cases that it will to be detected by our surveillance system.

99
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,240
And then specificity will be the proportion of non cases.

100
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,970
So people who do not have the disease that our case definition was able to exclude

101
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:12,880
as not having a disease of interest and then for positive predictive value,

102
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:19,089
this is where we're saying for those who are screened and then we have the gold standard test,

103
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,360
maybe in this case would be the results coming from the CDC.

104
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:29,470
You have the proportion of of crew illness that meets the case definition, but this is only among those who were screened.

105
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:39,910
So these are measures that we can use to help us understand how well we've been able to define a case in the absence of the gold standard,

106
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,260
which would be the PCR testing for COVID 19, using that as an example.

107
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:53,520
So there are ways that multiple ways that case can heat up cases can be identified.

108
00:12:54,270 --> 00:13:02,400
One way can be an active investigation where the investigator is actively going and looking for cases.

109
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:09,060
This type of case identification is usually costly.

110
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:19,169
So it's not usually done as a routine. Case identification process is usually done in the context of an active investigation related

111
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:29,610
to an outbreak or some other investigator initiated surveillance for particular outbreak.

112
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,249
Then there's the passive system,

113
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:43,100
and this is what that's collected on a regular basis where you have health care providers and laboratories reporting information on a routine basis.

114
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:52,380
So they run their labs and maybe on a monthly basis the information will be sent to the local health department.

115
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,910
With this process and this case identification system,

116
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:05,490
you have potential to miss asymptomatic cases because you have people who are showing up only because they have symptoms.

117
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:14,520
Then you also have syndromic where in you are just identifying people based on the signs and symptoms that they are presenting.

118
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:22,380
So this dramatic case identification system is useful because it allows you to quickly

119
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:31,080
get public health resources together and to keep the infectious disease under control.

120
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,110
But with signs and symptoms,

121
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:41,460
you might be pulling people in as cases where Indian that cases and then you might be missing cases that do not have symptoms.

122
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:52,920
And then also, you can identify cases by contact tracing, which we've kind of gotten to here a little bit more during the COVID pandemic.

123
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,330
And that can be either prospective or retrospective in terms of tracking cases.

124
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,650
So classifying all outbreaks you have endemic where you have unusual presence of disease.

125
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,530
So it's an aspect, a number of cases of a particular infectious disease in a given area.

126
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:22,120
And then epidemic, you have an unusual occurrence of illness in an area which is clearly more than what's normally expected.

127
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:27,940
And then as we've left a pandemic where we have a worldwide epidemic,

128
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:34,510
and there's in addition to the microbiology aspect of the infectious disease

129
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,680
spreading for one region to the next and then eventually to multiple countries.

130
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:50,200
There's also an administrative aspect where the World Health Organization will go through a process before epidemic is officially declared.

131
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:58,460
So just a quick overview of some of the Infectious Disease Surveillance Network.

132
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,940
The first one is the National Notifiable Diseases Network.

133
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,709
And from here,

134
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:17,810
you get data that I pulled from more than 3000 public health departments nationwide and the work to detect disease as soon as it happens.

135
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,409
So stop it before it gets out of control. And of course,

136
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:25,969
use the information related to that particular outbreak to inform and strengthen the

137
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:34,940
science and then use that information to generate fliers and then to educate the public.

138
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,489
So how do we collect information? We start at the patient level.

139
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:45,440
The patient presents at either a laboratory or health care center.

140
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,570
Information from that patient is collected by the health care team.

141
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:57,980
If there's something that needs to be reported, that information would then be reported to the public health department at the local level.

142
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:08,870
So in this case, it's going to be reportable. When the states decide which diseases are reportable for their jurisdiction.

143
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:18,140
So after collecting that information is compiled and eventually forwarded to CDC to be a part of the NOTIFIABLE database.

144
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:28,550
Then the CDC team works with the information to combine it and make it available after cleaning the data.

145
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:39,470
And then from there, information about how to handle outbreaks and education activities are then developed from the information.

146
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,340
So we see it starts at the patient level. It goes all the way to CDC.

147
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,930
And the CDC says information back always at the patient level.

148
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:54,830
Some of those fliers you see when you go to a doctor's appointment, those are all informed by the data that are collected.

149
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,460
CDC also provides guidance to the health care team,

150
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:06,890
and then CDC also provides support to the health department in terms of investigating outbreaks and other factors.

151
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:19,020
So there's a protocol for how infectious diseases are reported to the public health agencies.

152
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:27,810
So there's a time frame. If it's in a certain category, then it's extremely intelligent and that report has to be filed within 4 hours.

153
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,850
If it's in another category that's immediate, urgent.

154
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:40,860
Then you have or the public health agency or clinic will have around 24 hours to report that case.

155
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:47,160
Other than that, there are some diseases that are known to be in a local environment or a local community.

156
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:54,750
So those are routinely notifiable. And they're just going to be sent when there's a regular reporting cycle.

157
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,130
So the information that CDC collects,

158
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:10,580
they collate that information from the National Notifiable Diseases Network and the data from each state for each week of each year.

159
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:15,590
And bits can be found in the Mortality and Morbidity Weekly Report.

160
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,230
So this information can be found on the CDC website,

161
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:29,480
and that's even one of the locations that I got the the image for the pregnant women in COVID and the different symptoms.

162
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:38,720
So very interesting and up to date information you can find with the MMR and M.W. are at the CDC website.

163
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:48,360
So foodborne and water borne illness. So is the national outbreak reporting system north.

164
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:54,900
So all waterborne foodborne enteric disease outbreaks are reported in this system.

165
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:02,790
Again, similar to the in in the system a person presents to a health facility.

166
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,720
They collect information on the possible outbreak and then the information gets entered into north.

167
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,750
And then CDC is going to process the data, check for accuracy,

168
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:19,980
and maybe even follow up with the state and then finalize the data identity that become available and publish.

169
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:28,080
So this is showing an example for outbreaks in Michigan from 1998 to 2016.

170
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:43,290
You can look at the data by year. So you can see over time the outbreaks increased beginning from 2009 with the peak between 2015 and 2016.

171
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:48,690
So around yes, just around 2016, there was a peak eating outbreaks in Michigan.

172
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:54,090
You can also look at the outbreaks by ones by the primary mode.

173
00:20:54,090 --> 00:21:03,780
So you don't see water animal contact, but person to person or by the etiology is so meaning the causative agent that's associated with that outbreak.

174
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:11,070
So very useful information that you can just go to the website and play around with some of the interactive tools there.

175
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:23,370
Then there's the anti-microbial resistance system, and this is the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System.

176
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:29,009
NAS And is a collaboration with the CDC, the FDA and the USDA.

177
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:34,730
And it all depends on which focus the agency is working on.

178
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,310
So if it's humans, then it's the CDC. If it's.

179
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:48,560
If it's retail meets, you have the FDA and then for producing animals will be the USDA norms.

180
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:57,780
So CDC norms focuses on ill individuals, so they're not sampling people in their population.

181
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:04,530
But you have to be able before samples are collected. The meats that we have from different grocery stores that we go to.

182
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:12,730
This is under the care of FDA. They had farm animals under the care of the US Department of Agriculture.

183
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,380
So this image here just shows that the way that we are.

184
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:29,940
Identifying more and more often pathogens that are resistant to the known treatments.

185
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:37,650
This is just to show that in the next 30 or so years, we might now have a different leading cause of death.

186
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:46,600
We may have until now, microbial, resistant infections that will be the leading cause of death compared to the current leading causes of death wish.

187
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:51,870
You have cancer, and in this case, you also had diabetes on this list.

188
00:22:52,350 --> 00:23:00,989
So we need to be mindful and collecting data and very intentional about the programs and the development

189
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:07,710
of our meals because of the problems that we could potentially have in the next 20 to 30 years.

190
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:16,530
Then the next category would have health care associated infections or hospital acquired infections.

191
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:29,220
They're usually called HCI. There's a network of hospitals, information rehab facilities and then long term acute care hospital.

192
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:35,820
So more than 23,000 facilities contribute to the data we have for health care associated infections.

193
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:45,600
They also collect information on the specific devices and also procedures associated with those health care associated infections.

194
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:56,460
It is a very useful for informing microbial policy and to also use that information to project how things are going to change over time.

195
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:04,909
So here, this table shows the standard infection ratio.

196
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:13,550
So it has the R and then the associated with the different specific infections, all the type.

197
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:22,100
So it could be SSI, which are such surgical site infections or clotting, which are catheter associated,

198
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:29,750
urinary tract infections, ventilator associated events and then also central line associated bloodstream infections.

199
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,830
So they use this tender standardized infection ratio.

200
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,760
So have a sense to see how well these different facilities are doing,

201
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:44,720
how well they are able to keep infection under control for people who are using these different facilities.

202
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,300
So for the R ratio, if you have a value of less than one,

203
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:58,999
then that means the expected number of cases happens to be higher than the actual number of cases.

204
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,290
So you have fewer cases that you actually serve. Observe your facility.

205
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:11,750
If the R is equals zero, meaning the expected and predictor are the same.

206
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:21,710
If you have a R that's greater than one, then you have your actual number of cases higher than what was expected.

207
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:29,120
So of course these different facilities are working hard because the payline also is tied in

208
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:36,560
to the number of cases that are associated with obviously health care associated infections.

209
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:45,850
So the the Medicare program will not pay.

210
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:54,850
To a certain extent, some of these health for a healthcare associate, the infection that occurred when somebody went to the hospital for surgery.

211
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:59,020
So hospitals are very particular about trying to reduce these numbers.

212
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,760
And to be fair,

213
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:10,380
the SARS takes into account key characteristics of the facility and also characteristics of the patients that go to that particular facility.

214
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:18,310
So if the person has other conditions, that would put them more at risk for developing a hospital association infection.

215
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:22,210
That's also taking into account in the calculation that these are.

216
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,880
Then we had the vaccination uptake and vaccine adverse events.

217
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:37,400
So there are multiple sources that create the information that we have organized for the National Immunization Registry.

218
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:46,730
It tracks immunization rates of the vaccines that are recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

219
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:56,630
The compiled data from the National Immunization Survey. This survey focuses on children 0 to 35 months.

220
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:05,060
Then there's the school vaccination assessment report. And this is required for students to be able to attend kindergarten.

221
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:12,170
And because of this, there's this usually a jump in vaccination rates between children,

222
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:18,260
less than five in children older than five because it's required for them to go to kindergarten.

223
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,819
It's before five. You know, it's all over the place.

224
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,030
And some people decide to vaccinate their children anyhow.

225
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:33,470
But there's this noticeable increase between five and six, and that's partly due to requirements for school.

226
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:40,160
Then there's the nice team which has information for pre-teens and teens.

227
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:46,010
Then if you go to Bathurst, which is one of the surveys that we cover.

228
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:57,680
There's information, adult vaccine uptake, and then the next flu, which has information on influenza vaccines from six months to 70 years.

229
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:12,350
So keep in mind, vaccine uptake will be relatively lower in younger age groups compared to kids five or older,

230
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:18,890
just because it's not recommended or mandated until the start of kindergarten.

231
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:27,620
Then there's the vaccine adverse events monitoring program,

232
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:36,230
the vaccine adverse event reporting system, which is there is a collaboration between CDC and the FDA.

233
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:51,320
And this is stemming from the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which was done or at least initiated to support vaccine companies,

234
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:57,140
to keep them in business for a while addressing any injury associated with vaccines.

235
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:03,110
Prior to that, there were a lot of lawsuits associated with vaccines, and because of that,

236
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:12,140
some of these companies were lowering their production of certain vaccines and it led to a vaccine shortage in the country.

237
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:19,820
So the Vaccine Injury Act then set up this program way to actually attend to claims made

238
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:26,510
by individuals who suffered an adverse event related to taking a vaccine or vaccination.

239
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:32,600
So this then allowed the companies to continue producing.

240
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,230
We all fear that people are going to be suing.

241
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:46,460
Anyone can report an adverse event in the VA system and because of that the system is passive and unverified.

242
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:52,460
Surveillance system is not associated with a national vaccine injury compensation program,

243
00:29:52,790 --> 00:30:03,050
which is another program that allow people to be able to file a claim and to get monetary compensation for injuries related to vaccine.

244
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:10,040
Just, you know, most of the reports we submitted over the years come from manufacturers.

245
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:17,480
There's just a small proportion of individuals who actually go to the site to file information on.

246
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:26,110
Adverse events. So around 7%, where around 37 to 40% of those reports come from manufacturers.

247
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:35,670
So this is what the site looks like. This is what the information you need to complete.

248
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,640
The first option allows you to submit,

249
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:47,489
but you have to complete the form at one point in time compared to where you can print a PDF form and upload that form.

250
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:54,110
It then submitted for a report that you want to submit to the apps.

251
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,290
And in the final surveillance system is the influenza surveillance system.

252
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:12,800
This is really one that's used to monitor the vaccine effective effectiveness in getting here.

253
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,720
And these are not sites that are located all across the like in every state.

254
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:23,360
They are located at five locations in the U.S. and then they collect information

255
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:30,980
that then informs whether the vaccine is circulating for a given year,

256
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,090
what is actually effective or to what extent is effective.

257
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:41,090
So we have one of the sites here at the University of Michigan where I'm marching in.

258
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,320
I know Monto are the principal investigators.

259
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:54,560
You may have seen Dr. Monto on the news related to COVID 19 because of this offensive work that he's done with respiratory conditions.

260
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:02,030
So this type of surveillance system is very interesting.

261
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:08,690
So when you go to the doctor, if you have a cold, they collect samples and they tell you whether you have the flu or not.

262
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:17,630
They can just tell you what is the flu, but it won't tell you more specific information about what is this particular strain of the flu or not.

263
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,730
These sites are then able to conduct more detailed analysis to tell,

264
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:33,710
to identify what circulating strains and how those trends compare to the ones that are included in the vaccine for that year.

265
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:39,800
Then there's the hospitalized influenza vaccine effectiveness network.

266
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:53,959
80. University of Michigan also is a site for this network, and this particular network works.

267
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:03,590
We're in to collect information for patients who have a cough or cold symptoms and is almost like a case control.

268
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:12,200
Design is different in that both groups have cold symptoms but a test negative.

269
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:20,240
So if a person has cold symptoms but they test negative for flu, they then select that as controls.

270
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:24,740
And then those who test positive for flu would then be the ones that will be case,

271
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:30,469
and then they will follow those individuals or get inflammation to see whether they took the vaccine.

272
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:37,070
And if they did, what are the probability that those individuals will be hospitalized?

273
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:46,670
So there are a few sites in the US collecting very detailed information that then informs the current flu season,

274
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,660
but also that information can be useful for subsequent flu seasons.

275
00:33:54,300 --> 00:34:05,280
And then, just as we have in the last almost three years, hope that the information that you can find on the CDC side about COVID 19,

276
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,400
particularly last year, when everything was just at its peak in the year before.

277
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:22,020
So you have this site that you can go to get information on COVID cases, or you can also get historical information on COVID cases of COVID.

278
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:28,440
And then you can compare the data by state or you can compare the data by U.S. versus state.

279
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,510
So this is information from what we had.

280
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:43,860
Pick up their cases and you see that we have the map here, color coded with Michigan showing the highest category,

281
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:49,770
one of the highest categories of cases in the previous seven days when this map was printed.

282
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:59,370
So this can be useful in terms of CDC trying to understand public health response, where to send resources, where to send experts.

283
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,260
There was one point, I think, when this was printed that CDC was sending some of their epidemiologists to Michigan to

284
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:14,160
help us understand and figure out why we had such increase in the number of COVID cases.

285
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:20,190
So this could be useful for planning at the local level, but also at the national level by the federal agency.

286
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:28,380
And this is Corbett. That report is within the same time frame as the number of cases.

287
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:34,350
Interestingly, Michigan was in the highest category of four cases while four deaths.

288
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:44,040
Michigan was not included in one of those states where you had the highest death rates associated with.

289
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:54,560
So I know we've covered a number of data sets, but we haven't covered all of them.

290
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,710
But for this course, that will be it.

291
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:04,870
I was just wondering if anybody is interested in environmental exposures for the research to do or in general research that they're interested in.

292
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:19,209
All right. So there's also data that you can get from a publicly available source, air pollution data.

293
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:24,820
So air quality, this source is publicly available.

294
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,540
You can go there and download the data by region.

295
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,680
You can download the data for current period for historic up here.

296
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:44,530
And what's interesting is that you can use the data from this site and link it to maybe data from the national virus that that statistic program.

297
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:51,970
So you can look at air pollution and birth or you can look at air pollution and deaths.

298
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:56,830
So those are publicly available data. You wouldn't be able to link it at the individual level,

299
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:02,110
but you might be able to link the data for particular region because when you go to the EPA site,

300
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:10,680
you are then able to download the data for a particular region. So I just thought maybe people might be ingesting quality data.

301
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:16,730
So that's another source that you can use. The data yet is specific to air quality.

302
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:26,360
They are not linked to individuals. They are linked to a particular location that you can then use to link to other types of data that you might have.

303
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:34,820
Either data that you collect the age or study that you, the investigator conducted or other publicly available data.

304
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:41,830
Any question about the infectious disease surveillance systems in the US?

305
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:54,510
The terms associated with those different systems or other sources is what we talked about immediately.

306
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:59,970
Kind I thing that we're focused on.

307
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:08,909
Corvette, I think is on a list for immediately as it was new then, you know.

308
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:15,989
So if it's something that's new and not seen before and I guess one too that immediately modifiable

309
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:21,540
but over time it might move from that category to a different category because it's new.

310
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,410
They're not resources in place for identifying that particular agent.

311
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:35,400
So it was something that needed to be automatically identifiable to the CDC.

312
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,790
But now we have it within a slightly different category, right?

313
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,570
COBRA is not meant to minimize the impact of COVID.

314
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,710
What is not the Corvette that we started with at the beginning of the pandemic.

315
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:51,350
Now you can have testing done pretty much anywhere, and we do testing at home.

316
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:55,880
So the level of that for this side of it has changed over time.

317
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:59,610
So it's going to be in a totally different category from when it started.

318
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,860
And that could be for other infectious diseases, too, especially new ones.

319
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:12,060
And new will be not necessarily totally new in history, but maybe mutual giving location.

320
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:24,360
So there was a point where Ebola was in some African countries, it wasn't in the U.S. So at that point it was, you know, a big deal here.

321
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:33,840
Then when it became something that was on the the list here in the U.S., then I took it up to a different level.

322
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:38,640
So some of these things are changing over to some of this state on that list forever.

323
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:45,930
But again, depending on the characteristics, how will we have public health resources in place?

324
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:54,320
It could change with currently the coronavirus or something if you have something like that in the last seven days.

325
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:13,990
COVID as there is. I know even tracking the the data for Michigan before that, you should have daily updates on COVID data on the Michigan website.

326
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:19,359
That has changed. It went to every two days, then it went to every week.

327
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:26,530
I haven't checked it recently to know again, that's showing how we've adjusted before it over time,

328
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:34,299
but now people are able to get all the testing done fairly quickly and it just have to go.

329
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:39,550
My thought, checking the site to see who was reporting on a weekly basis and was reporting on a monthly basis.

330
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:45,550
I guess prior to the fall, maybe the time frame may have been a little bit wider.

331
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:51,580
We're getting into the fall season of flu, COVID, so it might change again.

332
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,840
So it is a little bit of a busy situation.

333
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:00,490
Good. All right.

334
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:09,010
So I will just go over the a brief summary once by some of her data source that we've covered.

335
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,870
So we talked about the U.S. Census that we're collecting data every ten years.

336
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:18,130
They're very useful for calculating epidemiologic measures.

337
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:21,760
For example, we can use that for standardization,

338
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:29,080
especially we are trying to compare locations in the U.S. and we're trying to find a standard population that we can use.

339
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:35,220
We are able to quickly calculate rates associated with COVID 19.

340
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:40,809
We're able to calculate rates associated with other conditions in the U.S. It's because we

341
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:45,730
have the census data and we have our denominator for calculating some of these measures.

342
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:55,930
We talk about the American Communities Survey, where it is a subset of the population, about 3.5 million that are surveyed every year.

343
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:02,050
And we get comprehensive data on the population, including income, education and housing.

344
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:10,870
So you are able to get some information that similar between the census and then the American Community Survey.

345
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:17,110
But keep in mind, they're using different time points and then you might have more detailed information

346
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:21,189
that you can relate to the American community survey within the same survey,

347
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:26,290
compared to using the census and trying to connect that to the American community survey.

348
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:31,000
So if you're looking for very detailed information, go to the American Community Survey.

349
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:44,990
So it's talk about burqas and here's how we have a wealth of data collected cross-sectional information for breakfast on individuals 18 or older.

350
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:53,870
These data collected at the state level and they are conducted by telephone or and cell phones.

351
00:42:54,350 --> 00:43:01,040
And they are all self-reported data. So that has its own limitations associated.

352
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:08,420
Recall. Sometimes things change between when the person last saw the doctor and the measure you're asking about.

353
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:16,790
So time changes can also be a factor and participants are not compensated for the breakfast program.

354
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:25,760
Whereas for enhanced. This is also a cross sectional survey includes children and adults and there's no upper limit for the age.

355
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,620
The data collected by in-person interviews and by physical exams.

356
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:38,140
So imagine if you're collecting information within the last year or be in a certain time frame on weight.

357
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:39,590
You know,

358
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:50,180
this is accurate because the time the information was collected that was going to measure the individual to get the information on weight for and

359
00:43:50,180 --> 00:44:02,240
he's participate participants are compensated and then they are also giving a summary of their results which can really be useful for participants.

360
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:08,740
We talked about the DISH as a program with the demographic and health surveys.

361
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:22,330
These surveys conducted in countries where data are needed to help us understand birth, fertility and death in those countries.

362
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:36,850
We know that the data started off as collecting data on fertility, but you want to get other data when you're collecting fertility.

363
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,240
The delicate data collection process is very costly.

364
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:47,050
So it's going to be a hurdle to actually go to collect information and just collect information on one variable.

365
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:52,990
So the DHS team is using this opportunity to collect information on a range of measures

366
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:59,650
and also collecting biomarkers on a subset of the participants in this program.

367
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:05,170
The other goal of the program is they actually train individuals in these countries,

368
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:12,280
so they have the skills needed to collect quality data that could be comparable across different regions.

369
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:22,930
We have information on 90 countries and the availability of data varies because on any given survey,

370
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:30,600
some countries drop off in some countries either back to the survey program.

371
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:41,830
So keep that in mind that some countries drop off, some countries add up, and you might have missing data for some countries at certain times.

372
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:49,480
For the CIA Medicare program. We know this is a population based registry in the U.S.

373
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:57,270
They collect information on cancer incidence, also information on cancer survival and cancer mortality.

374
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:01,020
And then in terms of cancer, on a global scale,

375
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,620
you have cancer incidence in five continents and in global cancer, cancer incidence in five continents.

376
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:18,060
You have quality, high quality data that are based on population based registries and well known data collection programs.

377
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:25,200
For global, can you have data estimated on cancer incidence in other parts of the world?

378
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:33,180
Where you're missing information that are considered gold standard data collection processes.

379
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:41,370
But the goal is to have some sort of estimate for cancer incidence and data on cancer mortality in this country.

380
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:50,250
And these are based all counts. These are based on estimates from using if the country nearby has better data,

381
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:54,570
maybe sometimes they use some of those data to inform the estimates for different regions.

382
00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:04,750
Then we talk about Medicare and Medicaid. Individuals 65 and older and individuals with disabilities.

383
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:12,340
So this is not one that's covering. The entire U.S. population was a specific subset of the population.

384
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:16,360
We have the ability to use claims data.

385
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:25,760
So administrative data that are used for billing purposes to be able to understand cancer factors associated with cancer diagnosis.

386
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:32,470
And and to also keep in mind that some of the data we have, they're very specific.

387
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:37,900
So if we're using some of those diagnoses as our exposure, we need to be mindful.

388
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:43,360
It might be limiting because some of those diagnoses when it come about, if there's a need to be treated.

389
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:53,050
So we talked about obesity, where if individuals had a reason for which they needed to have a medication prescribed,

390
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:58,870
that's going to show up in a system. But other people with obesity could be seen.

391
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:05,530
But I'm not sure because for that particular visit, they didn't need anything related to the their weight.

392
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:16,360
And then it's limited because we have missing data based on having the having information on people prior to the age of 65.

393
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:22,380
So any question about the data sources that we've covered?

394
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:34,000
All right. So I can inform you that you can use the remaining time to work on your project

395
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:41,360
if you're done or if your group members have already been assigned in your set.

396
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,810
You can then leave if you.

397
00:48:54,280 --> 00:49:05,440
I think. Not only that, but we were very concerned.

398
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:09,650
Able. It's also.

399
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:17,760
Is. To see.

400
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:40,390
Researchers at the. I definitely agree with you that.

401
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:54,290
I. I do.

402
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:21,270
I know today. So. He didn't know what.

403
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:33,200
I got behind the tell. I haven't read the paper. I know.

404
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:37,420
I left City for Baltimore.

405
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:43,950
The. I didn't want exposure.

406
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:59,090
If you're. I think that's a good question.

407
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:30,370
I didn't feel so. So.

408
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:41,960
What I was going to. He never so.

409
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:59,020
Had a report. I think that.

410
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:15,530
Yeah. Oh, yes.

411
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:21,080
I was like, oh, that is.

412
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,790
And in excess of 300.

413
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:41,240
I don't know. I don't think.

414
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:49,390
To expose racism is just another heresy.

415
00:52:51,370 --> 00:53:04,210
In fairness, that is I don't know about. I.

416
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,580
In the areas like the Pilbara. Joined.

417
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:38,710
That was my favorite. I can't get flapjacks.

418
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:44,490
You know, they are so close to the attacks.

419
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:58,280
And I thought it was very. It's all happening.

420
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:02,960
So. I was.

421
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,130
I only got 100.

422
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:21,880
Yes, I think. They like.

423
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:34,780
Like he values. That's a big difference, though.

424
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:40,140
This is exactly why they did it so. So that makes sense.

425
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:46,600
But they also did. I think that the mobile. To take citizenship.

426
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:55,540
You know, just what made me think. Maybe we.

427
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:01,080
Maybe. Maybe we. Okay.

428
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:11,590
So this is going to be well in case one third of the election is called.

429
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:21,780
I mean, you know, I don't know, you know, the size of what.

430
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:27,450
Yeah. Yeah, I think we're allowed to do that. Okay.

431
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:47,110
It's a question. I think the that.

432
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:00,180
I just realized. I'm telling you guys.

433
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:09,690
No, that's exactly why there's a lot. And I was supposed to.

434
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:35,060
In other. You know, we're talking about democracy in the United States and the have a for there to be some kind of higher ed.

435
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:43,810
I know. Well, yeah. So it you feel.

436
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:54,540
As I said, my. It's like how I felt like I was really good last year for.

437
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:03,200
Stuff. I have a girlfriend, I.

438
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:21,870
Right. Go back to your favorite song.

439
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:37,130
I think so. So I don't think you should listen to the idea that that should happen.

440
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:47,000
Yeah, because I know they still did abortion rights and now they've got this set of policies that make it so.

441
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:52,470
Yeah. You know, if you read the paper, they did a version of focusing on.

442
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:58,190
Yeah. And that being. Scientific objective is to be more.

443
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:08,780
I. But the next thing I know, the African.

444
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:25,450
You're not alone. I mean, that would illuminate something.

445
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:31,660
But, yeah, I mean.

446
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:39,750
Project the. As soon as I started.

447
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:59,220
So there were. Yeah.

448
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:05,780
It's working. We have.

449
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:09,670
I think it's a. There's nothing to say about that.

450
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:23,210
Know. 2555.

451
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:30,710
The fact of the matter is, it's a.

452
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:41,010
Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure he doesn't that right. I just think those guys are so sad.

453
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:55,490
I just have. Was a.

454
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:19,250
And. Today.

455
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:38,070
So there's. Okay.

456
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:44,250
To answer your question, let me set the stage.

457
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:49,820
Yeah. But it's not the first.

458
01:00:55,150 --> 01:01:04,080
I think this will be. Thank you so much for a set of monthly shows.

459
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:15,100
The. I'd like to advise.

460
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:22,130
It's a principle citizenship with high value places and your health insurance value.

461
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:28,820
Public. So I think I did.

462
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:35,680
I think those are the questions I have, because then I'm going to be taking a person virtually.

463
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:43,640
And I just said the aspect that they would have been asking the government to just say something.

464
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:51,840
I'm having difficulty with the technology and I can see it now.

465
01:01:54,480 --> 01:02:01,140
Yeah. Just. Contact him.

466
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:15,170
I have to say there are of. So.

467
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:20,990
Yeah. Yeah.
