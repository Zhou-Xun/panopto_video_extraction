1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,910
Those are my stakeholders. Yeah. So this is the first.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,350
So here's a by the way,

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:14,400
the first person to take me up on the offer to do a stakeholder presentation instead of an academic presentations are very grateful.

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,110
So you need to reframe your minds. You're no longer asking academic conference questions.

5
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:29,640
You are people with money. Right now it's just do it.

6
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:41,360
And my offer on extra credit points for asking questions still applies, even though you're now people with money instead of academics.

7
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:50,780
Okay. Good morning. My name is Marissa Olsen and I will be presenting on behalf of my research team.

8
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,650
We are looking to get more funding for expanding.

9
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:01,309
I've Barbara's associate cancer research. So our mission is to decrease.

10
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:07,070
I've seen Barbara associate cancers and study possible therapeutic measures for these type of cancers.

11
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,110
So we want to bring your focus to the viral tumorigenesis and relation to therapeutics.

12
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,820
So hopefully once we get this virus going, we can hopefully move on to other ones.

13
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:24,709
So the goal for this specific funding would be to research Epstein-Barr virus tumorigenesis to discover therapeutic agents such

14
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:32,960
as micro and R RNA is which I will get into the next few slides and then discover positive therapeutics with these micro RNA.

15
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,510
So why Epstein-Barr virus? So what? Why is this our research about that?

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,270
So I've seen virus as a herpes virus. And in fact, so 90% of the worldwide adult population.

17
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:49,460
But most people is going to be asymptomatic. So no kind of disease is going to occur from this.

18
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,800
And I'm currently there is no treatment or medication for it and there's no vaccine.

19
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:04,610
So it's a lot of like the symptoms how other type of non vaccine preventable the viruses are and they are associated with human cancers.

20
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:12,290
There's two main types that they're associated with. So the lymphocytic malignancy is the lesser lymphomas and other ones.

21
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:17,270
And the ones that we focus on, on my research team are Epithelial Carcinomas,

22
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,040
so we have the nasal pharyngeal carcinoma which I would be very referring to is

23
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:28,159
and C FMC Barr virus is in most of the layers and then there's gastric carcinoma.

24
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:35,480
So the EBV, AGC and 9% of gastric carcinoma cases have Epstein-Barr virus in it.

25
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,990
So to the right is just a picture of like a regular gastric saline and then a tumor,

26
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,120
one that's Epstein-Barr virus positive just to counter the comparison.

27
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,359
So an example for expansion.

28
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:59,210
So this is kind of what we're looking to expand our research on is a previous study that we have done looking at Epstein-Barr virus micro RNA.

29
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:07,310
So I'm I r part five dash through P, which I would just be referring to as BART by 3 p.m. for the remainder of the presentation.

30
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:14,450
And it's an ambition of P 53 expression, and I will get into what P53 is in just a moment.

31
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,970
So Bart, micro RNA is a class of non-coding endogenous RNA,

32
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:28,610
and for Epstein-Barr virus there are about 25 precursors and 44 mature microRNAs and there

33
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:33,230
is growing evidence for their role in viral latency host cell survival into Genesis.

34
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:41,630
So for Epstein-Barr virus, there are two phases. There's a later in the lytic phase, but microRNAs are more prevalent in the latent phase,

35
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,520
and this is because it helps with Epstein-Barr virus persistence.

36
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,780
And then p53 on the other hand, is a tumor suppressor gene.

37
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:59,420
So it dictates various responses and also a pap ptosis, DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and cell differentiation.

38
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:09,380
So just a quick overview. If you don't have any cancer biology background, P53 is a huge regulator and a lot of different things can affect it.

39
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:18,080
But just a crash course of what Part five therapy does it degrades p53 enhancing tumorigenesis by preventing apoptosis.

40
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,770
So in the next few slides, I'll just go over some noble results to how this conclusion was brought about.

41
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,200
So the first one is figure one. We're just, we're just going to focus on.

42
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:40,670
H9 So in a there's the first two ones, the CDC 97901, the first one are the gastric cell lines.

43
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,920
And then those two are the nasal pharyngeal carcinoma, the cell lines.

44
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:54,500
So you can see in the presence of our five three, there is lower p53 expression and then p21 is a target of p53.

45
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,630
So it makes sense that that one is lowered as well.

46
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:10,110
But H just shows some more trickle down effects of when p53 is inhibited because backspace babies BBC three are all things P53 affects men.

47
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:19,700
And I was just showing when there is a p 50 B by three p inhibitor that p 53 increases back up by a figure to A,

48
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,030
B, C and E kind of reinforces the findings in figure one.

49
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:30,980
Figure A and B are showing that in the presence of Part five three period, there is a greater holding.

50
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:40,570
Formation and then and figure C is showing that a part by three P inhibitor decreases calling formation.

51
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,740
So it is just showing how apoptosis is.

52
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:52,809
One of the mechanisms that p53 regulates does increase in the presence of part by 3p9 part 553.

53
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,670
If you notice that one,

54
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:04,240
that's just another part that EBV has and that's one that is known to decrease apoptosis as just a comparison group that we took there.

55
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:09,819
So then the last normal thing is I want to focus on on figure three and figure six.

56
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:16,299
So these are important cancer therapeutics and birds, which is what we want to do with this finding as well,

57
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:22,360
to kind of figure out if other tumor therapy drugs inhibits FAS or both can elude those as well.

58
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:31,330
So at top of that is a chemotherapy drug and we measured those in different amounts.

59
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:39,580
So if you see compared to the NC and part five three PS, there is less p53 when there is a chemotherapy drug.

60
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:46,470
So four, five, three can elude the chemotherapy drug, making it harder to treat.

61
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,660
So you can see that in both of the gastric cell lines, it's a little bit more prevalent.

62
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:57,700
The one figure six is just showing the tumor growth in vitro.

63
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,560
So you have group one, just the monarch cells.

64
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:10,510
They stain for P 21. So P 21 is a triple down to p53.

65
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:16,719
That's what we see what we've seen four. So you can see there's a lot of p21 here, not as much here.

66
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:26,890
So showing that part five through p knockdown p53 and then in this one we have y part by three T cells, but then injected a inhibitor.

67
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,690
So there is a decrease and the increase of 21 here.

68
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:42,190
So some public health implications of this is Eisenberg I associate cancers are pretty difficult to treat as

69
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:51,640
you saw in figure three because the 553 expressing cells exhibit more resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs.

70
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,000
So it takes longer to treat them.

71
00:07:54,010 --> 00:08:03,370
You have to find other routes and there is no vaccines that can prevent these type of cancers because Epstein-Barr virus is in most people,

72
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:11,620
you kind of have to target if you're going to do a vaccine. So understand the mechanisms of some of our various associated cancers can potentially

73
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,780
lead to new therapeutics or a mechanism of reduction for these type of cancers.

74
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:24,740
So with your funding, we would want to do additional studies on boats and how they can cause tumorigenesis.

75
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:33,620
We want to expand past Bert by three P and because there's many different boats out there, some of them have been studied more intensely than others.

76
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:41,030
And we would also like to look at biomarkers and see if different groups of birds can increase or decrease tumorigenesis.

77
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,850
So that's kind of what I meant by the dense part.

78
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:50,120
And then look at the potential therapeutic strategies for I've seen Barbara's associated cancer and relationship.

79
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,720
So that's looking at the inhibitors and stuff along those lines.

80
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:59,450
And then the last thing we would like to do is additional studies on virus and chemo therapeutics to

81
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,970
try and see if there's any chemotherapy drugs that kind of inhibit Barrett's more than other ones.

82
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,450
So thank you. Thank you for your time and consideration.

83
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:17,480
We hope you take this funding and that we can run with it to expand viral carcinogenesis research.

84
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:28,570
Any questions? Any question.

85
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,080
Yes. Do I need you finding the answers for the them?

86
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:43,650
Like expand to other for these purposes and just be one or two.

87
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,530
Um. We have not done any research on other herpes viruses.

88
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:55,530
Epstein-Barr virus is one that is mainly has microorganisms, independently processes.

89
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,960
But we want to move on to different viruses as well to see if there's other relations there.

90
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:07,890
So with your funding, we can do them if you'd like to, for the price of one.

91
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,270
Yeah, but. Yeah. Yes.

92
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:19,260
So I know you cited one prevalence statistic, but how prevalent are these?

93
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:26,370
Epstein-Barr virus associated cancer. Um, they're not as prevalent as you think.

94
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:32,640
It does range from country to country. They're more prevalent in, like, Asian countries and South East Asia.

95
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:42,120
They're not as prevalent in the United States. But. It's important to try and get the moral force in the genesis out there.

96
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,889
But we definitely look at more films because they are kind of harder to diagnose.

97
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:53,400
We have to test for our supervisors because as you saw with gastric carcinoma, not all of them have some sort of virus.

98
00:10:53,400 --> 00:11:01,480
So you kind of have to differentiate there. Yes.

99
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:11,820
So. So as this goes into like a treatment, how many years do you how many years away?

100
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:23,970
If everything goes. That's hard to say just because there's a whole ton of research on treatments for Epstein-Barr virus,

101
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:32,129
and especially in relation to the virus or in relation to therapeutic grounds, because they can even chemotherapy drugs.

102
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,380
So you have to watch the dosage on those.

103
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,520
So it takes a lot of trial and error.

104
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:44,030
There's a lot of birds that I've seen, diverse producers that you have to make sure the right ones are being targeted.

105
00:11:51,450 --> 00:12:04,040
Thank you very much. Race.

106
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,450
See. Next up, we have either Chelsea or Spain.

107
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,660
So she's wearing purple. I was drawn.

108
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,810
Thank you, Melissa. That was a great presentation.

109
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,320
And in fact, I forgot that I had to present right after.

110
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:54,080
Good morning, everybody. I'm Smith Alexander. And today I'm going to be talking about the measles virus.

111
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:03,500
And my research team has helped me put together a research which sees if measles virus

112
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:10,190
infection diminishes preexisting antibodies that offer protection from other pathogens.

113
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:19,790
So to give you information that you already know, measles virus is a single stranded on locked on any virus with one serotypes.

114
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,000
That's the structure. I'm sure you all know about it.

115
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:28,730
It's classified as a member of the genus morbillivirus in the parrot mix of everyday family.

116
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:36,290
Humans are the only natural hosts of measles virus, which I think is an advantage because it helps to eradicate it.

117
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,830
But unfortunately we have not been able to do that.

118
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:48,560
And it causes measles, which is characterized by prodromal fever, malaise, cough cries of conjunctivitis,

119
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:57,770
the three C's and also complex spots which are seen grayish white spots seen in the buckle mucosa followed by

120
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:06,500
a global rash measles virus is responsible directly for more than 100,000 deaths yearly on a global scale.

121
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:12,949
Now, coming to what research has already been done on measles infection,

122
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:19,760
on immunity, measles virus infects immune cells, causing acute immune suppression.

123
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,889
And studies over the years have shown decreased interferon signaling,

124
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:34,100
skewed cytokine responses or reduced WBC count suppression of lymphocyte proliferation shortly after the infection.

125
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,440
However, the good news is that there is a recovery of the functional immune response,

126
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:46,490
including resolution of the LYMPHOPENIA, which occurs 2 to 4 weeks after viral clearance.

127
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,320
Now, here's the bad news.

128
00:14:48,890 --> 00:15:00,920
So measles virus replication in immune cells has been hypothesized to impair immune memory, potentially causing immunological amnesia.

129
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:07,730
Now, for those of you who don't know what immunological amnesia is, right, just like me before I started reading this paper.

130
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:17,060
Immune amnesia is basically a reduction in the diversity of the immune memory repertoire after measles infection,

131
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:22,460
which is basically all the antibodies that you have collected over the years.

132
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,440
I mean, there's a reduction in that once you get a measles infection.

133
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:32,570
So it's and that's why this study is important. So thanks for your attention.

134
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:39,800
So moving forward, what we've done with this study is that we use very scan,

135
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,970
which is a tool that detects antiviral and antibacterial antibodies in the

136
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:48,440
blood which result from current of past encounters with viruses and bacteria.

137
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,720
And it basically a small answer, but that gives you an overall snapshot of the immune system.

138
00:15:54,050 --> 00:16:04,760
And it was used to analyze blood samples from 77 unvaccinated children who contracted measles during a 2013 outbreak in the Netherlands.

139
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:13,670
And samples were obtained before the infection, as well as two months, about two months after confirmed infection.

140
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:22,600
It's a case control study, so we have four control groups totaling of about 119 children group.

141
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:29,870
A group here was is matched controls sampled at a similar intervals like the cases that is zero and three months.

142
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,490
Group B was age matched controls with samples collected after one year.

143
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:41,749
Group C was adult controls with a collection interval similar to the measles infected

144
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,460
individuals that is at zero and three months and group D was young children,

145
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:52,730
basically infants and after before and after their first MMR vaccine.

146
00:16:53,630 --> 00:17:01,940
And additionally even unvaccinated children from the same community who remained sero negative for measles virus.

147
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:12,559
What infection was included in the study so coming to the results of measles of so the first thing we concluded

148
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:18,830
was measles modulates the diversity of antibody repertoire and causes loss of preexisting antibodies.

149
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,930
As you can see, this is a violin graph. Okay.

150
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:28,160
And the x axis is divided into the various groups that it's control A, B, C,

151
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:35,990
measles virus, SERONEGATIVE controls, as well as a dose control group D, which was.

152
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:44,720
Mama vaccinated the children. And then you have cases which were further divided into those who had mild infection, as well as severe infection.

153
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:52,880
And it was plotted against standardized epitope hits, which is basically the antibody titers in these cases and controls.

154
00:17:53,540 --> 00:18:02,599
So basically, you can see that there's not much change between Timepoint one and 9.2 for the control group A, B, C,

155
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:15,830
as well as of those with sero negative measles virus, as well as there was an increase in those controls who had in who had taken the MMR vaccine.

156
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,190
This is before the MMR vaccine and this is after the vaccine.

157
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:31,040
This is the unvaccinated case group. And you can clearly see that there is a fall in the antibody titers and standardized epitope hits.

158
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:39,350
Okay. Now, we also checked for individual anti viral antibodies as well.

159
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:48,020
And we checked for Enterovirus coronavirus odyssey herpes virus, rhino papilloma virus, influenza and adenovirus.

160
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:53,660
And the common conclusion that we had was that there was a decrease that was seen.

161
00:18:53,930 --> 00:19:00,140
However, the magnitude of decrease depended on each virus.

162
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:06,020
This is a heatmap indicating the change in the total number of epitope hits.

163
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:11,570
And you can see there's not much change. Minor changes, which is seen in the control groups.

164
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:18,020
There's a positive change which is seen with those who were vaccinated with the MMR vaccine,

165
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:24,260
which is indicated in more of read that you see and more of blue that you see,

166
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:33,650
which is in the case group is basically a decrease in the epitope hits everyone clear so far.

167
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:40,280
Okay. So basically this is for the people who like numerical data.

168
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:52,130
Measles virus infections were basically associated with a mean reduction of about 20% in the overall diversity and size of the antibody repertoire.

169
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:56,270
And this was consistent across individual pathogens as well.

170
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:05,000
And the most severely affected children, they lost about 50% of the pathogen specific antibodies.

171
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,140
And in some children, they lost even 70% of antibodies that we have collected over the years.

172
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:24,410
Also, the good news for the controllers and those who were vaccinated was that they within 90% of their epitopes over similar or longer durations.

173
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:29,270
Measles also decreases the strength of epitope recognition.

174
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:38,270
So for example, antibody epitope binding signal was recorded, which is a relative measure of antibody titers for each group, for each epitope.

175
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:49,010
And as you can see, for control group A and B, there was not much change seen as and it was closer to one.

176
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:55,160
Whereas for the case group you can see that there was median for changes which were substantial.

177
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:06,919
And you can see that it reduced to 0.58 in the mild measles virus infection group and 20.62 in the

178
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:15,020
severe measles virus infection group and thus indicating a 40% reduction in the epitope binding signals.

179
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:22,340
Also for the control group B, a D, which was MMR vaccine.

180
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:31,330
I mean, the group that would be MMR vaccine, there was a marked increase in the overall antibody repertoire, diversity.

181
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:37,990
And even after infection, there was not much loss seen in the antibody.

182
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:47,620
After the receipt of and mod vaccines and also that in these children the antibody repertoire continued to add

183
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:57,070
antibody diversity over time and there was no overall change in the epitope signaling after MMR vaccine as well.

184
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:06,280
Also, after all of this, we also conducted an experimental study to confirm the findings that we've seen before.

185
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:16,750
So for the central experiments study we use for rhesus monkeys and we use virus scan to collect plasma

186
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:23,380
and check their antibody repertoire before and five months after experimental measles virus infection.

187
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:33,730
And the overall diversity of the antibody, the epitope was again seen to decrease an average of 26%, which confirmed the findings from before.

188
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:43,660
And this loss persisted for at least five months after the measles virus infection, thus making them susceptible to infections from other pathogens.

189
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:55,240
But however we expected it. But there was an increase in recognition of measles virus epitopes for simian foamy virus as well as Epstein-Barr virus.

190
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:05,260
So as you can see, this shows that there's a decrease in almost all antibodies for all pathogens except for simian by virus,

191
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,160
as well as simian form uveitis and Epstein-Barr virus.

192
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:17,620
So that's concluding my slides and this presentation.

193
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:22,330
Measles is associated with large reductions in both the diversity of the antibody repertoire,

194
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:27,940
as well as magnitude of binding signal, which was seen in the reduced antibody titers.

195
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:36,130
Also, our findings showed that even though individuals recover their immune functionality after the infection,

196
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:45,010
there is memory cell elimination which is induced by measles and it can alter previously acquired memory.

197
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:53,260
And these can infect about 20 to 70% of memory cells, including measles, De says, as well as plasma cells.

198
00:23:54,100 --> 00:24:03,700
And the experimental measles virus infection also found out that we could no longer detect up to 60% of the antibody repertoire,

199
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,480
and this persisted for at least five months.

200
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:14,950
So for those of you all whose minds I want to get in there, this is basically the slide you focus on.

201
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:25,480
Measles virus destroys immunological memory, resulting in immune amnesia, leading to future vulnerability to infections by different pathogens.

202
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,320
And it's very, very important to get vaccinated even today.

203
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:36,340
There are a lot of people who are not vaccinated, and that is causing a lot of infections even today.

204
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:42,610
So therefore, infections will not only help prevent the deaths directly caused by measles virus,

205
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:50,410
but it will also avoid potentially thousands of additional deaths attributed to the lasting damage to the immune system.

206
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,480
And yeah, and hopefully one day we'll be able to eradicate measles.

207
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:02,890
Thank you. Questions.

208
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:09,279
Okay. I'm just curious.

209
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:19,480
You might not know, but are there any other viruses that have been studied that have not seen that link and should not?

210
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:27,850
It's a good question. Not that I'm aware of, but I'll get back to you about it.

211
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,959
Yes. Hi. Can you give us a picture? I was just wondering,

212
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,000
do you know if there's any specific public health interventions that help people

213
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:46,090
to be protected from opportunistic infections while they're going through that?

214
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:57,240
So far we're just seeing because there was a short immune response period that we studied for, which is 0 to 3 months.

215
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:04,770
So right now we're trying to increase the study period and hopefully we'll get to an intervention soon.

216
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:11,709
Okay? Yes. How long was this following for?

217
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:16,210
After infection data collected for following insertion.

218
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:21,810
It was collected in three months and for one control group it was collected till one year.

219
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:26,710
But that's just the case. Group was going to be conducted only at zero and three months.

220
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:33,900
Yes. So my question, you kind of already answered.

221
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,940
So my my question is more of a comment. Thank you.

222
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:50,370
So there's been a long history of studies that say that measles vaccines is linked to lower all cause mortality.

223
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:55,290
So countries with a higher measles vaccination percentage have lower all cause

224
00:26:55,290 --> 00:27:00,630
mortality from is like just generally like either all infectious diseases or all.

225
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:07,140
And it's been highly controversial that those findings have been debated for years and years and years.

226
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:16,110
So your study is like proposing a mechanism for why specifically measles like vaccine

227
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:24,210
against measles itself would would potentially prevent mortality from other causes.

228
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:33,120
Right. So, I mean, I think my question to sort of answer it is sort of like the time you're talking about the 0 to 3 month time scale,

229
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,500
which is a pretty limited time scale, at least all cause mortality.

230
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,100
Studies are like life course studies.

231
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:46,799
So they're saying like you're well, someone, somebody gets a measles vaccination as an infant is their whole first reduced.

232
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:52,670
And so, you know, I was going to ask you, what about the different types of that?

233
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,770
So interesting.

234
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:06,030
It's like an interesting thing for you to get at this mechanism for this very controversial hypothesis and another another interpretation of it.

235
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:10,110
So, yeah. And it also speaks to this. Are there other viruses?

236
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:19,110
You know, one of the reasons why people focus so much on B cell viability after measles infection

237
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,520
is because of this finding this this finding that happened ecologically first.

238
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:41,200
Thank you. I should be up in.

239
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:14,899
Hi. I'm Chelsea. Today I will be speaking on behalf of my colleagues on our paper titled HCV Infection Increases the expression of Ace2

240
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:24,230
receptor leading to advanced and or enhanced entry of both HCV and SARS-CoV-2 into hepatocytes and a co-infection state.

241
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,980
Today I'll talk through the introduction, methodology, results, limitations and conclusions of our study.

242
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:36,110
So a little background on SARS-CoV-2 and HCV, I'm sure all of you know,

243
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:43,040
but they are both enveloped non segmented, single stranded, positive sense RNA viruses.

244
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:53,120
SARS-CoV-2 can lead to severe COVID 19 infection, which can lead to Multiorgan dysfunction, including kidney, liver or heart failure.

245
00:29:54,350 --> 00:30:07,220
The SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme two receptor on cells and HCV primarily infects hepatocytes, which are liver cells.

246
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:17,750
In the liver tissue itself. There are low levels of ace2, so this could lead to a co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and HCV in those cells.

247
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:28,940
The cell lines that we used for this study are the 7.5 cells we had both HCV pre infected and Non-infected controls.

248
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:33,080
Both were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 for 48 hours.

249
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,250
Then we stained with immunofluorescence staining.

250
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:43,250
We use different staining for HCV, SARS-CoV-2 and also Ace2 expression.

251
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:54,560
And then we tested the levels of RNA at 015, 24 and 48 hours post infection with SARS-CoV-2.

252
00:30:55,670 --> 00:31:03,020
And then we extracted the RNA and ran our PCR to determine SARS-CoV-2 and HCV RNA levels.

253
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,790
We had four major results from this study.

254
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:19,700
The first one is that HCV and SARS-CoV-2 co infect and co replicate in hepatocytes and HCV infection enhances SARS-CoV-2 entry into parasites.

255
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:26,659
HCV infection also induces increased expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors,

256
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:32,870
which would be the ace2 receptor into hepatocytes and Ace2 expression also affects

257
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:37,880
HCV infection by enhancing its viral entry entry into hepatocytes as well.

258
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:45,500
So looking at this first result of the co-infection and co replication in hepatocytes,

259
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:53,360
we did the immunofluorescence staining on the left hand graph and today you can see all of our staining.

260
00:31:53,810 --> 00:32:05,180
The left column is our Dapi staining, red is HCV, green is SARS-CoV-2 and the far right column is the merged image.

261
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:12,830
And in the yellow you can see the cells that got Co-infected with both HCV and SARS-CoV-2.

262
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:19,730
That made us determined that it is possible that they both infect the same cell at the same time.

263
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,819
I'm looking at CO replication.

264
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:35,360
We did studies over time, so looking at Fig. B, we did SARS-CoV-2 fold changes over time at zero 24 and 48 hours, 24 hours,

265
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,969
you can see a slight increase in replication and at 48 hours you can see that

266
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:47,060
SARS-CoV-2 does in fact replicate in both singly infected and co-infected cells.

267
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:56,930
The I do want to note that you can see that there is a difference between 24 and 48 hours, but that difference in full change is not significant.

268
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:05,360
It replicates effectively in both cells for figure C, we're looking at HCV over those same time period.

269
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:18,140
So zero, 24 and 48 hours at 24 and 48 hours, we saw a significant increase in fold change in the CO-INFECTED cells versus the HCV only infected cells.

270
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:24,709
And then in Fig. D, we wanted to look at SARS-CoV-2 over shorter time periods.

271
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:35,420
So we did zero one in 5 hours. At one hour we see that CO replication is occurring in the cells and that 5 hours is where we

272
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:42,260
see a significant increase in replication in CO infected cells versus the singly infected.

273
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:51,740
The next result I have is the HCV infection enhancing SARS-CoV-2 entry into parasites.

274
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:57,500
So for this study or this part of our study, we looked at non-infected cells,

275
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:07,910
HCV infected cells and HCV infected cells that also included anti ace2 antibodies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry.

276
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:13,580
So we can see by this, I did not realize that that we tested.

277
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,930
So as you can see in this purple,

278
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:31,190
the anti Ace2 antibody did prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry and in the red HCV infection did increase the SARS-CoV-2 entry into parasites.

279
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:37,490
We also looked at this for H cells which are primary human hepatocytes,

280
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:42,770
which are more like the actual liver cells that you would see in a clinical sample.

281
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:51,740
And it did the exact same thing. So HCV infected cells did have a significantly higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 entry.

282
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:02,000
The next result looks at the expression of ace2 on cells that are infected with HCV.

283
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:15,110
So we looked at the ace2 RNA for change on these cells, and the non-infected cells had a pretty base level of ace2,

284
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:20,690
but once they were infected with HCV, the levels of ace2 increased significantly.

285
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:32,360
And we see this in the high 7.5 cancer cell line that we looked at, also in primary human hepatocytes and also in human liver biopsy samples.

286
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:42,860
So it is pretty across the board that HCV infection increases H2 receptors on all of these different types of liver cells.

287
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,139
As a control,

288
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:56,660
we looked at the hepg2 cells that are infected with HIV virus and we did not see an increase in ace2 RNA on cells that were infected with HPV.

289
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:02,180
So we have concluded that this is likely an HCV specific response.

290
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:10,630
And the last result I want to go over today is the ace2 expression and how it affects HCV infection.

291
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:18,400
As we all know, when a virus does something to cells, it likely has a reason for doing that.

292
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:25,750
So we wanted to look at whether ACE two specifically helped HCV in any way.

293
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:37,750
And so we looked at cells that were infected with HCV but had base levels of Ace2 and also HCV infected

294
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:45,820
cells with higher levels of ace2 to see if HCV infection entry into those cells would increase.

295
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:54,490
And we did see a significant increase in HCV entry into cells that had higher amounts of ACE2 receptor.

296
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,500
And I do want to know that there are some limitations of our study.

297
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:12,780
First, we mainly focus on the 7.5 cancer cell line, primarily because human hepatocytes have a low infection efficiency.

298
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:19,170
So in order to run this study and get enough data, we did use the 7.5 cancer cell line.

299
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:28,890
But more research should be done in primary human hepatocytes, as that would more closely show us what would happen in clinical relevance.

300
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:37,290
And we should also evaluate what would happen in clinical settings as we looked at co-infection and co replication.

301
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:42,270
But we don't know the actual outcomes that that would have on patients.

302
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:48,360
So more studies would have to be done on the clinical relevance of co-infections.

303
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:58,260
Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of determining specific pathogens that are infecting patients and co

304
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:05,070
infecting SARS-CoV-2 patients in order to accurately determine risk of severe disease in these patients.

305
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:13,820
And that is it. Thank you. Any questions?

306
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:29,430
Yes. So this is certainly true.

307
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,960
Infection in people with liver disease is linked to severe outcomes.

308
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:42,250
Right? Yes. So to what degree, based on this, do you think that that could be?

309
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:52,720
You know, that's a factor of having the liver tissue and cirrhosis of the liver like that or a fact of HCV viral control.

310
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:59,410
Like by doing after you die or control, you could then have better outcomes.

311
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:01,720
That's a great question.

312
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:14,350
I think that looking at the study, since we looked at both HCV and HPV and we only saw the Ace2 expression in HCV and not HPV.

313
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:27,890
Both of those would contribute to liver damage. So it makes me think that severe outcomes are more contributed specifically to HCV infection even.

314
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:40,180
I think more studies need to be done on liver cells, ace2 replication or ACE2 receptor after HCV treatment has occurred.

315
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:52,570
If liver cells continue to maintain those ace2 receptors, then any infection of HCV therefore could have those damaging effects of severe COVID.

316
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:57,820
Even if you don't currently have the infection. That's a good point. So it'd be more about prevention and about real.

317
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,569
Thank you. All right.

318
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:13,120
Thank you very much. Oh, right.

319
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:22,750
Well, excellent job to all three of our speakers. So let's go ahead and.
