00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:07,510
Welcome back. In this session, I will discuss the January through March agenda.

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,760
If you can recall, during these months,

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:17,600
we will be in the process of searching and selecting programs that you want to apply to help identify these programs,

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:25,170
you will then organize the each program requirements in a table, chart or create a checklist.

5
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,960
Before you start your search, make a list of assets that you consider important in a university,

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,730
for example, are you concerned with the reputation of the university?

7
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,320
Maybe there are key components you require to be built into the curriculum.

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:49,350
Maybe an internship or dissertation is important to you for maybe if the university program does not offer a great deal of funding.

9
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:57,030
This can be a deal breaker. For me attending a university offered a lot of funding was a priority for me as I was

10
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,400
conscious of how much law debt I had accumulated during my time undergraduate school.

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:11,250
I also consider is that a diverse group of individuals of importance to you, specifically within within your faculty, staff and student body.

12
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,300
Considering location because you might end up working in the state

13
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,850
you attend school or you have a preference, maybe have a preference for a certain climate.

14
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,130
If you seek research opportunity, then you want to attend a research university.

15
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,990
These universities typically more expensive,

16
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:36,270
but they offer you the opportunity to become a part of a research team. If research is not a major factor to you.

17
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,630
Attending a teaching school is for you.

18
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,840
Schools often focus on didactic learning and helping students build practical skills.

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,340
These schools are usually less expensive compared to research schools,

20
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:58,230
and the most important consideration of them all is making sure that the university offers your program of interest.

21
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:05,730
For example, if your interested in disaster management but the university does not offer this program, you're wasting your time.

22
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:16,350
The university would not be able to accept you because they know that they don't have a program there to support your interest.

23
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:26,370
The Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health, also a common acronym for is ASPPH is prominent membership organization.

24
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:33,240
That mission is to advance public health, advance the public health profession, and its professionals.

25
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:39,330
The organization also works closely with accredited public health programs and those seeking accreditation.

26
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:51,020
The ASPPH offers a great resource on their website to help students locate universities and colleges that have their program of interest.

27
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,130
So here's the ASPPH Program Finder.

28
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:03,920
This is a great resource for you all to use it to help you kind of narrow down and focus on what universities offer your program interest.

29
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:14,690
And it also helps you to look at maybe if you're looking at a specific location, are there any any many programs or answers in these locations?

30
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:24,970
So, for example, looking at all the areas of study, maybe you say that you're interested in.

31
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,950
Infectious diseases and microbiology, so we will select that and then

32
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:38,080
if we want to just create results based on this area of study, we can press a search button.

33
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,820
And it tells us that 14 institutions in 20 cities.

34
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:48,400
There are 26 programs and 14 institutions that offer this program of study.

35
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:55,990
So you can see you can go down your list and see what universities or what programs have this interest.

36
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:02,000
And also so say maybe they don't have a program or area stated within this box,

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,400
they don't allow us to limit ourselves so we can type in HIV and we can then look and

38
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:18,790
see what universities and what programs offer research or offer a concentration in HIV.

39
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:28,270
The great thing about this is it allows you to narrow the search down to only accredited universities and also allows you to look at specific,

40
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:36,430
specific locations. Also, this website is great because it allows you to look at dual degrees if that's of

41
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,790
interest that you in which we will talk about this case that a little bit more later.

42
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:45,880
But if you're interested in a dual degree, say an MPH/MSW, like myself

43
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:52,070
I can simply select that option. Use the search bar.

44
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:57,050
And it will narrow it down down to programs, they offer an MPH/MSW mind you

45
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:04,510
you're only seeing three universities here because we still have the microbiology infectious disease selected.

46
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:13,250
So that's a great way to kind of narrow it down. So, you know what school is going to have the microbiology infectious control program.

47
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,890
And now we also see these programs also offer an MPH/MSW route.

48
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:27,240
So you can see that although your list is very short, you know, what programs will offer your specific interest.

49
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:38,100
So after compiling your list of schools from ASPPH website, you're now ready to organize your programs into three categories.

50
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:44,100
So we're going to organize them into your dream schools, your plan B and your cushion schools.

51
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,850
So FPHLPer's dream big. Do not limit yourself.

52
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:54,720
Apply to programs where the competition is high. Target your GRE scores to your dream scores.

53
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:02,370
Let the school set the bar. Next you'll  categorize them into your plan B schools.

54
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,740
These schools are your backup plan. If you're not accepted into your dream school programs,

55
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,850
the possibility of acceptance is more likely within these programs in the

56
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:18,480
GRE scores are either average or the close the average. Finally select cushion schools.

57
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,040
Your chances of getting to these programs are strong, low competition.

58
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,510
and although these programs might check all your boxes, they,

59
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,700
It is a great school for you.

60
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:39,810
I would urge you to still put a lot of effort into your cushion schools because if all else fails, you have this cushion to fall back on.

61
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:44,880
I will recommend applying to at least four programs, but no more than six.

62
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,080
Applying to graduate school is very stressful and expensive,

63
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:55,950
Considering each school requires a personal statement and application fee associated with the program.

64
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:02,610
Also, the GRE exam only allows you to submit, submit your test or to four university.

65
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,060
So I would urge you that unless you want to pay the additional fee,

66
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:12,330
so maybe do no more than four or like i said stay at the six because it's still a little bit more manageable.

67
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:17,840
You're able to maybe pay for the extra two Universities.

68
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:25,250
Meeting the priority, after selecting your programs of itnerest, note the priority deadline,

69
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:31,970
the priority deadline is not the final deadline or is not the regular deadline, as they like to call it,

70
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,560
but the first application period for which application can be submitted.

71
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,930
This deadline is important because students who apply first are more likely to be accepted

72
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:50,620
More importantly, those who apply before the priotrity deadline are considered for financial awards, such as scholarships and fellowships first.

73
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:58,460
Also, because you will be notified of your acceptance first this gives you more time to make a decision.

74
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:05,960
Where to file the application portal can be found on your program's website. Program systems vary across

75
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:12,230
the program's. Most accredited universities and colleges who are public health programs,

76
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:22,980
specifically use the Schools of Public Health Education Dervice, also referred to as SOPHAS as their primary application server.

77
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:30,810
SOPHAS is great because it's a one stop shop, all the documents needed for your application is located in one place.

78
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:38,010
SOPHAS makes the application process easier because you can use one application to submit for each program.

79
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,640
Do norw that personal statements do vary by program,

80
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:50,760
so you have to rewrite the particular your particular personal statement to fit that program's requirement to fit that particular program.

81
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,400
But your resumé letters of recommendation and transcripts can be reused.

82
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:04,500
SOPHAS is not an appliacton server and is not affiliated with a particular university.

83
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:12,720
So programs cannot see where you are applying to. As mentioned earlier, each programs require an application fee.

84
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:23,740
SOPHAS does not does offer a free waiver assistance for those that qualify, Check the SOPHAS website or call customer service to learn more.

85
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,720
So this is just the home page of the SOPHAS website.

86
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,560
You can know that the two application buttons are where you would hit to go to apply to the SOPHAS website.

87
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:47,890
You also are able to access the academic profile profile program finder from the ASPPH website on the SOPHAS website as well.

88
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:55,290
Also, looking at the SOPHAS website, if you go to the events tab, you're able to see a list of upcoming events,

89
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:04,510
that the SOPHAS offers, these events are usually great if you want to learn more about the program of interest.

90
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:13,140
A perks of being a FPHLPer, a benefit of being a part of FPHLP, if their students receive a 75 dollar SOPHAS fe waiver,

91
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,760
if they are applying to the University of Michigan. To apply for a fee waiver,

92
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,550
explain the reason for your email and submit verification of participation documents

93
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:33,190
that you were in the FPHLP program to sph-inquiries@umich.edu.

94
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:41,050
So, after we have to selected our university is now time to organize all this information we just receive,

95
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:46,570
creating a chart is a great way to organize each program's application requirements.

96
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:53,470
Trying to remember each application requirement can be exasperating. Organizing the information and a chart,

97
00:10:53,470 --> 00:11:05,960
making a checklist or even creating a table can make it easier to refer to each application process and make it less intimidating and more manageable.

98
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:15,610
We have reached the end of this session, and as a reminder, we just discussed the first three months of the 13 month timeline.

99
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:27,168
In the next session we'll explore different methods to prepare for the graduate record examination, the GRE exam and skills for taking this exam.
