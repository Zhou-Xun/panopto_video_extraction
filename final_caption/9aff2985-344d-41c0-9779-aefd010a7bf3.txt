1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,600
Yeah, exactly. Think it's great?

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:15,120
I mean, that is a little bit.

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:22,350
That's right. According to one of the dorms.

4
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:44,850
I was like, oh, my God. So I checked with Barclays and I listened to it and I was the one about power.

5
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:56,910
But you're like, I'm sorry, I can't tell you guys.

6
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,900
That's one I was happy about.

7
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:15,700
I mean, you know, I think that's where it's like, yeah, I thought about partnering between this case.

8
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:25,520
Yeah. I can't sleep when I ain't nearly flawless in my apartment building.

9
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:45,780
I said, Oh, no, no, you got it already for ceremony.

10
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:54,970
So that's where I was.

11
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:04,980
No, I don't think that's all I would say.

12
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,809
It's like it's like I said, it's just like, I'll be out of your way.

13
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:21,450
And I'm like, if you're, like, trying to get over it sounds like you said, you know, you're not getting anywhere.

14
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:34,710
You know, people are just one more thing for getting married again.

15
00:02:36,150 --> 00:03:16,410
I'm not actually. It's like just like, oh, my God, I don't like I'm going to go outside, sit outside for 3 hours to get turned on.

16
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:28,780
I don't know what representations to encourage you to see all your hard work on public functions.

17
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,250
So let me explain this. All right. We're going to have you guys do as you watch presentations.

18
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,340
This is the first thing you do. We keep us engaged.

19
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:46,620
There's something attached to your grades, which is great for you guys to do, engage in a little peer review.

20
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:54,810
So after today's presentations and then the next two sessions, same thing, what have you.

21
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,990
You know, think about as you're watching people's presentations.

22
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:07,320
Who do you which verb do you think had sort of the best conceptual model that was easy to follow and understand and then best application of theory?

23
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:20,910
Again, most states this has nothing to do with your grades, but you guys should just sort of evaluate your peers in a in a way,

24
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:28,860
it will send out what you guys rated and hopefully exciting to some of your group.

25
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:38,339
Some of you look scared. It has nothing to do with your grades and there's no ranking from the lowest here.

26
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:50,999
It's just really cool. What sort of which presentation really sort of stood out to you so well, I submit will send this out at the end,

27
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,590
of course, before you leave so you can submit your rankings around this.

28
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,600
So I'll go ahead and get started because we have a.

29
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:08,250
A full day. So goes hand in hand, which is substance abuse.

30
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:16,240
Practice isn't.

31
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:36,900
Uh, you know, I only really used two things up here first and half the time, and it's not over yet.

32
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:55,590
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

33
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:00,840
Yes. Okay.

34
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,120
Yes. My name is Casey.

35
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:13,229
I'm Carly and Becca. Emily. And today we're going to be talking about our conceptual model and intervention,

36
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:17,290
which is designed to intervene in substance abuse with adolescent use.

37
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,560
So substance abuse is defined as a pattern of substance use, whether that be illegal or illegal.

38
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:31,879
It can often lead to distress and other significant problems. Dependance on the substance can be defined as cravings, interference with daily life,

39
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,960
development of a high tolerance and suffering from withdrawal symptoms when you're not using it.

40
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:46,010
In 2017, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that 19.7 million Americans over the age of 12 had suffered from substance use disorder.

41
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:52,790
Of those, 74% suffered with alcohol abuse disorder and 38% struggled with illicit drug use.

42
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:59,060
So for our project, we decided to focus on alcohol abuse because while alcohol is necessarily considered a gateway drug,

43
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:05,180
excessive use of it has shown to be a risk factor for other substance abuse later on in the individual's life.

44
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,530
Alcohol use can also prime the brain for a heightened response to marijuana and nicotine,

45
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:17,480
which we also know can increase the risk of using other substances in addition to excessive consumption.

46
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:23,330
Or just like, you know, some short term uses, whether it be loss of inhibition or difficulty breathing.

47
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,340
Excessive consumption can lead to liver damage, cardiovascular problems and memory issues further on.

48
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:38,160
So for our target population, we wanted to focus on high school students and college student athletes between the ages of 14 to 22 in the U.S.

49
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,710
Adolescents tend to partake in risk because they can view themselves as invulnerable to the consequences.

50
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,940
This belief can empower them to feel unstoppable mentally and physically.

51
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:52,410
In particular, student athletes are more likely to feel pressure to uphold a certain image and

52
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,470
can struggle with the expectations that are held within a team environment.

53
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:03,000
So with the stress and expectations, in addition to like the competitive dynamic, they can be more likely to use substance use.

54
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,460
Therefore, although 18 to 22 year olds are categorized as emerging adults,

55
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:13,500
they are still at risk of engaging in risky behavior with substance use due to poor decision making.

56
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:22,870
And so another reason why we want to focus on alcohol use was that the research around student athletes tends to focus on performance enhancing drugs,

57
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,900
not so much on alcohol, tobacco and marijuana.

58
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,110
So here are two figures of substance.

59
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:38,560
College athletes, 2016, 2014. And as you can see, although the women's sports has substantially less use than the men's sports,

60
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,700
Boston illustrates similar trends to substance use, particularly with alcohol.

61
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:50,500
And so that's why we want to focus on high school and college student athletes due to their changes in physical, cognitive, social and emotional.

62
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,530
So we wanted to be sure that our intervention was able to support healthy behaviors,

63
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:03,500
both in the short term and in the long term, to ultimately foster a healthier, more successful, largely student athletes.

64
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:10,400
So first and foremost, approximately, we wanted to focus on academic performance, which has been shown to be hindered when a student uses substances.

65
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:18,890
Some of our research showed that student's GPA can decrease by 0.03 points on average every semester that they heavily use substances.

66
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,250
So while that seems like a small difference right away, over time,

67
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:27,860
if that suit against it to a habit or dependency that can take a great toll on their grades in high school,

68
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:33,139
this can partially impact what college they are able to go to. Scholarships are able to get in college.

69
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,210
That may influence if they're able to get a degree or what kinds of opportunities they will have during and after graduation,

70
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,310
kind of as a bridge between PROXIMO and us. So we wanted to focus on physical and mental health.

71
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:50,300
The prefrontal cortex, which is the area of the brain that focuses on rational decision making, is not fully mature.

72
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:56,180
And we about 25 years old and matures greatly during this sensitive period of development.

73
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,640
And it's also shown to be had its growth stunted when adolescents use substances.

74
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:10,470
Using substances like alcohol and marijuana during these sensitive periods can also decrease brain volume in areas like the amygdala and hippocampus,

75
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,180
which are very important for things like behavioral control, mood, memory and attention.

76
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:16,890
In the short term,

77
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:24,209
consistent use of substances can decrease performance on the field or the court and also hinder an athlete's ability to recover from injury,

78
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,020
which of course could impact their opportunities to play at the next level. That's important for them.

79
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,800
Thinking ahead, the impact of substance use can be felt as early as your college years.

80
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:42,150
If you do begin to use early and that can persist into adulthood and manifest as a variety of emotional, mental health and substance use disorders.

81
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,970
And finally, in the long term, research has shown that the earlier someone begins to use substances,

82
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:53,970
the more likely they are to abuse them, develop dependencies and progress to more risky substances later on in life.

83
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,090
This has huge implications, of course, for society as a whole,

84
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:02,640
because these student athletes and students in general are the next generation of leaders for our nation and world.

85
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,680
So it's clear that adolescent substance abuse has negative consequences across the lifespan,

86
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,999
and our stance is that it's important to intervene as early as possible in order

87
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,680
to prevent and minimize the harms that are associated with abusing substances.

88
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,210
This here is a table from one of the papers that we use to inform our intervention.

89
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:26,999
It compares the prevalence of various exposures and outcomes that exist between students

90
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,480
who started using substances early around age 13 and those who had a later onset of use.

91
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,130
This is specifically alcohol.

92
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:44,370
We can see that 65% of adolescents who began using alcohol early also had a parent in the home who had an alcohol or substance abuse disorder.

93
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:49,890
30% of those who use alcohol early also began to use other drugs at an earlier age,

94
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:56,790
and its early onset also increases the risk of lifetime dependency on alcohol or whatever substance the student is using.

95
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,979
So this data supports our claim that early intervention that considers a variety of different risk

96
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,180
factors is crucial to reduce the harmful long term outcomes that could be associated with this.

97
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:17,010
This is our conceptual model. We use social cognitive theory to inform our conceptual model and understanding students low self-esteem,

98
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:22,020
poor self-image, family history of substance abuse and social environmental factors.

99
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:28,470
We also use inner organizational relations theory to understand the cultivation of social support in the teen setting,

100
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:35,100
to address peer pressure and team culture and how the group comes together for the common goal of reducing or limiting substance use.

101
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,090
I'm starting on the far left of this slide.

102
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:45,540
The antecedents affecting our conceptual model include demographic factors like age, sex or gender, race and ethnicity.

103
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,690
Socio excuse me, socioeconomic status,

104
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:53,940
athletic factors like league regulations regarding substance use and type of sport

105
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,340
and individual circumstances such as family history or exposure to substance abuse,

106
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:04,920
adverse childhood experiences. I mean, these factors affect student athlete substance use,

107
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,979
which would then open the door to substance abuse and moderating factors that would lead to student

108
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:17,520
athlete substance use to becomes of use include curious characteristics of the substance use,

109
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:24,870
which would be influenced by personal and social support factors mediators affecting the severity of outcomes.

110
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:30,510
Kerley mentioned the previous slide include decreased attention span, negative hippocampus effects,

111
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,340
decreased neural pruning, inhibition of the prefrontal cortex and the emotional center.

112
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,460
Development and addiction reward pathway activation.

113
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,620
Okay, so now we're going to talk about our specific intervention that we designed.

114
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,150
So our intervention aims to prevent student athletes substance abuse and abuse,

115
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,669
primarily by connecting high school and college athletes with each other and connecting them with

116
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:02,790
educational resources in order to motivate them to resist the pressure to use and abuse substances.

117
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:11,370
So over our intervention has two main goals. The first is to increase awareness of long term negative consequences of substance abuse,

118
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:18,450
and the second is to empower student athletes to feel confident in their decision to not engage in substance use.

119
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:25,499
So key objectives include the program, including addressing team culture around substance use,

120
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,880
challenging an individual athlete's beliefs and enhancing social networks.

121
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:37,890
As Becker mentioned, our conceptual model and thus our intervention is informed by the inner organizational relations theory and the social cognitive.

122
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:44,070
And then kind of looking more specifically at our intervention details,

123
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:49,590
the program will consist of monthly workshops over the course of one academic semester.

124
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:58,380
Each session will be 2 hours long, with the first hour consisting of activities and education and discussion broken down by academic level.

125
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,679
Whereas the second hour will consist of that buddy program.

126
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,209
With the high school and college athletes working together in our team,

127
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:12,720
we kind of discussed how we would pair student athletes together techniques to incentivize participation in our program,

128
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:19,200
and then screening processes in order to ensure that we had good role models for college athletes enrolled in the program.

129
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:25,860
So kind of looking more specifically at that first hour, the first hour will be that workshop session,

130
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,469
and we will have it facilitated by community members in the community that the intervention is taking

131
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:37,830
place and it will focus on different aspects of athlete substance use and abuse like peer pressure,

132
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:46,560
stress and coping, safety, health, the consequences of use, and kind of that self-confidence to resist and change team culture.

133
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:53,189
Then during the second hour, the athletes will be paired up in that buddy mentor mentee relationship with

134
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:57,330
one college student and one athlete high school athlete from the same sport.

135
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:05,400
As Emily mentioned earlier, sport kind of plays a key role as to how much alcohol use and abuse is taking place on the team.

136
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,070
So it's important that high school and college athletes can have this in common.

137
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:17,640
And then this portion will primarily focus on building community and enhancing social networks

138
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:23,579
that are around activities that don't involve substances like games or service activities,

139
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,730
and kind of focus on forming friendships.

140
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:32,730
And then our intervention is not specifically or inherently culturally specific,

141
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,680
but it's designed to be adapted to the specific community that will be taking place in.

142
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,180
And then lastly, in order to measure the effectiveness of our program,

143
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:48,360
we'll have an anonymous pre semester and post semester survey to have a knowledge check and things like that.

144
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,830
So the first theory that we use to kind of inform our intervention activities will be the organizational relations theory.

145
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:04,620
This theory explains how different organizations formally work together toward a common goal here, or our organizations include high school athletes,

146
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:11,330
college athletes, school and athletic administrators and the community partners leading workshops within the athlete groups.

147
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:19,319
Each sport could also be considered its own organization. The goal here is to reduce student athletes substance use and eliminate abuse by

148
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,040
using workshops to combine the capacities of students to influence each other,

149
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:29,400
the community partners to educate and motivate students at the school and athletic administration to oversee and continue the program.

150
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:36,030
Students in these organizations are combining their resources together to form a promotional network.

151
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,480
We hope to increase the support for student athletes to resist substances through through proactive.

152
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,940
Yes, through proactive change of team culture, by uniting teams.

153
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,740
They can give and receive support and help them enhance their existing networks.

154
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:59,910
By bringing high schoolers with college students together, they can create new networks around the goal of preventing substance abuse.

155
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,860
Using connections between these groups and organizations can help to demonstrate to student

156
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,400
athletes that they are not alone in their choice to limit their use of substances.

157
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:14,669
And incorporating resources into the fabric of these schools and athletic departments can provide another angle

158
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:19,830
of support for students that could be long lasting by expanding social networks to include trustworthy adults.

159
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:29,300
Our intervention is also informed by observational learning, which is part of the social cognitive theory,

160
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:36,350
an observational learning search that people can witness and observe the behavior conducted by others and then reproduce those behaviors.

161
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:42,920
This is often exhibited through modeling of behaviors of individuals seeing successful demonstration of behavior.

162
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,230
They can also complete that behavior successfully.

163
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:52,430
As mentioned in our intervention, high school students are paired with undergraduate college athletes or the role models.

164
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,909
In this case with the intention the high school students would witness and

165
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,900
interact with successful college athletes who do not use or abuse substances.

166
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:03,499
This interaction would occur during the monthly workshops for the second half

167
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,370
of the meetings and the mentor mentee relationship building portion and high

168
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,969
school students can observe the desired behavior conducted by college athletes

169
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,480
refraining from substance use and be encouraged to reproduce that behavior.

170
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:21,050
College athletes would serve as the role models and that they are similar to the high school students and would be perceived as a higher status.

171
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:26,990
And they could connect with the high school students via mastery models depending on the high school student self-efficacy.

172
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,170
So another contract that we want to call this efficacy,

173
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:38,030
which is defined as the belief that an individual has control over and is able to execute a behavior.

174
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,059
So in one of our monthly workshops, we would focus on helping athletes navigate situations on how to see,

175
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:48,230
knowing what to do in those environments, by focusing on how to strengthen their self-confidence,

176
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:53,040
opposing decision making, reducing likelihood of succumbing to peer pressure, in addition,

177
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:57,140
increasing their knowledge of substance use through like safety measures and personal anecdotes.

178
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,740
It can increase their control over their own behaviors and decisions.

179
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:07,730
And then the last constructs that we're going to mention that informed our intervention is normative beliefs.

180
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:16,370
So social cognitive theory names, normative beliefs as a construct that represents is representative of the idea that an individual's beliefs are

181
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:22,610
representative of how the other important people in their life believe a behavior should or should not be performed.

182
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:28,700
So our intervention will address normative beliefs through hosting workshops to address peer pressure.

183
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,870
By bringing entire teams together, we will address team culture in an attempt to reframe those team norms around positive

184
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:40,790
substance use and then incorporating influential adults into the conversation.

185
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:44,690
So by having those important community members come in and speak and athletes,

186
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:52,640
perception will hopefully be shifted when those important community members speak positively about substance use.

187
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,049
And then by selecting positive, positive collegiate role models,

188
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,800
the beliefs of the high school students will be shaped by the beliefs of the college student.

189
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:09,860
So the goal is to change the way that the student athletes think about substance use and then change their behaviors around alcohol and drugs.

190
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,550
And then finally, just a few words about her experience.

191
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:23,540
We all thought it was really interesting to kind of take a deep dive into a new topic and to your topic

192
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,439
through the lens of all the theories and models that we have learned and talked about this semester,

193
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,980
to really figure out which one we thought was much best on.

194
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:36,940
And that is very cool to see how our project evolved throughout the semester and to see how it finally came out.

195
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:43,790
And it was really fulfilling to see everything that we had learned over the course of the semester be able to be applied to a realistic,

196
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:48,520
the real world situation. Yeah. And then lastly, we were just thankful that we had each other.

197
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:53,300
We worked really well as a team and all of our brains worked better together to produce

198
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,420
an intervention that we're proud of and that we couldn't have done individually.

199
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:23,970
It's. I think it shows you that you have to do what I like.

200
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,770
I mean, I don't know if I needed some kind of tutoring because, like, you got to get really.

201
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,600
I think sometimes it's less like, wow, really?

202
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:53,360
Just so I would never say that because she must've known that, like, you know, once you get to like.

203
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,130
As much as I grew up on it, I just felt like go.

204
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:12,959
It's not like I wouldn't want to watch that one, which is not there.

205
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:39,840
But also in that time was later on because like it was like, yeah, you weren't supposed to just have one hour, so let's go ahead and get started.

206
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:45,360
Hi everyone. I'm Cassie. I'm Andrew. I'm Annie.

207
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:52,470
And today we'll be sharing about our project on binge eating disorder and bullying and nervous and bipoc adolescent populations.

208
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,730
And first, we just wanted to note that this can be a really sensitive topic for some people,

209
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,270
and we'll try our best to explain these disorders, spread awareness about them, and propose some effective interventions.

210
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,340
So binge eating disorder or bed and bulimia nervosa or be and are mental disorders

211
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:16,250
defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or the DSM five?

212
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:23,240
The criteria for BD involve recurrent and persistent binge eating, which involves behaviors like rapid consumption,

213
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:28,760
uncomfortable fullness after meals, eating when not hungry or dining alone due to embarrassment.

214
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,420
And these behaviors are often accompanied by psychological stress.

215
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,140
And also no compensatory practices are involved in bed.

216
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:46,310
And the diagnosis criteria is pretty similar to BD, except there are two criteria for inappropriate compensatory actions like purging,

217
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:53,660
excessive exercise, laxative use, and there's also negative self evaluation based on shape and weight.

218
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:05,900
So research suggests that the lifetime prevalence rate of BD is about 1.6% and the lifetime prevalence rate of 0.9%.

219
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,300
And other studies estimate BD prevalence rates around 1 to 5% in adolescents,

220
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:16,520
with been slightly lower due to the additional diagnostic criteria that I mentioned before.

221
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:22,759
And while these rates may seem really small when you consider them into in comparison to childhood cancer,

222
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:32,450
which receives a lot more funding, awareness and resources than eating disorders, that rate is about one in 5000 or 0.02%.

223
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,660
So we just wanted to mention that, to put it into perspective a bit.

224
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,740
So we focus on two sections of outcomes, health outcomes and societal outcomes.

225
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,800
Obviously, there are many health risks that come with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder.

226
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:57,080
Some of them listed here are high blood pressure, high cholesterol, coronary heart disease, type two diabetes, obesity.

227
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:05,960
And then because I believe your nervosa also is associated with purging behaviors, it has a couple of other health risks associated with it,

228
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:15,050
such as electrolyte imbalances, gastrointestinal issues, heart failure, tooth decay, acid reflux and esophageal damage.

229
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:24,260
Because of these many health risks associated with eating disorders, the mortality rates are about six times higher than in the general population.

230
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,490
And then moving on to societal outcomes.

231
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:36,430
The burden of all of these health issues not only lies on the individual, but also on the health care system not responsible for treating them.

232
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:48,370
It is estimated that health outcomes stemming from eating disorders cost the United States 64.7 billion in productivity loss and health care costs.

233
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,490
And that's in 2018 to 2019 alone.

234
00:26:52,330 --> 00:27:00,100
Also approximately $11,000 in costs per person per year for individuals with eating disorders.

235
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:09,640
So not only is it really important to address and stop eating disorders so that we can promote healthier adults and decrease that high mortality rate.

236
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:15,340
But we also want to curb economic costs attributed to bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder.

237
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:18,980
So particular things that.

238
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:24,770
So moving on to risk factors so it's important to note that eating disorders can be present in all individuals regardless of race,

239
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:29,929
gender, age, ethnicity, body shape, weight, sexual orientation or socioeconomics.

240
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:34,579
That is. It is also important to note that eating disorders are commonly comorbid with

241
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,990
psychological disorders in particularly people or populations at risk adolescents,

242
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:47,660
women, black and Hispanic populations. These and our target population for particular intervention are black,

243
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:53,149
indigenous people of color and adolescents who are experiencing eating disorders.

244
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:56,600
Adolescents specifically in the age range of 10 to 19 years old.

245
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:02,090
Why, you may ask? Because binge eating disorders and bulimia nervosa put people at high risk for health complications.

246
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,669
And black teenagers are 15 50% more likely than white teenagers to exhibit bulimic behavior and

247
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:14,450
less likely to receive resources for treatment and intervention due to historic dispositions.

248
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:23,240
All right. So this is our conceptual model for the development of eating disorders, specifically BD and bean in bipoc adolescents.

249
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,799
Perhaps the first thing you'll notice is that rather than separating out every single

250
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,300
element here and kind of creating something that was even more chaotic and indecipherable,

251
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:38,000
we really decided to gather all the related aspects under a broad but yet cohesive grouping.

252
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:42,979
Some of the relationships that we're going to discuss may feel a little bit more natural than others.

253
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:47,900
But, you know, particularly given some of the material that we talked about in this class,

254
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,070
but we assure you that everything here is backed by the scientific literature.

255
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:58,880
So there are three key constructs through which basically all of the relationships in our model go.

256
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:04,070
The first one we look at is the socioeconomic or socio environmental factors.

257
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:09,860
So this would include concepts of family, community, socioeconomic status and living environment.

258
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:18,500
It's pretty logical that these elements relate to what we're going to call medical influences, such as access to care, diagnosis and treatment.

259
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:24,050
Experiences with the health care system go on to directly influence the development of AEDs.

260
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:32,360
So similarly, food diet, including nutrition and food insecurity, mediates between that socio environmental factors and eddies.

261
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,340
And, well, socio environmental factors can directly influence psychological outcomes.

262
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,030
Physical activity also exists as a moderator between the two.

263
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:46,070
The second key component we're really going to look at is psychological influences.

264
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:53,690
So as we previously saw in the two slides go on the risk factors, there actually is a genetic component here.

265
00:29:53,690 --> 00:30:00,780
And for our genetics friends, one example would be the d r d to a one over yo that's linked to compulsive overeating.

266
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:07,970
Psychological influences are directly relevant in the development of eating disorders, as we discussed.

267
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,390
So that's why there's that direct connection there.

268
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:18,620
The final connection that we're going to look at is the cultural influences, which includes elements like social networks,

269
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:25,070
social media use, marginalized identities, peer support, the idea of internalization and weight bias.

270
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:31,010
And these factors directly impact psychological influences and food diet.

271
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,880
But they can also be very relevant in the development of eating disorders as well.

272
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:41,670
So we have four different interventions that we're going to go through today.

273
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:51,210
The first one is eating disorder screenings, and this was informed by the social ecological model, specifically organizational relationships.

274
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:57,120
Our goal with this intervention was to increase access to eating disorder screenings for

275
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,680
bipoc adolescents as they tend to be under-diagnosed compared to their white peers.

276
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:06,690
So we wanted to do this by bringing eating disorder screenings into a school setting.

277
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:11,340
We want to educate school staff about risks and signs of eating disorders.

278
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,320
And then we would want to utilize school nurses to conduct the eating disorder screenings.

279
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:21,629
Obviously, school nurses have a medical background so they can properly identify concerning

280
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:27,570
behaviors as well as then direct students towards resources if needed.

281
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:34,979
Also, school nurses tend to already know students and they can have trust and rapport already built with students,

282
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,660
which is important when you're talking about these really sensitive topics, such as eating disorder.

283
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:44,760
We would want to utilize a culturally competent eating disorder screening tool.

284
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,910
The screening tools that exist right now aren't the greatest,

285
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,530
and so we just would want to keep that in mind if this intervention was to be implemented

286
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:57,330
so that we would be sensitive to the population that we're actually intervening with.

287
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:06,180
We hope that this intervention would allow for low barrier access to screenings and earlier detections of eating disorders.

288
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:15,129
So in conjunction with screenings, it's really important for interventions to change school curriculum so that adolescents can develop a

289
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:19,990
more informed and culturally sensitive understanding of both nutrition and healthy eating behaviors.

290
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:27,310
And we know that the social cognitive theory explains how the perceived and actual environment of an individual really impacts their behavior.

291
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:35,440
So with that in mind, to target weight related social pressures and the large amount of media that's often linked to body dissatisfaction,

292
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:41,830
we propose that curriculum be structured around participatory based reading, writing and verbal exercises.

293
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:46,570
And these kinds of techniques have been found to induce psychological dissonance and discomfort,

294
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:56,170
which can really encourage people to have behavior and mindset changes, and by also sparking discussions and enhancing media literacy.

295
00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:02,680
Adolescents may be more likely to protect themselves from then ideal internalization rhetoric as well as negative

296
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:08,440
comments around body shape and weight that they may find on social media or hear around a school community.

297
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:16,150
And lastly, educational programs have the potential to bolster social support, self-empowerment and non dieting approaches to nutrition.

298
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:21,910
And all of these outcomes have revealed improvement in reducing eating disorder pathology in the research.

299
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:28,390
So our third intervention is kind of going to be an intermediary between the school system and the greater community at large.

300
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:35,950
And we're really going to focus on physical activity. This part was informed by both the socio ecological model and social cognitive theory,

301
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,750
really as it relates to the development of skills and certainly opportunities and barriers as well.

302
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,759
Our ultimate goal is to really boost physical activity as there's a lot of scientific research

303
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,690
that says that being more physically active can improve your psychological function,

304
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:53,440
which as we know, is a direct contributor to the development of eating disorders.

305
00:33:53,830 --> 00:34:00,340
We want to really partner with community organizations to create and promote accessible and safe spaces for people to be active,

306
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:07,599
to create physical education programs where people can gain that knowledge, and also to create group athletic opportunities.

307
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:14,500
Specifically, noncompetitive sports have been shown to reduce the risk for developing an eating disorder.

308
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:21,880
And ultimately, all of that really needs to be influenced by understanding the barriers that are faced by bipoc adolescent populations.

309
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:30,650
And a lot of the intervention focuses on community engagement. This was also informed by the social, ecological, but the social ecological model.

310
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,540
And our goal of this is to partner with community organizations and community member community

311
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:40,999
members in order to host workshops that can address both food scarcity and binge eating disorders,

312
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,720
because there is a lack of education and lack of resources for binge eating disorders that actually reach bipoc.

313
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:55,280
And we also wanted to use feedback from these groups in order to improve access for community members and adolescents to the food.

314
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,499
And we wanted to use the knowledge that we gather from community members in order to address them.

315
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,579
Of course we can go because there is there are many ways that relate to burgeoning

316
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:12,760
disorder in popular adolescence associated with stigma and seeking hate and looks like.

317
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:26,850
And do we have any questions? Thank you so much.

318
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:39,370
I don't know what's going to make me feel good about Christmas.

319
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:47,510
No, I just think I need to take it out on an afternoon.

320
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:53,380
Yeah. I mean, if I had to go through all the things that I.

321
00:35:53,410 --> 00:36:01,330
Well, I think sometimes I would say, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

322
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:07,300
I decided that I was really going to struggle every day.

323
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:17,020
All day I was about to ruin it. Or 3.0 I was like, anybody else, like, really freaking out like that?

324
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:23,420
I guess it was wedding colors. Okay.

325
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:38,240
Well, Casey. Casey didn't seem to be on stage, so we were there.

326
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:51,550
Hi, everyone. I know we are the child child group and our project was focused on kindergarten vaccinate Michigan.

327
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,240
Hi, Marissa. I'm Emily.

328
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,879
Cool. I'm an overview.

329
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:05,200
We have a lot to cover and not much time, and we're going to start by talking about the background information and then our target population,

330
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:12,490
which is children in the thumb, Michigan. And then we will go into our process of creating our model.

331
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:20,710
Then we will share a final model on our intervention and then some limitations and future directions that we could see on a project like this going.

332
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:28,179
So beginning with our background, vaccinations are one of the most important and cost effective public health interventions with social,

333
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:31,839
economic and overall health outcomes. For example,

334
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,479
vaccinations administered to children from 1994 to 2013 are expected to prevent 21

335
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:43,990
million hospitalizations and 32,000 deaths and save $295 billion in direct costs.

336
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,150
So obviously they work and they're great.

337
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:54,400
However, only 71.3% of 24 months year olds, 24 month year olds had received their combined 17 vaccine series as of 2018.

338
00:37:55,030 --> 00:38:02,350
And this is the vaccine series that contains really infectious diseases such as measles, mumps, polio, the standard series we probably all have.

339
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:09,140
And 71.3% is lower than the 94% rate that would be needed for more community level protection.

340
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:13,780
The combined seven series is also important because it's what children need to begin school and that

341
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:17,750
starts enrolling in kindergarten when they would submit their immunization information to schools.

342
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:24,410
And depending on the states, however, exemptions are allowed where kids can enter school without having their vaccine series completed.

343
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:29,780
And this presents the potential for infectious disease outbreaks, such as the 2019 measles,

344
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,890
one where almost 1300 children were affected, including those at Disneyland.

345
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:41,600
So because these exemptions can vary by state, we wanted to really narrow into Michigan and as far as is said, in particular, the thumb of Michigan.

346
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:46,339
So the school exemptions in Michigan can be medical, religious or philosophical.

347
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,469
Medical or religious are pretty self-explanatory.

348
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:55,280
Philosophical refers more to the ideologies and beliefs of the parents for why they don't want their children to receive the vaccines.

349
00:38:55,550 --> 00:39:02,180
And specifically, we wanted to focus on the thumb of Michigan because as you can see here, we focus on Carousel and Clair pure cars,

350
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:09,710
where nearly all the schools in these regions had a vaccination rate of less than 95%, meaning there is potential for an infectious outbreak.

351
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:14,450
I do want to highlight that with COVID 19 not even taking into account the COVID 19 vaccines,

352
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:21,950
this issue has gotten worse with the overall children completing the recommended course of vaccines decreasing and school waiver rates increasing,

353
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:24,620
with over half of these being for philosophical reasons.

354
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,120
And as I said, the philosophical reasons are more those ideologies and beliefs of the parents.

355
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,480
And so that is what we believe would be most targetable by intervention.

356
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,559
So overall,

357
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:40,549
we want to target the behavior of the parents that hold these philosophical beliefs are exempting their children to get them to vaccinate their

358
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:48,230
children as our proximate outcome to help us achieve our just outcome of increasing vaccination rates of kindergarten children in these counties.

359
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:57,410
Okay. So we when we started out with her model, we informed it with use of the health belief model and the social cognitive theory.

360
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:06,020
So our first model, we have personal factors, risk perception and perceived norms all coming from health beliefs model.

361
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:14,390
We have behavioral factors, socio environmental factors, education about vaccines and self-efficacy coming from social cognitive theory.

362
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:25,729
All of these, all of these leading to changes in parents attitudes toward vaccine and increasing vaccination in kindergarten children,

363
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:28,640
and that this first model was wrong.

364
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:36,410
When we started to look at it, we really had to go back to the drawing board and see where all of our arrows were really going.

365
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:39,860
So we went on to the next version. We added a title.

366
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:44,630
Our social environmental factors went to behavioral risk in education.

367
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,740
We had personal factors going right to perceived norms,

368
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:57,350
and we changed this to making a plan to have a vaccination appointment instead of changing attitudes.

369
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:07,100
This version was also wrong when we started really kind of looking into the literature to support our heroes and connections.

370
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:12,379
We really had to go back and really look at where our heroes were going.

371
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:18,200
So this was our final version. So we had personal factors going directly to social, environmental factors.

372
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:24,410
Education became education about vaccines and the diseases that they prevent risk perception

373
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:29,300
straight to making a plan and perceived norms straight to increased vaccination.

374
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:37,010
And so now that we had our final version in place, we were really able to get in and start looking at the interactions between our constructs.

375
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:42,050
So personal factors is an antecedent to perceived norms.

376
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:46,760
So things like age, socioeconomic status, employment,

377
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:55,850
geographic location all contribute to whether or not a person identifies with and becomes a part of a group like a religious or a cultural.

378
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,880
And so these groups all have norms, so a person in that group would perceive those norms.

379
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:10,640
And so a person's perceived norms about vaccination within a group would influence whether or not they got their child vaccinated.

380
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:18,290
And making a plan to to have a vaccination also directly influences vaccination in kindergartners,

381
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:28,790
because research has shown that having a plan in place to have a vaccination helps people follow through with that vaccination.

382
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,610
And to go back to kind of more the beginning of the model and go through our

383
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:36,900
main two pathways through behavioral factors and social environmental factors.

384
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,770
As Emily said, personal factors were our main antecedents.

385
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:47,280
And they can influence behavioral factors, especially enrollment in health insurance, as there's difference in insurance rates based on age rates,

386
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:54,000
ethnicity, employment and education levels, as well as the comprehensiveness of that insurance can be affected by geographic location.

387
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,600
Personal factors can also influence socio environmental factors.

388
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:03,480
In particular, geographic location can really have an influence on opportunities and barriers to health care access.

389
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,669
Some of the counties that we're looking at are more rural,

390
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:11,280
and there can be a greater distance to travel, to get to health care, greater costs associated with it,

391
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:18,059
and just more of a scarcity of clinics, as Emily said, also moving from social, environmental to educational vaccines and diseases.

392
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:24,600
We want to include that having access to health education was important, as previous parents have noted,

393
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,589
that they didn't feel like they had access to those one on one conversations with physicians to

394
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:32,790
really gain the knowledge that needed to eventually make the decision to vaccinate their children.

395
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:37,860
And finally, we thought social, environmental, especially with role models and key figures in the community,

396
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:42,000
could be a moderator of behavioral factors of parents engaging in school activities.

397
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:49,110
As previous readers research has placed, parents within social networks have been connected to more parents increases,

398
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:54,400
involvement in school activity, and now they're focused in a little bit on risk perception.

399
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:01,170
Behavioral factors have a direct relationship to risk perception in that enrollment and health insurance and the

400
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:08,280
associated knowledge that comes from having regular interactions with a health care provider as well as mandates.

401
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:20,340
Schools have been shown to increase one's perceived risk as well as more correctly align perceived risk with actual risk and then vise versa.

402
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:27,330
Risk perception also impacts how people engage in some of the factors, such as with COVID 19,

403
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:33,330
as people felt as though they were more at risk of getting diseases or just general health complications.

404
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,490
More people enrolled in health insurance,

405
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:44,580
similarly on how someone perceives their risk will also impact what school and whether or not they have their child enroll in school.

406
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:50,910
Education has a direct relationship to risk perception in a pretty kind of obvious way.

407
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:57,480
The more people know about vaccines and diseases, the more they have a better understanding of their perceived risk and susceptibility.

408
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:05,460
And then finally, there is research shows that there is a pretty strong connection between risk perception and making a plan,

409
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:12,180
and things such as on perceived risk of likelihood and severity of susceptibility all have a direct

410
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:17,700
impact on one's likelihood in making a plan to engage in vaccination behavior in particular.

411
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:21,780
So social environmental factors,

412
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:32,040
they lead to a risk perception that antecedent to risk perception and opportunities that one's has like the availability of insurance,

413
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:38,490
they shape their ability to control their health behavior. And this affects the risk perception and things like this concept of norms,

414
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:42,870
the perceived versus actual vaccination rate and the health behaviors that they think other

415
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:47,639
peoples around them and the community and the role models actually do also affects the risk.

416
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:55,950
Perception and education about vaccines and diseases is a mediator between socio socio environmental factors and self-efficacy.

417
00:45:56,130 --> 00:46:01,950
Because the knowledge that the parents have and the way they look for information from valid sources affects how they are,

418
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:07,980
the self-efficacy they have, and their motivation to actually make a plan to take a vaccination appointment.

419
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:11,049
And they're making a plan to taking a vaccination appointment.

420
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:17,610
There's also a mediator between self-efficacy and our final desired outcome of increasing vaccination and their potential.

421
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:25,020
So moving on to our intervention, how did we decide what our targets are?

422
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:30,360
The highlight of the parts are actually the parts we decided to focus on for our intervention.

423
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:37,410
We worked our way back worth thinking about how we can increase making a plan to take a vaccination appointment.

424
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:45,150
And we can do that by aligning this perception with the real risk and increasing self-efficacy, which is can be done.

425
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:48,959
Therefore, they're both preceded by socio environmental factors,

426
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,430
which is basically we decided where we decided to focus most of our intervention efforts.

427
00:46:55,340 --> 00:47:06,350
So what's our intervention? So basically our intervention is it's county led and it's a community driven

428
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:12,290
intervention and it's mainly organized by the potatoes and the public schools.

429
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:19,940
And it is focusing on the parents of kids who need to be vaccinated at the pre-kindergarten age.

430
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:28,940
So we decided why not to provide a free playgroup and observe session playgroup for the moment and subsequently, these are my kids.

431
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:32,480
And so yeah.

432
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,490
So it's a mom and me playgroup.

433
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:45,860
So and the first Friday of every month there will be a free teacher led session that has the free snacks and the chance for the parents to socialize.

434
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:50,750
And in these sessions is, well, we are going to do our intervention.

435
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:53,630
So what's our intervention? It's a multilevel intervention.

436
00:47:53,870 --> 00:48:00,980
The first part is at the beginning of the session before the playgroup, that will be a to all and the physician information session.

437
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:06,950
The physician will come and he will talk. What time, what he was, he will say about the vaccines that the kids need.

438
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:12,070
He will talk about the vaccines that the kids need to take and at what age where they can take them.

439
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:23,810
He will talk about the misconceptions of vaccines. He will also provide the more information about the importance of taking vaccines.

440
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:29,030
After that, he will also answer questions which will help personalize this,

441
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:34,910
this and tailored it for the people that are there in case they have any issues or

442
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:40,940
to notice the risk that they actually think versus the risk that's actually there.

443
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,700
And after that,

444
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:51,830
there will also be a pop up onsite vaccination clinic where the kids can actually just go and have the vaccines that that actually needs.

445
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:56,659
The physician is already there. The vaccines are there. They just need to go and take it.

446
00:48:56,660 --> 00:49:01,280
And hopefully this will provide some social modeling so that the parents can see how the

447
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,390
other parents around them and the community are actually getting their kids vaccinated.

448
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:15,230
And in the end, after they do the playgroup, we are going to ask the parents for to provide us with their phone numbers and email.

449
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:22,690
And hopefully we will allow the parents who did not did not choose to vaccinate their kids yet.

450
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:30,770
We can follow up with them to provide support, to see what their barriers are and to provide more information so that they can vaccinate their kids.

451
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:36,850
And a little bit more about how the theories inform that convention about the thought.

452
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:44,660
So clearly I think that social cognitive theory comes from or some of its efficacy and social cognitive theories.

453
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:48,950
And so that is where we're able to do that through discussing with physicians,

454
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:54,020
having that email sign up and having to integrate their risk perception.

455
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,519
Consumer health model. Again,

456
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:03,410
having the physician there to answer questions and provide information and real time education and knowledge is also from the social cognitive theory,

457
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:10,280
which is the general information such as and that as far as those two environmental factors from the social cognitive theory

458
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:16,610
and those are so opportunities and barriers are addressed through the pop up clinic and having the appointment sign up.

459
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:25,550
Right. They're role model in observational learning through having the PTO members who are other parents who are maybe further along in their

460
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:33,260
time as being a parent present to kind of show an example of people who are in the community and have gotten their children vaccinated.

461
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:42,380
And finally, descriptive norms through having vaccination statistics and misconceptions I've discussed in year in the meetings,

462
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:50,300
I don't know, limitations and future directions. Self-efficacy we found is a bit of a double edged sword in the world of vaccination,

463
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:56,000
because on the one hand, while we want parents to feel empowered to get their child vaccinated,

464
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:01,040
there is this other flipside of self-efficacy of parents who feel as though they understand health really well,

465
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:05,300
things they can protect their kids on their own without getting the child vaccinated.

466
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:16,190
As for education, there are already some education requirements in place for parents who choose to not get their child vaccinated in Michigan,

467
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:17,930
they haven't been effective.

468
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:24,490
So we were really kind of thinking through how can we make sure that our form of education is different and more effective?

469
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:28,370
And those are this is also super time sensitive intervention.

470
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:32,090
And there's a really small window of time when children are able to get these vaccines.

471
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:37,609
And then there's also the delinquent problem, which is similar to the double edged sword of self efficacy,

472
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:44,180
and that having a roomful of parents who are all anti-vaccination can get a little bit risky out of it.

473
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:51,049
We are aware of that. And then as for future directions, we did not address any inductive norms here.

474
00:51:51,050 --> 00:52:00,080
So things such as religious beliefs. And so we were really only focused on people who are have their own personal feelings about vaccines.

475
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:05,480
And so that's another place that could still use some work. And this is also super self-selecting.

476
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:13,190
People who choose to come to a mommy and me session like this are likely people who may already be unlikely to vaccinate their children.

477
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:19,640
And so this is also say we are only at the tip of the iceberg and there's lots more to do in this space.

478
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,130
And then final reflections. Yeah, yeah.

479
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:30,620
My final reflections were that making conceptual models is hard, as I'm sure you all know, show to Dominic, who is a great help.

480
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:35,690
Recently we found there are many ways that you could tackle an issue like vaccination,

481
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:41,300
and we found a lot of limits to what we can accomplish, like groceries and we can't, at the end of the day, for religious medical reasons.

482
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:49,010
And a lot of times our thoughts are proven wrong. But we actually found literature, which is why it's important to do your research.

483
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:51,560
And we had a great experience doing this.

484
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:06,190
So do you guys discuss at all how you would manage an outbreak of an infectious disease in a large group of unvaccinated children?

485
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:14,020
What we did not worry was just scary if you guys had brainstormed anything.

486
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:18,130
I think that's a great future direction that we will be centered.

487
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:27,960
Okay, so we have two more groups and I want to keep each presentation to 15 minutes.

488
00:53:28,000 --> 00:54:01,540
So I think, you know, I was going to ask you to just take your time.

489
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:26,940
I think it's important to understand how they're going to do that.

490
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:52,080
We'll just have to. Right. But I think it's very important not to accept the fact that, you know, you've got.

491
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:02,690
Hi. My name is Sarah. This is Graciela.

492
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:07,890
I'm Kelly. And we are thinking how? I'm sorry.

493
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:17,880
We can't hear you. Oh, I'm sorry. So for our project, we decided to focus on the impact the war has on the mental health of immigrants and refugees.

494
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:25,250
So to start off, we're going to give some background information to explain why we chose to focus on this topic.

495
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:33,830
So as of May 20, 22, approximately 100 million people have been forcibly displaced from their homes due to violence, persecution and human rights.

496
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:44,230
So this process of being displaced from one's home in kind of home country and being forced to migrate can be incredibly traumatic.

497
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:48,640
So refugees experience conditions of vulnerability and marginalization and poverty,

498
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:54,460
in addition to high stress over the high stress of displacement, seriously affects the health of the population.

499
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:57,850
Mental health is especially affected in refugee population,

500
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:03,880
and there's evidence that suggests that one in three of these experiences high rates of PTSD, anxiety or depression.

501
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:09,360
So furthermore, it has been found that there is a prevalence for risk of suicide right fringes.

502
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:16,240
Part of it has been found that the prevalence for risk of suicide ranges anywhere from 3 to 34% among these refugee populations.

503
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:21,160
And this all demonstrates that why it's so important and that this is a pressing public health concern

504
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:25,900
and also highlights the need for interventions or programs that help address refugee mental health.

505
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:29,140
However, there are some challenges that these populations face,

506
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:36,850
which includes delay in care for both physical and mental health due to legal restrictions in these host countries that affect access to care,

507
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:41,740
as well as there are screenings that occur when they do enter these host countries.

508
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:45,130
But often times is overlooked.

509
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:56,799
So for our intervention, we collectively decided that our target populations should be refugees battling with mental health disorders such as PTSD,

510
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:05,230
depression, anxiety and so forth. As a result of experiencing war, poverty and famine.

511
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:15,820
But one particular challenges that immigrants face while dealing with mental health is the stigma and taboo that revolves around that specifically.

512
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:23,910
They believe that it is lazy, unnecessary and an invisible disorder.

513
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:32,910
But we know that seeking help for mental health disorders is vital due to the serious impacts it can have on human health.

514
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:37,409
Evidence has shown that patients with mental illness have a higher burden of physical health,

515
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:40,590
morbidity and mortality compared to the general population.

516
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,920
For example, for people with clinical depression,

517
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:49,620
they are twice as likely to be diagnosed with type two diabetes compared to people who don't have diagnosed clinical depression.

518
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:54,120
Additionally, studies have also shown that depression is linked to a shorter life expectancy,

519
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:59,040
and PTSD has also been found to be associated with an increase in all cause mortality.

520
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:06,419
Thus, in order to help improve the health of the refugee population, we hope to address the proximal outcomes being rates of depression,

521
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:13,080
anxiety and PTSD, which impact our distal outcome, which is morbidity and mortality that comes from these mental health illnesses.

522
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:18,570
So now we're going to dive into our conceptual model.

523
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:28,080
Here is our full conceptual model regarding the consideration to improve the mental health of refugees,

524
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:31,500
mental health of refugees, and we'll go through each of them individually.

525
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:42,570
So first, our antecedent is war within our home country from within our country,

526
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:46,310
which leads to people experiencing war and living in this environment,

527
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:52,290
which will then lead to immigrants and refugees facing travel to war in their home country,

528
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,570
as well as through the migration process, which is certainly.

529
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:05,919
We also have several mediating factors that include perceived susceptibility to mental health problems and perceived benefits to engaging in therapy,

530
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,450
which stem from health belief model.

531
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:15,730
Both of these construct and impact a person's ability and likelihood to seek access to mental health as a health belief helps explain this,

532
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:18,520
think and then impact rates of depression, anxiety and PTSD,

533
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:23,410
which then also affects their outcomes as we talked about, which are morbidity and mortality.

534
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:27,939
It's also social support is another mediating factor which we derived from the

535
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:32,890
conceptual model for the relationship of social networks and social support to health.

536
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:38,979
This model also helped inform our link between social support and stressors as a model explains that social

537
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:44,110
support impacts how we perceive and experience stressors which can then have an impact on developing depression,

538
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:49,030
anxiety and PTSD. Finally, we also incorporated elements of autonomy,

539
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:55,240
perceived competence and relatedness from self-determination theory, which all can impact an individual's motivation.

540
00:59:55,600 --> 01:00:01,749
In this case, a person's autonomy, perceived confidence to seek access to mental health care and their feelings of social

541
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:05,650
relatedness can then impact their overall motivation to seek mental health care,

542
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:11,590
which then can also have different effects on whether people develop these illnesses such as depression,

543
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:15,670
anxiety and Justine, which also impact the distal outcome.

544
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:22,620
And for moderating factors acting on these connections between the predictor and the mediators,

545
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:27,390
we employed a socio ecological model to identify moderating factors at the community level,

546
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:31,710
relationship level as well as the individual level for the individual level.

547
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,830
We first included age, sex, culture and personality.

548
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:41,850
These are moderators that have evidence within the health relief model as moderating or constructive susceptibility and perceived benefits.

549
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:48,509
Furthermore, access to health care, health insurance and language can also affect individuals perceived benefit of overcoming

550
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:53,639
these barriers and thus engaging in therapy on an individual's prior mental health.

551
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:57,810
History can also impact perceived susceptibility of having a mental health disorder.

552
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:06,809
And we also included intrinsic versus extrinsic aspirations in life as a moderator for constructive autonomy, perceived competence and relatedness,

553
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:12,900
which is also rooted in self-determination theory for relationship factors including family and household size,

554
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:16,140
which is also a known moderating factor within the health model.

555
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:19,950
And for moderating perceived susceptibility,

556
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:24,659
perceived benefits of family members or friends with mental health disorders can also influence

557
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:30,120
an individual's perceived susceptibility of they themselves developing mental health disorder,

558
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:36,569
which can impact their level of social support as people with mental health illnesses are less likely to engage in social support networks.

559
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:41,010
And this topic is present for individuals. And then finally for community factors.

560
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:47,280
We include stigma surrounding mental health conditions as well as the overall availability of mental health services in the community,

561
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:53,040
which can impact a person's perceived competence to accessing care and the surrounding health.

562
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:57,120
Climate also has a known relationship between autonomy, competence and relatedness,

563
01:01:57,390 --> 01:02:01,260
which is another construct in our model stemming from determination theory.

564
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:11,940
So we plan to implement a community based program targeted towards areas with high immigrant and refugee concentrations.

565
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:18,270
So we develop multiple complementary interventions as part of our program based on a construct century in our model.

566
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:26,680
So the first intervention that we chose to intervene on or the first contract we chose to intervene on is perceived benefits of engaging in therapy,

567
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,050
which is part of the help that we follow.

568
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:37,520
So anything related to this construct include hosting or informational seminars about the benefits of therapy and creating easily accessible.

569
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:46,410
Infographics with information on therapy. So with both of these interventions, it's also necessary to consider language barriers.

570
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:53,340
And these these interventions would need to be translated into the native language of the participants and finally

571
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:58,270
employing other members of the community who engage in therapy themselves to discuss their experiences with therapy.

572
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:03,000
So bringing in these members of the community would help to decrease the stigma that we talked about

573
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:09,000
earlier and also would help build rapport with participants and would then increase trust in the program.

574
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:17,260
So there can be immense variation in a person's feeling of personal vulnerability to an illness or a disease.

575
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:22,970
And as we previously learned in this class, we perceive susceptibility in order for a person to take action.

576
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:25,030
They must believe that they are at risk for a disease.

577
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:31,690
So therefore, we should be mindful in addressing all levels of attitudes and awareness toward getting and having mental illness.

578
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:33,220
And this can be done in several ways.

579
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:40,270
I wrote a way to do this is to increase education on mental health and expand this to teach individuals of the different types of mental disorders.

580
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:47,260
And I think it's important to highlight that the characteristics and symptoms of each concern of such concerns will

581
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:52,360
be taught so that the individuals can become more cognizant of such signs in themselves as well as in others.

582
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:57,340
And our goal is to educate refugees who are unfamiliar with the risk levels of acquired mental illness.

583
01:03:57,610 --> 01:04:03,850
And by emphasizing their high prevalence, we will be able to highlight to them how common mental health problems are in their communities.

584
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:08,140
And this can then help them to combat the stigma that exists in these populations,

585
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:12,640
which can then lead to a better comprehension of their susceptibility to mental health disorders.

586
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:20,620
So we will educate them by placing signs or posters on display in public settings such as bus stops or in busses or in public bathrooms.

587
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:23,970
And these will be provided in different languages. And then additionally,

588
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:28,299
education on how to address mental health should be increased so that people know what options

589
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:32,140
they have or the steps to take toward receiving help to mitigate the effects of their illness.

590
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:38,310
So we will distribute informational pamphlets to households in areas known to have high populations of immigrants,

591
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:42,700
refugees in our community, centers of facilities in these high refugee and immigrant areas.

592
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:49,210
And these pamphlets will also be provided in various various languages to account for different refugee populations.

593
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:51,040
And then additionally,

594
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:57,070
there should be an increase in the discussion of mental health and the risk and rates of issues associated and untreated mental health.

595
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:58,509
So with our program,

596
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:06,250
we tend to create community organizations that boost awareness of risk or mental health issues among immigrant refugee populations.

597
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:15,279
And we will also create community forums or expand on existing forums that start in some form,

598
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,940
whether it's in-person meetings or online discussion forums that.

599
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:24,400
Touch that's around mental health in these ways.

600
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:29,950
And then also to provide these populations with resources and the space for them to

601
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:34,600
become more aware of the risks that they're up due to their background circumstances.

602
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:40,090
Okay. So our next one is addressing social support,

603
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:47,410
human connection and social connections is a vital thing for humans to interact and feel better about themselves.

604
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:53,620
So our first thing is creating a social support and we encourage we will be creating a social support

605
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:59,799
group that meets at least once a month to talk about their troubles and trauma that they have faced.

606
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:04,950
But we also encourage that they rely on their family members, friends and coworkers.

607
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:09,500
Our next one is having a group that has faced struggles to better connect with each other.

608
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:19,510
More people are inclined to talk about their troubles when they have someone that's group that has gone through the same situation as them.

609
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:27,360
And then like in our TEDx Talk, they had a app called Circle which.

610
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:38,600
Discussed about having a community where they are able to connect and be able to grab coffee, groceries, just have someone to talk to.

611
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:46,040
So we thought that would be a good idea to have the same community have an app so that they're able to talk to each other and then use them.

612
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:55,209
And then self-determined self-determination theory tells us that there are three psychological needs which are autonomy,

613
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:58,510
competence and relatedness that influence a person's overall motivation.

614
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:01,599
Thus, motivation is also a very key component of this intervention,

615
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:07,479
is to aim to change an individual's locus of moderation from being motivated to seek mental health services,

616
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:11,710
to hopefully be at least being externally motivated and eventually intrinsically motivated.

617
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:16,780
So to do this will employ health coaches that will be trained in motivational interviewing,

618
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:21,070
both English in the participants native language, if possible. If not, then translators will be used.

619
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:21,999
But essentially,

620
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:29,230
these health coaches will help increase the participants competence and their ability to seek mental health services by kind of helping them determine

621
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:36,970
what are those barriers that they might encounter and do a collaborative plan to hopefully overall increase their motivation and competence.

622
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:44,470
Second, with training and motivational interviewing, they'll together explore the reasons why participants might not want to seek mental health,

623
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:49,209
help and then find and develop those points of intrinsic motivation that can

624
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:52,360
help them seek mental health services through that introspective questioning.

625
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:58,840
And then finally, the health coach will be a source of social support, which also increases feelings of relatedness, which impacts motivation.

626
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:04,059
And as Layla already mentioned, the whole intervention itself is also rooted in social support.

627
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:09,550
So that in and of itself also helps increase a person's feeling of relatedness, which will also impact motivation.

628
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:18,770
And of course, given that all these components are based on trying to help participants get access to mental health,

629
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:23,510
we ourselves will also include an aspect of including mental health care within our intervention.

630
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:28,340
And to do this will partner with therapists to provide group and individual therapy sessions.

631
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:33,469
We'll also partner with doctors in order to help provide that medical psychological need,

632
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:37,370
whether or not they need medications, and for them to manage those medications and prescribe them.

633
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:43,729
And then finally, we will partner with local mental health lines that will be able to respond to crisis situations and will make

634
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:48,410
sure that those mental health clients are well equipped in order to provide care in the native language.

635
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:50,990
And if not, make sure that there's at least the interpreter available.

636
01:08:55,120 --> 01:09:01,720
So these are just some keywords that stuck out to me throughout the whole process of doing this project.

637
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:07,360
For Personal, we're all daughters of immigrant parents, so this was something that came close to home.

638
01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:13,360
Eye opening. I realize that there's actually a lot more research than I had expected.

639
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:20,049
It was challenging because for me, especially, articulating words in a coherent sentence is something I struggle with.

640
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:23,680
Still being able to express myself has been something that's difficult.

641
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:28,920
Communication group chats are wonderful things. We're able to talk more than once.

642
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:33,850
Time management, especially being in grad school balancing three projects or more,

643
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:38,110
has been especially difficult and tried to put 100 effort into each project.

644
01:09:38,530 --> 01:09:48,040
And finally, teamwork, where we all just work this out as a family and be able to talk about if one project was hard and asking for a lending camp.

645
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:59,800
Thank you. We have one more group, and you need to stay till they're done.

646
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:21,760
We feel pretty comfortable now that he's complete.

647
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:42,040
When you pay attention to before you guys start and you can't see this from up here,

648
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:46,750
but I'm going to throw this up to wrap it up with five groups each day, 15 minutes.

649
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:51,610
So I don't want to cut any group short and I feel weird.

650
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:57,069
This feels rude, but it also feels rude to cut people's time.

651
01:10:57,070 --> 01:11:06,910
So I don't I don't know what the best solution is, but I don't feel the need to rush through your presentation but know try to stay within 15 minutes.

652
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:18,190
I took. He's the speaker minority.

653
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:27,440
No. Just because something.

654
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:47,760
You know. Okay.

655
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:52,190
Sorry, guys. I think I need to switch my displays.

656
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:12,610
With someone besides my child.

657
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:20,160
Is so startling. Get. Hi, everyone.

658
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:23,820
All right, so we are mental health prevention.

659
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:31,380
And the title of our project here is LGBTQ Plus Youth and Young Adults Experiencing Homelessness,

660
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:35,250
a conceptual model Proposed Intervention for Decreasing Suicidality.

661
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:39,780
I'm Carolyn, but I'm doing more.

662
01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:49,040
So first, I'm going to give you a little bit of background on what we're dealing with this with within this intervention.

663
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:59,569
So in our research, we found through the CDC that young adults ages 15 to 24 struggle with suicide.

664
01:12:59,570 --> 01:13:07,850
It's their third leading cause of death in LGBTQ young adults, especially struggle with this risk factor,

665
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:12,410
along with other risk factors like stigmatization and discrimination.

666
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:23,420
And data from the Trevor Project shows that LGBTQ youth who responded to their 2022 national

667
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:28,550
survey considered suicide in the past year and attempted suicide in the past year.

668
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:35,990
You can see that the age is broken down here, but it's definitely reflected in their survey.

669
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:54,140
And young adults also struggle with housing instability, especially when they have a familial rejection as one of their risk factors.

670
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:58,520
When I said all my notes with me right now.

671
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:05,600
Is there any way we can share? Do you mind if I restart really quick?

672
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:09,980
Want to go super fast though? Because the way I practiced this was super fast.

673
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:16,730
So sorry about that. Okay.

674
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:28,400
So going back to the Trevor Project, data from The Trevor Project show that 45% of the respondents overall seriously considered attempting suicide.

675
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:36,500
And you can see the response on the screen here. Separated by age and considered versus attempted.

676
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:44,600
And for LGBTQ youth, suicide risk is in addition to the other risk factors they face such a stigma discrimination and by some estimates,

677
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:48,470
LGBTQ youth are actually more likely to present with suicidal thoughts,

678
01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:53,750
three times more likely to present suicidal thoughts and behaviors than their hetero heterosexual peers.

679
01:14:54,950 --> 01:15:02,600
And along with these stressors, those who identify as LGBTQ plus are often at least temporarily rejected by their parents or garden guardians.

680
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:12,920
And so due to their gender and sexual orientation, in some instances, this unfortunately leads to homelessness, which is where I was going through.

681
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:24,769
So again, from the Trevor Project, we learned that LGBTQ youth who experience housing instability reported considering suicide at twice the rate and

682
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:29,780
attempted suicide at more than three times the rate of LGBTQ youth who did not experience housing instability.

683
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:37,460
And as the graphic showed, first, the percentage of LGBTQ youth who experience housing instability, which was 29%.

684
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:41,380
On the left and among those on the right, am I have it backwards?

685
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:46,460
Yeah. On the right. Youth who attempted suicide, which was 23%.

686
01:15:46,490 --> 01:15:52,400
34%, depending on gender identity. So wrapping up our big picture here.

687
01:15:55,240 --> 01:16:03,670
Our focus became. How can we mitigate the familial rejection that leads to homelessness that these LGBTQ LGBTQ youth face,

688
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:07,840
knowing that there's evidence they could experience better mental and physical health outcomes,

689
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:11,380
including decreased rates of suicide attempts if they have family support.

690
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:16,780
And with that, I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to Farrah for target population and outcomes.

691
01:16:17,090 --> 01:16:22,840
Thank you. So let's talk about target population.

692
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:32,340
As you can see, this is more like an idea that shows you a profile of our target population and characteristics to including our programs.

693
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:40,509
So first of all, we really focus on the LGBTQ youth age between 15 to 24 years since these families and these

694
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:46,330
age groups are more likely to have psychological trauma that may influence their lives.

695
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:50,800
And more importantly, people are.

696
01:16:50,850 --> 01:17:00,100
More surprisingly, I would speaking, youth may grow up without work, but rather influenced by cultural values and religious beliefs.

697
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:05,709
Parents may see their child's sexual orientation as immoral.

698
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:09,370
We're dangerous. So, yeah.

699
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:15,849
So this may not only exacerbate feelings of loss, guilt, anger toward shame,

700
01:17:15,850 --> 01:17:23,920
but also makes her youth feel that they lost the support of their important family in their lives.

701
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:27,850
So. Which eventually they have to choose.

702
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:33,680
So as a result, a large percentage of LGBTQ youth may experience homelessness.

703
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:37,060
And that is another factor. We were doing research on.

704
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:42,139
Just like Caroline mentioned the figures before, LGBTQ youth,

705
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:50,750
who experience homelessness recently reported more severe mental health disorders and higher rates of suicide suicidality.

706
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:55,969
So I feel that by focusing on these factors,

707
01:17:55,970 --> 01:18:05,990
we will be able to have a better understanding on the relationship between family support and homelessness and sustainability.

708
01:18:06,830 --> 01:18:11,510
So we calculate the proximal and distal outcomes.

709
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:21,460
Just like we mentioned before, the family environment may be a crucial factor that influenced mental health in LGBTQ youth.

710
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:30,370
So therefore the primary other proximate outcomes of our program will be increased familial support and acceptance.

711
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:36,580
Alongside these outcomes, we expect to see the decreased rates of homelessness.

712
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:42,310
And lastly, for decent outcomes is to decrease suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

713
01:18:42,670 --> 01:18:46,510
So for next level stories to introduce our conceptual.

714
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:55,520
That instead is their conceptual model and it draws on a lot of influences from the minority stress model,

715
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:59,480
as well as incorporating theories of social support to illustrate how the

716
01:18:59,830 --> 01:19:04,250
rejection may lead LGBTQ youth to experience more homelessness and suicidality.

717
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:09,380
And so, starting with the box on the left, we have circumstances that are in household environment.

718
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:13,340
And so this is this construct is the antecedents of our model.

719
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:20,090
And it's basically used to describe why caregivers in a household may have a negative appraisal of their child's sexuality.

720
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:21,110
In this context,

721
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:27,710
we're using negative appraisal to describe caregivers overall negative perception of their child's sexuality when they do find out about it.

722
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:31,940
And this negative appraisal can be due to cultural values, religious values,

723
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:39,350
or personal beliefs that lead caregivers to view LGBTQ identity or community as unbecoming or harmful to their child.

724
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:43,430
Moving to the next construct, we have minority stress spots.

725
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:50,240
In the context of this model, minority stress refers to anti LGBTQ how anti LGBTQ prejudice,

726
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:57,380
stigma and discrimination predispose LGBTQ youth to experience increased homelessness and suicidality due to their sexual minority status?

727
01:19:57,740 --> 01:20:04,010
The minority stress box is composed of two constructs, so the first one being stressful and unsupportive in the environment,

728
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:07,580
and the second one being rejection of your sexual identity by guardians.

729
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:11,540
So in regard to the first construct, this construct broadly describes the loss,

730
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:18,710
how the loss of the male social, social support experienced by the LGBTQ youth may,

731
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:22,580
how the youth in this situation may feel as if their family members have withdrawn

732
01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:26,660
the emotional mentor or financial support that they would be given before.

733
01:20:26,930 --> 01:20:32,930
And in regard to the second construct in general, this concert highlights how the experiences of anti LGBTQ prejudice,

734
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:39,050
stigma and discrimination that the LGBTQ youth face is because of their caregivers negative appraisal of their sexuality.

735
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:45,080
And so another important thing to highlight is the fact that we have a double headed arrow between these two constructs,

736
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:48,469
just to emphasize the fact that they can intensify and influence each other.

737
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:53,870
But regardless, they both result in the youth feeling and or being unwelcomed in their family home.

738
01:20:55,610 --> 01:21:02,959
And so the next construct in our model is homelessness. This construct encompasses both LGBTQ youth who were put out by their family members,

739
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:11,030
as well as LGBTQ youth who voluntarily left their familial home because because of the negative environment that they were experiencing.

740
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:18,680
And lastly, we have mental health outcomes. And so the construct within this within this box is suicidality.

741
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:23,600
And with this one, we want to highlight the culminating impacts of stress as loss of social support.

742
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:29,000
Generally for people experiencing suicidality, they may feel as if they are a burden to others and to society.

743
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:36,890
And this feeling, feeling of burdensome ness comes from feeling isolated and cut off from one social circle on which many

744
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:41,630
homeless LGBTQ youth may feel after being rejected by their family and having to leave their home.

745
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:47,959
So moreover, we want to also highlight that suicidality is moderated by general stressors due to homelessness,

746
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:53,420
which can include food insecurity, sexual assault survivors, sex, violence, and other mental health challenges.

747
01:21:56,930 --> 01:21:57,350
All right.

748
01:21:57,350 --> 01:22:04,670
And from diving into that conceptual model and the literature, we could tell that there were really three key points of change that needed to happen.

749
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:12,140
First, being within caregivers or parents and changing their attitudes and beliefs to be more accepting.

750
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:21,950
Secondly, being with the relationship between the youth and the caregivers to create a more supportive, emotion focused relationship.

751
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:29,720
And third, with the youth themselves and building their self-esteem and building up their autonomy and intimacy.

752
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:41,510
So our intervention aims to tackle those three key points by creating a education focused intervention,

753
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:47,809
where we'll first provide caregivers with that education to reshape their normative beliefs so that

754
01:22:47,810 --> 01:22:54,650
they can have a better understanding of how that they can best support their LGBTQ plus youth.

755
01:22:55,220 --> 01:23:00,110
Second, we are going to kind of transition into attachment based family therapy.

756
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:03,200
So that will involve the youth as well as the parent.

757
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:11,420
And we'll have a licensed counselor kind of work through that dynamic with them to create a more supportive dynamic.

758
01:23:11,990 --> 01:23:15,650
And then lastly, we'll provide individual level youth counseling.

759
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:22,849
Again, with a licensed mental health counselor. And that session will really be focused on empowering the youth,

760
01:23:22,850 --> 01:23:27,980
making them feel really affirmed in their identity, improving their mental health symptoms,

761
01:23:28,010 --> 01:23:36,280
and making them feel like they have the autonomy to stay in their household so that you can

762
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:42,080
continue to dive a little bit into the theoretical background that informs our intervention.

763
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:46,340
The primary informing theory and social cognitive theory.

764
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:52,550
So with the snap primary, the ties into the work that we're doing with the parents.

765
01:23:52,820 --> 01:24:00,290
So really using that context, this social cognitive theory to help change the attitudes,

766
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:04,790
beliefs and cognitions of the parents in order for them to be more supportive of the youth.

767
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:10,429
We also drew on self-determination theory primarily with the work that will be

768
01:24:10,430 --> 01:24:16,610
doing with the youth to give them the control and the autonomy to be who they are,

769
01:24:16,610 --> 01:24:21,380
to live authentically, and to choose to stay in the home if they feel that that is safe.

770
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:28,010
And then in regards to our distal outcomes, we also drew on Thomas Turner's interpersonal theory of suicide,

771
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:36,500
which proposes that suicidal ideation is largely impacted by perceived burden from this important belongingness.

772
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:45,620
So by working with the relationship of the child and the parent in that attachment based therapy,

773
01:24:46,010 --> 01:24:52,579
we will work to improve those two constructs in their relationship by making the youth feel

774
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:57,200
that they are not a burden in the relationship and that they do belong in the household.
