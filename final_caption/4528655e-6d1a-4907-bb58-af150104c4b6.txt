1
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:15,780
Okay. So, so today starts a two part discussion on how social factors impact military.

2
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,800
Patrick Patrick and access and talk about models of treatment.

3
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:28,370
And I want to before I do that, I want to remind you that your checkpoint number two is due on Wednesday at the beginning of class.

4
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:34,140
We are going to spend time in class discussing it. So it's essential that you have that done and you will have a graded assignment that

5
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,670
is going to be due on Friday asking you to reflect on the feedback we get from this.

6
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:50,139
So questions on. Know, I'll say I've gotten some questions from students asking sort of the amount of detail in the concept map.

7
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:59,890
And generally my answer is as much detail as will help you convey what's in your head to me, but not more than that too.

8
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,639
So I don't need references. I don't need. But I don't also want to, like, make you work in a particular way.

9
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,780
If you've done concept maps before and there's a way that's useful for you, I want this to be useful for you.

10
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:17,050
But the purpose of this is for you and I to have a conversation electronically, visually about your topic.

11
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:24,100
And so so for an example, if what you are interested in is like treatment seeking or the life force,

12
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,320
for example, you should say that and not just say age is like a factor, right?

13
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,639
Because I don't know. The age could be I can interpret that five different ways.

14
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,160
Right. And it's just in two parts. So be descriptive but don't feel like I am.

15
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:45,790
What I am looking for is a a using this as a tool for communication between you and me.

16
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:59,200
Questions about that. So everything I'm going to talk about today are most of what I talk about today.

17
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,580
It comes as using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.

18
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,030
We're going to talk about this a lot in detail when we talk about substance use in a few weeks.

19
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,530
But how many of you have heard of this survey? All right, let's.

20
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,960
So, how many of you heard of names? All right, so this is names for drugs.

21
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,210
So it's like. So the national. So and is the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

22
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,610
So this is a one of many kind of routine surveillance surveys that the government runs.

23
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,190
The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey is another one.

24
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,200
It's just sort of like if you you know, if you have a car, like just checking, like what's the oil like?

25
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,790
You know, like what level is the oil, right?

26
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:42,509
So it's like a dipstick, like kind of figuring out how much mental health or drug use or whatever is there in the population.

27
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,479
I talk about this specifically, but that's up again a couple of weeks.

28
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:53,610
But I most of the the kind of the the best estimates we have for kind of like point prevalence for mental disorders.

29
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:59,280
And certainly the best point prevalence is we have for drug use are going to come from this this survey.

30
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,330
So but before I tell you about that and show you some data from that and also I was going to show you the website,

31
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,350
but it was broken down right before I came in here. So maybe it's a back up now.

32
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,400
You can go to it if you're interested. But um, so just as a reminder, we've already learned that stigma is,

33
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:23,460
is related to many of the reasons why or as reflected in many of the reasons why people don't seek care.

34
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,729
They're either they're afraid people might find out.

35
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:34,680
For example, I would argue it's also probably institutionalized within like, you know, not kept up to date provider networks.

36
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,679
I would love for somebody to like replicate that study of the ghost networks would like oncologists wouldn't that be

37
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,799
amazing like I mean I feel like that's what it would take to like shame these companies to like update their list like,

38
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,870
oh, 75% of the time you can't get an appointment with an oncologist that's on your list.

39
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:57,600
Like, wouldn't that be be interesting to see. So I got a feeling it's not that bad high.

40
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:04,770
But the other thing we talked about and this is more of last week is we just again distinguishing between diagnosis are disorder,

41
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,559
disease disorder and diagnosis and the fact that just because someone meets diagnostic criteria that is there a

42
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,050
case according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual does not automatically mean that they need treatment.

43
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:24,450
And why is that? Why is that why is being a case not the same as needing treatment should be kind of a formula.

44
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:32,680
Right. Heuristic formula. What does it mean to say somebody needs treatment?

45
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:42,660
So the relief of some sort of impairment and an impairment, there's something kind of like there's some harm that we're trying to remedy.

46
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:48,560
Yeah, that's yeah. You're also playing up the personal effects.

47
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,030
There's a benefit that they break. So there are there is no free lunch.

48
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,879
Even aspirin has side effects. Okay.

49
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:01,560
So and if you're like there are major side effects to some of the medications that we use, but it could also be like financial harms, right?

50
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,790
So if you have to pay out of pocket.

51
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,530
Right, or if you have to go through 12 different providers to get to the person that you know is actually gonna help you.

52
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,190
Right. So the, the, the, the. So there's elements around that.

53
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,400
But also treatment is really varied, right?

54
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,530
So some people prefer psycho cognitive behavioral therapy or psychotherapy or they prefer medications, right?

55
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,849
And so and both of those are considered first line treatment, for example, with major depression.

56
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,540
And so there's a lot more variety. It's not the same as treating hypertension.

57
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,430
There's basically like 1/1 line treatment for five retention. And it doesn't matter who you are as a person,

58
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,820
that's what you get when you walk in the door and in fact would probably be medical malpractise

59
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,770
it becomes that there's a wide range of things that they can give you if you walk in the door.

60
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,990
Right. So again, but we have to clarify, what does that mean in each treatment?

61
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,830
What's the nature of the treatment delivered by home for how long and at what cost?

62
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:58,050
Right. So that's why just meeting meaning being a case does not automatically mean that you need to be treatment.

63
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,860
Okay, so who actually gets access to care? So this is all data it's for.

64
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,370
She doesn't want it to go to three, I'm afraid more recent data on a minute, but it's not going to get any better.

65
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,690
So this is this is showing you the proportion of people who have any.

66
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:19,800
Everyone in this chart is represented. This chart meets some something of the DSM criteria and DSM not be distracted by DSM.

67
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:29,100
For now, we're in DSM five. Right. And so you can see that if you no matter what's going on with you in the DSM about, you know,

68
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:38,280
less than 15% have seen a psychiatrist in the past year, less than 20% or about 15% have seen a non psychiatrist, mental health specialist.

69
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,790
This is why on the very first day of class, I told you how especially mental health care is not really part of like public mental health, really.

70
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:49,650
I mean, that, that it's it's great if you can get to one of these providers, but the vast majority of people cannot.

71
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,429
Most mental health conditions are treated in general. Medical this is any health care.

72
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,459
So this is coming across their social services.

73
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,090
This is like a caseworker. This is complementary alternative medicine.

74
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,290
So this is your St John's Wort, your acupuncture, your what have you.

75
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,909
And this is everything. Like if you add it up and you got at least one thing, so it's not number is 41%.

76
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:17,340
So 41% of people want to have met criteria for anything in the DSM.

77
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,650
Got anything for their problems? Okay.

78
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:28,620
That's a 2000 and 2014. That number was 45% of the national drug use in Helmand.

79
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,590
And that number has essentially been absolutely flat since 2008.

80
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,390
So this is going out now to 2016. This is getting inpatient treatment.

81
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:43,830
This is getting outpatient treatment. It's getting a prescription medication.

82
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,780
And that is any mental health services. Adding it all up. Check out the Y axis here.

83
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:53,190
It stops at 50 50%. Okay.

84
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,720
So. So. So you might say, like, why is this number so sticky?

85
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:06,490
It's kind of a strange we've got all this increased awareness and yet this sort of problem, obviously.

86
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,430
And so part of this, I think,

87
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:16,480
is sort of that the notion and for those of you who are doing work on mental health services for your potential project title,

88
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,190
I mean, for several of I attached to a recent editorial that I wrote for the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

89
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:28,480
That's not just because I wrote it, but because it speaks to Biden's plan about improving mental health,

90
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:35,530
public mental health and like, you know, without policy changes, you know, like it does, it just doesn't matter.

91
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,660
Like there's not enough providers, period.

92
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,550
Like, there's just not it's not even if you threw all the money in the world, there's not enough providers right now on it.

93
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,760
So and there's not enough providers.

94
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,930
It is not money in it. It's not reimbursement in it. So.

95
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:54,280
Okay. So that's overall, this is there was an earlier comment about that.

96
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,120
Older adults like that, they're being surprised that older people are more likely to get treatment.

97
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,750
And this is true.

98
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:07,000
So adolescence so this is the proportion of children in the United States of age 12 to 17 who have passed a major depressive episode.

99
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,709
That is just that little bar and that red bar are those with severe impairment.

100
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:20,470
So they're having trouble with school or social relationships. Only less than 50%, 45% of those kids got anything in the past year.

101
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,300
And of adults, you can compare that to about 70%. Why would this be?

102
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,490
Why? What do you think is contributing to the fact that adults are more likely to get.

103
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:43,170
Yeah. Because it's been like less funding and more time.

104
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:51,700
Yeah. So they've, they've sort of potentially been living with it longer. So just kind of more casual to dissect what else might be going on.

105
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,020
If you're a kid or an adolescent, you have to talk to your parents about it.

106
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:00,510
And if you're an adult, there is a gatekeeper. Yeah. If you're an adult, you can kind of handle your own care.

107
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,249
Yeah. So it's two different states.

108
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:12,030
And if those of you are interested in this topic, different states are kind of experimenting with different models as to whether teens I mean,

109
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:16,919
nobody's really talking about kids, but teens need consent for this, right?

110
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:23,400
So to get care, because for some families, for some children, they may want the parent,

111
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,290
especially if there's abuse in the home like the parent may be the reason why the child is having mental health problems.

112
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:34,560
But there also may be strong statement from the parents against having the child, for example,

113
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,210
take medication or engage in therapy or want to know what the kid is telling the therapist.

114
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:46,560
Right. And so, like, so it's there is this other element of gatekeeping that's happening here as well.

115
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,780
So. All right.

116
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:56,880
So you so you thought that was bad and depression is an important condition for us to talk about is certainly the most common mental disorder.

117
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,900
But you ain't seen nothing yet. So this is substance use disorder by age.

118
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,260
So do you remember when most substance use disorders started?

119
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,799
I told you this a couple of weeks ago. 19, 20 years ago.

120
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:18,120
Most of this stuff is gone. Okay? So 8% of people aged 12 and older.

121
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:25,650
So the whole use, 8% of people got any treatment for a substance use disorder for any substance.

122
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:33,960
So this is alcohol, this is drugs. This is it's probably not probably not including nicotine, but certainly would be alcohol and drugs.

123
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,159
And you can see that. So this is a number of people this is percent.

124
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,100
And so the highest percentage of those aged 18 to 25 and even that high percent is 15% to 15%

125
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:51,330
of your age group who has a substance use problem gets anything for that for their problem.

126
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,309
And this is. Oh, sorry.

127
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,520
That's past year. What is. How are these different times received?

128
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,090
Oh, sir. Sorry about that. It's even worse.

129
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:08,130
Sorry. This is the percent of people who need treatment. It's the percent of people who get treatment.

130
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,940
That's a 1% to 1% of people. Sorry.

131
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,640
So, yeah, 1.8% of your age group got treatment.

132
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:25,920
Substance use problem. I got know of anything. And as we're going to talk about when we talk about drugs,

133
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:34,800
the ways that people get into treatment for substance use disorders are very different than the ways people get industry before psychiatric problems.

134
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,970
Is the most common way that people get access to substance use treatment in the United States is probably when they're admitted to rehab,

135
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,960
like unintentionally. How do they get admitted to rehab?

136
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,200
Would it be like or after an overdose they're in voluntarily?

137
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:56,069
And what who needs to be involved in order for them to be involuntarily admitted to rehab but are usually be like,

138
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,220
please at least see this is being arrested.

139
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,110
This is being forced into order to treat this.

140
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:07,140
So that's how the vast majority of people in the United States, if they get access to substance use treatment,

141
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:13,900
they're getting access to it because they are legally mandated to try to avoid it.

142
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,160
So we'll talk about that with just a preview.

143
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:24,060
So, oh, and again, this is again among people who have a substance use disorder.

144
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,450
Plus, they said they needed treatment for it.

145
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:36,440
About 10% of those people got the specialty care that is got into rehab like a rehabilitation or like an outpatient

146
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:42,179
or actually sometimes it's information that sort of when you hear about I don't want to say just celebrities,

147
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:48,930
but often it's celebrities. When you hear about somebody like going away to treatment for a while, like that's that is accessible to basically nobody.

148
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:57,260
Okay. So they'll be something positive.

149
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,980
Well, maybe next week will be positive anyway.

150
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:07,480
So it was as was sort of discussed or mentioned earlier in terms of like why or why adults might be more likely to get care.

151
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:12,040
So it's again, it's not just like you wake up one day, you realize you have depression and then you call.

152
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,660
You start working through your dose network of your insurance providers.

153
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,479
Now, like people wait a long time before they get access to care.

154
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,780
And so they're this is some of the best data we have on sort of like, well, how long does it actually take for you?

155
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:30,940
Since the since the problem started. And so the X axis here is years since onset of disorder.

156
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,540
And the Y axis is the probability just a treatment contact, like just getting access.

157
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,250
This isn't about quality care. This is about getting the care that helps you.

158
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:45,610
Y access here does go to one, so that's helpful. This is major depressive episode dysthymia and bipolar disorder.

159
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:52,360
And you can see here at the 50th. So about 50% of people are getting some sort of care by about within ten years.

160
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,170
I'm going to tell you, this is not just a U.S. phenomenon.

161
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:03,550
Right. But like just it's important to kind of understand when we talk about why depression is disabling.

162
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:09,310
Part of this is because people are living with it for like a decade before they're getting any sort of help with it.

163
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:18,340
So it's not it's that's part of where the impairment sort of develops in like a feedforward problem.

164
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,479
This is the anxiety disorder. So the x axis is the same.

165
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,469
The y axis again still goes to one. So I'm going to go down the line.

166
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:32,140
So PD is panic disorder. JD is generalized anxiety disorder.

167
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,710
Orange is for phobia.

168
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:43,990
Pink is post-traumatic stress disorder. The triangles are specific phobias.

169
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,470
So that's going to be like fear of bridges, fear of spiders.

170
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:56,260
The x x black x's are social phobia, which is like not wanting to have trouble giving a speech, for example.

171
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:01,389
And then so this one down here is it's not seasonal affective disorder.

172
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:06,430
This is separation anxiety disorder in adulthood, which I don't want to talk about.

173
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,510
And so but the point is, is like you can see that there's a lot more variation.

174
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:18,780
So if we go out to 50%, like how long does it take for 50% of people with any of these anxiety disorders to get any sort of treatment contract?

175
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:25,180
We're out about ten years for panic and JD and then beyond ten for everything everything else which represented here.

176
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:35,130
This is that childhood onset kind of externalizing disorders.

177
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,629
Notice the y axis only goes to 60%, so we don't even have this.

178
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:43,940
This is actually a false compare. Don't don't view this in comparison to this because this is actually way worse than it looks.

179
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,430
And so here is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional, defiant.

180
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,999
And then this is intermittent explosive disorder, which is kind of like anger outbursts.

181
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,100
Some people think this is sort of like a precursor potentially to a bipolar disorder,

182
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,560
which we try not to, although we now try to not diagnose in children.

183
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:13,550
So, again, if you go out to 50% of people have on average had that condition for about 30 years before they finally got any sort of health score.

184
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,770
So these are people who are getting help in adulthood for the first time of something that they've all of these have onsets.

185
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:31,770
We just haven't. These are the drug problems, again, that Y-axis here is does not go to 100% the dark side or the axis or drug dependance,

186
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:37,660
the sector independence, then alcohol dependance, then drug abuse, then alcohol abuse.

187
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,710
We don't use those terms any more. We now use substance use disorder.

188
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:48,460
But so if you kind of just comfortable together, again, the consistent with the idea that, you know,

189
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:59,290
the way that people get in treatment is they often have been arrested for DUI, they have been arrested for possession or use of a substance.

190
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,160
And so this is this is how people often get into treatment.

191
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,390
If they get into treatment, go see something else.

192
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,970
Sorry. Oh, I will say like that.

193
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:18,820
The challenge we're looking at graphs like this is that almost no one in this chart has this problem.

194
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:25,059
So they also almost certainly also have an anxiety disorder or depressive disorder, etc.

195
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:29,410
Right? So this is sort of this is making it look like it's clean and it's not clean.

196
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:37,960
But the takeaway message is that it's it takes much longer than you think to get act to get access to any or to get into any sort of treatment.

197
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,430
But the mechanisms that are underlying that differ across different disorders.

198
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:50,629
All right. So again, just as I showed you a pie chart like this before that not all cases are that

199
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:55,730
all cases can be decomposed into four groups as a function of unmet treatment.

200
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:03,800
So while treatment, you know, again, I'm not I'm not saying this is good, that it's taking a long time for people to get treatment.

201
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:10,790
But it is also the case that it's the type of treatment they may have access to is not very effective,

202
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:16,900
for example, or is not like it's going to be very costly or there's there's other it's a challenging thing.

203
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:21,170
And so as a result, we do have people who can get treatment.

204
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,460
So remember I showed you this before, about one in five people who get treatment still have unmet need.

205
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:31,340
That is, the treatment that they're getting is not resolving the helping sufficiently resolving the problem.

206
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,900
They're there. And there are also people who don't get treatment and don't report unmet need.

207
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:40,460
That is, they are not interested in what the mental health system has to offer.

208
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:45,950
Okay. So it's important to kind of understand that both of those groups of people exist.

209
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:53,150
This is just shown for depression. But I could show you that for for any of that, any information.

210
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,709
So. I've told you about all that.

211
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:06,030
So let's play a little thought experiment. So let's imagine you are experiencing severe anxiety attacks.

212
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:13,850
What happens next? What is your journey to care?

213
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:25,810
What do you think? Oh, probably the first thing was like a long period of time, was not seeking out treatment like you might not in the beginning.

214
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,980
So it takes probably while to try to get yourself slept.

215
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:38,150
So who do you talk to and give you your first calls to your doctor?

216
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,260
Well, you know, maybe, like. Maybe like the first call to.

217
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,670
Your mom. These are your friends.

218
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:57,670
You know, your local mental health experts, right? So, yeah, I probably Google search try to find, like all the Internet.

219
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:05,460
Yes. Like you have cancer. Um, so I did have the answer one.

220
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:13,620
So if you if it says that you should go and talk to somebody and if they say there's no chance it's cancer,

221
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,330
you should say, like, I'd actually like a test stock, so I might be part of that doctor every time I out later.

222
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:30,900
So, um. Oh, so you're so your first your first person or thing that you're asking is not a mental health expert or even a clinical expert.

223
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:36,150
Okay, the very first thing that you're going to is like, right.

224
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:42,360
Is some sort of kind of person in your network.

225
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:48,180
Let's see who continues to have like now. Now what's going to happen?

226
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,500
Or did you? That was our high school news.

227
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:02,670
How many I mean, what are those of you who weren't maybe your first call wouldn't be to a family member or friend.

228
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:06,260
Where? Where. Where would that. Where would you go? What would be the first thing you would do?

229
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,390
If you've ever had a panic attack, you think you're what do you think you're having?

230
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,930
When it happens? Yes. You think you're dying, right?

231
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:24,210
You think you're having a heart attack. So where do you go if you think you're having a heart attack in the emergency department?

232
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,100
Right. So either way. So not a psychiatrist, right?

233
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,590
You're not going to the psychiatric emergency department. You're going to the emergency room because you think you're dying.

234
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:42,740
Okay. So. All right, so now these persist. Now. Now what happens in this imaginary journey?

235
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:54,559
Well, depending on who you talk to, a different kind of context, maybe people will try to talk you out of it or like it'll pass or anything like that.

236
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:03,380
And so like maybe you try to wait it out a little bit longer to see to make stuff happen or.

237
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:09,950
Yes. You're going to you're going to try to see if it's serious. Who doesn't say if it keeps persisting?

238
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,820
It's been a long time. Right next to the treatment options.

239
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:22,520
Okay. So you think you might want to talk to somebody about it? Yeah, I guess I feel like I'd like around that stage.

240
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:28,850
Also, I would be searching or trying, like, individual coping mechanisms or management strategies before you might go to.

241
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,610
A therapist. Yeah.

242
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:38,850
And say. And then the next step is like, I feel like with people I know,

243
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:45,420
it's kind of like you either do like therapy or medication or a combination of your moral.

244
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,000
So what is the thing that gets if you get to care?

245
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:55,450
What is the thing that's actually getting you to care? Is it the is it the experience of the symptom?

246
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:04,220
What are these additional things, as you're waiting to say?

247
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:09,500
Probably largely depends on like your insurance and whether or not you can actually afford the care.

248
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,290
Okay. So there's this other element of how is it going to cost?

249
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:25,160
But what? When you've made a decision that that a psychiatric or mental health provider is somebody you should go see.

250
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:31,290
What is actually the thing that's kind of made that decision happen because you've had that symptom for a long time.

251
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,340
So what's different now?

252
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:40,770
Like, if it starts, like you can't do things anymore, like it's affecting the fact that like you can't see your friends or go to work as you used to.

253
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:47,550
Okay. So you're having a permanent function and and then what's that other piece that you've got to sort of get over?

254
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:56,360
So you write that like you've got to this is this is a this is not going to get better on its own

255
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:03,060
that and that you might have something seriously wrong with you and like maybe it is New York.

256
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:10,340
It's but you think about it. This is of all the options, like how so how you've gone through like six different options before you get to this point.

257
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,239
You know what I'm trying to say.

258
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:21,139
And so the thing that's interesting is that and we're going to talk about sort of how people get access to this thought experiment is is

259
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:28,850
reflecting how the ways that people get access to mental health care is almost the inverse of how we think about how people get access to care.

260
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,479
So we often think about people, you know, you go to the doctor and the doctor,

261
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,570
you know, test your cholesterol and you like, oh, you have high cholesterol. You should you should do some sort of thing to get that cholesterol down.

262
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:44,809
Right. So you kind of like the doctor tells you you've got a clinical problem with mental health disorders.

263
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:48,469
It's the opposite. You've decided you have a clinical problem.

264
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:53,840
That's why you're in the doctor's office. And so you can have that same problem and not decided to clinical problem.

265
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:58,760
You could decide it's a problem about school, it's a problem about family conflict.

266
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:07,070
It's a problem about, you know, adjusting to a new role or adjusting to a new job or what have you.

267
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,360
Right.

268
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:14,389
Like you can decide that when you show up in the doctor's office, it is because you have already made the decision that you have a clinical problem.

269
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:20,330
And so it's not the job of the clinician is not I mean, they're trying to try to make so we're going to make a diagnosis.

270
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:26,090
But you've already determined as a patient that you are are so you have already determined that you are a patient.

271
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:34,820
And that's a bizarre way when you think about it. Like you're like, Doc, I'm a patient, you know, like the doctor doesn't assign you that role.

272
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:40,970
You assign that role to yourself. I'm going to talk to you through this in a second, but that's very different than how people think about.

273
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,829
And for those of you who've taken any kind of health behavior class, you might have heard this theory of recent action,

274
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,790
which is like the thing that's supposed to explain, like why you people wear seatbelts and like floss.

275
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,960
And this has almost nothing to do with why people get mental health treatment.

276
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:01,610
But unfortunately, this is sort of the foundational idea about like mental health awareness campaigns and like getting,

277
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:05,450
you know, I mean, this, this the idea of theory, reason to action. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

278
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:09,560
And I was like, okay, so let's talk about how people actually get access to care.

279
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,150
So the first thing we're talking about is data from mechanics.

280
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:23,360
So that mechanics, a very famous sociologist who medical sociologist at the University of Wisconsin and he's he talks

281
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:32,509
about the fact that being a patient is a social or any of you have had the misfortune of being sick.

282
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:38,720
I think you know exactly what he means by that. You are not the same person as you are right now.

283
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:48,980
You you're in a doctor's office when you are disrobed in some like if times are stupid and you're like, that is not that is not who you are.

284
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:59,600
So but that rule is not just negative, but rather that role also has a set of rights, you know, any social goal has a set of rights.

285
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:04,339
And so this argument is that this is sort of sums up his arguments that the

286
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:08,299
ways in which the symptom so in our case example in our hypothetical example,

287
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:19,460
the symptoms of a panic attack are perceived, evaluated and acted or not acted upon is again going to that that is what the central means.

288
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:23,480
And that essentially said, this is the important part.

289
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:30,530
It's after the the things have actually the disorder is present.

290
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,670
The problem is present. Right? The person is experiencing symptoms.

291
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:40,070
The illness determines the illness. Behavior determines whether a diagnosis will be met at all.

292
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,620
So it's not that the diagnosis is there.

293
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:46,730
This is why that's again, this is why I had spent so much time separating out the disorder from the diagnosis.

294
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:53,719
The diagnosis is the clinical opinion that this is you unique diagnostic criteria, but that that is not the same as the disorder.

295
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,320
The disorder is the thing that's actually you're experiencing symptoms that you're experiencing.

296
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:05,970
So some of the things that we talked about with excuse example, illustrate are consistent with this model and how people get access to care.

297
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:10,440
So why, you know, how does this relate to unmet treatment need?

298
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:16,650
So the argument is that the thing that sort of makes the types of things that shape a person's willingness or ability to adopt

299
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:24,030
this sick role varies is a function of and this was some of your quick questions the visibility chronicity of your symptoms,

300
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:31,980
how much those symptoms impair functioning and other and you can you can finish this thought impair functioning in other roles that you value.

301
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:38,009
Right. So so it might impair functioning is something you don't care about and you're probably not willing to like make that tradeoff.

302
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,139
Right? But if it is functioning, something you do care about,

303
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:45,300
like your work or your school or your social relationships, you know, then this is going to be a problem.

304
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,830
There is he does acknowledge like knowledge and beliefs about the problem. This is the Googling, right?

305
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:54,000
Like figuring out like, what is this thing? This might be happening to me, competing needs.

306
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,300
And so those needs might be financial, those needs might be social.

307
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,900
Then also the availability of acceptable treatment. Of course,

308
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:07,380
this is a challenge because you don't really know what you're willing to accept until you know what it means to undergo any particular treatment.

309
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:15,690
Okay. So questions about this illness, role sick role model, how people ask.

310
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:30,290
So in our thought experiment, you also identified elements related to the social network perspective.

311
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:34,980
So this is this argument is not really about social roles but around your network.

312
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:43,110
So that and this is from Esko, Toledo, who's another sociologist who's written a lot of work on stigma.

313
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,170
I think for those of you who are doing work on stigma, I recommended some of her readings.

314
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:53,340
So the argument here is that dealing with health problems itself is a social process that is managed through contracts.

315
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:59,280
So what are some ways can we be specific, like how does this social process actually play out?

316
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,150
So in our thought experiment, so you're experiencing anxiety symptoms.

317
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:08,690
You talk to your friend and what what things might you be looking for from that social network?

318
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:17,090
Yes. Yes. We really validation that it's actually a real problem.

319
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:20,230
That matter is not just something that should be solved under the rug. So.

320
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,850
So sort of validating the cycle potentially.

321
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:29,150
Yeah. What else might they be able to provide you with support and come to our meetings?

322
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,490
What else can I say? Like an alternative to treatment or what?

323
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,950
A treatment. So, like religion as a big. What else might they have?

324
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:48,300
Yeah. Advice? Yeah. And what what might that form of advice be?

325
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,220
To seek treatment from my therapist?

326
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,060
They might have access. They might know somebody. Right. Like they might have already.

327
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:04,980
Presumably, if you sort of knew that someone in your social network had dealt with the exact same problem that you were experiencing,

328
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:09,360
you're not just asking them for support. You're asking them for like, who did you see about that problem?

329
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:13,130
Right. Like, who do you know? That's good. Right. Do you have somebody. Right.

330
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:19,800
So that this is important because it also when we talk about why certain groups are less likely to access care, like how people get to care.

331
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:26,330
This is an important. Oh, does it help you get in the door any faster but at least gives you the name of a provider.

332
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,180
Or you can even ask them about their treatment experience so you can get a better understanding of like,

333
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:34,250
is this something that might be acceptable to me or have you ever taken in any present?

334
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,700
How did it make you feel? Right. Like, can you can you give me any advice on that?

335
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,510
Because I'm very scared of taking a medication, for example, if that's how you are feeling about it.

336
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:48,420
So again, the idea is that this person's willingness to go and or ability to seek treatment is

337
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:52,979
a process that is going to incorporate individual level factors your social network,

338
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:57,930
your coping skills. And then this is a little bit more on a treatment system quality.

339
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:06,880
And this is very much reflects that the depression care treatment paper that you read, which I mean, I don't know about you.

340
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:14,280
Like, I feel like the authors, the abstract of that paper is so much more positive that I feel like the findings are.

341
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:18,899
Like, if you just read the abstracts, the paper, you're like, Oh, it looks like most people get access to care.

342
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:24,870
And I'm like, Yeah, after trying like for a year, I mean, sure, I would hope.

343
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:31,590
I would hope so. Like we eventually, you know, if you just continued if she persisted at the situation.

344
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:41,399
But. Okay. So another the final kind of now we're going to be bringing a little bit more into the, um, kind of psychology.

345
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:47,610
So both of these first two models, the sick role model and the social network model, are just straight sociology.

346
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:51,390
Like that's just you don't need any other discipline to kind of talk about those.

347
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:56,970
The social behavioral model is got a little bit more in terms of like what we think about health behaviors.

348
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:03,149
So again, the argument is that the likelihood of seeking treatment is impacted by three factors that are those are need factors,

349
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:08,520
which is essentially like how much impairment you are experiencing predisposing factors,

350
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:14,530
which is your sort of health beliefs, potentially things that are going to be correlates, not that gender.

351
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:19,920
Race is not like these in and of themselves matter, but like they're correlated with things that matter, you know what I mean?

352
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:25,560
And we often don't have much direct measures of those, but we are usually at those and then enabling factors like,

353
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:31,350
you know, how far to get somewhere and insurance coverage. And there are fascinating studies that like look at how.

354
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:37,470
Especially for something like substance use. Like where are the methadone clinics?

355
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:42,330
You know, where these are not located. He's not randomly distributed anywhere.

356
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:51,900
And so if you are dealing with opiate dependance and if you want medication management benefit from medication management of that opiate dependance,

357
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,700
it's it's you know, there's that geography, those geographic factors, really.

358
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,120
So again, this idea is that there's a medical need, predisposing factors and enabling factors.

359
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:15,920
So this and then the last model, which is like the purely psychological model that tell you about today, is this theory of reasoned action.

360
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:25,070
And so I don't I mean, I don't know if this is just coming out of like the field of economics where like people are just rational actors or know.

361
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:30,320
But it's I cannot tell you what it is going to tell you why it has nothing to do with what we're talking about in class.

362
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:37,759
So the argument is that human behavior follows reasonably from your beliefs and attitudes and that your expectations regarding that behavior.

363
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,920
And so essentially the idea is that each one of us, when we're making a decision related to our health,

364
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:49,580
basically do a little cost benefit analysis to be like, am I going to be better off after doing this or worse off after doing this?

365
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:56,030
And if we act according to that result. And so this model is important to public health writ large,

366
00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:05,000
in that it is basically the foundation of what we think of as the things that that there's underneath the hood of why

367
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:11,030
people are willing or unwilling to engage in preventative health behaviors like getting a mammogram or using a condom,

368
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:16,790
for example. So things particularly things that people have to do on a on an irregular basis.

369
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:22,460
So not every minute of every day, but in specific are like putting on a seatbelt would be another example.

370
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:27,229
So that and and it is reasonable.

371
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:33,139
Like if you think about, you know, getting a mammogram like this is something that occurred within the age of 50.

372
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,650
This is something you would do once every year or every other year.

373
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:45,200
There is, you know, moderate evidence that doing so will certainly detect cancers.

374
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,230
Whether it adds light years to your life is actually debatable.

375
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:54,380
But the point is, is that you can sort of imagine that cost benefit analysis actually happening.

376
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,550
But the idea that that's what's happening when somebody makes a decision to or

377
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,120
not to get treatment for their depression or anxiety attack in our example,

378
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:08,150
is a little far fetched for the reasons that we have articulated in our thought experiment.

379
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:14,659
So again, the argument that the reason this this model as to why people get care is

380
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:18,049
essentially the idea that everyone is doing their internal cost benefit analysis.

381
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:23,330
And if you come out and say this is actually not beneficial to me, then you're not going to get care and otherwise you.

382
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:34,680
So let's go back to our thought experiment. So what and again, you've all generated these exact questions.

383
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,860
So because I'm clairvoyant, I can read your mind.

384
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:48,810
So. So, again, the answer to like what happens next actually depends on your answers to four questions that when you think about sort of don't really,

385
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,480
you know, when you think about like why do some people get care and some people don't?

386
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:56,070
I don't know that these are the questions you would think about. So, like, do you think you need help?

387
00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:03,780
And if so, what do you even mean by that? Because that help might be your family support.

388
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:08,729
It might be talking to a priest, it might be going using a app or a website.

389
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,530
It might mean calling a crisis line.

390
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:15,780
It might mean calling, you know, looking at your insurance list of your doctors and trying to find a mental health specialist.

391
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,839
Right. But what kind of health insurance do you have?

392
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,760
And and again, how much is in your bank account?

393
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:28,950
Because even if you have very good insurance, most mental, especially mental health providers do not take insurance in the United States any longer.

394
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:33,150
And so if you aren't getting access to private, especially mental health care.

395
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:42,720
That is almost always coming out, a majority of time out of pocket. So where does stigma fit into this?

396
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:54,730
Where do you see spring? Okay.

397
00:38:55,750 --> 00:39:00,640
Maybe like internalized beliefs of whether you need help or not. You might think you don't because you don't.

398
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:05,540
In that manner. What would and. And so what?

399
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:10,320
So. So. And talk a little bit more about that.

400
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:19,140
I don't want to be perceived in that manner because I don't think sometimes I think there's something wrong with them.

401
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:23,270
There's something wrong with me. I know that's not right.

402
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,939
So, yeah, there's something. There is. This is the internalized stigma, right?

403
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,290
So. If I need help, then there is something wrong.

404
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,170
Which of course, by definition is like.

405
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,280
If there is something wrong, you need help, right?

406
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:44,400
But like this, this is this is a different type of, you know, if you had a broken leg, that's something that's wrong.

407
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,210
And you need help with that. Right.

408
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:56,340
But so where this is, we talked about this when we read that poem, you know, the idea that differentiating between I can have this problem.

409
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:03,630
But you know, she in the poem, she talks about how it was voluntary. Her husband's choice to undergo ECT is voluntary.

410
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:10,440
She points this out. Why? Because that's better than having an involuntary right to have the exact same problem.

411
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,440
But have somebody else determine that you need treatment is a worse problem to have than you decide the treatment.

412
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:24,090
That's a it's a very nuanced example of how stigma operates because it's not just it's making differentiations all down the line.

413
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,210
It's not just problem, not problem. It's what flavor problem?

414
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:32,520
And this is where you get. Can we talk about depression in a couple weeks? You're going to play a video game called Depression Quest,

415
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:42,719
which is about a it's an autobiographical video game that is about a woman trying or not trying to get care for her depression.

416
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,030
And this idea of sort of like splitting hairs in terms of like, it's not that bad.

417
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,480
I don't need that kind of help. I don't need medication. I don't need think that that's all.

418
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:57,330
Where else? The stigma come in. Yeah. I like family members.

419
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:03,510
If you're having discussions with them, they might have their own ideas of what mental treatment is and when it should be used.

420
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:12,960
So that could definitely affect how you think you're feeling and what other elements if you can't care for mental health needs.

421
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:18,660
What does that say about them? Well, I know in other cultures too, like families can,

422
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:27,000
if they have a family member that got to access mental health treatment, they're seen as less, I guess.

423
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:30,870
Yeah. So parents screw it up. Yeah. Right. So there's this element to that.

424
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:33,570
And that's the that's the idea that the whole family is stigmatized.

425
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:39,540
That's how stigma operates, is not just that the person level, the whole family is stigmatized when one person has.

426
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:44,770
You know, and what's interesting is, like, it's not just that the child has a problem.

427
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:50,490
So that's because of the but that comes after earlier point of like this is not a problem worthy of treatment.

428
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,620
Right. Because treatment means a serious problem.

429
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:56,340
And a serious problem would mean that I didn't do my job as a parent or there was something else going on.

430
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:01,560
So that's it's all these other meanings that have nothing to do with the actual experience of the person.

431
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,540
That's that's like the again, the stigma is that air we breathe. Right.

432
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:09,210
Like that's that's how it's operating. It's how it's getting into all these different interactions.

433
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:17,270
Then of course, the structural stigma around health insurance coverage and not having adequate health care and not having a health care system.

434
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:21,500
And most people, when they find out how bad the system is,

435
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:25,640
the only reason they find out about it is because they or a loved one are trying to intersect with it.

436
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:34,940
And this is you'll see this very much more. We talk with NAMI, which is why that group is I mean, one of their champions has gotten Fred Freeze,

437
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:40,630
who is himself a schizophrenic living with schizophrenia.

438
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,260
He was also a therapist. And, you know, he was the original for us by us.

439
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:52,460
He's like, there is nothing there's nothing going to happen with mental health systems unless you have advocates and family members at the table.

440
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,870
And that's actually in the editorial that I wrote about Biden's plan.

441
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:05,000
That was one of our big points, is like there was no point in his plan involving stakeholders of people with mental illness in the process,

442
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:14,640
which they probably know what's wrong with it. So, okay, so again, just this is just summarizing what we've we've already talked about.

443
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:18,680
Again, stigma is this fundamental cause of health inequalities.

444
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,550
It is the air we breathe. It serves a function. So it keeps people out.

445
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:28,550
It keeps people in rights with this idea of like family in terms of like what is acceptable that's around conformity, keeping people in.

446
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:35,090
And it keeps people down right in terms of hierarchy and it manifests both as self stigma and institutionalized stigma.

447
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:42,620
This is a good example of a website, an anti stigma website and make it okay for community service.

448
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:49,340
I think it's a great website for just in general, but especially if you're interested, if your project has to do something with stigma.

449
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:53,560
So I want to read it to you because it's about a person who's dealing with panic disorder.

450
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:58,670
So I said, this is I had a panic attack while doing a presentation at the end of my first year of university.

451
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:03,680
It was the worst sensation I experienced my whole life. Basically, my mind and body suddenly leaving obvious reason.

452
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,550
I was facing a very dangerous situation and I knew to escape. I felt horrible.

453
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,410
For what was worse than the sensations in my body was the meaning I gave to those sensations.

454
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:15,770
I was losing control. I was failing and something was wrong with me.

455
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:21,799
The panic attacks crept in everywhere. I was so afraid and as I was so fearful of them around me, totally,

456
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:29,959
I couldn't accept it because it didn't match the idea I had of myself a happy, confident and unstressed person and in anxious.

457
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:37,640
All the time I felt the weight of stigma around mental problems when I felt ashamed of what was happening to me and my inability to deal with it.

458
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:42,680
I felt it when I realized how uncomfortable I was and still sometimes am to share those experiences.

459
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:45,800
I feel when I judged myself for feeling that way.

460
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,870
When I think something is wrong with me, when I think I am weaker than I should be, when I don't accept it,

461
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:54,140
I feel it when I notice how it affected my self-esteem in the way I perceive myself.

462
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,260
And then she closes here. Or he or she actually I don't know.

463
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:04,620
I think we need to fight message shaming individuals for the mental suffering that is our fault, our feelings.

464
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:08,149
Now, the idea is that happiness is normality that strong is always better than weak.

465
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:11,990
That weakness should be hidden, that suffering or reacting differently to certain problems.

466
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,660
All types of suffering are not failures of anything. They are just possible experiences.

467
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:21,740
The complex human mind coming from a set of predispositions, experiences, circumstances, social context and more.

468
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:27,530
That is somebody who's been to some cognitive behavioral therapy. That is that is a great reframing right there.

469
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:35,720
And so the reason I want to share this is because I think this is probably one of the best examples I've seen, like written examples of self stigma.

470
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:42,380
I'll also share this. So I had a severe episode of postpartum depression when my son was born.

471
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:47,209
And even though I teach this for a living and when I went to my doctor and I went

472
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:50,360
through the depression screening and she said I should have antidepressant medication,

473
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:54,650
I was like, No, no, no, no, absolutely not. What are you talking about? Like, I'm just I'm trying to adjust to a new mom.

474
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:59,540
I just, you know, I just said, I'll go to therapy. I want to therapy. She's like you. You and I knew she was correct.

475
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,960
She's like, you were experiencing severe symptoms, and I need you to take this medication.

476
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:08,720
And it still took me two weeks after getting the script before I finally agreed to take the first film.

477
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:14,120
You know, and it was and I say I share this just as an example of how you can know all the things.

478
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,100
And still, when it comes to your specifics, you are different.

479
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:21,530
You are the special snowflake. And I took the and I got better.

480
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:25,690
And here we are now this time. So that again,

481
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:31,640
I share this as an example of just how how in ways that I think and I think that's just a beautiful way

482
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:36,920
for me as somebody who would experience self stigma like this is this is how I felt I was a failure.

483
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:41,030
I was I was not doing what I should do. Okay.

484
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:47,960
So and I thank you for all my stuff. Come.

485
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:50,300
Coming next. Okay. So. So just.

486
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:58,180
Just remember that we're counting cases, which is the things that you did in your interactive trading spaces, for example.

487
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,700
That is not the same as quantifying need for mental health services.

488
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:08,120
The thing the role of what those measures are that we messed around with last week is just to identify cases.

489
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:14,660
But just because someone meets diagnostic criteria doesn't automatically mean that they perceive any threat that they would receive for treatment,

490
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:19,340
that they would benefit from the available treatment or that they would accept the available treatment.

491
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:29,750
Right. So those are those are not the same thing. This is just an example of another the idea of attitude.

492
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:33,860
This is again, this is not to say that everything I just told you about stigma doesn't matter.

493
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:37,670
But this is now just like thinking about attitudes, like what are people's preferences?

494
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:41,690
The vast majority of people, even people who have severe disorder,

495
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:46,010
at least at the time of the survey that's done, they want to try to handle it on their own.

496
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:49,460
Right. And so I'm not saying that this isn't also stigma.

497
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:58,190
They separate stigma separate from here. But again, it kind of comes to the idea of like is what is the acceptable treatment?

498
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,890
Is available treatment acceptable to individuals?

499
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:08,030
And as we're going to talk about next time, the vast majority of treatment in the United States solely exists of medication.

500
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:12,770
And so if that's all that you can offer someone, and that's not acceptable to them,

501
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,700
and medications are effective, but there are also other effective treatments.

502
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:20,300
Right. But if what is available is not acceptable, then you might as well not even offer it.

503
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:30,770
Oh, okay. So this is just kind of the idea that you are at the end point is making a decision to shake to to seek care.

504
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,770
Right. This is the calling the provider taking the medication, whatever.

505
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:39,890
Say the things that are going to get you there are what kind of professional help do I think I need?

506
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,260
What do I need to get that help?

507
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:48,890
Some people say like you need good mental health to get mental health care, which of course is actually more of the year.

508
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:52,939
And then these elements at the beginning point. To what degree are those symptoms impacting?

509
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:55,770
My ability to do what I want? How do I fit? Do I feel,

510
00:48:55,790 --> 00:49:01,670
to what degree do I feel shame about my symptoms and how difficult me how difficult is it for me to understand what my treatment options are?

511
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:15,890
And so to the that that the stakeholder example where I sit with the with the survey or that how to find a therapist.

512
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:24,160
Who's I. The therapist. Yes. I'm sorry. Sorry. I think it's a great example of like how to find out what your treatment options are.

513
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:26,770
How might you work through that? It's very hard. Sorry.

514
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:32,660
It's very hard for me with a both a beautiful hair to figure out what your treatment options are.

515
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:37,190
So that's in a helpful way here. Okay. Here's my last slide for you today.

516
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:40,819
So diagnoses again in themselves are not sufficient to treat the needs.

517
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:44,809
But the problem is and the reason that we hear about this in public health is often that's the only

518
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:49,310
data you have available as a policymaker or a program planner if you're trying to allocate funds.

519
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:57,170
We would like to have more information about impairment and also like the content, intensity and duration of the intervention.

520
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,540
But even if I take all that into account,

521
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:04,930
the substantial portion of mental disorders and particularly substance use disorders don't get the treatment.

522
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:10,560
So no positive news today, only donors, but they do it well.

523
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:24,300
I think we'll get back to questions about this. All right.

524
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,989
Well, I will let you go. I'll hang out for a few minutes if you've got questions. And I'll see you on Wednesday.

525
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:29,370
Your consent for class.
