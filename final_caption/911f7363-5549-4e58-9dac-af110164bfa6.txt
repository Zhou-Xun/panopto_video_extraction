00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,730
Hello and welcome to the Epidemiology Department, my module series.

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,150
My name is Martha Buxton and I am a faculty member in the Epidemiology Department.

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:20,690
In this unit, we will walk through the steps of calculating the Spearman's rank correlation.

4
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:27,740
Outdoor correlation measures are generally calculated using a statistical program.

5
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:37,490
Completing an example will allow you to understand and appreciate the format of the data and the steps involved.

6
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:47,300
By the end of this unit, you will be able to list the steps needed to calculate the Spearman's spring correlation.

7
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,930
And you will also know how to calculate disbursements rent correlation using actual data.

8
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,680
As a recap, all the different types of correlation measures.

9
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:09,180
The Pearson correlation allows us to evaluate linear relationships between two continuous variables.

10
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:20,500
The Pearson correlation is an ideal choice when you have continuous data for a pair of variables and the relationship follows a straight line.

11
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:31,170
On the other hand, the Spearman rank correlation is a non parametric eternity to the Pearson correlation.

12
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:40,320
The calculation is based on the ranked values of each variable rather than the raw data.

13
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,070
And this you have an opportunity to see as we walked through the example.

14
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:54,350
So you might be wondering which situations would it be appropriate to use experience correlation.

15
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:01,230
Let's go over a few instances. You should use the Spearman's rank correlation.

16
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,570
If you have continuous data and the relationship between the data,

17
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:13,140
if they do not follow a straight line or where the relationship between the variables is not linear,

18
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:20,910
you can also use the Spearman's rank correlation for data that are not normally distributed.

19
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,290
Additionally,

20
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:34,680
you can use the Spearman's rank correlation for data to have a monotonic relationship in monotonic relationships as one variable increases.

21
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,090
The other verb tends to either increase or decrease, but not necessarily in a straight line.

22
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,610
Spearman's correlation allows you to fit curvilinear relationships.

23
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,360
However, there must be a tendency to change in a particular direction.

24
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:00,620
So if you have a monotonic relationship or a situation where as X gets larger,

25
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:10,790
Y gets larger and then gets smaller or something that's more complicated, you should not use the Spearman's rank correlation.

26
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,950
You can also use experiments rank correlation for ordinal data.

27
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:29,920
Ordinate data are categorical data that have natural order categories, but the distances between the categories they are not established.

28
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:40,660
One example could be when you have socio economic status classified as low, medium or high.

29
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,570
So you have three categories. There's some sort of ordering, but it's not so clear.

30
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,150
Well, what's the difference between low and medium?

31
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,190
Or what's the difference between low and high?

32
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:04,650
So now we will review the steps needed to calculate the Spearman's rank correlation and then follow that by going through an example.

33
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:15,220
So the first step, you want to generate a table that includes the observations for the variables that you would like to evaluate.

34
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:22,420
The second step is then you will assign a rank to each observation for each variable.

35
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,590
After that, you will calculate the difference in rank for each pair of observations.

36
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:35,889
Then you'll calculate D Square by squaring the value of each difference.

37
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,430
And in this case it's going to be the value of de that you're going to square.

38
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:50,909
Then you calculate the sum of the square, and then the final step will be you will use the different variables that you've

39
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:57,330
calculated using these steps to calculate Spearman's rank correlation to them.

40
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,809
Plug those values into the experiments.

41
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:16,820
Rank Correlation coefficient formula. So the formula for spam is ranked correlation is a rule that strange looking P is what is called rule so

42
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:26,930
as equals to one minus six and the summation of D squared divided by end times and square minus one.

43
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:37,569
So Raul, as I said, is the how Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is represented and then and is the number

44
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:44,140
of data pairs and d square is the square of the difference in ranks for each data pair.

45
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:54,370
So let's see in ticket, look at an example and then hopefully these definitions will become clearer as we go through the example.

46
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,030
So we have a question here.

47
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:13,520
A cohort study was conducted to understand cytokine patterns over time among people who previously had COVID 19 or severe SARS-CoV-2 disease.

48
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:24,080
The table below contains the value of cytokines interleukin one A and interleukin one B from ten monthly visits.

49
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:33,470
Interleukin one A, interleukin one B profile damaturu cytokines, which are key factors in immune response.

50
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:40,460
So we need to find a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between the two cytokines.

51
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:51,920
In other words, the question is asking if the values from Sara visits for I l want a are correlated with the cytokine values.

52
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,580
Fire won't be. So we have our table.

53
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:00,409
The table has decided lines and then the value for each visit.

54
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:09,129
And you see we have up to ten visits. So on this slide, we have our table just to remind us of the values,

55
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:16,360
and we have a visual that we can track and then follow by that we have the

56
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:23,769
different variables that we need to calculate in order to calculate dispersions,

57
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:35,240
rank correlation. So firstly you will see in the red text box we have aisle one in in order of rank.

58
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:43,010
So we are ranking the values based on our smallest or largest.

59
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:49,940
So if you look, you will see that visit one file, one has been assigned a rank of one.

60
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:59,240
And this is because the value for visit one is the lowest among the ten cytokine visits for aisle one eight.

61
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:07,940
If you notice, you will also see that the value for visit you has been assigned a rank of two.

62
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:16,210
And this is because 39.87 is the second lowest value for I don't want eight.

63
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:27,830
And then if you look all the way to the extreme, four visit ten visit ten is the highest value file, one A and that has been assigned a rank of ten.

64
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:35,959
So don't confuse visit ten and having this being ten, it just happens that this a ten has the highest value.

65
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:49,240
So it has been assigned a rank of ten. Next we will do likewise while one be wearing all their values according to the ring.

66
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,110
So it would be the lowest to the highest.

67
00:08:53,590 --> 00:09:02,830
So in this case, I visit a file one B happens to be the lowest value file won't be.

68
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,770
So it has been assigned a rank of one.

69
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:17,819
And then on the extreme end, we have a visit, one that has been assigned a value of ten, because if you look across this table,

70
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:28,950
four out one B, you see visit one has a value of 102.43, which is the highest value for I'll one B.

71
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,070
Now followed by that we have the difference in rank.

72
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:41,840
The difference in rank here is you subtract the difference in rank between I want A and I'll one B.

73
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:52,610
So for example, visit one, we have one minus ten and that gives us a value of minus nine for visit five,

74
00:09:52,610 --> 00:10:00,710
we have a value of three file one eight as the rank and then a value of seven for the rank for I'll won't be.

75
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:09,590
So for that, the difference in rank would be minus four and similarly apply to the other pairs of values.

76
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:17,450
And then finally we have a square for each of the difference in rank.

77
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,710
So for visit one we had minus nine.

78
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,930
If you square that, you get 81.

79
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:35,240
And then the last step before we get to actually calculating the shipment's rank correlation is that we calculate the sum of De Square.

80
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:45,230
And so if you add up these numbers in the square row, you will see that the value will be 272.

81
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:54,719
So from there we can go ahead and use the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient formula and

82
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:02,660
then as a reminder is row and that is equal to one minus six times the square of D square.

83
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:12,770
In this case, we're almost to 72 divided by in which is the number of there's times in square minus one.

84
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,940
So we plug the values in the formula.

85
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:25,340
We have one minus six times 272 divided by ten times ten squared minus one.

86
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:34,370
So with that, if you calculate that, you get one -1632 divided by 990,

87
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:51,560
and then you'll find the step would be one -1.6485 giving you all Spearman's rank or correlation coefficient value of -0.685.

88
00:11:53,390 --> 00:12:00,170
So now that we've gone through the steps of arranging the data and calculating the Spearman's correlation,

89
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,079
let's take it to another step to interpret this.

90
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:19,910
Spearman's correlation. So to interpret the calculated Spearman's rank correlation coefficient or row of -0.6485.

91
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,980
We know that the negative sign.

92
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:37,190
Indicates that the cytokines inversely correlated in a magnitude of 0.65 means a moderate correlation between the two cytokines.

93
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:45,560
So in other words, when one cytokine value goes up, the other cytokine value goes down.

94
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:57,450
So in this unit we have covered an example of how to calculate the Spearman's rank correlation using epidemiologic data.

95
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:06,360
The steps covered here allow for fuller appreciation of how data are used to calculate

96
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:13,560
the Spearman's rank correlation and a better understanding of how to interpret the data.

97
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:21,840
Because now you understand that what we are actually looking at, we are using ranks to assign to the values for each site.

98
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:29,190
Okay. You can find additional resources on canvas on the Correlation Mojo page.
