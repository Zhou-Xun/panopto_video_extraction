1
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:09,453
In this module,

2
00:00:09,453 --> 00:00:13,940
I'll be introducing in giving you an
overview to environmental health policy.

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,030
Now in other lectures, we've focused
a lot on hazards and exposures and

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,370
you may be quite frustrated thinking
about how many people around us and

5
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,720
around the globe are exposed to lots of
different environmental health hazards.

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,400
I fully agree,
that's very frustrating and disturbing.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,016
The good news is, what we're going to
talk about today right now is policies

8
00:00:34,016 --> 00:00:38,122
that we can put into place to
actually improve those conditions.

9
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:41,551
So I should define environmental
policy before we get much further.

10
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:45,874
A policy is basically just a statement
by an organization of intentions and

11
00:00:45,874 --> 00:00:51,100
principles in relation, in this case,
to overall environmental performance.

12
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,793
And so the organization's putting
out policy can be public.

13
00:00:53,793 --> 00:00:57,191
It could be local or state or
national government.

14
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:58,200
But it could also be private.

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,410
It could be a corporation setting a policy
for how that corporation will behave.

16
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,790
Now environmental policies
give us two things.

17
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,570
They give us a framework for action and
they also give us a framework for

18
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,750
setting objectives.

19
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,490
So what are we trying to do with
regards to the environment?

20
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,610
What is our target?

21
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,630
What are we trying to achieve here?

22
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,430
And the goal of any environmental
policy should be to reduce human

23
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,030
risks that come from environmental
damages resulting from pollution.

24
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,716
So I'd like to go into a little bit
of depth here for a specific example

25
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:32,927
of an environmental policy, a very,
very important environmental policy.

26
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:38,430
In 1969, Congress passed
the US National Environmental Policy Act.

27
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,026
And the goal here again was to prevent
damage to the environment to benefit

28
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:42,786
human health.

29
00:01:42,786 --> 00:01:46,171
I'm not going to read a lot of slides in
this class, but I will read this one.

30
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:50,419
The Congress, recognizing the profound
impact of man's activity on

31
00:01:50,419 --> 00:01:54,451
the interrelation of all components
of the natural environment.

32
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:58,706
Declares that it is the continuing
policy of the federal government in

33
00:01:58,706 --> 00:02:00,365
cooperation with state and

34
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:04,837
local governments to use all practicable
means and measures to create and

35
00:02:04,837 --> 00:02:09,830
maintain conditions under which man and
nature can exist in productive harmony.

36
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,629
And fulfill the social, economic, and

37
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:17,502
other requirements of present and
future generations of Americans.

38
00:02:17,502 --> 00:02:19,413
So that's a lot to take in at once.

39
00:02:19,413 --> 00:02:22,322
But as you have a chance
to digest that statement,

40
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:24,823
I hope you realize how
very powerful it is.

41
00:02:24,823 --> 00:02:29,347
This single sort of distillation really
set us off on a completely new path at

42
00:02:29,347 --> 00:02:34,013
the time for the United States in terms
of protecting public health by actually

43
00:02:34,013 --> 00:02:39,110
concentrating on preserving and
improving the environment.

44
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,852
I'd like to walk through
now the four principles or

45
00:02:41,852 --> 00:02:44,095
philosophies of environmental policy.

46
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:48,423
Some might argue there are more, but these
four I think are sort of prototypical or

47
00:02:48,423 --> 00:02:52,570
provide us a good definition of
what policies might be based on.

48
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,068
So these philosophies or

49
00:02:54,068 --> 00:02:58,431
principles can be used to guide the work
of the people who create policy.

50
00:02:58,431 --> 00:03:02,750
And policy can be created by formal and
informal actors.

51
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,750
It can be researched
by policy researchers.

52
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,504
And of course,

53
00:03:06,504 --> 00:03:10,760
there's analysts involved who try to
understand the impacts of policies.

54
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,541
So the four that we're going to run
through are the precautionary principle,

55
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,734
environmental justice,
environmental sustainability, and

56
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:19,284
the polluter pays principle.

57
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:22,286
I will say there
are significant ethical and

58
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:25,785
moral issues associated
with creating policies.

59
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:30,402
The key one being that when we set
a policy we have to identify what is

60
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:34,609
an acceptable degree of risk
associated with the hazard that

61
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:36,595
we're trying to regulate?

62
00:03:36,595 --> 00:03:39,030
Are we comfortable with
some people getting sick?

63
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,450
If so, how many are we comfortable with?

64
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,050
Or we would like no one to get
sick as a result of exposure

65
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,660
to a particular contaminant?

66
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,300
These are absolutely ethical and

67
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,850
moral issues that sort of complicate
the making of environmental policy.

68
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,986
So let's dive a little deeper
into the precautionary principle.

69
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:00,863
This principle basically says that
we should take preventative and

70
00:04:00,863 --> 00:04:05,625
anticipatory measures whenever we think
an activity could harm the environment or

71
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:09,177
creatures in the environment,
wildlife, or human health.

72
00:04:09,177 --> 00:04:11,778
And we should do these
things even if cause and

73
00:04:11,778 --> 00:04:15,550
effect relationships
are not fully established.

74
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,790
So let me reframe that a little bit and
say it other words.

75
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,000
We want to err on the side of prevention
and take protective measures.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,349
Even if we're not completely
scientifically certain about the impacts

77
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:29,495
of a particular chemical or agent.

78
00:04:29,495 --> 00:04:31,667
This approach is not common
in the United States, but

79
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,655
it's been fully adopted
by the European Union.

80
00:04:33,655 --> 00:04:37,177
And basically there,
their policies advocate that if

81
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:41,693
there's even a potential hazard
from an environmental health risk,

82
00:04:41,693 --> 00:04:45,537
action should be taken to prevent
the impacts of that risk.

83
00:04:45,537 --> 00:04:48,155
The second principle I'll mention
is environmental justice.

84
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:52,155
And basically this posits that equal
treatment of all people in society,

85
00:04:52,155 --> 00:04:55,964
irrespective of their racial background,
their country of origin,

86
00:04:55,964 --> 00:05:01,520
their socioeconomic status, is absolutely
required to have a fair and just society.

87
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,340
Unfortunately, environmental hazards
are very often the product of disparities

88
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,910
in power and privilege.

89
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,700
And so these disparities result in
different group,s and oftentimes,

90
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,220
especially children,

91
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,015
having very unequal amounts of
exposure to environmental hazards.

92
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:19,960
So the tenant of environmental justice
is basically no group should bear

93
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,930
a disproportionate share of negative
environmental consequences.

94
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,988
And in that,
there are a number of sort of sub-tenants.

95
00:05:26,988 --> 00:05:31,240
People need the opportunity to participate
in decisions that affect their environment

96
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,380
and health, that makes sense.

97
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,830
The public needs to be able
to influence an agency that's

98
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,010
regulating these decisions.

99
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,575
Third, people's concerns absolutely
need to be considered and

100
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,118
sought out in the decision-making process.

101
00:05:45,118 --> 00:05:49,819
And fourth, it's the job of decision
makers to actively go and seek out and

102
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:54,983
involve potentially affected people to
avoid environmental justice problems.

103
00:05:54,983 --> 00:05:59,200
We'll talk more about environmental
justice in other lectures.

104
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,580
The third principle here or philosophy
is environmental sustainability.

105
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,920
And this is basically the viewpoint
that a just, strong, and

106
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,980
wealthy society is actually
consistent with a clean environment,

107
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,690
a healthy ecosystem,
and a beautiful planet.

108
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,200
Basically the two major tenets here are,
number one,

109
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,530
that resources can't be used faster
than they can be regenerated.

110
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:24,500
And number two, really we should be
aiming to make no permanent changes to

111
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,190
the natural environment.

112
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,354
So sustainable development is
a very hot topic today and

113
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:31,922
that basically has three major components.

114
00:06:31,922 --> 00:06:36,346
We need to focus on material and energy
use, we need to focus on land use, and

115
00:06:36,346 --> 00:06:40,770
we need to focus on the development and
betterment of humans.

116
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,770
Finally, we come to the fourth philosophy,
which is the polluter pays principle.

117
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,085
This was actually put forth by the OECD,
the Organization for

118
00:06:48,085 --> 00:06:51,927
Economic Cooperation and Development,
all the way back in 1974.

119
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:56,125
And basically, this principle states
that polluters, people who create

120
00:06:56,125 --> 00:07:00,387
contamination, need to bear the expenses
of preventing that pollution and

121
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:04,050
control measures that are required
by public authorities to keep

122
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,064
the environment in an acceptable and
healthy state.

123
00:07:07,064 --> 00:07:09,644
So basically we're saying
if you make the pollution,

124
00:07:09,644 --> 00:07:11,674
you have to pay to control it or
clean it up.

125
00:07:11,674 --> 00:07:16,037
But of course, it's your right as
a producer to pass along those costs of

126
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:20,043
controlling pollution to consumers
through the price of goods and

127
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:23,669
services that you create.
