00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:07,809
Okay, so we've been talking about different ways to use our breath, our senses, our body

2
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:11,919
to help meet the needs of whatever is going on in our body, at the moment.

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:18,169
These exercises are going to be a mixture of helping us channel our energy and kind of focus

4
00:00:18,169 --> 00:00:24,589
it, and also, kind of get some of it out when we need to, or slow it down.

5
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:31,079
So I'll walk you through the different ones and you kind of figure out, the cool thing with some of these too is that you can use them in a meeting,

6
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:37,089
especially on Zoom it's really easy, because people can't see your body. These can be used

7
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:41,619
anywhere you are to kind of help you in the moment.

8
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:53,759
So the first one we're going to do, is you're going to use your hands almost like if you've ever kneaded dough or been trying to,

9
00:00:53,759 --> 00:01:00,879
like, smooth something, but having to really kind of push in and out.

10
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:07,409
We're going to do this with our thighs. Now, we don't want to push into our thighs to the degree that we're bruising ourself or hurting ourselves.

11
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:14,309
But imagine that you've got a lot of frustration. I mean, imagine that you've got a lot of anxious energy, and

12
00:01:14,309 --> 00:01:19,789
you need to kind of like put it somewhere for a little bit.

13
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:30,229
That's what we're doing here. So what I want you to do is to put your hands at the top of your thighs.

14
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:38,729
Inhale. And push down to your knees.

15
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:49,199
Go back up into the top of your thighs and inhale. And push.

16
00:01:49,199 --> 00:02:02,059
And you're just going to keep doing that as a way of breathing, slowing down the breathing and pushing the stress, the energy, the activation.

17
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:08,429
This can be a good way to kind of settle before you have to give a talk or something like that.

18
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:15,369
A similar way to do this, is so, again, you're just sitting in your chair.

19
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:21,179
You're going to think about pushing your feet into the ground as if you were going to tip your chair back.

20
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:23,589
You're not necessarily tipping your chair back.

21
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:30,059
But again, you're taking all of the anxiety, frustration, whatever it is, and you're going to push it down into your feet.

22
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:40,599
It helps to tilt your chair back just a little bit. Hold it. And let it go.

23
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:51,379
And just like the other one, you can do that multiple times. So you're giving all of that energy that's bottled up a place to go,

24
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:59,169
and then letting it go. So that one, I could actually do while I'm talking to you right now,

25
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:02,069
and nobody even has to know necessarily that that's what I'm doing.

26
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:09,689
I'm kind of channeling and focusing all of this built-up energy and giving it a place to go. If more than that is needed,

27
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:18,069
that's usually where things like running or I'll often say you're taking a pillow and just kind of

28
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:21,429
beating up your bed for a little bit. It's letting the energy go.

29
00:03:21,429 --> 00:03:26,469
They are more vigorous things to do, like shoveling snow or something that can also be helpful.

30
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:33,759
But in lieu of that, these little things that we can do in our chair, can sometimes be helpful.

31
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:39,139
The other one, we've talked about this in a few of the videos, but I want to come back to it a little bit.

32
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:46,539
Is tapping, so we've done tapping like this. But you can do that on your thighs,

33
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:54,729
a slow, bilateral motion is helping calm your nervous system, even if you're doing something else.

34
00:03:54,729 --> 00:04:00,619
So if you're in a meeting or in a talk and it's feeling stressful on your thighs,

35
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:05,049
you can be doing that tapping to slow down.

36
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:11,759
You can be doing it with your feet under the table to slow down.

37
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:28,789
You can be doing it with your hands. And some people really like tapping both sides at the same time, a little bit faster.

38
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:44,809
And just breathe. So try variations of that,

39
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:54,759
see what works for you. We'll put a link in here that has more exercises like this that are brief, but that you can do in lots of different

40
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:03,799
situations to help manage the energy and what's happening in your body from moment to moment.
