1
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:14,590
That's what this.

2
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:49,570
Because it's just first year investigation of mass shootings.

3
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,230
Okay. Good morning, everybody. I think we need to move my microphone.

4
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,760
How was your weekend? Good. Great. How was yours?

5
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:19,430
I am like, for the first time, appreciated and ready.

6
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:29,560
Oh, yeah. I didn't know what I was going to say, but.

7
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:34,750
Yeah, I. I see. Neil is seriously up for a second there.

8
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,990
I almost got his name in front of 200 people.

9
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:50,710
Life is like a busy tree. But I refrain to say that most fun.

10
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:07,400
Okay. There are some things that I want to discuss with you. Some of them.

11
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,810
Well, one of them is about the midterm exams being graded.

12
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,700
And you'll get your grades pretty soon. And with your grade,

13
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:24,470
I think you'd have your grade ten and all the homework assignments and the grade that I would do if I had to be in here right now.

14
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:33,890
Right. So when I give you the great, you'll get the grade of the assignments and the letter grade you.

15
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:40,790
And if I have to stop the class and enumerate now these letters rate those receive in the classroom, you know,

16
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:52,910
so pretty much you're standing in the class and not you don't get confused with a numerical grade that may not be huge.

17
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:04,070
So one of the things that I would like to do today is common on some of the problems that we.

18
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:16,209
Some of the problems that we got in the south, particularly.

19
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:25,330
I want to take a look at this one table and I ask you.

20
00:03:33,280 --> 00:04:04,170
And. So I ask you to find this picture, that imperfect information.

21
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,360
Look at the meaning of this. It's.

22
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:23,409
I know. So it went like this gets beat of nature.

23
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:30,060
One state of nature into the state of nature.

24
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:38,140
Three. And on this issue of learning.

25
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,330
Physician to the musician.

26
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:54,670
Three. And 700,000.

27
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,690
900 and hundred or 400.

28
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:20,400
And 500 and 251,000 and 710.

29
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:30,560
So I ask you to find out the perspective of imperfect information that I didn't give you any probabilities.

30
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:39,710
Right. So it was drilled here and then I said Computer API for a reason.

31
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,120
The decision maker, that's the person who makes based on this victim monetary value makes this issue.

32
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:52,530
If you have enough information just to find your answer in either case and then I think in the round table.

33
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,690
So you don't need probabilities to feel that regret pain.

34
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:06,940
All right. So we have the decision in my decision to do this issue three and be it.

35
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:12,590
Is this the structure? I needed to be on the table.

36
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:23,630
So those are both 15. So what we know that for detail for the data review table we need to do is they maximum and then column.

37
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:51,740
And so when we fixed the debt rose from 5 to 7 and then it was our floating standing and then we subtract, you subtract the individual entry.

38
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:04,820
So we said, so if we have that in this table, right,

39
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:13,370
and we know that the regret table is always positive or not negative cannot have negative three grand.

40
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:21,800
And you we know that everybody is always equal to based on it in particular.

41
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:30,650
Right. So it doesn't matter what the what probabilities you have against these was always going to be zero.

42
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:38,510
Right. So it doesn't matter by how many numbers, you know that I don't to one you multiply these proportions,

43
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:43,190
this is always going to be zero and there's nothing lower than zero right.

44
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:49,970
In is that that opportunity cost because the opportunity cost are zero or possibly right.

45
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,740
So this is the best that you can do this.

46
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:59,040
This is going to be they expected a minimal unexpected opportunity loss.

47
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:03,410
It doesn't matter how many, you know, what kind of probability you put here.

48
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:10,340
So this is going to be if if any of the probabilities are new, that they have one.

49
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,030
So they have to be all zero. These numbers are going to be positive.

50
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:25,160
And then if that so these is going to be the minimum expected opportunity large and therefore they divide is.

51
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:31,730
Do you think this mean of community?

52
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:37,740
Not. Which makes sense. What is this better value of perfect information?

53
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,760
What is eating is the amount of money that you would pay to have perfect information

54
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,290
to know what the state of nature is going to be before you make the decision.

55
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:57,980
So if you don't know anything about the state of nature, what decision would you make if you have you know, you know,

56
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,320
the probability of you didn't have the probability when decision was made,

57
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,800
you always would make decision one because decision one is the best on each possible scenario.

58
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:16,750
You think a look at that and they say, does it matter that this person tells me that is going to be state of nature?

59
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:22,930
One, I'm going to be this is show one, I'm here to see you and your decision.

60
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,249
Right. So you know that you're going to pick this issue one no matter what,

61
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:33,220
so that the information doesn't add anything to you because that's what you're going to do anyway.

62
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,540
Therefore, it is not your perfect information in this case.

63
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:46,950
Zero. That's why you have the. This is the best of all the possible.

64
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:53,400
The decision, the one under each state of nature is the best of all possible.

65
00:09:53,610 --> 00:10:04,829
And so you would never do anything else. That decision, no matter what the probabilities are.

66
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:12,300
Here I come 1.9 and 10.1 and zero.

67
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:21,630
And the steel, you know, you get this each one of the best because it is the highest of the one end.

68
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:35,840
Or if I. Good .313.4 then you name you know those just one decision one in three of each one of the.

69
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,470
So that's what I hope you are doing to build the opportunity table.

70
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:52,170
So you kind of you realize that this is the best of each possible scenario in each possible state of nature.

71
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:59,640
And you say, okay, I'm going to pick that one. Anyway, the EBIT in this case is going to be zero, right?

72
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:12,270
So I'm using a zero yield. So that's that that's a point that I wanted to make in that specific problem.

73
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:18,360
So I know there that you might, you know,

74
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:28,320
another thing that you might you might find in problems like this and I'm going

75
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:36,270
to modify now there is a piece of table suppose that I have the following.

76
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:42,490
So everything. It sounds.

77
00:11:52,880 --> 00:12:00,380
And this is 2004 is.

78
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:18,930
So if I give you that and I ask you, we decision you would never take which decision you would never implement.

79
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,330
So you can't you can take out of the the bail thing.

80
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:33,570
In this case, it would be decision two, because this issue, too, is always worse than decision one.

81
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:40,620
So if you are going to pick decision two, you might as well pick this issue one, which is based on any possible scenario.

82
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:48,180
So I don't know when decision London, decision three, because this is better in this case,

83
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,420
but the decision is better, that decision in this case and so on.

84
00:12:52,440 --> 00:13:03,480
But what I know is I can never think decision two, because there's always a pay for any any estate of nature.

85
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,050
The decision one can be a better deal.

86
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:17,280
So that's what we say is that this issue of the one dominates this issue in two for each state.

87
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:29,160
So those are the kind of things that are more conceptual, right?

88
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:38,030
But you can actually work the math and figured out that you will never peak like like they, you know, they can, you know,

89
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:47,170
do in the VBI of day opportunity loss table and realizing in the other case that they

90
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:57,550
were there that that that first decision was they wanted to do something on the order.

91
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,810
On the time. Right. Okay.

92
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:13,270
So another thing that I wanted to mention is that they were you realize that they when I was reading

93
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:27,610
the problem last time in this decision tree from period of 1517 these laws they said plus one.

94
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:37,090
So there's a there's a 10% probability that you increase 1%.

95
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:45,370
You know, the interest rate goes up, then the interest rate goes down by 1.1%.

96
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:57,250
The interest rate goes up by 1%. So that's why you have the 5% to 6% minus one is 5%.

97
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,490
6% plus one is 7%.

98
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:07,900
But then this is supposed to be made.

99
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,080
It goes up by 3%, not 2%.

100
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:23,370
What I would I some of the I think the description in the book is that the the problem in the book is that it goes up,

101
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:29,770
you know, it can go 1%, down 1% or 3%.

102
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:35,139
And I would always do percent. So always my mistake is fine.

103
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,290
If you did that and this is done, that's okay.

104
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:52,270
And, you know, you don't have to redo it. Well, I wasn't grading fine, so I just be read that I mean everything with plus 2%, but in reality, 3%.

105
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:56,490
So all these numbers should be increased by 1%.

106
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:01,920
You. So we should see.

107
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:14,730
So they should be nine year olds should be in heaven and should be 30 years.

108
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,640
When I see how these numbers are.

109
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:31,050
So let's assume that. So this is 9% we need to get.

110
00:16:31,560 --> 00:17:05,980
Sure. Three. And just to make sure.

111
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,760
I'm going to Providence. 15, 17 more seats now.

112
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:26,140
I'm going to. The first one that we did it.

113
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,300
Then three percentage points.

114
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:49,040
Yeah. At the beginning of the seven year, the interest rate could increase by 1%, increase by 1% or increase by 3% with probability point seven.

115
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:54,080
And then we go back to our decision three.

116
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:04,640
Then we go here. It should be done in three years, right?

117
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,320
Less than 9% or three years.

118
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,350
They may have 9% change here.

119
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:23,170
These should be everything.

120
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:38,520
And. We never in the formula.

121
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:54,470
And finally. We have almost 13% for three years.

122
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:09,380
And then 13% in the 14.

123
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:22,040
And. All right.

124
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:31,190
And then what we have now is that these $211,200.

125
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:41,360
And then as this issue I think is the same one that we've got before, it is 200 is go 6% for five years.

126
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:52,850
And then there's a chance they think there's the same kind of adjustable rate loan, adjustable rate,

127
00:19:52,850 --> 00:20:05,750
and then you can get this 6% in four or five years and then and then your interest rate can go the last four years, seven, nine, 11%.

128
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,890
So that's it. I'm sorry about that.

129
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:20,950
That was then. I read it, and I just thought I made a mistake with the number.

130
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,050
So it was 2%, three, 2% increase instead of fingers.

131
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,800
And thank you for a couple of you can go with that. All right.

132
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:40,380
So today we are going to continue working on this issue, an analysis of when we start introducing the amount of information.

133
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:52,860
And to do that, what I would like to do is keep solving the problems and introducing the the body of information while I do that.

134
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,460
So I want back to.

135
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:05,790
That's. What went overseas on you?

136
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:12,210
WOMAN Number six. The first problem we are going to do, it will really need to 1517.

137
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,170
So listen to problem 919.

138
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:24,490
And that problem 99 is from now from your wings don't textbook.

139
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,580
That's what we're going to be using from now from.

140
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:14,500
Industry. So the problem is this download problem 919.

141
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:50,100
Nancy. How is this? Suppose you are tested to see if you have a rare disease?

142
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:57,810
Okay, then we make these. And so we are going to start just by looking at the information.

143
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,429
And so suppose that you are tested to see if you have a rare disease.

144
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:07,200
I assume that if you have the disease, your test will always come back positive.

145
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:13,080
But if you do not have the disease, there is still one in 2000 chance that you will get it.

146
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:22,790
But in reality, only one of the people 10,000 people have and this is your doctor calls and says that you have tested positive.

147
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:30,780
He's sorry, but there is 99% chance that's one minus one in a thousand chance that you have the disease.

148
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,650
Then the question is who is incorrect and what is there?

149
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:38,730
If he is not correct, what is the actual probability that you have the disease?

150
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:50,310
Right. So this is let's see, we are in times of COVID, for example, then there is a certain probability that there is.

151
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:57,410
You have got within the population, there's some probability that you have the disease,

152
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:02,969
you know, based on the prevalence of probably you passed on the test is positive.

153
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:13,020
And then how sure it is, how sure you are that you have to be specific based on the prevalence of COVID in the population.

154
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:24,320
This is not reflecting COVID, by the way, but, you know, this is this is the kind of analysis that we take when we want.

155
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:33,900
And, you know, even all the you know, the effectiveness of the tests, but how we interpret that as results.

156
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:49,680
So see, this test is very good because it tells you that they that even if you have the disease, your test will always come back positive.

157
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:55,290
Right. So if you come to these things, you will come back positive.

158
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:59,219
But you do not have the disease that that is false.

159
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:05,940
Negative, right. If you do not have the disease, there is still 1000 chance that you test positive.

160
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,180
So you can have a false, false negative new test.

161
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:17,940
And then the test comes and say positive. But they say that's one in 10,000 that you have.

162
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,529
That happens if you will have the disease. So, so let's model these.

163
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:34,259
And and that's going to be fundamental to evaluate information to use in decision analysis.

164
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:39,600
Right. So what to do is if you have information that is not perfect like in this case.

165
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:49,960
So we know that there is a prevalence of the disease out there.

166
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:53,500
So one in 10,000 people have the disease.

167
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:57,040
This is what we call the higher probability of the disease.

168
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:07,329
So, you know, so if you pick a person in the street at random, what is the probability that that person has?

169
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:11,920
The disease is one in 10,000 if you pick that person at random in the street.

170
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:17,150
So at least it's equal to one in.

171
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:33,890
So. You have to enable editing.

172
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:53,200
Do the job there. Think you. Okay.

173
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:06,970
I. So we were talking that.

174
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,510
This is important to one in 10,000.

175
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:33,740
Intelligence. And this is one want one in?

176
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:46,480
In. That is the days prior.

177
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:53,670
I mean, the probability of that this is right before you get any information about the specific person and

178
00:27:53,670 --> 00:28:02,280
then let's see what is the probability of of testing positive given that you have the disease.

179
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:10,680
But it is probably testing positive given that you have these. 100% on their birthday.

180
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:18,350
I want. So a person will have the disease or would test positive.

181
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:23,570
And what is the probability that you test positive given that you will have the disease.

182
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:30,320
The false -3.1 in the subsequent.

183
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:43,489
So what we want to know is this quantity is whether the probability that if I is a person

184
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:48,190
in the street and the person that supposedly witnesses the properties of the person,

185
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:55,910
we think so, which is not the same as what is the probability that a person tests positive

186
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:02,360
given that the person that this is among all the people that test positive,

187
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:11,300
right? What is the probability that that person has a disease and this is someone all the people with the disease with probably as positive.

188
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:19,700
So this so in this case, the denominator is all the people who have the disease in this case.

189
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:26,300
The denominator is all the people that this person with these.

190
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:37,909
Well, let's let's actually in order to do this, we're going to do that using two different ways.

191
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:45,530
They're exactly the same. But the first one is called building a frequency table.

192
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:57,660
And with a frequency table, with a frequency approach, we are going to actually have an intuition of what it is that we're doing.

193
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,680
So remember, this is the issue.

194
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:09,470
There is a disease in the population and the prevalence of the disease is one in 10,000, a rapid version on the street.

195
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:18,560
And then if we stop before I do administer any test, then I say, what is the probability of each person have the disease?

196
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:23,270
And I have to conclude that it's one in 10,000 because that's the prevalence of the population.

197
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:32,620
But then that specific person, I administered the test and the test is positive and then I revise my probabilities, right?

198
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,290
I say, well, now is not in 1000.

199
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,640
Now I have more information. That person tested positive.

200
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:45,800
So what is my probability, my reassessment of the chance that the person has the disease?

201
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:56,240
So that's the. So we are going to start by imagining that we have a population of, say, a million people.

202
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:03,260
So this is going to be 1000000.

203
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:17,330
That's my initial population. Maybe I'll I'll get to the more people just to get this whole number right.

204
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:22,680
So my population is initial population is going to be this initial.

205
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:40,150
Okay. Out of these 1 million people.

206
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:45,340
How many of then do the youths will have their voices?

207
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:49,630
Right. So I'm going to put these here.

208
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:01,950
Cool to see some of these guys.

209
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:21,390
Think I'm healthy. How are you, one? So how many of these individuals are going to have the disease?

210
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:32,300
It has to be a million people at times the probability that one in 1000.

211
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:37,370
So this is going to be 2 million people.

212
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:48,200
Right. And then I'm going to function for I want to make sure that I don't insult if I have to copy these these for you.

213
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:56,359
I don't know the times and then among the multiplied times, the prior probability that we see.

214
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:02,180
So. So I get the hundred with the disease.

215
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:15,310
Right. And then how many are not going to happen is he is is going to be the initial population times the probability of not having the disease.

216
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:15,590
Right.

217
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:28,050
So if people in the initial population finds the probability of not having the disease is one minus the probability that people have the disease.

218
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:44,340
One in eight, one in 10,000. So we have 800 within Alex and 999,000 nylon.

219
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:53,160
Let's use the coma separator so you can read these numbers at least for me.

220
00:33:53,500 --> 00:34:01,730
You use. Right.

221
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:14,720
So now out of these people with the disease are, you know, how many are going to test positive and how many are going to test negative?

222
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:25,290
Test positive. A good chance.

223
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,760
The same thing is positive for people with no disease.

224
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:51,060
It was. On Thursday.

225
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:11,629
And then I had to conclude that that person how many of these people with a disease would that

226
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:19,640
positive is these hundred times the probability of testing positive given that you have the disease,

227
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:31,790
which is one right. So it was going to be equal to the number of people with the disease and times the probability of testing positive.

228
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:38,810
Given that you have the disease, which is 100.

229
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,110
How many are going to test negative?

230
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:53,510
Is there going to be a number of people with the disease times the probability of testing negative given that you have the disease,

231
00:35:53,510 --> 00:36:04,610
which is one of these number here of testing positive you then you have the disease is one therefore testing positive.

232
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:09,920
Keeping in the drawing in the testing negative given that you have the disease is zero.

233
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:15,490
So that's one one here.

234
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:43,070
So that is zero. Which means here we make all these numbers, numbers instead of counting and, you know, a thousand separate or.

235
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:50,240
Okay. So here we know about the number of people that test positive.

236
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:56,210
So those are the number of people that this positive given that they don't have the disease.

237
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:03,320
So how what's the probability of testing positive, given that you didn't have the disease at this point?

238
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:13,430
0011 in 2000. So out of out of these people that don't have the disease, how many are going to be testing positive?

239
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:29,140
Is this number 999,900 times the probability of testing positive, given that you have this, which is we you know what?

240
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:43,920
So happens to be yourselves on how many of these people are going to be testing these 999,900 -1000.

241
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:52,180
But we've got to be more for Romans eight. Is it going to be a number of people will be these two.

242
00:37:53,860 --> 00:38:02,340
And for these times, one, you know, the probability of testing positive.

243
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:12,270
You know, these like Houston, the probability of testing negative in Wyoming.

244
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:21,820
So only nine, nine, nine. So I have 998,900.

245
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:28,440
Right. So we have separated in buckets and four buckets, the population.

246
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,100
And those are that people that tested positive.

247
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:41,410
And and half of the people. Right. This is the probably this is the number of people that tested negative and have the disease,

248
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:49,930
the probability that tested positive and do not have the disease and the probability of testing negative and do not have diseases.

249
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:56,200
So we are conditioned a million people and the population into these four.

250
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,880
Now what I need to do in this case now is fine.

251
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:09,310
If I if I get a random people from the population and I think the person and that person these positive.

252
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,100
What is it? Probably the person will have the disease.

253
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:20,460
So we are asking what is the probability that a person has the disease given that that person is possible?

254
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,420
And so what I'm going to do is what is my they nominated.

255
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:35,189
The probability that that person has privacy, given that that person is positive, tested positive.

256
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:45,150
Whereas my denominator denominator is the number of people that is a positive.

257
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:53,030
Right. So all the number of people have tested positive. And then what is my numerator is the probability of people.

258
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,670
That is the number of people that have that you see. Right? So I don't know.

259
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:06,540
So in this case, the macro volatility is going to be what are the probability that is that positive?

260
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:11,100
Okay. And you have the is still this is a probably tested positive.

261
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,550
And how easy is it probably imposing of these?

262
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:21,630
Even so, in this case, it's a hundred, right? So that's going to be 100 divided by.

263
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,430
And then all the people that tested positive.

264
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:32,130
Right. And then the number of people that tested positive only to be a hundred.

265
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:40,520
And you have here us 1,000% positive, right?

266
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:52,080
So here those are the probabilities. These are the people that they supposedly can have the ABC divided by all the people that they're supposed to.

267
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:56,680
Right. And in this case, we have 9%.

268
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:04,770
So it's not only. Surprising.

269
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:15,630
So let me put that in percentage. 69.09%.

270
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:22,080
So it says here that this looks like a good pass, right?

271
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:32,790
So the probability of this is a probability of the probability of positive,

272
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:47,969
given the disease is one and the probability of positive given seasons .00 so that the probability of false positive is one in a thousand.

273
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:56,730
The probability of false negatives is. So in this case, it looks like a very good test.

274
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:04,470
But given the prevalence of the disease, given that the disease is very rare, you know,

275
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:20,040
if you are informed that there's been an individual a day and he's positive, then you know that your probability instead of being one in 10,000.

276
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:23,390
Now you say it was 9% in the preparation of the disease.

277
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:31,230
What is just 9%? So you see what I mean?

278
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:41,310
So you can the person from the industry and that you say we need that that person is has a disease.

279
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:47,030
One thing's very small. Let me put let me give you the person in this place possibly.

280
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:51,600
What is the probability that the person is now almost 90%?

281
00:42:52,310 --> 00:43:02,670
I. So it is it's far from 100% is much higher than a 1000 that you had before, but it's still very low.

282
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:16,139
So does the idea that you think that that's that that's the information that that just you know will with go for you and that

283
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:27,180
reason is because that the prevalence of the disease is too strong is supposed to the prevalence of the disease is fairly high.

284
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:32,130
Suppose that the prevalence of it is about 5%, right?

285
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:38,670
Instead of one in 19,000, I suppose it is 5% .05.

286
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:55,080
So now that same person, if you take it with the same type of test, now you that person test positive now you think is 98.4%.

287
00:43:55,460 --> 00:44:04,020
Yeah. But this because the prevalence of the disease is high before,

288
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:11,549
because the problem is so small is is very difficult to find in person with these needs.

289
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:16,500
Right. So. So this is one.

290
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:24,620
But we had 10,000.

291
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:29,970
Right, right now.

292
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:40,870
What we have done any questions about is about the frequency table.

293
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:56,380
So is the initial population. Just like anyone who is eligible for the disease, like if it was the disease could only be present in women.

294
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,310
Is it like women in the city or something like that?

295
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:03,870
Yeah, well, it's a prevalence if it is. Okay.

296
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:09,700
So it depends on what your population is if it is a disease that only happens in women.

297
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,690
Right. So you start with a million women.

298
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:17,650
Right. And what is the prevalence of the disease of women?

299
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:23,000
This is your prime protein. Okay. So it's kind of like whatever you're trying to study.

300
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:27,820
The study team defines the initial population based on what they want to know.

301
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:41,410
Okay. In this case, you know that.

302
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:51,140
You know, let's let's say what is the prevalence of prostate cancer.

303
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,800
Right. So you are not going to include it. Right.

304
00:45:54,990 --> 00:46:03,170
So you're not going to include women. So what is the prevalence of prostate cancer among men?

305
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:14,550
And then you get the PSA test, whether it was positive or something worth doing.

306
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:29,060
Okay. So if you take a look at that, I'm going to kind of write these in a different way.

307
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:38,629
So in this case, I'm going to I'm going to establish I'm going to I want to write in table when I'm considering the

308
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:47,120
people that give me the the accuracy of this test that says the accuracy of this test in the.

309
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:57,639
ROSE. I'm going to hide the condition that we want to forecast,

310
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:03,480
the condition that we want to find out if these cases whether this person have the disease or not.

311
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:10,710
This is. No.

312
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:24,400
In the columns I'm going to type whether the person tests positive.

313
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:49,960
For me as opposed to being. And this is going to be the condition of probabilities of the probability of having the testing.

314
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,980
No positive or negative or testing probability of testing result.

315
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:14,500
Given then discovered this is going to be.

316
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:37,510
And this is the probability this this is a priority of testing the testing results.

317
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:44,650
So this is on singularities.

318
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:51,220
Okay. So here I'm going to put the probability of testing positive,

319
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:57,850
given that you have the disease and the probability of testing positive that you have the disease is one rate.

320
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:07,300
So therefore, the probability of testing negative, given that you have the disease to be zero in the in the other case,

321
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:20,230
the probability of testing positive given that you don't have the disease even that you will have the disease is .001.001.

322
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:29,350
And the probability that testing negative given that you don't have the disease is one minus that right.

323
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:35,140
So it is 1.00.

324
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:42,400
So this is what we call the accuracy of the past.

325
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:53,260
And the accuracy of the test or the accuracy of the information in general is independent on the prior probabilities of this day of nature.

326
00:49:53,260 --> 00:50:01,510
So it doesn't depend on how prevalent it is, what you are trying to forecast, how you know,

327
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:09,660
how how big is spread in the population where you want to go for your microphone, stop working.

328
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:29,149
If you just. Out of factories.

329
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:32,220
So you have to change that stereotype.

330
00:50:32,970 --> 00:51:19,230
Thank you. Okay.

331
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:25,340
Thank you. Right.

332
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:34,669
So these numbers are specific to the the information or the quality of the information.

333
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:45,180
So this is what we forget and they the false negative.

334
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:51,310
So this is the false negative. And these are going to be the false positive.

335
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:58,970
Right. So these numbers here. So for the perfect test, you have 1100.

336
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:08,059
So that will predict that's perfect information. So if you have whatever the test tells you, this is going to be the reality.

337
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:12,950
It's going to indicate with 100% accuracy what the reality is.

338
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,760
But in this case, the test is not perfect.

339
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:21,770
Catherine, I need a bit of an perfection here because he has, you know, false positives.

340
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:37,220
Right. So in the there is a chance that they test for a version that is non sync test, you know, appears to be lost.

341
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:51,350
Now what we want to know, what we want to know when we apply the these test is not this number,

342
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:58,070
but these number combined to their prior probabilities of if they don't and this is going to be here,

343
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,799
one in the one is not in things thousand or one -20,000.

344
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,460
Right. The probability of having the disease or not.

345
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:26,420
So if you want to. So what what I would like to do is find a table that will give me is the probability of disease condition.

346
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:40,780
Given. The testing results.

347
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:57,370
So in essence, I want to pass it first. And then, given what it has tells me, I want to figure out whether that person have the disease or not.

348
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:06,280
Here. These numbers are.

349
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:13,600
Did you take a look at these numbers?

350
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:22,770
You know, they they. You know, given that that person happily sees or not to have these numbers,

351
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:28,990
for example, he needs to they need to add up to one because this is a universe.

352
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:34,660
This is everything that's going to happen. Given that the person having these these isn't this positive or negative,

353
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:41,480
given that a person that doesn't have the sees, that person can test positive for doing it right.

354
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:46,209
In this case, these are the numbers in this table.

355
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:52,660
Most are one by columns because he even that you tested positive,

356
00:54:52,660 --> 00:55:00,160
you can either have diseases or not even that you've tested negative, you can either have the disease or not write these numbers.

357
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:07,100
That we have here trying to.

358
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:21,360
Make insert. I really.

359
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:41,730
Oh. Of these needs, which is one way in which the primary season is long.

360
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:52,210
These these two numbers is what we call the prior state of age.

361
00:55:54,660 --> 00:56:00,470
Who wants to higher probability of the state of.

362
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:58,880
I know what I want to do is apply the test, apply information, and then get what we call the posterior probabilities of this state of nature.

363
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:06,729
So before I I've got a person randomly on the street, I saw that person.

364
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:19,550
The prior probability is one in me, one in 10,001, 9999, you know, probability of not having the disease.

365
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:25,060
That's that's my prior. I applied that test and the test was positive.

366
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:34,629
Therefore now I think that that person, the probability of that person that would me is 9.09.

367
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:37,960
And what am I going to do with the probability that that person doesn't have the disease?

368
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:41,680
So those are called the posterior probabilities.

369
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:50,320
So you apply the test, you get information, you transform your prior probabilities into the probabilities of elimination.

370
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:58,030
After you get information, you know, you transform your prior probabilities into posterior probability.

371
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:08,650
So now we need, you know, we know how to transform the prior into the posterior probabilities like this frequency table.

372
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,880
But, you know, there's another way to do that.

373
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:23,130
And I don't want to know when I'll work out the the algebra totally.

374
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:26,500
But I'm going to give you the basic formulation.

375
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:43,960
So you'll see that the probability of the the probability of the having the having the disease.

376
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:49,300
He begins testing positive for.

377
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:59,840
Times the probability of testing positive.

378
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:30,120
This impulse is equal to.

379
00:59:46,720 --> 01:00:08,560
Is equal to the probability of testing positive given the having the disease times the probability this is the higher probability of right.

380
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:16,060
So these you and that's something that you learn in your probability class.

381
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:20,570
And what we want to know is, is this number.

382
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:25,690
What is the probability of having the disease given that you test positive?

383
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:32,530
So the reality of having the disease even that you positive.

384
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:46,900
Is equal to the probability of testing positive.

385
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:55,930
Even then, you have to concede the probability of having the disease.

386
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:02,750
Divided by the probability of testing positive.

387
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:10,380
Now take a look at that, at what was given to us.

388
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:17,700
So we have the probability of testing positive given the disease, right?

389
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:20,550
Probably testing positive given the disease is one.

390
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:29,870
And then we know what is the probability, the prior probability of having the disease, which is one in 10,000, 100,000, which is this.

391
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:35,310
So what what we don't know is the probability of testing positive.

392
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:41,370
Right. So we need to compute the probability of testing positive with the information that we have.

393
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,880
On the probability of testing positive.

394
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:58,110
It led to the probability of testing positive.

395
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:05,970
Given that you have the disease times, the probability of having disease is.

396
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:14,150
Was the preliminary testing positive?

397
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:27,110
Even then you don't have all disease, disease and the probability of not having diseases now with these.

398
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:41,000
And so this is, you know, another way that, you know, ways to do express the probability of testing positive based on conditional probabilities here.

399
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:51,579
So essentially, it's. We have all the ingredients to compute all the information, so we have the probability of testing positive.

400
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:59,600
Given that you have the disease that was given what we know, how the probability of the disease we have the probability of testing positive,

401
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:04,980
given that you don't have the disease, which is, you know, the testing positive.

402
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:15,670
You then have the disease. This is the here and ten times the probability of not having the disease, which is one minus, which is this number.

403
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:20,919
Right. And then we can compute the probability of testing positive.

404
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:25,180
And once we compute the provided the testing positive, we apply.

405
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:34,830
You know, this is formula. This formula is commonly known as the base for our Bayes theorem, if you want,

406
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:44,890
and then you flip the probability because that's that's what did what we did with this frequency table is applied based.

407
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:53,900
Theorem, you know, intuitively. So we had really made sense of what we weren't doing.

408
01:03:54,230 --> 01:04:05,870
And in this case, we applied the formula, you know, the probability formula that we learn and in your basic probability class.

409
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:09,520
But but they are, you know, they are quite simple, right.

410
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:18,560
So this is simply saying the probability of testing positive is I would do the by the probability of testing positive,

411
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:24,580
by the probability of testing positive, given that I have these times,

412
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:33,380
the probability of having explored the probability of testing positive, given that you have the disease that I'm supposed to be having the disease,

413
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:38,120
and I can add those probabilities because those are mutually exclusive events.

414
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:44,480
Right. So this is an event in which I, I have the disease.

415
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,780
This is the event in which I don't have the disease.

416
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:53,210
Those are the injuries. And that's why, you know, I can add the probabilities that I have things.

417
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:57,430
I have the information to compute these numbers.

418
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:01,339
And then after that I apply Bayes theorem.

419
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:06,920
And Bayes theorem is simply telling me the date.

420
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:13,520
The probability of the disease, given that it's positive,

421
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:21,230
is the probability of testing positive given the disease and the probability of ABC divided by the probability of best impossible.

422
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:26,630
And the reason is because these equation is true, right?

423
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:37,700
This equation just tells you is an expression of the the joint probability of having the disease.

424
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:42,770
And that's important. It can be expressed this way or it can be expressed this way.

425
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:50,780
I use the joint probability of testing positive disease, and you can convince yourself that.

426
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,129
That's right. We can do that in the next class. I can go on.

427
01:05:55,130 --> 01:06:01,250
We can just tell you with a frequency table why these numbers, why these expression is right,

428
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:06,110
and then you solve for the probability of the disease testing positive.

429
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:17,080
Now, I. I don't need for you to remember all these formula, you know, like I've done.

430
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:23,030
I mean, you should know from your probability class, but in order to implement these formula,

431
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:28,310
we are going to implement that in a linear, easier manner.

432
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:35,090
And. You.

433
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:48,750
Please. Right.

434
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:55,770
Do you use permanent marker? The permanent marker?

435
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,820
I think so. I think we use you drew an excel for the black.

436
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:04,000
Yeah, I know. I mean, we excel here, you know?

437
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:32,040
Right. It's.

438
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:56,550
So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to compute what is the what what's the probability of testing positive?

439
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:03,540
What is the probability of testing? The probability of testing positive about you tested negative on the moon.

440
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:07,150
Compute these probabilities right here.

441
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:16,060
So the probability testing positive, I'm going to place that probability here and the probability of this being negative,

442
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:19,780
I'm going to claim that probability here. Right. And then.

443
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:24,970
So if you remember that probability of.

444
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:45,000
Just if you remember, the probability of testing positive is going to be the probability of testing positive.

445
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:51,930
Given that I have the disease times the probability of having the disease plus the probability of testing positive.

446
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:56,070
Given that I don't have the disease times the probability of having a disease.

447
01:08:56,340 --> 01:09:05,640
So essentially, is it some problem of these proprietary probabilities at these conditional probabilities of accuracy?

448
01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:09,270
And therefore, I can simply.

449
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:31,260
This is its own problem. It's just a better way to play, so we don't get confused.

450
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:35,180
This is a probability of testing positive.

451
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:44,380
So on the basis of probability, there's two negative.

452
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:54,540
And this is simply its own problem.

453
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:07,120
Oh, my lovely ladies of the Beat of Nature and those are great blue.

454
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:16,040
And for that and then times the conditional probabilities of anything positive given that I have the disease or testing positive,

455
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:20,420
given they that not have the disease. Right. And then those are here.

456
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:32,000
In business. So it tells me that the probability of it is.

457
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:55,640
You. But even more of this email.

458
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:11,570
So what I have is 100114 the probability of testing positive I'm 199894 the probability of testing negative right at the.

459
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:26,480
And now what I would like to do is now that I have these these these probability that the probability of testing positive or negative,

460
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:36,770
then I come up, I can apply base theory. And it does mean, for example, a theory that the probability of testing of having the disease,

461
01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:43,370
given that this positive is the probability of having tested positive,

462
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:49,850
given that I have the disease times, the probability of having the disease divided by the probability of testing positive.

463
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:57,380
So that's what we did with phase three. So this is what I'm going to do now.

464
01:11:58,370 --> 01:12:12,260
I'm going to create a table that is going to transform those prior probabilities 10.00 1.99 into posterior probabilities.

465
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:16,070
What happens if you test positive? What happened to you was negative?

466
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:20,760
So this is going to be equal to the.

467
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:34,979
Reversed. And we call that a flip probability or reverse probability or the probability of testing positive or negative gearing.

468
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:37,950
That usually happens in certain times.

469
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:49,200
The probability of the state of nature and in this case is going to be the probability of things of having X and I.

470
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:57,570
When I copy this formula, I want a formula to state in in that column the right.

471
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:06,290
So I'm going to anchor on the column the. And then I'm going to divide that.

472
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:16,840
So. To seem.

473
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:29,830
There's probably lead times. If we didn't feel this theorem being true, then I am for those things going on.

474
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:35,680
And then by that time, the government has imposed.

475
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:44,860
So it's interesting because it is one and I want to anchor row 14.

476
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,720
So to.

477
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:55,520
Then I have these remember that 9% is here.

478
01:13:55,940 --> 01:14:05,450
So I'm going to get this table in percentage to format sales and percentage.

479
01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:10,640
With me, they can copy this formula.

480
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:20,870
And so if you remember, this formula needs to add up to one.

481
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:32,030
Very right. So the probability of testing positive I'm sorry, the probability of having the disease, given that you've test positive, is 9%.

482
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:38,900
The probability of not having the disease, even if this positive is 90.91%,

483
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:43,970
the probability of of having the disease, given that you test negative is zero.

484
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:54,320
Right. Because everybody who is have the test positive and the probability of not having the disease given that this negative is 100%.

485
01:14:56,090 --> 01:15:01,390
So that's your and those are the stadium probabilities.

486
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:05,750
So here we have two sets of posterior probability.

487
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:08,750
This is one set of material for what we needed.

488
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:17,570
It said number one, and this is another set of two posterior probability said number two.

489
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:29,420
So you start the process believing that these are your probabilities of the of having, you know, getting a person with the disease or not.

490
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:32,989
But you take that person and that person is positive.

491
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:43,880
Then your prior probabilities came to this. So now you don't think they are one in one in one in 10,004?

492
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:52,850
In 1999. All right. You think that those proteins are 9% and 90.9%?

493
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:57,260
99.9 at 90.9% right now.

494
01:15:57,290 --> 01:16:04,010
But if that person test negative, then you know that that person doesn't have the disease.

495
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:09,350
And the probability of not having the disease is 100% the Broadway musical.

496
01:16:09,710 --> 01:16:19,490
So you transform you you trade, you change this prion protein into this set of, you know, what speed of problem.

497
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:30,080
So these are all these tools that sent number one and said, number two, posterior probabilities of this data which.

498
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:48,240
Yeah. All right.

499
01:16:48,520 --> 01:17:01,030
So we had this this is you know, this is important because we're going to use Bayes Theorem a lot to flip these probabilities.

500
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:10,299
You can convince yourself that what you're doing is right, but always you can do the frequency table.

501
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:18,160
But this is much more straightforward. And, you know, you convince yourself that the argument is right.

502
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:21,700
I'm going to do a quick five minute presentation.

503
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:27,640
You know why Bayes Theorem or Bayes formula works is right.

504
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:31,090
And next time and then we'll continue.

505
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:47,230
Now we're going to use these notion that that we have about how to use information to improve our ability to in our knowledge of the state of nature.

506
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:56,440
I use that in the decision tree, so never wait how valuable that information is through up to the next time we are

507
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:05,769
going to continue working with these know any likely that we will be doing his

508
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:12,309
homework overseas by that time and then then we'll start to putting everything together

509
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:25,390
in decision tree lets you go and you really use Bayes theorem from your itself,

510
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:40,300
which is what you have to.
