1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,880
I had a brain injury. I can feel like anything.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,489
Sure. Yeah. You're up first. Are you ready? Okay, so we did it.

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,790
20 people filled out the evaluation, so we have treats.

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,180
We'll do them at the break. You ready?

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:29,380
Okay. Every time I. That one.

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,980
All right. All right.

7
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,780
Hi, everyone. My name is Surya,

8
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:50,970
and today I'm going to be presenting a two state comparative study on the health care seeking behaviors of the next residents during COVID 19.

9
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,860
So this is a brief agenda of what I'll be going over today.

10
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,460
I'm going to start with a background impact of COVID 19 and what next.

11
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,830
We're going to do a comparison between New Mexico and Arizona and the immigration policies.

12
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:12,630
My Aims and hypotheses. The study design a timeline of the study, my strengths, limitations, and lastly, the protection of human subjects.

13
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:21,380
So first I want to start off with the term one. So next, the term used for individuals who have roots in Latin America.

14
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:26,090
However, in many papers and literature, the term Latin also includes those who identify as Hispanic.

15
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,430
Now there are many people who identify as both Latin and Hispanic and people who identify as either or.

16
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:37,880
But that is something to be aware of throughout this presentation that it is interchangeable sometimes in papers.

17
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,790
And also, I do want to point out that Latin X is an anglicized term and not everyone identifies as that.

18
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,220
So for the study I'll be using Latin X just because that's what we use in literature.

19
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,960
But for the study, when we're talking with participants, we're going to ask them what they identify as.

20
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:03,030
So first, we're going to start off with the next community. Here's a little map of the countries that include that.

21
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:11,460
So that next community makes up 18% of the US population and that's even higher among those individuals that are under the age of 18, which is 25.7.

22
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:17,340
And that makes them the second biggest ethnic ethnic group after non-Hispanic whites in the United States.

23
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:25,530
They also make up a larger percent of the workforce at 68.3% than not not mix whites, which is 63.6%.

24
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,920
And also they have paid over $3 billion in taxes, including nearly 2 billion in federal taxes,

25
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:38,040
federal income taxes, and as well as a little over 1 billion in state and local taxes.

26
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:44,370
And I just mention that because they are a big contributor to the U.S. economy and our culture.

27
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,650
But I also do want to point out that the value of a community should not be based solely on their contribution to our economy.

28
00:02:51,690 --> 00:03:00,989
So the impact of COVID 19 on the next committee, as I mentioned before, the Latin X community makes up 18% of the United States population.

29
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,830
However, they were nearly 25% of COVID 19 cases in the US.

30
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:11,250
And there is multiple reasons for that, including reduced access to health care, living in larger households,

31
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,650
and a lot of them worked in service based industries that were deemed essential during the pandemic.

32
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:22,440
So every time they went to work, they were at risk. And these high trends in cases aren't just with COVID.

33
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:28,620
In fact, there are similar trends seen with the H1N1 flu virus in 2009 among the Latinx community.

34
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,430
So, as I mentioned, reduced access to care is a big reason as to why COVID 19 cases are so high.

35
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:41,460
And one big factor that plays into that is immigration policies and more specifically, anti-immigration policies.

36
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:47,250
Anti-immigration policies lead to anti-immigration rhetoric, which widely targets the Latino community.

37
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,480
There's been an association between worse mental health outcomes and increase in

38
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,500
arrest rates following announcements of several restrictive immigration policies.

39
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:04,680
There's also a study done that said that living in a community that ICE targets can also increase risk of poor physical and mental health.

40
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,439
So these policies create a sense of fear and non belonging in the communities that

41
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:16,070
these next members reside in and also leads to immigrants and mixed family mix.

42
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,780
That is, families are less willing to access health care.

43
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:27,020
So for my city, I'm going to be specifically looking at these two states, Arizona and New Mexico.

44
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,830
They are neighbors and they're also relatively the same distance from the US-Mexico border.

45
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:42,650
And Arizona is known to have pretty restrictive immigration policies that make their Latinx community members feel very isolated and targeted.

46
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,839
I listed for them and for time's sake, I want to go over all of them.

47
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:56,180
But I will point out a few, including Prop 300, which prevents people without proof of immigration status from applying for state funded services,

48
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:02,210
among other measures, as well as the notorious Senate Bill 1070,

49
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:07,999
which mandates that immigrants care proof of their legal status and law enforcement officers

50
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,460
can demand to see those papers if they're suspicious of a person being undocumented.

51
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,150
And New Mexico, on the other hand, has pretty inclusive policies that make their residents feel very included.

52
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,990
And they offer a lot of government services and resources for them.

53
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,800
One of them being House Bill 173, which allows all residents,

54
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:34,550
regardless of immigration status, to obtain a driver's license, as well as Senate Bill 582,

55
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:40,760
which forbids law law enforcement officers from asking criminals about their immigration status

56
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:47,360
and also extends to all immigrants in-state tuition funding for public colleges and universities,

57
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,530
and also prohibits discrimination in admission based on immigration status.

58
00:05:53,830 --> 00:06:00,879
So my aims for the study are to conduct a two state comparative study with New Mexico and Arizona that will determine if seeking

59
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,700
health care is associated with the type of immigration policies passed in those states restrictive policies or inclusive policies.

60
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,800
And if that association is explained by the amount of anti-immigration rhetoric caused by the policies.

61
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:20,159
And for this hypothesis, we hypothesize that the next community members are more likely to seek health care

62
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,480
during COVID 19 and New Mexico because they have more inclusive immigration policies.

63
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,460
And we further hypothesize that these inclusive policies lead to less anti-immigration rhetoric.

64
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:41,320
So this is a brief conceptual model. My exposure is immigration policy as my outcome is health care seeking behaviors.

65
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:49,540
Anti immigration rhetoric is in fact modifier. And we're controlling for age, sex and socio economic status.

66
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:58,280
So my study is going to be a qualitative survey and we're going to be using a convenient sampling.

67
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:04,250
We're going to the study is going to take place in Frederick Qualified Health Centers,

68
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,450
one in Las Cruces, New Mexico, and the other in Tucson, Arizona.

69
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:15,860
We're hoping to get 500 self-identified Latin ex participants from each of which C, which is a little high.

70
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:21,559
But since the qualitative survey, I thought that would help with some of our results and also for recruitment.

71
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:28,820
We're going to be advertising the study at different agencies and health centers in the cities, as well as community centers and churches.

72
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,070
So these are my survey questions. So can we have workers at work at those?

73
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,640
These will be trained to administer these surveys.

74
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,750
They'll be done over the phone with participants who want to participate.

75
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:49,740
The survey can be categorized into four different sections, the first being the perception of immigration policies.

76
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,910
The second with their experiences with the anti-immigration rhetoric.

77
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,910
Next, with their trust in the public health care system.

78
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:03,570
And Massey, we're going to ask how often they went to see a health care provider or use health care services during COVID when needed to.

79
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:10,770
And this is not just for COVID related symptoms. It could have been for any kind of health care concern or health concern.

80
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:22,220
So for the analysis, because it is a qualitative data, we're going to use content analysis to identify different trends and patterns.

81
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:29,480
So as I mentioned, the survey is divided into four sections. The first three mentioned are going to be using exposures and a model.

82
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:34,820
And again, those were immigration policies, anti immigration rhetoric and trust in the public health care system.

83
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:42,130
The survey team will develop a key to it four words terms and phrases to indicate if each variable has a positive,

84
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,960
negative or a neutral effect on health care seeking behaviors.

85
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:52,040
B Positive responses will be coded as three neutral responses recorded as a two, and negative response will be coded as a one.

86
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,090
And these CO two variables we placed in a logistic regression model for analysis.

87
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:06,280
So this is going to be the timeline of the study. IRP approval and recruitment of refugees in Arizona, New Mexico.

88
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:10,930
I'm assuming will take about six months and then praying the survey and administering it

89
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,180
or creating a survey entry in the South to administer it will take about two months.

90
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,440
And then conducting the survey and recruiting the patient take about six months.

91
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,530
And lastly, analyzing the responses will take about six months.

92
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,209
So strengths and weaknesses. So this is going to be a comparative study.

93
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:36,650
So it offers a good setting for two states that have different and seemingly opposing immigration policies.

94
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:44,360
And also this will be a qualitative analysis to allow a few individuals to speak about their experiences in their own words.

95
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,780
And the limitations are that it's a cross-sectional study,

96
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:53,930
so we won't be able to assume any causal relations between immigration policies and health care seeking behaviors.

97
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:59,300
And also, we can't make as Asians from the results because we use a convenient sampling.

98
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:06,410
And lastly, recall bias because we are asking individuals to remember how often they went or were

99
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:12,379
seeking health care in the past two and a half years since the pandemic and last year,

100
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:18,620
with the protection of human subjects, we're all going to be getting IAB approval before the survey will get written consent from the participants.

101
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:24,889
And although surveys usually have low risk for participants because this kind of topics can be quite tricky,

102
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,850
we will offer resources and counselors for individuals who require it.

103
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:36,720
And that's. Finished a better.

104
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:43,500
I also did want to quickly add in the past few days, Arizona did pass a bill that allowed Dreamers in-state tuition.

105
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:48,690
So good stuff. Yes. Any questions?

106
00:10:53,180 --> 00:11:04,520
Yes. Do you think that there might be a difference in the neighbors during COVID because are so in your face versus seeking preventative care action?

107
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,850
I just wonder if people's sense of is is getting used to be like really frightening and really severe that people

108
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:18,110
would be more inclined to go seek out here versus your in your checkup that you often don't do in general,

109
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:25,250
but especially on maybe that. Yeah. So the reason I chose Colbert was because around the time of COVID or since 2016,

110
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,620
there's been a rise in anti Latinx rhetoric and anti-immigration rhetoric.

111
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,400
So that is a big reason as to why people are hesitant to seek health care.

112
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,330
And I thought COVID was a good point to look at.

113
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,829
So that's the reason I did that.

114
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:49,510
But again, a lot of them did have like service jobs during it and they weren't jobs that you could just stop or like go online.

115
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,070
So I feel like there also an incentive to continue working. Any other questions?

116
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,970
Or either one of you. I was afraid you could speak to why you decided to focus on that.

117
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:17,170
Yes. So, actually, over the summer, my internship, I wasn't actually working here in Detroit, and we did a study with what next to here?

118
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:23,769
So a lot of like next members use apparatuses for health care because they provide free clinics for

119
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:29,230
uninsured and underinsured and moderate like next community members tend to be uninsured or underinsured.

120
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:38,130
So that's why you. Um.

121
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,380
Mm hmm. I heard that my.

122
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:51,990
Depending on situation. Yes.

123
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,890
Yes. That was did a lot of thinking on that one. Is is something I was thinking about until like last night.

124
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:05,580
Let me go back. And this no means like a perfect way of analysis because it is a qualitative survey.

125
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:11,100
So what I was thinking is that like, for example, if we're looking at the perception of immigration policies,

126
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:17,640
if they answered, like has it affected their life and it hasn't affected them in a negative way?

127
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:24,720
If they say yes to that, then we're going to say that for that first variable, like it was negatively affecting their health seeking behaviors.

128
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:33,150
And so even if the answer to this was yeah, so even if they answer to any one of these questions that they were,

129
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:37,280
it negatively impacted them for that entire variable. I'm going to put it as negative.

130
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:44,570
Yeah. I just feel like I could. Yeah.

131
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,980
No, but also really important because these stories are not black and white.

132
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:55,530
So that's what we want to do, like an interview style qualitative survey instead of just like having them pick from like A, B and C.

133
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:11,629
Where are you? So I think you said that you were going to recruit from the health centers, but also from other locations.

134
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:19,730
Is that right? Yeah. But you're you're planning to administer the survey or the interview at the health center, right?

135
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,390
Well, it will be it can be health workers that work at the center,

136
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:27,500
but it'll be over the phone just because it might be a little bit easier than in-person interviews.

137
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:31,370
And just so like for transportation, if that's an issue or anything like that.

138
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:38,960
So like having fliers up in like all these so it can reach a wide audience and like centers and everything.

139
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,800
But there'll be one specific UHC that will be doing the actual interviews and everything.

140
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:51,290
I see. I was just wondering if you might have a group of people who are too nervous to seek health care

141
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:58,190
anywhere and that you might miss those if you didn't really think about how to identify those people.

142
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,919
Yeah, that's why I was hoping, like community centers and churches,

143
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:08,480
what kind of reach a wider audience who don't usually go to these and hopefully maybe like word of mouth or anything like that to.

144
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,540
One more. I was also.

145
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,460
Mm. That's actually a very good point.

146
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:27,580
Yeah. Thank you. Are. You.

147
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:46,780
About to die, apparently, on her inside.

148
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:17,230
Okay. So my presentation is on association between obstetrics abuse and plus pattern healing that is supposed to be depression on poor infant growth.

149
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,290
A retrospective longitudinal study in rural Ghana.

150
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:30,340
That is a mouthful, but bear with me. Okay. So obstetrics abuse is a form of abuse that is experienced by a person during labor or delivery.

151
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:36,700
In one of the first studies that was conducted looking at obstetrics abuse prevalence,

152
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:46,000
they identified that 83% of women in Ghana experience obstetrics abuse during labor and delivery.

153
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:50,920
And these are the three main highlights of the year result.

154
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,120
Let's get them. Depression is a type of depression that occurs after childbirth.

155
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:03,490
The first statistics is looking at a woman worldwide, and the success of this is looking at women specifically in Ghana.

156
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,970
And so as we can see, the prevalence is increasing.

157
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:13,240
One of the reasons why I chose this topic is because obstetrics abuse is it exists.

158
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:21,100
First of all, it exists very much, at least in the context of Ghana, to the point where it is perceived as normal.

159
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:30,489
But in terms of public health and human rights, we all know that it is not normal and it is important for us to look at of such abuse,

160
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:38,140
because this traumatic experience can impact or, you know, inflict on stressors and depression.

161
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:44,800
And if a mother is depressed and cannot attend to their baby, then their children are also affected.

162
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:51,460
And so my conception model for this project is looking at obstetrics abuse,

163
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,899
postpartum depression, support, infant growth of such is abuse is our exposure.

164
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,740
Postpartum depression is acting as a mediator.

165
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,760
An important thing to growth is our outcome.

166
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:10,030
Very simple, very, very basic, very straightforward. But a lot of things happen.

167
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:17,590
A lot of things happen in this, you know, very simple model that I presented to you.

168
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,930
So as you can see, there's a lot going on here.

169
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:26,530
You know, we have social supports, we have religion, we have marital status, we have this yes, we have education.

170
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:33,670
And all of these, you know, impact to the whole the whole relationship between ups such as abuse,

171
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:37,660
postpartum depression and eventually poor at youth and growth.

172
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:43,809
So the objective of my study is to better understand postpartum depression as a result

173
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:48,970
of obstetrics abuse and how that impacts children over a five year growth period.

174
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:57,190
And I hypothesize that maternal exposure to defined ups such as abuse and defined features of postpartum depression,

175
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,730
can result in observes observed impairment on infant growth.

176
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:06,280
My first aim is to look at the prevalence and the prevalence association between

177
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:13,510
maternal of sexual abuse and postpartum depression among women in terms of Ghana,

178
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,750
and then identify an association between maternal depression and.

179
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:28,510
To inform policy and interventions. So this is going to be a combination of retrospective and longitudinal study.

180
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:33,150
We are going to recruit women from health care facilities internally.

181
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:37,960
Approximately 150 women, because I'm envisioning this to be a pilot study.

182
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:45,760
Part of the eligibility criteria includes you need to be a resident of Tamara.

183
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:52,790
You need to be a pregnant woman, and you need to be within the reproductive age between 19 and 49.

184
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:57,520
Fortunately, if you do lose a baby, you are not qualified to participate in the study.

185
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:05,620
We're going to use interviews, in-depth interviews to screen for such as abuse victims and under of such as abuse.

186
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:10,600
We're going to look at physical abuse, which includes head and slapping, you know, pinching.

187
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,630
We're going to look at emotional abuse and verbal abuse.

188
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:20,050
We're going to use the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale to screen for postpartum and for infant growth.

189
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:23,840
We're going to concentrate on malnutrition and malnutrition.

190
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:29,350
These are the various criteria that we want to look at weight, height, nutrients and physical activities.

191
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:38,800
And those underneath us are the time points about how we are going to measure the various variables for malnutrition.

192
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,720
So this is this is Camile.

193
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:48,370
It is the capital city of the northern region, and it is a rural area.

194
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:55,749
So that is one of the reasons why I am focusing on that, because it gives us a lot of different cultural differences.

195
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:02,650
It gives us religion, gives us ethnicity. And so that is why all of that is part of my conceptual model, as you saw earlier.

196
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:08,770
So the interview, this is going to be kind of struggling to see how is it in English we're going to use SAS.

197
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,520
And those are the various statistical analysis that we're going to conduct.

198
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,940
Limitations. The eligibility criteria may lead to smaller sample size.

199
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:25,839
So as you saw earlier, my report, my eligibility criteria included people,

200
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:32,350
residents who live in family recruitment, what's going to be done in health care facilities internally,

201
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:44,410
and then reproductive age between 18 to 49 women in Mali tend to get get married earlier because they still we still do arranged marriages, sadly.

202
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:52,300
So, you know, 14, 15 young women are being married off in this year, married off early the next then is to get pregnant.

203
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:59,660
And so that might impact that might encourage a smaller sample size look can I just facilities mean so it's

204
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:07,900
a small sample size because some women give birth at home so that will exclude a good number of people.

205
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,700
And also just the fact that you need to be a resident in Mali.

206
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,850
It's not like United State where if you're a resident in Ann Arbor, you've been living in Ann Arbor for a while.

207
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:25,090
If you're resident similarly, you could be living in the Upper East Side, just living in town for a little bit or, you know, just because of work.

208
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:29,260
So you're living there for a little bit. So that may result in a small sample.

209
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:37,120
The Edinburgh postnatal depression scale. It's been used across a lot of post postpartum depression research.

210
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:45,910
It's at least the, the literature that I read that use this skill develop they got good results.

211
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:52,330
But one of the reasons why I it's a limitation is because it doesn't factor in the other social,

212
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:58,930
cultural, social, cultural identities of the population that I am looking at.

213
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:06,399
And a potential last follow up due to the longitudinal aspect of my study, you know, women could move away.

214
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:13,809
Some others may not be interested anymore. You know, unfortunately, infant mortality is pretty high in rural areas.

215
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,870
And in Ghana in general, maternal mortality is also pretty high.

216
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:24,850
So women may die and then, you know, very child might not be able to still participate or they can find themselves may die fortunately.

217
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:31,270
So this is the timeline of my project i IRB approval and training.

218
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:39,700
Hoping to take approximately a year, enrollment interviews and transcriptions will be six months tracking of infants.

219
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:45,370
Five years data analysis and manuscripts in production may take about a year.

220
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:55,630
And then for future studies, you know, just looking at the mental state of health care providers that indulge in this substance abuse is important,

221
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:59,590
among other, you know, responses for further research.

222
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:14,400
Thank you. I always.

223
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:35,740
So it's funny because it's not really. So specifically for this project, looking at professionals.

224
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:44,710
Yes. So I'm hoping to look at from antenatal care if they are receiving it until after

225
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,650
delivery and potentially may be either 32 days after I'm doing therapies here.

226
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,930
Yeah. You mentioned that this is a baby that.

227
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:09,980
I feel like. So that is that is hard.

228
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:19,430
But one of the reasons why that became my exclusion criteria is because my main outcome is looking out for an insane group.

229
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:27,590
So while if a if a woman does experience obstetrics abuse, they may encounter postpartum depression.

230
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:33,920
But then looking out there, how that postpartum depression impacted her, you know, they're infants.

231
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,800
If you don't have an infant, then. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

232
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:43,130
I want to jump off. But infant mortality, is there any.

233
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:51,569
Connection between. Potential infant mortality like out of the scope of your study.

234
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,750
But just thinking towards the future, is that something that people have looked at as well?

235
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,370
So that is something that I added to. Maybe not.

236
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:05,670
But that is something that, you know, like I did think about in terms of,

237
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:09,030
you know, like I said, you said you were supposed to get into infant mortality.

238
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:16,709
But with that, you you have to also consider that there's also a potential factor of maternal morbidity,

239
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,290
because it's not only the obstetrics abuse that is,

240
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:26,730
you know, impacting the depression, but, you know, like other health related consequences that might impact.

241
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:35,860
I wonder should. I didn't read that closely enough, but the infant malnutrition of delayed growth.

242
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:41,220
Yes. Could lead to yes. So that could be a long term yet it's a good thing.

243
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:44,380
But yeah, it's something that you could look at as the long term. Yeah, that's true.

244
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:52,200
Yeah. Thank you. There.

245
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,300
I explained it really well or everything just went through.

246
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,710
And that's okay. Yes, I sent for you.

247
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:10,660
Um, so you mentioned this in your presentation, but I was wondering how common homebirth does versus birth in, like, a medical facility?

248
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,620
Do you have a very common home? Birth? Yes. The parents are in a home.

249
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:23,800
Okay. So I was wondering about that and and why people might choose homebirth versus a hospital birth.

250
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:27,400
So. Or other health care facilities. Yeah.

251
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:31,640
So the problem about that is due to resources for one.

252
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:39,310
And also secondly, because of, like I said, um, such as abuse has gone to the point where it's seen as normal.

253
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:44,860
But then as time, you know, like as time goes on, people start to realize that it's not right.

254
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:50,049
But then also just thinking about the fact that you have a lot of stressors at home.

255
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:57,970
You know, you're you're a mom, you're the primary care giver, especially the area that I'm looking at.

256
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:02,500
You know, everything is on the mother. You know, she she takes care of the family.

257
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,490
She needs to go out to, you know, bring back food home.

258
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:10,149
And so it's sort of like they don't have time.

259
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:14,440
You know, if if my baby's ready to come, I might as well just do it at home, you know?

260
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:22,060
What's the point of going out to look for a taxi that may take you 131 hour, you know, to, you know, like to find one.

261
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,799
Or even if you go really, really deep into the rural areas, there's no taxis.

262
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,240
So they have to walk to the nearest clinic and not even a hospital and medical facility.

263
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:38,950
So it's like, you know, it's either if there is a community worker around, they can come home and deliver the baby.

264
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:46,029
But if it's not, then the grandma or whatever, whoever the oldest person is at home, you know, can just deliver the baby.

265
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:53,019
And then hopefully by the end, the taxi has come back, you know, a health care service.

266
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:57,549
So that is that is the norm. That is unfortunately, that is the norm.

267
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:02,080
But it's it's sort of like resources and transportation and and costs.

268
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:09,640
You know, it's it's not really it doesn't flow like how United States you really can sort of plan.

269
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:16,300
Just one last quick follow up on that. Do we know if there's less abuse in the, like, homebirth setting?

270
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:22,880
Oh, it's it's common. Yeah. So it's it's not about health for, you know, not about physicians versus midwives.

271
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,760
Yeah. Okay. And that's the thing, because in Ghana, we use midwives a lot.

272
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:35,560
So the midwives have the flexibility to actually go to the homes, to deliver the kids.

273
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:44,230
And so for the midwife, you know, it's like looking after maybe 60 people in this in this town because like I said,

274
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:48,940
they get married off early and so they started giving birth early.

275
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:55,929
And so if this woman has been giving, you know, like have been delivering babies from the same woman for like the sixth time,

276
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,020
you know, she's like, you know, like, you know what's going on.

277
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:04,150
You know, it's like, hurry up, you've done this. But it's it's time, you know, like, you know how to push your we have already been through it.

278
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,750
So, you know, hurry, hurry up. You know, I got other people to attend to.

279
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:15,700
So it's like so midwives aren't kinder and gentler than. Yeah, so thank you.

280
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:45,930
Thank you. Okay.

281
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,620
I'll do it. All right. Good morning, everyone.

282
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:55,879
The title of my presentation is Assessing Differences in Preterm Birth Odds among Black and White Women in Los Angeles,

283
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:03,110
California, after the Rodney King beating. So before I begin, I'd like to provide just a brief overview of the presentation.

284
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:12,330
It'll include background information, my aims and hypotheses, my conceptual model, the study design and methods limitations, and my proposed timeline.

285
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:23,610
So first, some historical context. On March 3rd, 1991, Rodney King, a black motorist, was beaten by LAPD officers after evading arrest.

286
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:31,080
The 15 minute beating was videotaped by a local resident, and video footage received both local and national attention.

287
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:39,090
On April 29th, 1992, the officers involved in the beating were acquitted, and shortly thereafter, the L.A. riots began.

288
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:47,130
The state of emergency was declared that same day. The following day, on April 30th, 1992, a curfew was imposed.

289
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,670
But by May 3rd, 1992, most of the rioting had ended.

290
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:59,190
So within that context, I'd like to discuss the correlation between police violence and adverse birth outcomes.

291
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:05,070
First, I'd like to note that black Americans are killed by the police and more than twice the rate of their white counterparts.

292
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,500
And this violence has both a physiological and psychological impact on their health and well-being.

293
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,570
It's associated with increased preterm birth risk, as well as pregnancy loss.

294
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,700
And a qualitative study found that it's a source of stress for pregnant black men.

295
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:28,470
So given that the literature indicates that there's an association between police violence exposure and preterm birth risk,

296
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:34,350
I wanted to look at the association between exposure to the Rodney King beating and preterm birth odds.

297
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,370
But before I get into my study, I'd like to just define a few terms.

298
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:45,090
So for starters, a preterm birth is defined as a birth that occurs at birth before 37 weeks gestation,

299
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:50,820
compared to a full term birth which occurs at or after 37 weeks gestation.

300
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:55,590
And as with police violence, there are racial disparities in preterm birth rates.

301
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:02,130
In 2019, black women had a preterm birth rate that was 50% higher than their white counterparts.

302
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:08,879
So my proposed study will utilize my proposed quasi experimental study.

303
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:17,190
Excuse me will utilize a difference in difference design to assess the difference in preterm birth odds between black and white women,

304
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:20,010
both an intra and interracial difference.

305
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:27,870
So I'm going to be comparing the preterm birth odds among black women who were pregnant in 1990 versus black women who are pregnant in 1991,

306
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:34,670
as well as a comparison between black women who are pregnant in 1991 and white women who were pregnant that same year.

307
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:45,659
My study has two aims. The first is to examine whether the odds of preterm birth were higher for black women who were pregnant in the

308
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:51,880
37 weeks after the beating than for black women who were pregnant during the same 37 calendar weeks in 1990.

309
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:57,780
The hypothesis being that black women who were pregnant in the 37 weeks after the beating had

310
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:02,250
a higher odds of preterm birth than black women who were pregnant during the same time period.

311
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:11,200
My second aim is to examine whether black women's odds of preterm birth in the 37 weeks

312
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,730
after the beating were higher than the odds for white women during that same time period.

313
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:20,259
The hypothesis being that black women who were pregnant in the 37 weeks after

314
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,160
the beating had a higher odds of preterm birth than their white counterparts.

315
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:33,180
This slide provides my conceptual model. My exposure is exposure to the Rodney King beating.

316
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,640
My outcome is preterm birth odds.

317
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:43,590
I included stress as a mediator because the literature indicates that exposure to police violence increases one's stress,

318
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:53,940
which could increase their risk or odds of preterm birth. I also included racial identity parity, marital status, maternal age, education,

319
00:34:54,330 --> 00:35:00,650
and neighborhood poverty level as risk factors, which is a literature indicates, are all risk factors for preterm birth.

320
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:09,729
So I intend to use data or birth certificate data excuse me,

321
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:16,300
provided by the California Department of Public Health to assess both intra interracial differences in preterm birth.

322
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:26,830
Black women who were pregnant in the 37 weeks after the beating from March 3rd, 1991, to November 17th, 1991 will be classified as exposed,

323
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:31,600
while black women who were pregnant in the same 37 week period, one year earlier,

324
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,180
March 3rd, 1990 to November 17th, 1998, will be classified as unexposed.

325
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:45,370
I intend to categorize infants who were gestational age at birth was less than 37 weeks as preterm,

326
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:51,790
and infants whose gestational age was greater than or equal to 37 weeks at birth as full term.

327
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:03,030
I also intend to use the same data source, the birth certificate data to assess intra racial differences in preterm birth odds.

328
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:11,070
Both black and white women who were pregnant in the 37 weeks after the beating from March 3rd, 1991, to November 17,

329
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:20,200
1991 will be classified as exposed, and I'll use the same categories for preterm and full term based on their infants gestational age before.

330
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:29,510
So because I'm looking at preterm birth adds, a main form of analysis would be a logistic regression.

331
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:34,070
So to assess the intra racial difference in preterm birth odds,

332
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:39,320
I'm going to look at the unadjusted association between exposure to the bleeding and my outcome of interest.

333
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:43,460
And then to look at the interracial difference in preterm birth odds,

334
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:48,050
I'm going to look at the interaction between racial identity and exposure to the beta.

335
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:55,670
I also intend to adjust for the risk factors for preterm birth that I discussed and described in the conceptual model.

336
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:00,770
And finally, I'm going to look at trimester of pregnancy as an effect modifier,

337
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:05,749
as the literature indicates that the association between police violence and preterm

338
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:11,479
birth odds of preterm birth risk is dependent upon or depends on or excuse me,

339
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,890
the strength between the association, between my exposure and outcome depends on trimester of exposure.

340
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,880
The study will inevitably have some limitations.

341
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:29,510
For starters, the literature indicates that there are persistent errors in reports of gestational age.

342
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:35,209
So some of the infants who were full term may have been misclassified as preterm and vice versa.

343
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:43,310
So that could come into play. Additionally, unexposed black women could have been exposed to other incidents of police violence during 1919.

344
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:51,260
Police violence is rather ubiquitous and so it's quite possible that their odds of preterm birth could be similar to exposed weapons.

345
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:58,099
Thirdly, the literature indicates that police violence has a cumulative impact on the health of black Americans.

346
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:04,700
It takes a toll. So even if I see higher odds of preterm births among exposed black women,

347
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,200
it might be difficult to completely conclude that exposure to the beating of

348
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,740
Rodney King was solely responsible for their higher odds of preterm birth.

349
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:17,390
Given that they may have been exposed to other forms of police violence over the course of their lives

350
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:24,110
and finally exposed black women were also exposed to other forms of violence during this period.

351
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:31,430
Less than two weeks after Rodney King was beaten, Latasha Harlins, a black teenager, was shot and killed by a local store owner.

352
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:39,910
So the literature indicates also that highly public anti-black violence is associated with increased preterm birth violence.

353
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:49,910
And so it's quite possible that even if these women have higher odds of preterm birth, it could be associated both with the beating of Rodney King,

354
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:54,650
as well as the cost of violence as murder and other forms of violence over the course of 1991.

355
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,770
Okay. Finally, we have my proposed timeline.

356
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:05,010
So this study is estimated to take about five years.

357
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:14,100
In the first year, I'll conduct my preliminary work submitting my protocol prior to approval, submitting my research application to the CDP,

358
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:21,330
to the Center for Health Statistics, Informatics, recruiting and hiring analysts and other personnel and completing personnel training.

359
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:29,760
I also intend to develop my data collection instrument. During this time, I will start collecting the birth certificate data.

360
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:35,490
We'll start with the preliminary analysis of the descriptive statistics and the logistic regression analysis.

361
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,000
In the third year, we'll continue the work that we started in year two,

362
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:44,729
and by the fourth year we intend to complete data analysis to begin with the manuscript so that

363
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:49,140
by the fifth and final year we can finalize the manuscript and submitted for publication.

364
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:55,910
And finally, here are my references. Thank you for your time.

365
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:07,710
So questions come. Yes.

366
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,360
This was really, really cool. Thank you.

367
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:23,460
I was wondering why. Yeah, that's a very good question.

368
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:29,910
So what I found in literature was a lot of people were writing about the murder of Michael Brown or Trayvon Martin or George Floyd.

369
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,880
I really wasn't finding a lot about Rodney King.

370
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:38,510
And I was thinking, particularly for my parents generation, that was something that was there, George Floyd.

371
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,910
And so I wanted to look at what it did to women who were pregnant around the same time that maybe my mom would have been pregnant.

372
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,670
So, yeah, I think the question. Yeah.

373
00:40:50,650 --> 00:41:09,520
I mean, I also. It would be worse if you had to look into an interest over time to see that something like George Floyd would be like, Oh, soda.

374
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:14,080
Similar changes. Also.

375
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:21,320
I think it's a very. Yes.

376
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:24,810
Very simple media. But yes.

377
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:38,590
Okay. So this was it hadn't really changed the county because I was wondering if it was the city.

378
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:47,270
Farther out. And continue on with both of your points.

379
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:52,759
So part of the reason my also chose to do this because a lot of killings have received attention,

380
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,710
but I wanted to look at an incident where the person survived and what did that do to the community?

381
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:05,750
Because we're often looking at what happens after the person is. Yes.

382
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:21,410
And then. Yeah. Oh, that's a very good question.

383
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,490
So one thing that I did talk about that my paper was that I'd select only single converts.

384
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:30,740
Given that multiple pregnancies are women who are pregnant with twins or triplets, they have a higher risk of preterm birth.

385
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:37,460
I hadn't really considered making any exclusion or inclusion criteria based on whether it was their second or third child.

386
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,320
But that is something to consider in the analysis. Thank you for bringing that up. I appreciate.

387
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:42,650
Yes.

388
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:52,160
I wondered if you had considered any other prenatal points like gestational age was a great one, but I think it would be a really interesting one.

389
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,290
Babies born 38 weeks. Still standing.

390
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:02,060
They don't eat right. So that could be another thing to think about.

391
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,870
Even if they were born at a regular age, they could still experience.

392
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:11,200
Show signs of different types of stressors that would have happened in it was just not manifesting at their gestational age.

393
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:12,400
That's a very different thing.

394
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:18,790
When Dr. Needham and I met with her during office hours, one of the studies that I was looking at was the Novak et al study,

395
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:22,980
which looked at gestational weeks after the preschool raid.

396
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:33,360
So that's a very good thing to consider. Thank you. I appreciate it. Yes.

397
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:37,520
Well, I have to actually. We have a minute and 28 seconds, so maybe.

398
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:47,400
Yeah, no problem. First. Do you think there could have been effects on births outside of California or do you think it was concentrated in California?

399
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:52,739
I certainly think that there could have been effects outside, given that especially I mean, granted,

400
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:56,729
it didn't receive it wasn't on social media, but it did receive both national and local attention.

401
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,860
So I think that definitely could have been the case.

402
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:05,340
But I really wanted to look specifically within L.A. I think those effects would have been magnified just by the proximity.

403
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:16,790
Yeah, in some ways I think like everybody knew about the cycle time because people watched national news and it was on it was on national news a lot.

404
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,270
And so it's I actually think is really interesting to look at this and see how this might

405
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:27,690
be different than more recent things where there's like a more fractured media landscape.

406
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:32,740
So I think this is a really important example to look at.

407
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:37,770
And then my last question was, you said you would look at effects modification by trimester.

408
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:48,450
Do you have any hypotheses about which trimester would show the strongest or when exposure would matter most in terms of the first trimester?

409
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:54,000
Sure. So one of the studies I was looking at, they found a stronger association during the first trimester of pregnancy,

410
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,770
which is to be expected, given that that's a critical period of in utero development.

411
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:00,390
That's when miscarriages might occur.

412
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:08,040
I think, if I'm not mistaken, the authors also noticed a stronger association around the six month mark, which I was slightly surprised by.

413
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:12,460
So either sometime between the first two trimester of pregnancy and probably.

414
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:15,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. Thank.

415
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,240
Okay. I don't know how to make that in presentation.

416
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:42,550
Oh, I finally. Good morning, everyone.

417
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:50,040
My name is Michael O'Connor, and today I will be discussing the effects of racial residential segregation on asthma outcomes of black children.

418
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,190
During my presentation, I will have a quick two question poll, so please have your devices out and ready.

419
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:07,760
Here is what I will be discussing today. Asthma is a chronic lung disease characterized by inflammation of the respiratory airways.

420
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:14,990
In 2020, it was estimated that over 4 million American children under age 18 had current asthma.

421
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:24,980
And that number is steadily increasing. Approximately one in every two children with asthma have had children have had one or more asthma attacks.

422
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:31,760
This is particularly alarming because asthma can cause permanent lung damage in children over the lifespan.

423
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:42,050
In addition to the negative quality of life impacts, asthma complications cost the U.S. economy more than $80 billion annually.

424
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:47,900
When considering days missed from school and work, medical expenses and deaths.

425
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:59,200
It's now time for our poll. Please visit poll everywhere dot com slash mikhaila connor 865.

426
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:04,780
Or text mikayla connor eight six, five, two, two, two, three, three, three.

427
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:08,260
To join then vote on the following question.

428
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:13,080
Which American city? I'm so sorry I was up.

429
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:19,389
I'm not sure what's going on. Yeah, maybe.

430
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:23,350
So. That was on display. Here, we'll pass the timer.

431
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:28,500
Okay. I'm sorry about that. I tested this. Yeah, there we go.

432
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:32,020
So I think it was just a matter of refreshing it. Thanks, everyone.

433
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:36,220
So show us where to go to the. You are all for the.

434
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:42,790
It should show that. Oh, there's a QR code.

435
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:47,950
Okay, I'm going to try it one more time. Okay. Is it working?

436
00:47:56,630 --> 00:48:00,620
Okay. Well, why don't you have us vote by hand?

437
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:03,700
Yeah, let's try that. Let's do the manual.

438
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,980
I'm sorry, everyone. I'm not sure why this is not working.

439
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:11,630
Because technology never. Technology does not want to work today for whatever reason.

440
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:16,760
Oh, it looks like some folks have been able to vote. I'm not sure why it's working for some and not others.

441
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:28,010
Um. Okay, so here's the question. By a show of hands, how many of you think that a Philadelphia has the highest prevalence of asthma?

442
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:31,400
Anyone? No takers. What about Detroit, Michigan?

443
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,140
There's a lot of history that anyone forsee. Oakland, California.

444
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:41,450
Okay. Miami, Florida. And even New York.

445
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,310
So it seems like it's kind of evenly split between New York and Detroit.

446
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:51,170
Actually, the correct answer here is Detroit. Michigan has the highest prevalence of asthma.

447
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,580
So once again, technology is not working. But here's my second question for you all.

448
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,560
Which American city is the most segregated? So we have the same options here.

449
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:05,150
How many takers do we have for, a, Philadelphia? B, Detroit, Michigan.

450
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:15,440
Okay, that's majority of the room, so let's just stop there. Detroit is actually the correct answer again there with the highest level of segregation.

451
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:20,870
So that ends our poll and three technology dilemma.

452
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:27,020
So thanks, everyone, for getting through that with me. Now we're going to talk about why Detroit is so significant.

453
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:32,150
So we've discussed that Detroit has the highest prevalence of asthma and is the most segregated city in the United States.

454
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:34,870
Let's talk about why those factors are significant.

455
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:41,950
So the mortality rate of Detroit is more than three times higher than the national average in Detroit.

456
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,950
Asthma related deaths have steadily increased over the past five years.

457
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:53,600
In the city was recently denoted as the number one asthma capital of the United States when compared to other cities in the state of Michigan.

458
00:49:53,900 --> 00:50:01,129
Detroit Asthma Outcomes Very Much Worse. Asthma prevalence among children is 74% higher than the state in child.

459
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:04,340
Asthma related hospitalization is two times the state average.

460
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,579
Now you know a bit more about asthma outcomes in Detroit. You may be asking yourself,

461
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:17,160
how does this relate to the initial question I posed regarding the fact that Detroit is the most segregated city in America.

462
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,600
So a picture is worth a thousand words. So let's examine this first picture.

463
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:26,160
It's clear that everyone does not have the same opportunities to lead a healthy lifestyle.

464
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:33,450
As you can see, some differences between the residential and segregated areas include access to sidewalks,

465
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:36,720
reliable public transportation, green spaces and more.

466
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:44,280
The city of Detroit was a victim to racial residential segregation and looks very similar to the residential city on the left.

467
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:50,280
The city of racial residential segregation can be best understood by examining the next photo.

468
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:57,510
So the New Deal of 1930 388, the intentional segregation of black and white neighborhoods in America,

469
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:02,670
inner city neighborhoods primarily inhabited by black and immigrant families,

470
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:09,420
were indicated as hazardous and outlined in red in a concept known as redlining by the Homeowners Loan Association,

471
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,030
by the Homeowners Known Corporation H, LLC.

472
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:18,540
Predominantly white areas were deemed lower risk, outlying and green, and possessed higher property values.

473
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:26,220
Subsequent policies, such as the placement of schools, highways and toxic hazard sites, mirrored redlining practices.

474
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:33,000
So as you can see in this final photo, although these practices are no longer taking place,

475
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:39,630
their legacy remains and previously redlined areas are still highly populated by African-American and minority groups.

476
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:50,900
So now let's discuss the aims of our study. Since Holland, Michigan is a city characterized with a low level of segregation.

477
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:57,620
We would first like to compare the effects of racial residential segregation and asthma outcomes of Detroit in Holland.

478
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:03,710
Next, we aim to describe the perceived quality of life impacts on children and caregivers from both cities.

479
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:11,300
We hypothesize that Detroiters will have worse asthma outcomes and perceived quality of health impacts than Holland residents.

480
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:19,620
For our first aim, we intend to use an ecologic study design examining data from local hospitals in both

481
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:25,260
Detroit and Holland that details current asthma prevalence of children under age 18.

482
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:34,350
This data will include covariates such as race and sex. For our second aim, we will use a cross-sectional mixed methods study design,

483
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:40,230
employing community based participatory research principles to further understand the burden of asthma on families.

484
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:48,140
We will recruit 400 families, 200 from each city for the purposes of our study.

485
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:51,530
A family unit will be defined as at least one caregiver and one child.

486
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:56,660
We aim to have equitable distribution of race and sex among child participants.

487
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:03,080
Eligibility criteria includes the child having current asthma and no other chronic health conditions.

488
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:09,410
In addition to collecting quantitative data surrounding race, sex and socioeconomic status.

489
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:16,090
Caregivers will be administered the Pediatric Asthma Caregivers Quality of Life Questionnaire P.

490
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,790
AC, q. L. Q and to elevate youth voice.

491
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:24,050
Children will be administered the Childhood Asthma Questionnaire, the IQ.

492
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:29,240
On the right, you will observe a sample question from the C IQ.

493
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:34,640
There are three versions of the questionnaire, and they're optimized for age specific relevancy.

494
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:41,479
Both questionnaires are validated. And how do you need evaluation skills for qualitative analysis?

495
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:49,760
We will provide a short answer section where caregivers and children alike can describe the challenges asthma poses to their quality of life.

496
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:56,150
Surveys will be administered via Qualtrics, and families will be encouraged to skip questions that they find unsettling.

497
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:05,570
Our team will work with residents to generate short answer questions relevant to each city's respective unique circumstances.

498
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:11,590
In an effort to empower the voice of those who know most about the issue, the community members.

499
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:17,959
Our team will use the data to generate a single by multivariate analysis to gain a holistic view

500
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:22,790
of the impact of variables influencing the experiences of family of children living with asthma.

501
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:29,350
Here's my conceptual model with the exposure of racial residential segregation

502
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:34,329
resulting in adverse childhood health outcomes and potentially compounded by sex,

503
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:42,570
race and socioeconomic status. So here's the timeline of our data collection process.

504
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:48,360
It will follow a four year plan that simultaneously carries out both ecologic and cross-sectional study.

505
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:52,650
So in year one, we'll do the recruitment process and hospital data collection.

506
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,900
Year two, administering our survey and collecting responses and begin analysis of our ecologic data.

507
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:05,910
Your three analyze data and draw conclusions, and then with your four, we're going to begin curating ideas for potential end of IT interventions.

508
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:14,120
Once again, utilizing those BPR principles. So here are some strengths and limitations of my study.

509
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:22,910
So first novelty. There are very few studies that have described the scope of racial residential segregation and its effects on health.

510
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:29,600
Youth Voice So we believe that elevating Youth Voice provides a holistic outlook of childhood asthma.

511
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:39,440
Utilizing CBR CPR principles can aid our research by engaging and learning with community members and bring attention to a very important issue.

512
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:46,100
The limitations of our study one the fact that group level data does not always reflect individual level data.

513
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:52,910
So that's the second fallacy. And then since Detroit has a large population of African-American residents,

514
00:55:53,330 --> 00:56:00,290
that may cause an overrepresentation of black folks in our study and an underrepresentation in Holland.

515
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:05,029
So kind of the opposite effect in the other city. And then lastly, response bias.

516
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:10,160
So children will be taking their survey in the presence of their parents just in case that they need help with any questions.

517
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:15,440
But that could also cause them to change their answers and answer differently than if they would if they were alone.

518
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:21,590
So here are my references and thank you for listening.

519
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:32,720
Once again, apologies for the technology issues.

520
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:39,000
I did practice and do that at times, so I'm not sure what happened when I got up there, but thanks for being for that.

521
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:54,350
This was so cool. And I love how you try to fool everywhere. So I was wondering, how am I connected to.

522
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:05,050
Okay. So for that question, I'm going to return to kind of this racial residential slide here, residential segregation slide.

523
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:10,540
So our built environment largely impacts how we experience help in the world.

524
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:16,000
And so in iteration with not everyone has the same opportunity to be healthy.

525
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:22,150
Detroit really looks very similar to this residential area that's on the right here.

526
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:26,420
So with that being said, there's a lot of toxic hazard sites.

527
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,480
There is a lot of pollution.

528
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:35,829
A lot of the freeways in Detroit resulting from the New Deal were also built in a way that goes right through residential areas.

529
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:42,220
And so that proximity to large freeways and things of that nature where you have semi-trucks constantly going through neighborhoods.

530
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:46,449
It lets off pollutants that fall over into those neighborhoods.

531
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:51,430
And so that can increase asthma complications, deaths, hospitalizations.

532
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,390
And so that's kind of like how they're related. Thanks for that question.

533
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:04,440
I was going to touch on that at the tax cut piece. I was wondering I'm trying to understand the first name of it.

534
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:13,410
So you're going to be getting the perceptions of the families of how racial segregation was one of my misunderstandings.

535
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,020
Okay. So for the first AME,

536
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:25,200
I'm actually going to be looking at racial residential segregation and its impacts or how it's related to asthma outcomes in both Detroit and Holland.

537
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:31,200
And so for that second aim, that's where I'm going to be actually imploring the families and asking their perception of

538
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,860
how they feel they're able to best handle that with their children and with their family.

539
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,820
And also, I'm thinking that that will change between Detroit and Holland.

540
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:43,530
So that's why I wanted to administer the survey in both cities, because one is largely segregated.

541
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:53,400
One is highly segregated. You under age.

542
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:58,880
When you like anything for.

543
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:06,190
In time. You know, it's just my understanding. Thank you very much.

544
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:13,980
So I know that. It's nice. That can make a difference.

545
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:21,120
It hasn't been a difference. What's. Why should I?

546
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:32,010
That's actually a really great question. So we do know that a lot of manufacturing plants in Detroit has closed.

547
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:41,160
However, the effects of those plants remain. And as I mentioned before, the construction of freeways through those neighborhoods as well.

548
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:46,980
And then also there is a plant, marathon plant in Detroit that is 24 hours and it runs all day every day.

549
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,550
And that is a huge contributor to pollution, especially in southwest Detroit.

550
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:55,320
And that's actually the most highly populated or highly polluted zip code in Michigan.

551
00:59:55,800 --> 01:00:02,970
And so that is one of those contributing factors that continue that legacy of environmental injustice and pollution in the city.

552
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:16,630
Question. To your point about the of.

553
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:26,130
I'm. We know that because of.

554
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:32,000
Certain spots is going to be something more than that in terms of.

555
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:40,250
So could you in Detroit where you have families that are in.

556
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:48,410
Does that make sense? Yeah, I guess so.

557
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:56,689
I think when looking at this map, so this clearly lays out those eight healthy grades from 1933 and how those relate

558
01:00:56,690 --> 01:01:00,650
to the current census data where African-American minority minority groups reside.

559
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:07,280
So we can see that the really dark red, almost burgundy areas are way more populated than some other area.

560
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:13,890
So that's a great contribution that I could add is like a third group of like those maybe suffering less and maybe some of those lighter pink areas.

561
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:23,510
Thanks for that. Yeah. The questions are really quick when there's only 6 seconds left.

562
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:28,430
So I'm going to turn the turn off so it doesn't beep really loudly.

563
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:29,390
Just really quickly,

564
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:38,629
are you thinking about measuring like at what level are you measuring segregation at the level of the city like Detroit is segregated, Holland isn't.

565
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:43,250
Or are you measuring segregation within the city and you think that there will

566
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:47,480
be variation in terms of more and less segregated areas within your two places?

567
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:54,740
So that's a really great question. And through my research, I actually found that research on racial residential segregation is very limited.

568
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:02,650
But I was able to find a particular study that did that looked at racial residential segregation all across the United States.

569
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:06,200
Yeah. And so they had different cities, citywide level data.

570
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:13,159
So that's why I'm going to go ahead and just focus on the city level data, because there's a wealth of knowledge on that topic,

571
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:18,620
but there's not necessarily a lot on kind of within the city how much segregation for every city.

572
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:26,809
There are those pieces for some of those highly segregated areas I mentioned, like Philadelphia, Miami, New York, but it's not like for everywhere.

573
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:32,570
So it would be harder to do like inner city segregation in my college because maybe not somebody.

574
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:36,110
Yeah. So thank you for being with you. Thank everyone.

575
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:57,190
Are they pumping you up, Ali? No, I think they're trying to.

576
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:04,820
I've got to appreciate that. Yeah, you know. All right.

577
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:10,970
It's only 10 minutes, and then you're going to get three. Oh, God.

578
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:19,490
Okay, back. You bet. All right. All right. So my project is on the perceived impact of the financial crisis and subsequent infant

579
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:23,720
health outcomes and how Sociodemographic characteristics modify this relationship.

580
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:30,540
So breastfeeding is largely considered the gold standard of infant nutrition because of its role in immune protection,

581
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:38,030
growth, regulation and metabolic support. But despite this, most years, mothers do not exclusively breastfeed their influence.

582
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:44,450
In May 2019, only 24.9% of U.S. mothers exclusively breastfed through six months of age.

583
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:53,030
And so I think it's commonly misunderstood that breastfeeding is a universally accessible option for infant feeding.

584
01:03:53,720 --> 01:04:00,950
And so there's actually a number of barriers to breastfeeding, very significant, including physiological, attitudinal and support related barriers.

585
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:06,530
So there are very distinct social patterns of formula feeding.

586
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:14,569
Dropping us into mothers who do not breastfeed are more likely to belong to racial minority groups, low socioeconomic status groups,

587
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:21,110
and experience occupational barriers and social support barriers to breastfeeding when compared to mothers who are able to breastfeed.

588
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:27,650
These social patterning is echoed in the disparities in infant health,

589
01:04:28,010 --> 01:04:32,570
and so there are very substantial and fair health disparities that exist in the US across social groups.

590
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:42,640
So many of these same social groups are these higher risks of infant mortality, preterm birth, low birth weight, among other severe infant outcomes.

591
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:46,880
So these groups include racial minority groups, low socioeconomic status groups,

592
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:53,030
mothers who return to work sooner and mothers who receive less social support partum.

593
01:04:53,780 --> 01:05:01,340
And so it's thought that the social patterning of infant feeding practices may explain some of the social patterning of infant health disparities,

594
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:10,490
but probably a very small slice of it, right. So in 2020, COVID related supply chain issues led to nationwide formula shortages.

595
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:15,350
I mean, these shortages were very severely exacerbated starting in February 2022.

596
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:20,839
And still today, there are pretty substantial shortages still when a contamination incident occurred

597
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:25,280
at the largest manufacturing plant in the U.S. And so during the shortage,

598
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:32,840
many parents began to adopt very unsafe feeding practices for infants by using diluted formula or homemade formula,

599
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:40,070
in some instances, breast milk from community sharing programs or imported and potentially unregulated formula brands.

600
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:45,890
And so, of course, there are a number of health consequences related to using these unsafe feeding practices,

601
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:50,060
but also overall associated with inadequate infant nutrition.

602
01:05:51,290 --> 01:06:01,189
So the infants that are most vulnerable during the formula crisis are infants that are more likely to belong to racial, ethnic minority,

603
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:08,060
low socioeconomic status groups and more likely to be born to mothers with less supportive occupational or social environments.

604
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:14,270
And so this is really important because it means that infants that are already disproportionately affected

605
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:19,610
by health disparities are at the greatest risk for nutritional deficits during the formula shortage.

606
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:24,430
And so this is particularly concerning among Medicaid users and recipients.

607
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:30,380
And because they comprise a very large portion of the Formula Youth in the United States today,

608
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:41,420
and especially recipients, are directly impacted by the shortages with respect to which formula brands are subsidized.

609
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:47,630
So the goal we study overall is to evaluate whether Sociodemographic characteristics

610
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:52,580
modify the association between the formula shortage impact and infant health outcomes.

611
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:59,690
And I will accomplish this through two stages. The first with comparing Sociodemographic characteristics of mothers who indicated

612
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:03,259
that they were or were not impacted by the financial crisis and the second,

613
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:08,660
through an effect modification analysis. So this study will be conducted in Genesee County, Michigan,

614
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:13,490
and it will be conducted among mothers who delivered within the 12 weeks prior

615
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:17,270
to the formula shortage crisis at one of three major hospitals in the area.

616
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:24,469
Upon enrollment into the study, mothers will be asked to provide baseline sociodemographic information and infant feeding

617
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:29,240
practice information and infant health outcomes will be collected about one year,

618
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:35,450
so mothers will be recruited to the study through male invite and in the meal inquiry will

619
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:39,080
be this baseline survey instrument going to be used for the purposes of this project.

620
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:46,340
And so the instrument will be used to ascertain study eligibility exposure and impact modifier status and also in the.

621
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:50,620
Mail in vote will be a hip hop authorization form that will allow mothers to release

622
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:53,830
their infants records at one year of age so that the outcomes can be assessed.

623
01:07:54,820 --> 01:08:01,120
So the first part of this baseline survey instrument will be used to determine study eligibility with mothers who indicate

624
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:08,260
that they either exclusively formula feed or breastfeed with formula supplementation being eligible for a study,

625
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:12,730
the second part of the baseline survey will go to the effect modifiers.

626
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:20,080
So I want that to be for me an effect modifiers which will be race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status through zip code indicators,

627
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:27,610
Medicaid coverage receipt and occupational support and social support, which I will go to single parent status.

628
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:34,569
So the exposure will also be assessed in this baseline survey instrument with mothers who indicate

629
01:08:34,570 --> 01:08:39,790
that the formula shortage crisis impacted their infant feeding practices considered exposed.

630
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:44,600
So I'll validate two main health outcomes.

631
01:08:44,610 --> 01:08:48,720
The first is morbidity, which is the number of visits to the pediatrician in the first year of life.

632
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:50,729
And the second is infant growth,

633
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:56,910
which is a percent difference in the expected versus the observed weight gain of the infant in their first year of life.

634
01:08:57,060 --> 01:09:02,070
And these will be abstracted from electronic medical records from their one year pediatric visit.

635
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:06,600
So this is my conceptual model. So as you can see,

636
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:18,540
I displayed the expected exposure outcome association and the expected role of the Sociodemographic characteristics as a dark matter virus.

637
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:30,389
And I also included confounder as area of residence because Jesse County is pretty heterogeneous in terms of urban city and affluence.

638
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:35,300
And so and also environmental exposures because it includes Michigan.

639
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:39,720
And so I decided to include as a confounder in analysis to account for that variation.

640
01:09:40,890 --> 01:09:47,129
So the first element of the data analysis will be the sociodemographic comparison between mothers who

641
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:51,240
indicated that their infant feeding practices were or were not impacted by the formula shortage.

642
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:51,870
I mean,

643
01:09:51,870 --> 01:10:00,600
this will be done by basic comparison of gains or prevalence values between the two exposure groups using the tests that are listed on the right.

644
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:10,140
And the expectation is that mothers who reported that they were impacted by the form of the shortage will be more likely to belong to racial,

645
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:16,380
ethnic minority groups or socioeconomic status groups, or be less likely to have access to social and occupational support.

646
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:22,889
So the second bit of the analysis will involve a fact modification analysis to see whether or not the

647
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:28,140
Sociodemographic characteristics modify the relationship between perceived impact to the formula shortage,

648
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:33,720
crisis and infant health. And so I will use two different regression modeling methods.

649
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:38,520
So the first will be percent regression for the infant morbidity because it's current data.

650
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:42,549
And the second would be linear regression. And for the present week differences,

651
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:49,290
since it's continuous data and I will do this by introducing an exposure modifier interaction term one by one for

652
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:55,290
each modifier add to the regression models in order to compare the impact estimates at each level of the modifier.

653
01:10:56,100 --> 01:11:01,530
So overall, my expectation is that the mothers that are impacted by the formula shortage crisis will have infants of

654
01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:08,220
worse health outcomes on average and socially disadvantage mothers will exhibit stronger associations.

655
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:11,610
So this is my projected setting timeline.

656
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:20,190
So the events in pink, purple, whatever it is, are the events that will occur in the retrospective section of the study,

657
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:23,520
which will be evaluated using the patient data.

658
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:32,940
And then in blue, I've indicated this study execution events starting in February 2023 with IAB application and approval data study,

659
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:36,270
recruitment, data collection, and then followed by data analysis.

660
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:41,070
So overall, I'd like to just nod to the broader significance of this issue.

661
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:51,569
I think that the formula crisis really highlighted how dangerous it is to rely on a very inflexible program or industry for supplying

662
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:58,200
infant formula throughout the U.S. because there's a very small handful of manufacturers that kind of have cornered the market.

663
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:07,800
And it's especially problematic for government subsidized formula distribution programs, which often rely on one or two main manufacturers,

664
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:17,040
both of which were significantly impacted by the shortages to distribute formula to groups especially needed.

665
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:23,849
And so I think it's also important to understand the implications of that for the formula shortage and

666
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:30,730
understand the health impacts of the formula crisis in order to prevent future instances and most importantly,

667
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:35,729
prevent further widening the gap and the health gap between breastfed formula fed

668
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:40,530
infants and infants born to the social groups that are most prone to either feeding.

669
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:08,209
The shortage happened before the pandemic. So during the pandemic, it seems there are like supply chain issues.

670
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:12,950
But even prior to the pandemic, there were some instances of these.

671
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:21,680
With this bacterial outbreak, especially at the Abbott nutrition plant and my gosh, I'm pregnant.

672
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:23,790
I think it's like Sturgis, Michigan or something like that.

673
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:32,650
And which, by the way, manufactures about 25% of infant formula for the entire United States.

674
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:39,240
And so there are some instances of this bacterial contamination starting back in 2019,

675
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:46,140
but it progressively got worse and worse and involved and required FDA involvement and halting production of the plant,

676
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:51,300
which led to the really, really severe shortage starting in 2022.

677
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:58,590
Yeah. Distinguish between.

678
01:13:59,330 --> 01:14:06,180
In between your boring day and you say you're not. I wonder if there's any anecdotal thoughts about how.

679
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:09,490
Yeah, well, I totally agree.

680
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:15,139
I was thinking about that too. And I was also thinking about other things like maternal age and whatnot, because, I mean,

681
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:25,040
a lot of it too is also depends on the type of formula you can tolerate because that that varies pretty dramatically in some of the affected plants,

682
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:31,160
like, for example, average nutrition. They, I think, manufactured like gentle weeds, which is like really have to be used in an acute.

683
01:14:31,190 --> 01:14:34,339
Right. And so I thought about adjusting for that, too.

684
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:39,469
But honestly, I was just thinking about the like the feasibility of the study as a whole.

685
01:14:39,470 --> 01:14:45,410
And I think that there are some pretty, um, probably pretty substantial limitations.

686
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:50,620
And I was a little bit worried about asking about um, medical data like that at baseline.

687
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:53,690
So yeah, but I definitely consider that. Yeah.

688
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:58,400
Because that would really, really impact access to formula and information that goes to.

689
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:03,680
They want you to write it, bringing it to you as you walk out the door.

690
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:18,550
Right. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Just wondering, like.

691
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:33,340
Yeah. I don't know. I honestly don't know about that specifically.

692
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:42,340
But I do know I will comment that now one of the responses to the formula shortage was that they started to really encourage,

693
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:47,020
I think, you know, use imported formula brands instead.

694
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:54,270
So, I mean, I don't know that this relates to your question, but they are now hoping that by diversifying, you know,

695
01:15:54,280 --> 01:16:02,830
the supplies available to us, you know, mothers and infants, that in the future this will be less of an issue.

696
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:06,920
But didn't really answer your question. Okay. Thank.

697
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:16,780
Yeah. I wondered about you had said that one of the only practices that you.

698
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:26,150
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So there are breast milk banks, right?

699
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:32,510
So you can go through a process where you donate breast milk and it's, you know, like, I don't know if it's pasteurized.

700
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:34,400
I don't know if that's the right word. But, you know, bear with me.

701
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:45,460
But there are also other community sharing programs like very informal sharing programs started to crop up during the formula shortage in the issue,

702
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:52,549
and that is that they may be contaminated by medications, illicit drugs, pathogenic bacteria,

703
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:58,280
among other things, you know, because it's not, you know, so that was one of the main things.

704
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:03,950
I don't know how common it was, but yeah, people did start, um, relying on that because, you know,

705
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:10,760
you think about it like if there's like an outbreak with lettuce, you know, you just as an adult, you know, you just avoid lettuce.

706
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:16,099
But as an infant that relies on formula feeding, you have absolutely no choice, you know?

707
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:19,970
And so people became really desperate. You know, it's really pretty tragic.

708
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:29,190
So. I just have.

709
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:34,100
Oh, no, go ahead. Where did you get your tablet from?

710
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:40,670
You know what? I think this is embarrassing. I DIY the whole entire thing in PowerPoint.

711
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:44,660
I literally do all of it in PowerPoint. I'm like, insane.

712
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:48,630
But yeah. So I'm flattered that you asked that.

713
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:55,050
That's like, very nice. Oh, okay.

714
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:58,250
Sorry. On that note, we will.

715
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:05,590
Okay. We're going to take a five minute break and I'm going to put snacks here.

716
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:10,810
You're welcome. You haven't seen them yet?

717
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:26,540
I. Okay.

718
01:18:33,770 --> 01:18:37,250
I need. Yeah.

719
01:18:38,080 --> 01:19:00,300
Oh, yeah. When I spoke to her.

720
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:12,320
I think. Oh, yes.

721
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:19,270
Yeah, you're right.

722
01:19:20,770 --> 01:19:26,220
Okay. Are these criminal?

723
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:33,890
I don't know what they are. I never. I just held them in the leg. Yeah.

724
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:41,910
You're welcome. One do.

725
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:19,490
You better get out of here.

726
01:20:19,550 --> 01:20:23,820
I don't know what all the different flavors are right here.

727
01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:33,200
You did it. Yeah. You guys have to eat all this because otherwise I won't even.

728
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:39,950
I won't be able to send you and the patients to have a report on you.

729
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:49,090
Oh, yes. Yeah, that's like a lot of petroleum products over there, and I felt a little bad about using them.

730
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:02,300
Well, that's what I was. Yeah. And the donuts, they gave them to me in this box.

731
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:09,470
And the box, wasn't it? Like I had paper over it, but I was like, they're going to get so you to them up yesterday.

732
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:27,229
Thank you. You're welcome. Well, you know, I I remember I was like, I don't know if they want us to get you know,

733
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:33,950
I was going to bring them anyway, but I still used the bar, you know?

734
01:21:38,030 --> 01:21:43,730
I have no idea. Well, you'll just have to take your chances.

735
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:51,740
Rice Krispie treats. If you ever had to do, like, the cereal with marshmallows and.

736
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:55,970
Oh, yes. It sounds great. It's pretty good.

737
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:17,120
Yeah. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you.

738
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:29,510
Yeah, I think it is.

739
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:40,750
Thank you all. You're welcome. I was like, okay.

740
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:52,080
I was like, I know you're very lucky.

741
01:22:54,060 --> 01:23:10,320
And I was like, I know you're.

742
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:34,060
I don't know. I can't hear any shaking.

743
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:37,820
It's hard to go around after the break. Yes, everyone's crashing.

744
01:23:38,210 --> 01:23:42,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. We're going to get started.

745
01:23:42,770 --> 01:23:46,510
You guys have to take all these donuts before you leave.

746
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:50,690
I don't want any donuts. It's okay.

747
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:55,620
You. Okay.

748
01:23:56,070 --> 01:24:03,480
Okay. Hi. My name's Eliana, and I'll be doing my presentation on an examination of mental health,

749
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:11,840
seeking attitudes and behaviors among Filipino Americans in California and the impacts of education for anyone else involved.

750
01:24:15,570 --> 01:24:24,540
No shame. And for background, the Philippines has the third highest rate of mental disorders in the Western Pacific region.

751
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:30,360
So I have it circled there and you can see that it is pretty small compared to the other countries next to it,

752
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:34,980
more than 3.6 million Filipinos suffer from one or a combination of the following.

753
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:38,220
So mental neural, neurological and substance use disorder.

754
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:42,629
Little attention is given to mental health care by the Philippine government.

755
01:24:42,630 --> 01:24:49,710
Public sectors in only a little over 8.2% of the total health expenditures are dedicated to mental health.

756
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:53,010
So there's a low availability of mental health services there.

757
01:24:54,480 --> 01:25:00,090
Filipino Americans have some of the lowest rates of mental health usage among various Asian American groups,

758
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:05,219
and this can be due to family or family structure because Filipinos usually have a collectivist structure,

759
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:12,000
so higher value is placed on the family unit than the individual is often the stigma surrounding mental health.

760
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,380
So there's also an importance of saving face or loss of face.

761
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:23,820
Cultural beliefs, filial piety, which is the obligation of an individual, has towards the family.

762
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:30,240
And overall, there is very limited, limited data available on the mental health of Filipinos and Filipino American.

763
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:33,390
So this data was pretty hard to find already.

764
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:40,650
So this is my transactional model. I try to make it symmetrical and I think I ended up with a diamond.

765
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:46,649
So from my exposure, I have the culture, cultural or place of upbringing.

766
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:50,639
So either the Philippines or the United States. And for my outcome,

767
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:55,350
I have mental health help seeking behaviors and my mediate yeah my mediators are

768
01:25:55,350 --> 01:26:00,389
perceived social support received need for mental health care and mental health.

769
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:06,920
Part seeking attitudes is what I'm going to focus on for the study and my confounders are income education and can.

770
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:12,270
So the aims of my study is to explore the general,

771
01:26:12,390 --> 01:26:18,640
general attitudes and behaviors of Filipino Americans toward mental health and utilization of mental health care services.

772
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:22,680
And we hypothesize that Filipino Americans may have a generally negative attitude

773
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:26,660
towards mental health and have lower rates of mental health care service usage.

774
01:26:27,330 --> 01:26:34,500
And we also want to elucidate differences in attitude and behaviors toward mental health help seeking between Filipino American immigrants.

775
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:41,219
So first generation and third generation. And we hypothesize that first generation Filipino Americans will have lower rates of mental health,

776
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:44,700
help seeking behaviors and more negative attitudes towards mental health,

777
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:50,220
help seeking services then third generation Americans who are born and raised in the US.

778
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:55,570
So for our research, design and methods,

779
01:26:55,570 --> 01:27:02,350
we want to do a community based cross-sectional study design using a population of Filipino Americans from the state of California.

780
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:08,200
So in California it has the largest Filipino population among all 50 states.

781
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:12,850
And you can see that from the map I have there. That's from the US Census in 2000.

782
01:27:13,510 --> 01:27:21,130
And we want to focus in the cities of San Francisco Bay, Los Angeles, San Diego and Stockton, which is home to Little Manila.

783
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:28,120
And we also want to distribute our questionnaire, which I'll go over later on college campuses.

784
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:32,260
So colleges like UCLA, UC, San Diego and UC Berkeley.

785
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:43,840
And we want to collect data on people 18 years old and up that have three generations of Filipino Americans within their family, which is a big ask.

786
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:53,229
But I'll get to that later. And our distribution methods would be for fliers, email, social media and with a QR code.

787
01:27:53,230 --> 01:28:00,790
So the QR code will direct our participants to a set of questions that are more general characteristics to see

788
01:28:00,790 --> 01:28:08,170
if they meet our inclusion criteria and those who do well to answer questions from our official questionnaire.

789
01:28:10,650 --> 01:28:18,420
So our online questionnaire will include demographic information such as age and complex upbringing, education level,

790
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:25,950
etc. and also questions from the following standardized questionnaires Mental health, health seeking attitudes,

791
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:31,950
general help seeking behavior, perceived needs or unmet need for mental health care, social support,

792
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:37,640
and are also be a section on open ended questions on personal experience with mental health concerns.

793
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:40,290
Other students have pointed out it's not black and white.

794
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:46,260
And we'll also like to put in a note encouraging participants to share our study with other Filipinos

795
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:54,090
in their network to take advantage of social sampling strategies and for analysis will use SAS.

796
01:28:54,420 --> 01:29:02,700
So for some reason, statistics will be using univariate analysis and multivariate regression analysis will be used

797
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:06,990
to examine the relationship between cultural place of upbringing and mental health policymakers.

798
01:29:09,490 --> 01:29:19,300
So for our timeline, our study will be over a span of a year with IAB approval first, because that is not a long time to wait.

799
01:29:19,930 --> 01:29:26,319
For the first three months we'll be developing. Our questionnaire and dissemination strategy will be advertising our study on social

800
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:30,580
media platforms and Filipino-American community groups and college campuses.

801
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:36,070
And the next four months we'll be collecting data and cleaning our data and organizing it.

802
01:29:36,850 --> 01:29:39,700
And for the last four months,

803
01:29:40,150 --> 01:29:48,580
we'll be obtaining descriptive statistics and performing data analysis and some limitations of our study because it is a cross-sectional study.

804
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:51,700
So we can't really establish a causal relationship with our data alone.

805
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,300
So this would be a good idea for future research and future studies.

806
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:58,900
Um, well, what works? Sorry.

807
01:29:59,410 --> 01:30:03,639
We are expecting low participation rate and sample size because again,

808
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:12,310
it'll be very difficult to find three generations within a family in the same area who are able to use an online questionnaire.

809
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:18,400
Or B there's a lot of factors that go into it which we are expecting to come across.

810
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:23,919
And there's also issues of reporting bias because our study focuses on mental health issues.

811
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:28,329
It's already a pretty sensitive topic towards food in Filipino culture.

812
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:35,260
So again, this might be participants from answering the questions completely or finishing the questionnaire itself.

813
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:45,700
And we'll probably also have problems with generalizability because we're using our study in, um, in Filipino communities in California,

814
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:53,379
there's a unique history and diversity in California compared to other predominantly Filipino communities,

815
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:56,350
such as like Hawaii and the East Coast, New York.

816
01:30:56,350 --> 01:31:08,380
So but I think an important part or an important aspect of our study is that the results that we may get from it may encourage,

817
01:31:08,590 --> 01:31:15,729
like Filipino governments and just researchers in general, to focus more on mental health in Filipino culture.

818
01:31:15,730 --> 01:31:20,320
Because I would like to know that's it.

819
01:31:24,830 --> 01:31:28,180
Are there any questions? Yes.

820
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:49,229
Yeah. So I include a reason to focus more on those who came from the Philippines.

821
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:55,070
So the Philippines is made up of 7000 islands with its own like with each other.

822
01:31:55,340 --> 01:31:58,040
Each island has its own unique culture and dialects,

823
01:31:58,040 --> 01:32:04,040
so this might influence cultural beliefs towards mental health and the stigma surrounding mental health.

824
01:32:04,050 --> 01:32:08,370
So. I think that would have an effect on both our exposure and our outcome.

825
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:22,700
I do want to. Um, that's a good question.

826
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:29,390
And honestly, it's for personal reasons because I've had different conversations with my mother about mental health,

827
01:32:29,660 --> 01:32:34,219
and I think I have a different relationship with mental health compared to my grandmother.

828
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:38,380
And I don't even know if I want to speak to my grandmother about some of this.

829
01:32:38,390 --> 01:32:45,170
I just feel like it doesn't even exist. So that's kind of why I wanted to do that.

830
01:32:53,490 --> 01:33:06,010
Well, meaning the curious thing is that there's a very large population.

831
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:16,320
Am either from the Philippines or. Not just.

832
01:33:17,970 --> 01:33:24,730
What? You're absolutely right. Well, they certainly have a different.

833
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:41,630
And I was also here in terms of culture. If you're going to be separating out those considerations, whether you were born and raised.

834
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:48,730
I'm just curious about. I can point to that for sure.

835
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:56,979
And I'm glad he did bring up the health care thing because my parents do work in health care, so they have a better understanding.

836
01:33:56,980 --> 01:34:04,650
And I think that has something to do with it too. So yeah, I think I would stratify by that and I think.

837
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:14,460
Ask your second question. Yes, I think that's also what I considered when I was, you know,

838
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:20,549
forming my study design to see if maybe I can compare with Filipinos from the Philippines

839
01:34:20,550 --> 01:34:24,810
who were born and raised there with those with Filipino Americans born and raised here.

840
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:31,660
But I think what I wanted to consider was. The generational difference also so.

841
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:44,290
I have a question that's similar to our building atmosphere.

842
01:34:44,590 --> 01:34:51,520
So I'm wondering, you talked about how you want to look at first and third generation, but you didn't talk about second generation.

843
01:34:52,060 --> 01:35:00,070
And so I'm wondering if you plan to include that group in your study and also how you're defining first, second and third generation?

844
01:35:01,750 --> 01:35:07,070
That's a good question. Yeah, I do.

845
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:14,840
I think the reason why I wanted to do the first and third and Scott's second was that I wanted there to be enough time in between,

846
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:21,110
um, for like, I don't know, culture adjustment and yeah,

847
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:26,809
so first generation I would define as someone who immigrated from the Philippines

848
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:30,790
and had a significant amount of time in the Philippines and then came here.

849
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:37,940
So yeah, and I think I put in one of my slides of the primary residents in the first 18 years.

850
01:35:38,150 --> 01:35:41,240
That's the part that I wanted to consider, really. Okay.

851
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:50,690
Um. Yeah. Um, I guess for the second generation, including in my study, that would be a good direction to do it.

852
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:54,510
Yeah. Sorry. That wasn't very good.

853
01:35:55,470 --> 01:35:58,740
No, that was fine. I was just curious. I think I understand.

854
01:35:58,740 --> 01:36:04,530
What you're saying is that you think the experiences of first and third generation will be very distinct,

855
01:36:04,530 --> 01:36:08,219
whereas the second generation may not be as distinct from the first.

856
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:15,840
And so you really want that that that larger difference in terms of looking like comparing.

857
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:37,570
I think. It's pretty great.

858
01:36:37,730 --> 01:36:43,960
It was a pretty good movie theater after seeing everyone else's film.

859
01:36:44,120 --> 01:37:01,030
You guys are stellar. Oh, it was.

860
01:37:03,910 --> 01:37:09,879
So speaking of using default, I literally wonder if you like it anyway.

861
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:13,340
But I mean, my slides, they're not anything. So.

862
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:16,810
Okay. All right. Okay. All right.

863
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:18,700
So hello, everyone.

864
01:37:18,710 --> 01:37:25,690
My name is Andrew and I will be presenting on the role of socioeconomic status in asthma among native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders.

865
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:31,690
So a little bit of background here. A little bit.

866
01:37:31,690 --> 01:37:39,940
But in terms of the overall US, there is a total of approximately 25.2 million people in the US that currently have asthma.

867
01:37:40,270 --> 01:37:45,459
And we define currently as anyone who's been asked by a professional or told by a professional that yes,

868
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:49,030
they have asthma and enter the company, they still have asthma.

869
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:51,399
So as we just discussed before,

870
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:59,470
there are 4.2 million of these individuals that are children that have currently have asthma and approximately 21 million adults.

871
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:05,530
And in the past studies in 2014 on what, specifically,

872
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:13,150
approximately 16% of what these children and 9.2% of the adults have been identified as currently having asthma.

873
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:18,450
And of this number, Native Hawaiian children have shown the highest that more prevalent in Hawaii,

874
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:22,510
approximately 23% of those children compared to Caucasian,

875
01:38:22,510 --> 01:38:32,440
Chinese, Filipino, Japanese and all of the children, those within the NHL have been also identified to be more likely reported.

876
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:36,110
Lower measures of socioeconomic status compared to other.

877
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:51,190
So here is my conceptual model, but with socioeconomic exposure and as as my outcome and race as my moderate and variable.

878
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:56,100
So I have two aims for this project.

879
01:38:57,030 --> 01:39:06,660
First of all is to examine the relationship between social, socio socioeconomic status and asthma and using previous health data.

880
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:14,460
And following up on that would be to examine the extent in which race moderates this affect socio economic status.

881
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:20,850
And my hypothesis or hypotheses are as follows We hypothesize that there's a significant

882
01:39:20,850 --> 01:39:25,469
evidence that socioeconomic status is positively associated with the prevalence of asthma,

883
01:39:25,470 --> 01:39:35,760
and that we hypothesized that the interaction term that will follow for both socioeconomic status and race will also be significant for this problem.

884
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:46,470
And I also suspect that people who are of initial pie will show the highest moderate effect on that in our analysis.

885
01:39:48,670 --> 01:39:56,530
So as for methods, I will be using an already existing data set with behavioral risk factors, surveillance system, health survey data.

886
01:39:57,220 --> 01:40:02,230
So I won't have to worry about any specific data collection with any prison populations.

887
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:09,760
So I will be using data specifically from 2018 to 2020 for this analysis on lifetime and current asthma prevalence.

888
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:11,530
As I say before,

889
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:20,290
this economic status is our exposure and I will be using creating a composite very categorical variable specifically for this analysis.

890
01:40:20,290 --> 01:40:25,930
And that's where I will be using both a poverty income ratio and education.

891
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:35,050
This will be similar to some of the prior studies that have been done and overall asthma prevalence will be our outcome.

892
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:41,530
And as I stated before, it will be defined as anyone who has answered these questions for answer them with yes,

893
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:47,650
as if they've been told by a professional if they've had asthma and if they still have an asthma.

894
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:53,010
And also stand for race will be used as a moderating variable and allow for a

895
01:40:53,010 --> 01:40:56,230
comparison between Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders and other.

896
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:00,930
So on to data analysis.

897
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:09,930
I will be using SAS to manipulate the purchase data and I will be conducting logistic regression on identifying the association of SPF

898
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:17,970
and the prevalence estimate and odds ratios will be compared to the overall U.S. population and within specifically the data for.

899
01:41:20,130 --> 01:41:28,800
And then following that, we'll be trying to analyze the moderate strength of risk by creating this interactive term with us.

900
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:35,750
And this will allow me to pretty much stratify by race and be looking in any.

901
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:44,880
So in terms of expected limitations for the study with purpose data,

902
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:50,730
it is vulnerable to recall or social desirability bias as it is a telephone based survey system.

903
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:56,730
So there will be people most likely altering their answers over the phone at the time of the interview,

904
01:41:57,180 --> 01:42:00,960
and there may not be everyone that is covered in terms of these interviews.

905
01:42:00,980 --> 01:42:12,270
So passerbys I've looked over actually have developed ways to reduce the estimated biases for anyone who's not coverage or have no responses.

906
01:42:13,290 --> 01:42:20,069
And the strength of this data set out here is actually that data already exists.

907
01:42:20,070 --> 01:42:28,650
So I don't have to worry about the processes for data collection or since it's also on a publicly available resource.

908
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:32,370
So don't have to worry too much on any risks to human participation.

909
01:42:33,540 --> 01:42:41,129
And the other limitation is that whatever data may be too small of a sample size to look at specifically in a definitive as well,

910
01:42:41,130 --> 01:42:46,790
because it just won't be as generalizable to anywhere else throughout the U.S. as

911
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:53,760
when I stratify by race and following some of the other struggles in past research.

912
01:42:54,180 --> 01:43:01,710
If the categories for race showed too few numbers to bear to share about with employee, they will be compiled together at other race.

913
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:13,719
So in terms of the. And my considering, as I said earlier, data collection is not too much of an issue.

914
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:17,860
So the time like the relatively shorter within a four month span as we're going to spend.

915
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:24,309
So the first month will be 14 and whichever purpose datasets I'll be using.

916
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:29,500
So from 2018 to 2021 to conducting data cleaning that reviewing the weights that we.

917
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:38,710
All three will be the overall statistical analysis process and one for will be the data, interpretation and publication necessary.

918
01:43:43,710 --> 01:43:47,840
But I saw him. I spent.

919
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:14,950
They were research. When I was researching online specifically, there were studies for school absenteeism, actually for Native Hawaiian children.

920
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:20,540
It was very much based on which island you work from because it's between the islands very long.

921
01:44:20,990 --> 01:44:24,470
Some of them are more difficult or more well developed.

922
01:44:25,010 --> 01:44:31,130
So these are more studied in those countries, I think it is for it's just depending on where you live.

923
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:34,690
But I haven't seen too much of the specific interventions that.

924
01:44:46,410 --> 01:44:49,440
So in between the islands this is more from.

925
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:54,560
This will be more from personal experience as far as I can suggest.

926
01:44:54,750 --> 01:45:03,000
I will expect differences into Ireland because of how much money developers and the other and in terms of what used to exist.

927
01:45:04,650 --> 01:45:09,479
I didn't think, but I do recall that there were sugar plantations between the islands and only recently

928
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:15,990
I think I forgot what year 2013 was when the last sugar plantation finally closed.

929
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:21,959
I'm anticipating different things due to intergenerational factors,

930
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:28,980
with many people had grandparents or friends living in the plantations at the time, but I haven't done too much research on that.

931
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:34,050
There isn't. I think the question.

932
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:52,510
So when you referred to me. Just the work isn't too bad.

933
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:59,590
You might have been there. This will be people of actual.

934
01:46:04,190 --> 01:46:11,400
So what? You're. Native Hawaiian children have the highest rate.

935
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:26,590
And so I was curious what your. So it sounds like this is particularly on the face of Britain for the most part, because.

936
01:46:27,940 --> 01:46:31,840
I haven't been. It would.

937
01:46:35,620 --> 01:46:40,690
I haven't seen as many of the resources for other populations.

938
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:50,350
Children. Yeah.

939
01:46:57,650 --> 01:47:05,370
Anyway, I'm just curious. I mean, I am thinking more of it is both a computational and.

940
01:47:10,940 --> 01:47:16,610
Yeah. I mean.

941
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:29,070
I have one for you. You knew you were going to escape. Only time gets you out of my question.

942
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:36,120
So you. So you're. Your main exposure is us, right?

943
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:42,780
And so you're hypothesizing that people with lower scores will be more likely to report having asthma, right?

944
01:47:42,810 --> 01:47:49,440
Yes. And that's that that will that is the strength of that association will depend on race.

945
01:47:50,040 --> 01:48:01,170
And so you're arguing that native Native Hawaiians versus other groups, the effect of low X on asthma, odds of asthma will be greater.

946
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:07,590
Is that right? Stronger association would be a stronger association for higher rates of asthma.

947
01:48:08,340 --> 01:48:16,490
Yeah. Can you say a little bit about why you think the effect of SARS on asthma would would depend on race group?

948
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:24,840
And maybe this gets back to a serious question and thinking about differences in occupation or something like that.

949
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:30,600
But just just curious when it comes to race and for a lot of it, I see this is more from a personal thing.

950
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:38,040
So it's not too much of an issue, but in a lot of cases, it's a lot more difficult for Native folks to actually find career options as well.

951
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:43,560
So it's been a running thing just in real life circumstances case.

952
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:47,580
But native Hawaiians do struggle a lot more just trying to survive in terms of job opportunities,

953
01:48:47,580 --> 01:48:53,760
education and all that income that I'm doing income and education as a composite variable for the sport.

954
01:48:54,060 --> 01:49:00,240
So that mixed with the smaller race as a moderate factor.

955
01:49:00,710 --> 01:49:07,050
I anticipate that because of that combination normally that I see with New Orleans and other Pacific Islanders,

956
01:49:07,050 --> 01:49:17,460
it's already at a lower level for the things that we're doing, but it's not it's a lot poorer than what people would anticipate.

957
01:49:19,230 --> 01:49:26,430
Yes. So that makes me think of when we talked about and when we talked about race like way back in the beginning of the semester,

958
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:32,700
we talked about the non equivalence of different indicators across racial and ethnic

959
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:36,779
groups because of things like discrimination and lower returns to education.

960
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:40,140
So I think that's interesting that that could be going on here.

961
01:49:40,150 --> 01:49:46,050
Yeah. And this kind of adds more to actually the actual limitation here because the nature of how hard it is to live,

962
01:49:46,350 --> 01:49:49,379
what you could begin with already is fairly unique of a condition.

963
01:49:49,380 --> 01:49:54,090
It is not as generalizable and I don't think it would be as generalizable to the rest of the U.S.

964
01:49:55,620 --> 01:50:01,230
Yeah, but still important to look at it in that context because what we know about the rest of the US may not apply there.

965
01:50:44,190 --> 01:50:51,519
Okay, everyone. So in my proposed study, I am assessing the association between an adult household income as a child and

966
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:55,750
their current cardiovascular health as an adult living in the air in our community.

967
01:50:57,780 --> 01:51:04,109
So for some background on the topic, education on the prevention of cardiovascular disease often fails to recognize that

968
01:51:04,110 --> 01:51:08,400
individual's eating and exercise habits are not the sole cause of this disease.

969
01:51:08,970 --> 01:51:15,150
While an individual's eating and exercise behaviors can impact their chances of developing cardiovascular vascular disease,

970
01:51:15,150 --> 01:51:18,720
we must think about what causes an individual to develop these behaviors.

971
01:51:19,230 --> 01:51:21,780
So we must look to some structural factors, such as income.

972
01:51:22,710 --> 01:51:30,120
Previous literature on this topic has demonstrated that income disparities create health disparities between people of differing income levels.

973
01:51:30,510 --> 01:51:34,680
For instance, lower income level is associated with a greater risk for cardiovascular disease.

974
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:39,149
And while it is known that a person's presence or socioeconomic status greatly

975
01:51:39,150 --> 01:51:42,810
influences excessive accessibility to healthy food and quality exercise,

976
01:51:43,140 --> 01:51:49,710
we don't have a ton of information on whether or not adults childhood socioeconomic status has the same effect.

977
01:51:55,080 --> 01:52:01,260
So there are a variety of existing studies that address the association between household income and cardiovascular disease.

978
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:08,579
One study even noted that factors correlated with cardiovascular disease, including obesity, inactive lifestyle,

979
01:52:08,580 --> 01:52:17,219
exposure to smoking and LDL cholesterol levels are more likely to be observed in non-pregnant individuals between the ages of six and 24 that

980
01:52:17,220 --> 01:52:23,130
came from low income families versus individuals in the same group that came from high income families while adjusting for race and ethnicity.

981
01:52:23,670 --> 01:52:27,899
Another study concluded that household income level was more strongly correlated with

982
01:52:27,900 --> 01:52:33,720
cardiovascular disease than behavioral risk factors such as active lifestyle and frequent smoking.

983
01:52:36,270 --> 01:52:40,229
So the aim of my proposed study is to analyze the difference in prevalence of

984
01:52:40,230 --> 01:52:44,220
adverse cardiovascular health outcomes for adults who grew up at the lower,

985
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:51,840
lower middle or middle class household income versus adults who grew up with a middle to upper or upper class household income,

986
01:52:52,140 --> 01:52:55,540
adjusting for parental education, level and race, ethnicity.

987
01:52:56,400 --> 01:53:01,650
And I hypothesize that adults who grew up with a lower childhood household income,

988
01:53:01,830 --> 01:53:07,200
while the higher prevalence of adverse cardiovascular health and health outcomes than adults

989
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:11,720
who grew up with a higher childhood household income adjusting for parental education level.

990
01:53:11,730 --> 01:53:17,140
Increased levels. So for my research design,

991
01:53:17,710 --> 01:53:22,210
I did an observational cross-sectional study and the sample will consist of

992
01:53:22,210 --> 01:53:27,520
at least 200 adults between the ages of 40 and 74 patients at and medicine.

993
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:34,510
Participants will be recruited by sending a survey to all patients between the ages of 40 and 70 via email.

994
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:41,170
Individuals that answer all questions of the survey will be included in the study, and the study will be completed by at least 200.

995
01:53:41,170 --> 01:53:42,640
Participants have completed the survey.

996
01:53:45,580 --> 01:53:54,370
So for a description of my variables, the exposure variable childhood household income will be measured as a binary predictor in the survey.

997
01:53:54,730 --> 01:54:00,040
Participants will be asked to report the number one if they grow lower class, lower to middle class or middle class,

998
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:04,719
and will be asked to report the number zero if they grew up middle to upper class or upper class.

999
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:10,120
As a child, I realize that most studies do not group numerous income levels under the same income category.

1000
01:54:10,420 --> 01:54:14,470
And while there may be limitations to grouping various income levels into one category,

1001
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:23,049
I believe it may demonstrate how drastic the difference in cardiovascular health outcomes could be between income levels close to one another's,

1002
01:54:23,050 --> 01:54:26,740
such as the upper and middle class and the outcome variable.

1003
01:54:26,740 --> 01:54:30,430
Cardiovascular health will also be measured as a dichotomous variable.

1004
01:54:31,390 --> 01:54:36,250
Participants will be asked for the number one if they've ever experienced one or more heart attacks in their lifetime.

1005
01:54:36,250 --> 01:54:43,969
And the number is zero if they have never. And I will also control for two confounding variables.

1006
01:54:43,970 --> 01:54:50,870
The two confounders for the study will be the participants parental education level and their race and the participants race ethnicity.

1007
01:54:51,290 --> 01:55:01,429
These variables would be considered since they both are associated with the exposure in the outcome and parental educational level will be measured as

1008
01:55:01,430 --> 01:55:08,840
a dichotomous predictor by asking participants to report the number one if neither of their parents earned a college education and the number of zero.

1009
01:55:09,140 --> 01:55:11,360
If one or both parents earned a college education.

1010
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:19,620
And then race and ethnicity categories will be reported based on 2017 the 2018 demographic questionnaire.

1011
01:55:22,570 --> 01:55:28,209
So for my statistical analysis, I'll be performing a binomial regression to obtain a prevalence difference

1012
01:55:28,210 --> 01:55:31,480
comparing the prevalence of heart attacks in the group that had a lower child.

1013
01:55:31,750 --> 01:55:37,870
But compared to the prevalence of heart attacks in the group that have higher household income.

1014
01:55:38,380 --> 01:55:45,730
While adjusting for race and parental education, level and dummy variables would be created for each level of the race and ethnicity.

1015
01:55:45,850 --> 01:55:53,830
Categorical variable using non-Hispanic white as the reference group in order to use the racial groups as confounders in the regression model.

1016
01:55:55,190 --> 01:56:02,179
And for my expected results, I anticipate that people belonging to the lower childhood household income group will have a higher

1017
01:56:02,180 --> 01:56:07,430
prevalence of heart attacks than participants belonging to the Higher Childhood Household Income Group,

1018
01:56:07,790 --> 01:56:11,270
even when adjusting for parental education and race, ethnicity.

1019
01:56:11,810 --> 01:56:17,360
And then I also expect the prevalence of difference estimate will be included in the 95% confidence interval,

1020
01:56:17,810 --> 01:56:22,550
which will indicate that the prevalence difference between the two groups is significant at upper levels.

1021
01:56:26,310 --> 01:56:34,290
So a rough timeline of the first activities to complete the bid to obtain IRB approval from the University of Michigan and Michigan Medicine,

1022
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:37,709
and then to distribute surveys to patients via email,

1023
01:56:37,710 --> 01:56:43,290
collect data on at least 200 participants, start to analyze the data and draw conclusions,

1024
01:56:43,290 --> 01:56:46,500
and expect this will take around six months to a year to complete.

1025
01:56:47,220 --> 01:56:52,620
And then the second set of activities will be to continue analyzing the data and drawing conclusions.

1026
01:56:53,130 --> 01:56:56,220
And if data creates results that are unexpected,

1027
01:56:56,220 --> 01:57:03,030
we will distribute the survey and collect data on an additional 200 participants to add to the dataset.

1028
01:57:03,660 --> 01:57:11,069
And I expect this will take six months to a year to complete, and then the final activities will be to finalize the data and creation of conclusions.

1029
01:57:11,070 --> 01:57:18,610
And I anticipate this will take that. So there are a couple limitations to study design.

1030
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:24,250
One potential limitation is that we will only be selling a small subset of one community.

1031
01:57:24,580 --> 01:57:31,450
So the relationship between adult household income as a child and having a heart attack will likely not be generalizable to the greater population.

1032
01:57:32,830 --> 01:57:40,569
And this is because these two variables could differ by community due to different average household income by community,

1033
01:57:40,570 --> 01:57:43,990
and differing accessibility to healthy foods and exercise facilities.

1034
01:57:44,620 --> 01:57:50,320
And then another limitation of this study is that not all individuals, particularly older individuals,

1035
01:57:50,440 --> 01:57:55,990
in the Ann Arbor community, may have access to technology which could lead to non-response bias.

1036
01:57:56,530 --> 01:58:00,160
However, I am fearing that most people in this age category would have technology.

1037
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:07,810
And then another limitation is that because this is an observational cross-sectional study,

1038
01:58:07,810 --> 01:58:11,170
the researchers cannot control the health status of recruits.

1039
01:58:11,530 --> 01:58:14,139
So participants with, for instance,

1040
01:58:14,140 --> 01:58:21,820
participants with worse cardiovascular health may be oversampled or under sampled in the survey compared to patients with good cardiovascular health.

1041
01:58:22,990 --> 01:58:27,700
And then another limitation is that the exposure is measured somewhat subjectively,

1042
01:58:28,210 --> 01:58:33,850
and individuals likely have different opinions on what income values indicate lower middle and upper class.

1043
01:58:34,510 --> 01:58:42,819
However, I constructed this because it's this way, because instead of using like actual income values,

1044
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:48,010
because there are different ages in the survey and the average household income at the time,

1045
01:58:48,010 --> 01:58:51,639
a 70 year old as a child was different from the average household income.

1046
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:53,230
At the time, a 40 year old has a child.

1047
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:59,430
So it would not have been possible to choose specific income values for each income level that would be applicable to.

1048
01:59:09,910 --> 01:59:22,090
Yes. Um, I honestly not really.

1049
01:59:22,090 --> 01:59:33,150
I wanted to get like a middle range for age because extremes that either of that could be that could lead to like skewed data.

1050
01:59:33,220 --> 01:59:45,290
That's. Yeah, that's. Is there a reason that you want to look at the numbers of the household in childbirth period versus any other time period?

1051
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:52,730
Yes, because and that was kind of a large study because there isn't a ton of intelligence out

1052
01:59:52,730 --> 01:59:59,120
there on just a child per household income and how that relates to future adult health.

1053
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:11,710
What do you think's going on there? Why do you think that that's the most impactful? Because childhood is where we learn our habits.

1054
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:18,820
In my opinion, and I think they can be hard to break. So, yeah, it's just a very.

1055
02:00:25,770 --> 02:00:39,280
How? Well, it's defined by the participants opinions of what that is, which is why it's so it's very subjective.

1056
02:00:40,540 --> 02:00:44,410
So their perception of their income.

1057
02:00:47,540 --> 02:00:58,220
But. But.

1058
02:01:02,210 --> 02:01:05,990
Yeah. Yeah. Now it can be a drawback.

1059
02:01:06,320 --> 02:01:12,090
Yes. Because in order to account, like I said, for the age distribution.

1060
02:01:13,530 --> 02:01:20,760
But yeah, I think it's just it's just a subjective thing that it's something that.

1061
02:01:24,310 --> 02:01:27,310
You mentioned lack of generalizability or limitations.

1062
02:01:27,940 --> 02:01:32,469
Do you have any ideas on how? Yes.

1063
02:01:32,470 --> 02:01:41,350
I mean, I think if I had designed it in a way that would account for more communities throughout America like and Haynes,

1064
02:01:41,350 --> 02:01:44,680
those publicly available data sets do.

1065
02:01:46,880 --> 02:02:06,000
So, yes. A couple of questions related to some questions you've already heard a little bit.

1066
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:15,630
So in terms of your measurement, you're asking people to report their perception of their childhood economic status.

1067
02:02:16,020 --> 02:02:23,180
And you're using the categories that you're planning to use are low social class, middle social class like.

1068
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:28,860
That's what you're going to use. I was wondering if you might think about using something like.

1069
02:02:29,400 --> 02:02:35,100
Do you remember when we talked about the ladder in class where where you could ask people

1070
02:02:35,100 --> 02:02:40,649
to think back on their childhood and kind of where their family ranked on that ladder,

1071
02:02:40,650 --> 02:02:51,450
if that might be helpful? Yeah, I think sometimes people there's not really like a shared understanding in the US of what social class means.

1072
02:02:51,450 --> 02:02:53,980
And so you might have some confusion there. Yeah.

1073
02:02:54,090 --> 02:03:01,680
And it might also depend on their current level of income, how they perceived their childhood income.

1074
02:03:01,740 --> 02:03:04,890
You know what I mean? Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Yeah.

1075
02:03:05,550 --> 02:03:10,140
So that's that's one thing you can think about. And then related to Olivia's question,

1076
02:03:10,140 --> 02:03:23,220
I was wondering if you thought about whether their current socioeconomic status might be a mediator helping to explain or possibly an effect modifier?

1077
02:03:23,250 --> 02:03:24,570
I wondered what you thought about that.

1078
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:30,870
Yeah, I definitely thought about that because, I mean, my model I was looking at like, oh, this is pretty simple.

1079
02:03:31,050 --> 02:03:34,650
But the mediating I did think about.

1080
02:03:34,650 --> 02:03:44,430
Yeah, because that definitely influences health and history as my background so very strongly associated.

1081
02:03:44,850 --> 02:03:48,270
So yeah, I definitely would consider putting that as a mediator.

1082
02:03:48,510 --> 02:03:54,899
Yeah, yeah, you could do that. But it sounded like you also had a, uh, a behavioral hypothesis too, that like,

1083
02:03:54,900 --> 02:04:00,660
if behaviors that are really important for cardiovascular health are established in childhood,

1084
02:04:01,080 --> 02:04:09,870
and then even if your ex changes, those don't change, then you could see that early life has a bigger impact and maybe current doesn't matter as much.

1085
02:04:09,870 --> 02:04:15,560
So you could test them. The phone does not through my fingers.

1086
02:04:15,570 --> 02:04:19,100
Does anyone else have this problem? I don't understand that.

1087
02:04:19,390 --> 02:04:22,990
Anyway, um. But. Yeah, so I think you could look at.

1088
02:04:23,780 --> 02:05:06,440
Yeah. Okay. Thank you. All right.

1089
02:05:06,450 --> 02:05:07,979
So my name is Jackie Walker.

1090
02:05:07,980 --> 02:05:17,340
And for my study, I wanted to propose an exploratory study into impacts high risk behavior transmission and vaccine hesitancy among gay,

1091
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:24,090
lesbian, bisexual, bisexual and excuse me, so a brief presentation overview.

1092
02:05:24,090 --> 02:05:32,070
I'll go over my background aims and public health relevance as well as my proposal limitations, protection for human subjects and the timeline.

1093
02:05:33,660 --> 02:05:40,260
So brief background. First, in the past few weeks, the W.H.O. renamed monkeypox to impacts.

1094
02:05:40,650 --> 02:05:45,090
So if there are there there are everything should be updated in the presentation.

1095
02:05:45,090 --> 02:05:51,780
But monkeypox is now empty. So just so everyone's aware, in July of 2022,

1096
02:05:51,780 --> 02:05:59,170
the World Health Organization declared the spread of sparks a global health emergency and called it stomach and pox.

1097
02:05:59,250 --> 02:06:04,180
There is a lot that we currently don't know about it, but it is thought to spread through skin to skin contact,

1098
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:07,530
respiratory droplets and fomites such as bedding, towels and clothing.

1099
02:06:08,250 --> 02:06:12,240
However, it is not a sexually transmitted disease. I just want to make that very clear.

1100
02:06:13,620 --> 02:06:19,049
In the 2022 and pandemic has infected more than 25,000 people in the US.

1101
02:06:19,050 --> 02:06:25,140
But fortunately it had a very low death rate. It has infected over 80,000 people in the world.

1102
02:06:25,860 --> 02:06:31,170
Many of those infected have been gay men, bisexual men or men who have sex with men who I will be referring to as,

1103
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:40,680
as and for the rest of this presentation. And many research methods so far have lumped all members of the LGBTQ plus community together.

1104
02:06:40,680 --> 02:06:49,050
Such as? Such as grouping MSM with lesbian women, bisexual women and women who have sex with women WSW,

1105
02:06:49,890 --> 02:06:53,730
as well as just trans individuals and other queer individuals as well.

1106
02:06:54,090 --> 02:07:00,210
So there's unfortunately with the current data that we have, very difficult to certify bisexuality.

1107
02:07:03,190 --> 02:07:11,560
So as you continuing on the overview, there is a fairly broad distribution of cases in the US and Puerto Rico.

1108
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:14,440
This was last updated December 7th.

1109
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:22,450
So cases have often been concentrated in cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago and New York City, and we can see that in just the distribution.

1110
02:07:22,450 --> 02:07:26,770
These dark blue states have more than 500 cases cumulatively.

1111
02:07:30,530 --> 02:07:39,080
So there are currently two vaccines available to that have been used to address and pass the ACM 2000, which I'm not sure if I'm saying correctly.

1112
02:07:39,260 --> 02:07:42,590
And the genius vaccine once again, also not sure if I'm doing it correctly.

1113
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:47,899
However, only the genuine vaccine is approved for and passed by the FDA and has been the

1114
02:07:47,900 --> 02:07:54,020
primary tool in containing and addressing the pandemic in the United States.

1115
02:07:54,950 --> 02:08:03,200
So the vaccines can be given to prevent and pass, but they can also be given after exposure and exposure to reduce the severity of symptoms.

1116
02:08:03,230 --> 02:08:11,780
We have seen differences in vaccine hesitancy among people in the LGBTQ community for COVID 19,

1117
02:08:11,780 --> 02:08:16,520
as well as Hepatitis A, HIV, Hepatitis B and other infectious diseases,

1118
02:08:16,760 --> 02:08:24,950
which is another reason why I wanted to explore vaccine hesitancy to see if this is a variable that is impacting the spread of impacts.

1119
02:08:26,750 --> 02:08:29,719
As a brief note, Impacts is no longer a public health emergency.

1120
02:08:29,720 --> 02:08:35,180
The Biden administration is letting that emergency order expire in the new year, however,

1121
02:08:36,020 --> 02:08:44,479
and pass has been endemic to countries in Africa for a very long time, and it has the potential to become endemic in other countries,

1122
02:08:44,480 --> 02:08:48,710
especially because we don't know what the reservoir hosts of parks are,

1123
02:08:49,430 --> 02:08:54,500
but we think that they are like small rodents and it just has the potential to become an endemic virus.

1124
02:08:55,430 --> 02:08:59,239
Additionally, after the failure of the HIV AIDS epidemic in the eighties,

1125
02:08:59,240 --> 02:09:03,020
I also wanted to emphasize that we need to understand transmission and ensure that marginalized

1126
02:09:03,020 --> 02:09:09,230
populations aren't stigmatized in order to reduce poor health outcomes based on sexuality.

1127
02:09:11,270 --> 02:09:19,300
So aims and public health relevance. The goal of this project is to just understand impacts rates and stratify cases further than previous research.

1128
02:09:20,060 --> 02:09:25,490
We can stratify based on gender as well as sexual orientation, but it's not reasonable.

1129
02:09:25,850 --> 02:09:30,560
So if our previous research is not stratified by MST and versus WSW,

1130
02:09:31,940 --> 02:09:38,600
I also wanted to explore vaccine hesitancy and acceptance rates among those most at risk for and pox transmission and infection,

1131
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:46,580
because especially LGBTQ individuals often have less access to routine health care and it's important to bridge that gap.

1132
02:09:46,940 --> 02:09:49,250
This was also highlighted by the COVID 19 pandemic.

1133
02:09:51,470 --> 02:09:58,250
So my project proposal is going to be a combination of cohort and retrospective study with case control analysis.

1134
02:09:58,940 --> 02:10:02,380
Because the pandemic is no longer an emergency, it is still ongoing.

1135
02:10:02,390 --> 02:10:04,520
New cases can be recruited into the study.

1136
02:10:04,850 --> 02:10:11,330
However, I also want to include previous cases as part of the retrospective study to kind of understand transmission as.

1137
02:10:12,130 --> 02:10:20,410
Cases decline. Retrospective data can be collected through prior contact tracing in major cities such as Chicago, New York and Los Angeles.

1138
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:27,730
And we can continue contact tracing as transmission occurs and go through convenient sampling to sample individuals.

1139
02:10:28,330 --> 02:10:33,220
Participants will be asked about their demographic information, their social networks and opinions on vaccines.

1140
02:10:33,490 --> 02:10:42,460
So this would include race, ethnicity, self-identified gender, or self-identified sexuality and other potential demographic information.

1141
02:10:44,080 --> 02:10:52,240
We will also administer this to new cases of anthrax, and the same information will be collected from old and new cases.

1142
02:10:53,500 --> 02:10:56,980
Controls will be recruited through cluster, cluster and convenient sampling.

1143
02:10:57,310 --> 02:11:02,950
So in-person recruiting fliers and targeted ads in gay villages can be used to recruit participants.

1144
02:11:02,980 --> 02:11:10,150
Many cities Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, Atlanta have areas called gay villages,

1145
02:11:10,150 --> 02:11:18,280
which are typically just areas that have higher concentrations of LGBTQ communities and just more spread.

1146
02:11:18,310 --> 02:11:21,790
It can be really hard to collect the kind of information.

1147
02:11:21,790 --> 02:11:30,340
So convenient sampling and just word of mouth is just the most realistic sampling method to collect as many people as possible into the study.

1148
02:11:32,260 --> 02:11:39,729
So my conceptual model is this I wanted to examine gender identity and sexuality and how that

1149
02:11:39,730 --> 02:11:46,270
might impact the risk of developing or getting exposure to impacts with vaccine hesitancy.

1150
02:11:46,510 --> 02:11:54,040
Risk factors such as demographic information and differences in behaviors of transmission to just understand what that might look like.

1151
02:11:58,210 --> 02:12:05,260
So for my part, for the data analysis, we will use regression analysis to examine different behaviors among the sample

1152
02:12:05,260 --> 02:12:10,389
population and stratified by sexual identity and gender identity rather than just one,

1153
02:12:10,390 --> 02:12:12,280
which is what most previous research has done.

1154
02:12:12,820 --> 02:12:19,090
We'll also adjust for other demographic information such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, health care, access, age,

1155
02:12:21,160 --> 02:12:26,860
etc. And we may develop several models to examine potential confounding mediating

1156
02:12:26,860 --> 02:12:30,550
variables that we just can't and might not be aware of because of the lack of research.

1157
02:12:32,290 --> 02:12:35,950
There are a few limitations to the study. The first is that there are.

1158
02:12:36,460 --> 02:12:43,330
We just don't know a lot about impacts, so it can be difficult to identify transmission and possible cases of exposure.

1159
02:12:44,080 --> 02:12:47,799
Additionally, this is not a randomized control study. This is a convenient sample.

1160
02:12:47,800 --> 02:12:52,210
So this data can't be applied everywhere and other in the future.

1161
02:12:52,540 --> 02:12:55,629
However, we're just trying to understand what those rates might be.

1162
02:12:55,630 --> 02:13:01,120
And because this is a more marginalized community, it can be really difficult to find and recruit people.

1163
02:13:02,770 --> 02:13:08,179
Additionally, subjects of impacts as well as your sexuality is still stigmatized.

1164
02:13:08,180 --> 02:13:15,250
So we could just have response bias and recall bias for registered cases as well as just people concerned about participating.

1165
02:13:17,290 --> 02:13:21,190
So protections for human subjects, because this is an observational study,

1166
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:26,230
there's no potential risk of getting impacts from participating in the study.

1167
02:13:26,260 --> 02:13:33,350
However, sexuality is still stigmatized, so hopefully privacy and confidentiality will follow university IAB guidelines.

1168
02:13:33,350 --> 02:13:35,260
And it's just something that we have to be aware of as we.

1169
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:49,320
So timeline, it's a little malleable kind of depending on how the impacts situation continues to evolve through four months.

1170
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:58,920
036 Pending IRB approval recruit retrospective cases and controls months six through child six through 12 Excuse me will analyze and clean our data.

1171
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:07,260
12 through 18 we will evaluate our managed group publishing and then ongoing through months zero through 12,

1172
02:14:07,260 --> 02:14:09,930
we will recruit new and parks cases into the study.

1173
02:14:10,230 --> 02:14:16,770
And it kind of depends on if cases continue to decline, we'll do less recruiting and they suddenly pick back up again.

1174
02:14:16,770 --> 02:14:34,110
We might go back to recruiting new cases. So I know down here, he said.

1175
02:14:39,010 --> 02:14:44,680
But I'm curious to know why, although, you know, it's not just sexually transmitted.

1176
02:14:50,750 --> 02:14:54,799
Yeah. So I think that's definitely one of the questions that needs to just be asked in this study

1177
02:14:54,800 --> 02:15:01,280
is while we know that it can be transmitted through skin to skin contact and sexual networks,

1178
02:15:01,880 --> 02:15:06,170
there's skin to skin contact through that kind of intimacy. So there's just that rapid transmission, though.

1179
02:15:06,170 --> 02:15:14,800
It is not an STI. I think that's just one of the things that we just don't know quite yet, because it's such an emerging problem in the United States.

1180
02:15:14,810 --> 02:15:21,380
It wasn't it's it is not impacting MSM or WSW in endemic countries in Central Africa.

1181
02:15:22,100 --> 02:15:24,650
So I think that's one of the things that we also just need to explore.

1182
02:15:31,180 --> 02:15:37,010
When you think about vaccine hesitancy, at least the time that this has happened to areas where you.

1183
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:44,010
We just came out of a period where. And I wonder if there any sort of like medicine.

1184
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:53,530
But then I got another one. But the other thing, at least from what I've heard and coming back from that it was really hard for people has been.

1185
02:15:55,200 --> 02:16:00,300
You have to show proof of contact with somebody who has been young, positive, and then get diagnosed yourself.

1186
02:16:00,630 --> 02:16:05,730
And then there's a lack of resources large. Yeah. So I know New York City based.

1187
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:10,230
I know. I know their their rollout more than I know Chicago's or ALS.

1188
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:14,700
But I know that the vaccine rollout was just poorly done.

1189
02:16:14,700 --> 02:16:17,190
The websites that were just incredibly difficult to use.

1190
02:16:17,490 --> 02:16:24,630
And we had we've had the genius vaccine stockpiled for many years, the issues we let a lot of them expire,

1191
02:16:24,900 --> 02:16:33,270
which led to a shortage and just a lot of like public health errors that just led to a lack of vaccination and a lack of good response.

1192
02:16:33,900 --> 02:16:43,680
And we should have learned from the COVID 19 pandemic, but we didn't. And we should learn from the pandemic, but probably not.

1193
02:16:44,970 --> 02:16:49,980
So yeah, it would be really interesting to also look at this vaccine exhaustion,

1194
02:16:50,640 --> 02:16:55,500
especially because it's been very difficult to get vaccinated, but it should not have been.

1195
02:16:55,520 --> 02:17:02,130
Yeah, and I think I think some of those problems have been alleviated as we have caught up and as we have progressed through the emergency.

1196
02:17:03,500 --> 02:17:07,520
I'm not sure of that. No, definitely. I just thought of how these things might influence.

1197
02:17:09,980 --> 02:17:13,100
Hesitance isn't the word that I want to use, but it's the word that's coming to my brain right now.

1198
02:17:13,130 --> 02:17:18,580
Yeah, absolutely. Oh.

1199
02:17:27,030 --> 02:17:30,990
It wasn't. Until, like, July.

1200
02:17:31,710 --> 02:17:35,460
Mm hmm. So I guess my question is.

1201
02:17:42,640 --> 02:17:51,150
Show the number. Even though it might have been lower if it wasn't affordable, professionals might not have.

1202
02:17:52,340 --> 02:17:56,079
Oh. I think that's a really good question.

1203
02:17:56,080 --> 02:18:01,920
And to be totally honest, I was not aware that it wasn't a reportable disease until you brought it up.

1204
02:18:01,930 --> 02:18:05,200
So I think that yes, I think you can bring that to my attention.

1205
02:18:06,490 --> 02:18:12,170
And I think that's something we have to look into going forward. Okay.

1206
02:18:14,410 --> 02:18:23,180
But. I have two questions.

1207
02:18:23,180 --> 02:18:24,890
One may be unanswerable, I don't know.

1208
02:18:25,130 --> 02:18:37,640
But so my original question was whether men who have sex with men are the highest risk population in all places where impacts exist.

1209
02:18:37,640 --> 02:18:46,670
But you answer that and said no. So in places where it's endemic, do you know if there are groups that are at higher risk?

1210
02:18:48,650 --> 02:18:55,520
In places that's endemic, we think that most transmission tends to occur between like an infected animal and

1211
02:18:56,410 --> 02:19:01,340
like a human who interacts or is like hunting or is just like in contact with.

1212
02:19:03,200 --> 02:19:11,420
That post reservoir. Yeah. So I think it would realistically depend on just who is in contact with those potential animals.

1213
02:19:12,290 --> 02:19:15,860
So probably more rural. Probably more rural as well as just one market.

1214
02:19:16,520 --> 02:19:21,710
I see. Okay. But I don't know exactly for sure if that answers your question.

1215
02:19:21,740 --> 02:19:32,180
No. Know that there also isn't a lot of great surveillance in general in West Africa specifically, which makes it really difficult to explore.

1216
02:19:32,810 --> 02:19:35,810
And the cohort studies that have looked at all use the same dataset.

1217
02:19:35,810 --> 02:19:39,620
So it's really difficult to say. Yeah. And one last quick question.

1218
02:19:39,620 --> 02:19:44,010
Do you know why W.H.O. changed the name? Yes.

1219
02:19:44,330 --> 02:19:51,090
I'm sorry. Yes, I know. There. That was amazing.

1220
02:19:51,140 --> 02:19:54,380
Is there is this because you couldn't hold it in? Okay. Yeah.

1221
02:19:55,250 --> 02:20:04,670
So the reason why it was called monkeypox is because it was first identified in a lab monkey that was in,

1222
02:20:05,050 --> 02:20:09,290
I want to say, the U.K. or maybe in the Netherlands. It was called Monkey Pox.

1223
02:20:09,290 --> 02:20:12,920
But because it's endemic to Africa, it's like kind of resistant. And you're like, probably shouldn't.

1224
02:20:14,890 --> 02:20:23,740
She definitely should. So, yeah. So I think that just like it's fascinating, right, that these things kind of even go into the names.

1225
02:20:24,550 --> 02:20:29,630
Yeah. And I think the show has changed their virus naming guidelines.

1226
02:20:29,930 --> 02:20:32,590
Yeah, they definitely have. Like with COVID. Yeah.

1227
02:20:33,340 --> 02:20:39,650
So hopefully it's less of an issue, but they're still going back and retroactively renaming viruses that have the.

1228
02:20:40,820 --> 02:20:44,710
Named with. Prior to the.

1229
02:20:46,600 --> 02:20:54,250
All right. Will ask you.

1230
02:21:18,730 --> 02:21:29,930
They? Hey.

1231
02:21:30,140 --> 02:21:38,270
So I'm Hannah, and my proposal topic is barriers to mental health care and the role of demographic and socioeconomic factors,

1232
02:21:38,690 --> 02:21:47,180
specifically in the context of Hurricane Fiona. So a little bit about mental health in the United States and barriers to mental health treatment.

1233
02:21:47,510 --> 02:21:53,659
As we know, as public health professionals, mental health is a pressing public health issue, especially in the United States.

1234
02:21:53,660 --> 02:21:56,150
One in five adults has a mental illness.

1235
02:21:56,480 --> 02:22:03,500
And because of the relationship of mental illness with diseases such as cardiovascular disease as well as productivity of the workplace,

1236
02:22:03,980 --> 02:22:11,060
these incur a significant physical or excuse me, reason for significant costs to physical health in the economy, especially in the United States.

1237
02:22:11,810 --> 02:22:15,230
Unfortunately, many people experience barriers to mental health treatment.

1238
02:22:15,590 --> 02:22:19,249
These can include actual factors such as costs, transportation.

1239
02:22:19,250 --> 02:22:26,210
Whether the provider accepts your insurance, they can also be internal barriers such as your stigma or judgment by others.

1240
02:22:26,690 --> 02:22:30,830
And all of these barriers are heavily impacted by socioeconomic factors.

1241
02:22:31,970 --> 02:22:36,980
But one barrier that is largely overlooked is the idea of the influence of widespread and

1242
02:22:36,980 --> 02:22:41,930
devastating events such as natural disasters and the ability to seek mental health treatment.

1243
02:22:42,380 --> 02:22:45,110
And so that will be a main focus of the rest of my presentation.

1244
02:22:46,640 --> 02:22:51,890
So a little bit about the current research into mental health treatment barriers and natural disasters.

1245
02:22:52,100 --> 02:22:58,300
It is limited, but I was able to find some research that focuses on natural disasters ranging from COVID,

1246
02:22:58,490 --> 02:23:05,210
Gulf Coast disasters and Hurricane Katrina and the barriers that they found are listed in the middle column of this table.

1247
02:23:05,450 --> 02:23:08,630
But I really want to draw your attention to the study limitations,

1248
02:23:09,170 --> 02:23:14,870
some of which are or excuse me, many of which are related to generalizability and scope.

1249
02:23:15,320 --> 02:23:21,230
And so, for example, in the COVID 19 study, which found a major barrier as being access to digital therapy,

1250
02:23:21,530 --> 02:23:27,019
especially among some socioeconomic groups, this study was conducted from provider's perspective,

1251
02:23:27,020 --> 02:23:31,819
and so it misses some patient level barriers that may be very important when people

1252
02:23:31,820 --> 02:23:35,720
decide whether or not to seek mental health or mental health care treatment.

1253
02:23:36,230 --> 02:23:41,629
And then by and large, I also just want to draw attention to the idea that there is very limited evidence regarding

1254
02:23:41,630 --> 02:23:46,040
links between barriers and socioeconomic factors in the context of natural disasters.

1255
02:23:46,040 --> 02:23:50,690
And so addressing as many of these limitations as I can is a focus of my study.

1256
02:23:52,130 --> 02:23:57,050
But in order to look into these relationships, I needed to select a natural disaster of interest.

1257
02:23:57,230 --> 02:24:00,350
And so I chose Hurricane Katrina for a few different reasons.

1258
02:24:00,650 --> 02:24:04,790
But one of them is that it is one of the most recent natural disasters in the United States.

1259
02:24:05,090 --> 02:24:11,780
And so it allows us to look at the barriers that it inflicted with relatively minimal recall bias.

1260
02:24:12,410 --> 02:24:19,880
So a little bit about Hurricane Fiona. It touched down in Puerto Rico, among some other areas on September 17th of 2022.

1261
02:24:20,210 --> 02:24:28,400
And it was a Category four hurricane that claimed the lives of 25 people and left many, many others without power and water for over ten days.

1262
02:24:30,990 --> 02:24:33,030
And finally, before I get to study design,

1263
02:24:33,030 --> 02:24:39,120
I just want to touch on why it's so important to study mental health care barriers in the context of natural disasters.

1264
02:24:39,480 --> 02:24:45,600
We, as public health professionals know that natural disasters aren't going anywhere due to increasingly increasing global warming.

1265
02:24:46,560 --> 02:24:51,000
There's a couple of news articles here that point out how how common they become and are becoming,

1266
02:24:51,960 --> 02:24:58,230
in addition to the idea that there's very limited mental health funding as it relates to the aftermath of natural disasters.

1267
02:24:58,230 --> 02:25:04,950
And so it's very important for us to understand how we can make informed decisions regarding resource allocation and funding allocation.

1268
02:25:06,950 --> 02:25:13,609
So the aims of my study are twofold. The first is to evaluate barriers to mental health care experienced after Hurricane

1269
02:25:13,610 --> 02:25:17,000
Fiona by Puerto Rican residents who perceive a need for mental health care,

1270
02:25:17,450 --> 02:25:23,360
as well as to examine socio socioeconomic and demographic predictors of the nature and quantity of these barriers.

1271
02:25:25,490 --> 02:25:30,390
So this is the conceptual model that the study is revolved around.

1272
02:25:30,470 --> 02:25:35,570
So you'll see in the bottom we have the relationship between Hurricane Fiona and the Hunter barrier.

1273
02:25:36,440 --> 02:25:43,340
These barriers are also impacted by socioeconomic and demographic factors, including age, gender, income, these sorts of things.

1274
02:25:43,940 --> 02:25:51,650
And then a confounding influence is being exerted on both these barriers and the demographic and socioeconomic factors by two main,

1275
02:25:52,610 --> 02:25:57,620
main factors which are mental health status and municipality of residence within Puerto Rico.

1276
02:25:57,920 --> 02:26:02,900
And so I'll talk a little bit more about these later, but we will control for them in our analysis.

1277
02:26:04,890 --> 02:26:11,100
So this study will be a retrospective cross-sectional follow a retrospective cross sectional design.

1278
02:26:11,340 --> 02:26:19,620
The period of interest will be a very acute three month period, beginning when Hurricane Katrina touched down in Puerto Rico on September 17.

1279
02:26:20,380 --> 02:26:27,060
Valid through December 17th of 2022. In order to be included in the study, participants will be at least 18 years old.

1280
02:26:27,390 --> 02:26:32,280
A resident of Puerto Rico, since at least August of 2022, right up until the hurricane hit.

1281
02:26:32,700 --> 02:26:38,040
And then they will have a perceived need for mental health treatment, which we will confirm using the question shown here.

1282
02:26:38,850 --> 02:26:46,470
We have a recruitment goal of 300 individuals, which will be we will recruit using random digit dialing,

1283
02:26:46,770 --> 02:26:57,900
which is a method that you use by selecting area codes in the geographic area of interest and then randomly generating cell phone numbers in order to

1284
02:26:57,960 --> 02:27:06,630
your cell phone and telephone numbers in order to reach potential study participants and individuals who we reach who are interested in participating,

1285
02:27:06,630 --> 02:27:13,830
will provide their important then. In order to collect data, we will use an online Qualtrics survey.

1286
02:27:14,160 --> 02:27:19,140
We'll collect data on demographic and socioeconomic information and variables listed here.

1287
02:27:19,710 --> 02:27:24,810
We will also collect the mental health status information measured via the Patient Health Questionnaire nine,

1288
02:27:24,810 --> 02:27:31,049
which is an objective way of measuring how depressed and relatively anxious they are as individuals.

1289
02:27:31,050 --> 02:27:39,060
And then finally, in order to capture the barriers that they may be experiencing, we'll use the barriers to access to care evaluation or face skill,

1290
02:27:39,420 --> 02:27:43,530
which captures both those internal and external barriers that I was talking about earlier.

1291
02:27:44,280 --> 02:27:49,439
And then because natural disasters inflict such unique barriers to mental health care,

1292
02:27:49,440 --> 02:27:52,980
there will be an option to write in other barriers that were captured via this.

1293
02:27:54,770 --> 02:28:00,530
Data analysis will begin with sort of this pre analysis phase and which will recode the right and answers

1294
02:28:00,530 --> 02:28:05,780
to the open ended question I just talked about either to an existing category in the base scale,

1295
02:28:05,780 --> 02:28:13,400
if it fits in with something that exists already or to a new category to capture overarching themes cited by at least four participants.

1296
02:28:14,330 --> 02:28:18,139
So to analyze and satisfy in one,

1297
02:28:18,140 --> 02:28:25,459
we will use descriptive statistics to indicate which barriers will be reported and then to satisfy into we will conduct multi normal

1298
02:28:25,460 --> 02:28:33,650
logistic regression models in order to in order to understand what the predictors of the nature and quantity of periods are.

1299
02:28:34,340 --> 02:28:40,190
Both models will include predictors including age, gender, race, education and income,

1300
02:28:40,190 --> 02:28:43,640
and will adjust for versatility of residence and mental health status.

1301
02:28:45,790 --> 02:28:51,280
The timeline for the study is relatively simple and takes place over the course of 2023.

1302
02:28:51,640 --> 02:28:56,050
So in January 2023 is when we expect recruitment and data collection to begin.

1303
02:28:56,560 --> 02:29:04,860
The summer of 2023 is when we expect the recruitment to conclude and analysis to begin later in the fall.

1304
02:29:04,870 --> 02:29:14,440
So around September we will excuse me from we will conclude analysis and then later that year we will expect to submit a manuscript.

1305
02:29:16,390 --> 02:29:23,250
So the study is not without its limitations. For those familiar with the method of random digit dialing, it can certainly be slow and inefficient.

1306
02:29:23,260 --> 02:29:30,490
You may reach people who don't live in Puerto Rico at all, and you also may reach numbers that don't exist.

1307
02:29:30,880 --> 02:29:38,110
And so we expect to supplement these recruitment strategies with advertising in local grocery stores and public spaces,

1308
02:29:38,440 --> 02:29:45,700
as well as television and social media advertising. These study findings may not generalize to other geographic areas impacted by

1309
02:29:45,700 --> 02:29:50,220
natural disasters simply because each natural disaster in the area impacts is.

1310
02:29:50,260 --> 02:29:55,720
Such is very unique and there are many ways and many types of natural disasters.

1311
02:29:56,560 --> 02:30:05,290
And then by using methods with random digit dialing, we're assuming that Puerto Rican residents have cell phones.

1312
02:30:05,650 --> 02:30:09,639
And so this already incurs a selection bias that we are aware of.

1313
02:30:09,640 --> 02:30:15,430
And again, advertising in public spaces is something that we hope to use to overcome that.

1314
02:30:16,420 --> 02:30:23,650
And then finally, even though I mentioned that using a very recent natural disaster such as Hurricane Fiona will minimize the risk of recall bias.

1315
02:30:24,460 --> 02:30:28,870
It, of course, is still present. And so that is something that we we recognize as a limitation.

1316
02:30:38,360 --> 02:30:42,880
Yes. But.

1317
02:30:46,120 --> 02:30:49,920
Yeah. Yes.

1318
02:30:50,520 --> 02:30:55,310
So I was wondering, just like in terms of generational. Older generations might.

1319
02:30:59,020 --> 02:31:05,490
Just wondering exactly from that interview. Yeah, that's a great question.

1320
02:31:05,500 --> 02:31:13,690
So that is I thought about that a lot, too. And that's why ages is a predictor of interest in my analysis.

1321
02:31:15,490 --> 02:31:24,010
I don't think I found anything. So I just I did find that in the study I looked at, for example, older patients,

1322
02:31:25,270 --> 02:31:31,390
especially because they do have sometimes these perceptions of negative perceptions towards medical care.

1323
02:31:31,690 --> 02:31:38,290
They are less likely to access it. And when they do, they're super unfamiliar with technology.

1324
02:31:38,290 --> 02:31:44,349
And so, you know, part of I think the reason why they found that barrier of accessing digital therapy is simply

1325
02:31:44,350 --> 02:31:48,030
because they don't know how to use the computer and cell phones and all of these things.

1326
02:31:48,070 --> 02:31:56,780
So I did find that, yeah. Yeah.

1327
02:31:57,350 --> 02:32:06,180
So I know you went over. That's really the how I maintain resources.

1328
02:32:08,470 --> 02:32:12,080
Why? Yeah.

1329
02:32:12,080 --> 02:32:17,660
So Hurricane Fiona was one of the most recent natural disasters that we have experienced,

1330
02:32:18,050 --> 02:32:21,590
at least in the United States or territories of the United States.

1331
02:32:21,920 --> 02:32:26,989
And so I wanted to minimize recall bias just because these studies involve people looking back and thinking,

1332
02:32:26,990 --> 02:32:32,270
oh, what barriers to care did I experience at that time? And so I was really just trying to minimize that as much as.

1333
02:32:34,060 --> 02:32:41,710
Does that answer your question? Yeah, those and sorry if you said before I also got to remember that those answers that weren't going to.

1334
02:32:43,830 --> 02:32:47,549
Too long ago, I heard. Yeah, that's a great point, though.

1335
02:32:47,550 --> 02:32:52,460
There were definitely many others that I could have blocked in at some point. I sort of just had to pick one.

1336
02:32:52,880 --> 02:32:56,690
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1337
02:32:57,080 --> 02:33:05,910
No, actually, that's a great question. Yeah.

1338
02:33:06,330 --> 02:33:09,630
I think it was I to bring you.

1339
02:33:13,320 --> 02:33:20,900
Yeah. Yeah, I was. I also. Often our first thought is like, how is it?

1340
02:33:23,270 --> 02:33:27,700
Yeah, that's right. In terms of.

1341
02:33:28,180 --> 02:33:32,280
Sources for the U.S.

1342
02:33:33,460 --> 02:33:42,370
Able to have. But it's not like what you're.

1343
02:33:45,060 --> 02:33:48,640
Have been. So.

1344
02:33:51,510 --> 02:33:54,680
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

1345
02:33:54,690 --> 02:33:55,620
That's a great question.

1346
02:33:55,620 --> 02:34:04,379
And actually, so our study, it should have been included here will provide necessary mental health care support to participants.

1347
02:34:04,380 --> 02:34:11,950
And so one thing that I also want to say about that, though, is that's also like a federally available resource.

1348
02:34:12,060 --> 02:34:18,480
So like, um, I was just looking at this recently where, you know, if, if natural disaster strikes,

1349
02:34:18,780 --> 02:34:24,360
um, federal emergency funds can tap into these resources for like crisis mental health care.

1350
02:34:24,780 --> 02:34:33,870
However, people who may know mental health, there was a very expensive bill just passed by the Biden administration,

1351
02:34:33,870 --> 02:34:39,059
and it didn't, at least from what I understand, it doesn't cover those sorts of emergency mental health funds.

1352
02:34:39,060 --> 02:34:44,370
It's more related to community care and community based mental health centers and things like that.

1353
02:34:44,370 --> 02:34:51,720
So it's very important. I, it just reinforces your point that, um, including mental health care as a part of our approach is going to be.

1354
02:34:57,260 --> 02:34:58,700
What will hopefully be a quick question.

1355
02:35:00,110 --> 02:35:08,360
So I imagine that experiencing a natural disaster could either trigger a new mental health condition like PTSD or something like that,

1356
02:35:08,360 --> 02:35:12,140
or it could exacerbate, in addition, an existing condition.

1357
02:35:12,590 --> 02:35:19,880
And I'm wondering how you might, like, account for those differences in your in your study?

1358
02:35:20,170 --> 02:35:33,200
Mm hmm. I thought about this, too. And I think the short answer, which may not be a satisfying one, is that I don't know that it needs to be.

1359
02:35:33,500 --> 02:35:35,650
Yeah, Abby, it doesn't matter. Yeah.

1360
02:35:35,660 --> 02:35:43,910
And I think that, you know, regardless of whether you were experiencing or mental health concerns prior to the disaster or after,

1361
02:35:43,910 --> 02:35:51,980
the need is still present. And so I sort of just would think that or hope that we would be able to capture the barriers experienced by anyone.

1362
02:35:52,670 --> 02:35:55,160
Yeah. No, I think that's I think that's absolutely true.

1363
02:35:55,880 --> 02:36:02,040
One thing that I think could make a difference, that you could see different barriers listed by those two different groups,

1364
02:36:02,460 --> 02:36:09,250
because I could imagine that some people are experiencing new onset of a condition and might not even know where to look,

1365
02:36:09,260 --> 02:36:13,790
whereas people who had been in care may not be able to access their provider.

1366
02:36:13,790 --> 02:36:17,159
And so it could be like different types of barriers. Absolutely.

1367
02:36:17,160 --> 02:36:21,680
And for that reason, I think, you know, if we could collect information on, you know,

1368
02:36:21,710 --> 02:36:27,170
past mental health experiences versus we will be able to try to have that be interesting to see if there.

1369
02:36:41,320 --> 02:36:45,530
All right, that's it. You guys did an amazing job.

1370
02:36:45,540 --> 02:36:48,680
I really enjoyed listening to all of your presentations.

1371
02:36:48,690 --> 02:36:54,540
I'm excited to read your papers. That's what I'll be doing all day, every day for the next week.

1372
02:36:55,890 --> 02:37:00,870
If you're wondering what I'll be up to, either I want to say anything at all.

1373
02:37:00,900 --> 02:37:04,440
So we did get, I think 20 people filled out the evaluation.

1374
02:37:04,440 --> 02:37:09,389
So thank you. If you haven't had a chance to do it yet, it's still open, I think, until Sunday.

1375
02:37:09,390 --> 02:37:14,129
So you've got one last chance to fill it up as you leave.

1376
02:37:14,130 --> 02:37:16,500
Please take these donuts and Rice Krispies.

1377
02:37:16,500 --> 02:37:23,160
And I want to know from people who've never had a Rice Krispies treat what they if you tried one, what do you think about Rice Krispies treats?

1378
02:37:25,430 --> 02:37:29,090
I suppose you've had one before, but. But thumbs up on that?

1379
02:37:29,600 --> 02:37:33,250
Yeah. Okay. All right. Thanks, everybody.

1380
02:37:33,260 --> 02:37:37,900
Have a nice break. Good luck with your finals. Know?
