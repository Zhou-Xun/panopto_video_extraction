1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:14,370
So that maybe you can find out exactly what you want to know.

2
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:25,340
And I want to talk to you about actions besides racism.

3
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:36,270
When I see. Oh, yeah. It's like I don't know where I want to talk about Mr. Obama.

4
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:57,840
You know, it's interesting that I'm hearing to thank you for being separated by.

5
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:16,770
Oh, yeah. Even though I know this doesn't it's a this isn't, say the room number.

6
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:27,060
I'll just go on over here. It's called, I think it is 26 and that is, it's on the second floor.

7
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:39,660
Ah you know, I don't know. I will go there. Okay. Yeah. Just come back if you don't know where you are, right.

8
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,520
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

9
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:53,540
Yeah, I know. It's funny because I can't do.

10
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:12,880
On the other hand, if they were to look at something that was going on, I suppose, you know, they might be.

11
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:34,410
10 minutes into this person and then he talks for a just a little just a very long time.

12
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:42,390
We're going to get started now, but there might be a few more people coming in because I think we're expecting like 30 people in here.

13
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:49,290
So I don't know where everyone's going to sit yet, but hopefully we'll figure it out as we go.

14
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,520
But welcome to the first policy lab.

15
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,330
So this is the discussion section 002.

16
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:03,930
I hope everyone is in the right place at DOT three is like over there and I can help you find the right section if you're not in the right section.

17
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:12,900
So today we're just going to do introductions and then if you have any other questions about the course so far, we'll talk about that.

18
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:18,410
And then we're going to go through an example case of like what you'll actually be doing in class.

19
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:24,149
We're not going to like do a case today and you won't need to turn anything in, but we'll go through what that will look like.

20
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,830
And then we'll set up and like next steps for the readings and for next week.

21
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:40,830
So we are going to have two introductions again. But my name, Maya, I'm your GSI I'm a dual with HP, and I'm also in urban planning.

22
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,590
And my pronouns are she her. And I'm honestly really excited for this class.

23
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:53,520
I didn't take it because I'm already in HP, but it'll be just really interesting to see the material and I'm really excited about it.

24
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,780
So we can just start with like your name, your pronouns are different.

25
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:06,220
You can say like what you're excited about in this class, or you can just share like why you're getting your mph or whatever degree you're getting on.

26
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,719
I know this class is required, so that makes it intense, but so why don't we just start,

27
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,050
like on this side and go this like, do you do you want to start?

28
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,340
I am attached is real issue or pronouns. I'm in HP G.

29
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,220
I've never taken like a policy class before, so excited that I've been into it.

30
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:35,130
So I'm me my friends are she her. I'm also from HP team and she has never taken policy question time.

31
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,140
Oh, wait, sorry. I want to. I think everyone here should be in HP.

32
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:47,630
Yeah, right. Okay. Oh, great. Okay, so we're all in not meeting, but everyone's in ACG, so don't say your department and I guess.

33
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,809
Sorry. Okay, you can keep going. Okay. Hi, I'm Alessandra.

34
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:58,590
I use your pronouns. Yeah. I've never really had a class in this topic, so I'm just, like, excited to learn more that morning.

35
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,920
Yeah. I'm Elizabeth. Are you she.

36
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:08,310
Her pronouns and some of the work that I've done within public health, I've learned that, yes,

37
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,620
health management and policies in almost anything, even if you aren't planning on going in that direction.

38
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:20,670
And Julia, she her. I also haven't done anything in policy, so.

39
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:30,120
Yeah, I'm married. Says she her. I'm a dual with law and I'm excited to see how things more explicitly connect.

40
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,479
Hi, I'm Andrew. I use it in pronouns. I'm really interested.

41
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,920
I works for some nonprofit organizations and they're chronically underfunded.

42
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:47,700
But sometimes other organizations also spend in not the best ways and manage their resources incorrectly.

43
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:54,180
So I'm really interested in just thinking about ways that we could kind of restructure what we're doing in terms of spending.

44
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:03,869
I'm Emma. I use her pronouns. I am hoping to go into health communication, post post-grad policies.

45
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:12,659
I had to take one in undergrad since I did the undergrad program here. It's not really my thing, but I'm so happy to love that.

46
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,770
Thank you for. Yeah. Hi I'm Grace I she her pronouns.

47
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:24,209
I'm a dual title student at the School of Social Work, and I have a criminal justice policy and a welfare policy class this semester.

48
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,650
So I'm excited to kind of expand on that with this and see how those two that's super cool.

49
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,680
Is that the class, the social worker class in social work?

50
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,280
So yeah, that's so cool. I want to take that class.

51
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,620
I think Cassie I usually her pronouns and I'm not sure exactly what kind of career I want to pursue yet,

52
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,640
but I feel like the topics that we're learning in this class are really applicable to any kind of public health positive.

53
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,510
So I'm just excited to delve deeper into that. I'm Annie.

54
00:06:53,640 --> 00:07:00,660
I use your pronouns and I'm a dual with social work and I'm really interested in policy and that sort of thing.

55
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,700
So I don't know much now,

56
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:15,089
but I'm excited to learn that I use her pronouns and I've never taken a policy has decided to figure out what I'm currently she her pronouns

57
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:23,040
and when I was debating between them which department of MPH you know insurance debating between each MP and intriguing interview 21 out.

58
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:29,330
So I'm interested to see that I'm missing out on everything I have.

59
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:38,270
Her degree in social work and policy is very much in my forte or an area of interest I do like.

60
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,229
I'm excited to get to be slightly less intimidated by this big thing.

61
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,410
Yeah. Hi, everyone.

62
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:54,239
I'm so. Hi. I'm a dual with a business school and I have a background in health care in the private sector.

63
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,120
So really interested in getting more public policy and public sector perspective and as far.

64
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:07,270
Hi. My name's Casey. And behind the pole. Oh, what can you see?

65
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,030
I could see. Oh, okay. Oh. Oh, I can move around.

66
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,569
So I use your pronouns.

67
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:20,470
And like people mentioned, this isn't something that I'm well versed in, but I'm excited to, like, add more tools to my public health toolkit.

68
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,880
My name's Becca. I use your pronouns. Like a lot of people, I know absolutely nothing about policy, so I'm excited to learn more.

69
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,420
Hi. My name is Mikayla Jones, a medical degree student with the School of Education.

70
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:43,230
I'm really interested in, like, broadly medical education and how we can improve it from the individual level, citizen level.

71
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:48,470
If I think this interesting point about policy and advocacy in medical education spaces.

72
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:53,510
I'm on Twitter, I issue a premium and I actually have a degree in public policy.

73
00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:02,600
So this is interesting. You know, it's. I am the GM and I have a vacuum.

74
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,460
So I was wondering how management and policy would help me over there.

75
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:14,180
And I've now had a class before, something like that. So my name is Mohamad.

76
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:29,090
I used to be really just interested to see how policy is utilized on the go, and I feel like I am at times sheer pronoun.

77
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:36,280
I would do the MBA and I have a background in health care policy and social science

78
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:42,570
and I'm just so excited to learn more about how it interfaces and everyone.

79
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:49,950
My name is derived from programs of as many people who are kids that have never had a class in policy before.

80
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,720
But I'm very interested to see more intersects with education.

81
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:05,370
And in terms of the way I feel a year from now, I'll do an average, but I never have the chance to an undergrad.

82
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,590
So of I'm about the intersection.

83
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,990
Sorry. I haven't got it. Oh, that's okay. Hi.

84
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,890
My name is Layla.

85
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:30,370
I use your pronouns first, and this is the policy, so I'm looking forward to learning a lot about it, and I think being here is a lot easier.

86
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:35,889
I was a healthcare administration minor, an undergrad, so I took a lot of healthy classes,

87
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:40,000
but they weren't really like hands on or more expensive process, things like that.

88
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:47,379
So I'm hoping like I'm like, okay, I hope this is fun.

89
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,660
Then you put the pressure on.

90
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:58,750
Do you want to introduce yourself just like your name, your pronouns, and like maybe why you're getting your mph or something like that?

91
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:07,840
Name's Alison. My point is, I think that there's I'm going to continue talking my health education, my first semester as a first year semester.

92
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:14,350
And I don't know how to start, so that's what I'm hoping to learn, he says.

93
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:20,050
I took the policy first in my undergrad last year, like my first year.

94
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:28,749
So really interested in reading too, that I'm interested in doing prevention in the career.

95
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:36,450
I tend to pursue my vision in public health and liver injury prevention department.

96
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:45,040
That's super cool. Well, there's also I get a bunch of emails about an injury prevention summer internship.

97
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,370
I don't know. Do you guys get that right? Oh, perfect. Okay.

98
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,850
I hope you get it. Okay.

99
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,190
Yeah. Hi. Sorry to put you on the spot.

100
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:01,300
Do you want to introduce yourself really quick? Just like your name and your pronouns.

101
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:08,620
I'm Jenny and I usually are. Right. Okay, cool. I think there's a scary setup here if you want or.

102
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:15,550
I was late. I know. It's okay. You know, it's just such a weird set up here.

103
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:25,090
Yeah. Or. Yeah, you could sit here too. I know.

104
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,989
I'm sorry. Thank you. And just really quickly, what's your name? So I'm Tabitha.

105
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:33,940
Tabitha? Yes. Okay, it's all right.

106
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,290
Okay. Host This is maybe everyone, but I know it's confusing so.

107
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:45,909
Well, no. Um, okay, so just general things about the class.

108
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,360
You guys can obviously always email me if you have any questions.

109
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:55,870
Dr. Kenny really wants to try and, like, have a one like question board on campus.

110
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,279
So if you have a question about the course, you know, someone else would probably also have the same question.

111
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:07,059
So there's a way on campus where you can like ask questions and if you don't want it, make it.

112
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,389
If like if you don't say your name, I think there's a way to make it anonymous.

113
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:15,910
But obviously, like if you really don't want to do it, you can just email me. But we highly encourage you to use the question board.

114
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:23,020
And then these are the discussion expectations that I compile from everyone from Monday.

115
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:28,030
So I actually really like all of these and they will definitely come up.

116
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:32,170
You know, when we're talking about certain health care topics,

117
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:37,659
things can get really personal when people can have opposing views or just really strong opinions.

118
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:43,389
So it's always good to just keep in mind our discussion guidelines,

119
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:48,820
especially on the first day and like keep them with us the whole time when we talk about these topics in class.

120
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,140
And then if there's any more like you guys want to add, we can do that, too.

121
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:03,200
So this is just like what we covered on Monday. But do you guys have any general questions about the course so far?

122
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,600
Because if not, we're just going to go into kind of the case analysis.

123
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,810
But I can answer any questions about like the general course if you have them right now.

124
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:21,800
Okay. So in policy, we call it policy lab, but it's discussion sections and same thing.

125
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:30,400
So in this class every week you're going to be with a group and then you'll have like 40 to 50 minutes to make a case.

126
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:35,300
And before class you'll read the case from the course back.

127
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:43,009
And then you just kind of like make your case. It's a slide deck and it should be around six slides.

128
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:51,680
You don't need to like do outside research. Everything is in the case and you also turn it in at the end of class.

129
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:58,819
So you also like you do all the work in class right now. And if you're not here so your group members will write your name.

130
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,889
I'm sorry, your group members will write everyone's name. Who's present on is when you turn it in.

131
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:12,860
And if you're not here, you'll have to do an individual one, but definitely try and be here because you only get like a few excused absences and

132
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,420
always just email me if you feel like you won't be able to make it to discussion later.

133
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:27,170
Okay, so these are the main components of the case, the situation like questions and brainstorming hypotheses, proof and action and alternatives.

134
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:31,879
And then today we're just going to go through like an example of what you guys would turn in.

135
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,710
The topic is the opioid epidemic. So all of the examples will be related to that.

136
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:51,420
So the first section is the situation and you will have to identify a problem, a decision or an evaluation like what is the topic of your case?

137
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:57,580
And so a problem is a situation where something important has happened, but we don't know why.

138
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:05,160
A decision is a case organized around an explicit decision, and then evaluation is an assessment like an intervention.

139
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,909
And so this is literally worth one point of your entire case.

140
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:14,190
So don't get too stuck on here. And also, you know, every case.

141
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:19,319
Can ultimately, like you can have evidence for it to be a problem or decision.

142
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:26,820
So as long as you have evidence to back up why you chose what you did, you'll get the point and it can be different from other people's.

143
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:36,989
So for this example, we would say this is a problem, and then you just give like a really brief background about like what it is.

144
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:45,270
You don't go into much detail here. So you would say like, you know, between 1989 and 2017, 400,000 Americans died of an opioid overdose.

145
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,280
And then, you know, kind of like, oh, like this is the problem.

146
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,440
Very brief, very quick. You don't have to go into much detail about this.

147
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:57,660
And then the next section is the required questions and supporting context.

148
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:06,809
And so this is when you really brainstorm kind of like why this is a problem and the underlying causes of the problem.

149
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:10,710
You still don't need to do outside research because everything is in the case.

150
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:18,569
But you go deeper into like why you think this is an issue and then there's also a health equity component to it,

151
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:22,680
and you definitely have to address that. You'll get points taken off if you don't.

152
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,450
But you you can't just say like there are inequities present in the opioid epidemic.

153
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:34,349
You have to kind of go deeper about why and give substantial reason in detail

154
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:38,309
and evidence that everything is really based on evidence and it's in the case.

155
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:44,720
So. That's really honestly the case is like the gold standard of what you have to do.

156
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:53,860
And so. Oh, yeah. So then these are the questions. So you can brainstorm like, why is this happening?

157
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:58,090
Um, you know, synthetic opioids, fentanyl is on the market.

158
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,620
And like who's responsible for the problem? Pill mills, deceptive marketing.

159
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,200
These are all reasons. And so like when you when you're in your like questions phase,

160
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:16,360
you're just gathering like all of the possible reasons for why you think this is an issue.

161
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:25,450
And then there's the health equity component, and then that leads you to the hypothesis, which is kind of where you state your recommendation.

162
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:34,620
So out of like the strongest explanation for why you think this is happening from the questions section,

163
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:39,430
you move forward with that in the hypothesis section and you only have to choose one.

164
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,049
But we're going to give you multiple examples,

165
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:49,600
but you only want one hypothesis and it's like your strongest explanation for why you think this is a problem or decision or evaluation.

166
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,800
And so, like one example could be, you know,

167
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:04,660
we believe that improving physicians pain management training will ultimately like decrease overdose deaths.

168
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:10,920
And then you would, like, give your reasons for that. And these are three separate examples.

169
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:15,390
We only want you to choose one. And it should be a statement.

170
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:25,470
And then you'll like later give recommendations for it. Or you could also say, like increasing transparency would help this problem.

171
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:32,880
Physicians should disclose their financial ties and like increasing transparency in the regulatory process.

172
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,390
And then another example could be changing the payment structure.

173
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:44,600
So not linking the number of prescriptions to payment for physicians.

174
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,400
And then the next section is the proof in action.

175
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,790
And so this is where you kind of gather all of the evidence to support your hypothesis again.

176
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,790
And then the action is kind of like how you would implement this.

177
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,010
So like policy recommendations and like what is needed to kind of make it happen.

178
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:20,230
And so for the proof, like you would give like stats on overdoses or opioid consumption or like physician prescribing.

179
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:25,150
And then this is like the proof kind of explains is the evidence to explain your

180
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:31,120
hypothesis and then the action is what you would do to solve the problem ultimately.

181
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:38,080
So the action could be. State.

182
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:46,659
Sorry. This is, like, a lot worse. Okay. The action could be like opioid prescriptions and pain management should have guidelines or

183
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:52,020
state health departments should have a centralized system to monitor all prescriptions.

184
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:55,070
And so that is kind of your ultimate goal.

185
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:58,210
So you went through like, this is the problem.

186
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:06,219
Our hypothesis is let's say you chose like physician transparency, increasing transparency,

187
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,730
and then your action could be State Department should have one centralized system.

188
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:15,650
And that is like one part of your case. And then the next.

189
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:25,220
The last section is alternatives and weaknesses. So you have to give one weakness to your hypothesis and then identify two alternatives about what

190
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,700
you're recommending and how the alternatives might strengthen your case or also weaken your case.

191
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,590
And so these are alternatives.

192
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:46,020
You do need to alternatives. And it could be like reducing the use of opioids for certain groups or strengthening regulatory oversight.

193
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:52,950
And then your weakness could be like, you know, private sector pushback from transparency,

194
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:57,900
because ultimately they make money off of not having a transparent system.

195
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:05,999
And so I know that was a lot that we kind of had to really fast, but these are all that was a lot of slides.

196
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,360
But your slides, you have to have at least six. We don't really recommend that you do more than six and you totally can,

197
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:18,210
but you definitely need at least six like a cover slide with the top edge and the names of your group members.

198
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:25,530
The situation section where you identify if it's a problem, a decision or an evaluation.

199
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:33,540
And then that is like a really brief section with a little bit of background on what you're choosing and evidence about why you chose it.

200
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:42,270
But you also have to say, like, you have to clearly state like this is a problem or this is an evaluation and then like reasons why.

201
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,540
And then the questions and brainstorming part, the hypothesis,

202
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:52,170
proof and action should be on one slide and then alternatives and weaknesses should be on another site if you're doing six.

203
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:58,660
But if you're not, you can do more than that. So are there any questions about the case at all?

204
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:07,820
Yes. Oh, sorry. Your name's Michela. Okay, so are the action items supposed to be like novel approaches or, like, everything from the example given,

205
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:12,530
like that example of, like, a heatwave and like, that's something that's already in place.

206
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:16,130
So our, our, our action items supposed to be something that's new.

207
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:23,870
So this is an old case that we're not using anymore. But from your like new case,

208
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:32,180
I guess identifying things that are not mentioned in the case or like strengthening what is already there could be a recommendation,

209
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:37,129
but you don't need to do like you don't need to do external research,

210
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:44,190
but obviously like you all have experiences and you all know things like you can bring that into the case and I think you.

211
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,270
Any other. Can we download these slides and just use them as a template?

212
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,180
Oh. Yeah, probably.

213
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,970
Okay. Yeah, sure. Okay. Yeah, I can upload them.

214
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,470
Yeah. So you talked a lot about, like, the problem on the side of it. What if you are doing an evaluation, like for the recommendation?

215
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:14,889
Like, is it we believe that we're on this side of the evaluation and then what do you do for the action in that case?

216
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:19,510
Is it still the same thing? Yep, that's a really good question for the evaluation.

217
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:28,870
So if it's like. Evaluating a community health worker program or something for the proven action.

218
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:34,300
You could. So your hypothesis could be like.

219
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:41,370
We propose that, I guess like after the evaluation of the case.

220
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:47,260
Sorry. So the case would be an evaluation of the program and your hypothesis could be,

221
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:52,780
you know, we think that this should be implemented or not based on the case.

222
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:59,980
And then your proof and action could be kind of like how you think it would best be implemented in like who could serve essentially?

223
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:09,720
Any other questions? Okay. Just logistically, so we have the same group throughout this.

224
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:14,510
Yes. So you have the same group. We have access to all the cases ahead of time.

225
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,500
There is, of course. But we'll just work. So we'll read them ahead of time and then come back up.

226
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,129
Where to put this line up for each class? Yes.

227
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:26,880
So there's one case per week.

228
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,860
So next week you have a case and then you'll read it before Wednesday.

229
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:40,840
And then you'll come in and. Like do the case in class and then there's no other work for like the case outside of class for.

230
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:49,690
Any other? Oh, yes. How long are they all?

231
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,979
Very. But I think they're like five, 5 to 10 pages.

232
00:25:53,980 --> 00:26:00,130
Not that long. One that's like 30 pages long. Oh, really?

233
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:05,410
Yeah. Which one? Reporter Did you guys.

234
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:08,620
Are you by the Caseback? The Korsak? No. No. Okay.

235
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,450
But she sent her link in an announcement.

236
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:18,070
So is in our inboxes. Okay. But I think that is essentially.

237
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,989
I mean, someone asked this question on Monday, like,

238
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:28,870
if you have to prioritize what assignments to do for this class, I would prioritize the case since.

239
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,650
Like ultimately you you'll need to know it for this discussion section,

240
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:40,070
but they do vary in length, but I think the one for next week at least is not 30 pages.

241
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,050
The COVID 19 global shutdown one is okay, okay.

242
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:48,110
I don't know how much of those graphs, but it's still okay.

243
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:55,220
It looks like a lot. Yes, yeah. Yes.

244
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:00,500
Sorry you already mentioned this, but let's just be one person in your group who submits the like,

245
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:06,049
yes, we're going to make groups on campus for your group.

246
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:09,800
So only one person is systematic. And what's your name again?

247
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:18,020
Cassie. Cassie. Yeah. Um, are we actually grading or is it, like, been created for completion?

248
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:36,890
No. Yeah, you're actually greater, but I'm pretty sure in the assignment the rubric is like in canvas and essentially like,

249
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,700
okay, so for the, the situation section,

250
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,770
like we really just talk about this a lot because it is one point,

251
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:52,639
but like you will not get full credit if you don't explicitly say like this is a problem or like this is a decision.

252
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,780
And then if you provide evidence for why you believe it's that so.

253
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,670
Like there are components and you will be graded.

254
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:11,310
But. I don't think like no, I don't think anyone will get a zero on any of the case unless you like don't turn it in.

255
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,910
But yet you are creating to provide incentives for everything.

256
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:23,210
Like, you know, I appreciate to prepare a start.

257
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:35,400
Yes. Is there any Tim. Okay. So I was just wondering if there's a reason why the prospectus in this company was like other classes are and.

258
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:43,319
Yeah. That's like, not an option. If it would be problematic if one one person got it.

259
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,500
And then we just have many who do it. No. Yeah.

260
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:50,340
I'm Tim. I am so glad you brought that up.

261
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,390
So I don't see. I don't.

262
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:59,140
Have you guys had quarterbacks from, like, Harvard before and t professors upload them?

263
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:04,350
Oh, no. Okay. Because I don't think you're like allowed to do that.

264
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,330
Just upload it to this.

265
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:19,260
Like, you have to actually purchase it and I cannot recommend that one person buy it, but I see about 30 people in here and it is $50.

266
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:24,120
And if you do the math, I don't know, but you guys can do whatever you want.

267
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:31,860
Don't tell me about it. Okay. But if someone upload it to Google Docs or something, put your Venmo information as well.

268
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:38,970
I can't hear that. Yes, I read our slides.

269
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:43,379
You know, you're you're so you're just uploading your slides.

270
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:47,580
You're not talking or anything. It's just group work and.

271
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:55,170
Sorry. What's your name again? Any other questions about the case at all?

272
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:19,520
Ridiculous. All of us are. So then this is just the late work policy for like all work in the class, not just the cases.

273
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:31,010
Everyone gets like one extension and you don't have to like ask permission for it, but you do just have to let us know that, Oh, I'll be doing this.

274
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:41,120
And then if you need additional extensions, please feel free just to reach out to us and we may grab them based like on a case by case basis,

275
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,830
but just like, don't hesitate to contact us about it.

276
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:53,420
And I guess I'm saying I'm your GSI, so you can just email me, but if you want to email another GSI, that would be all right.

277
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:03,460
Any questions about this at all? And then just attendance for policy lab.

278
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:11,990
You know, you do have to come to do the case and if you don't show up, you won't get credit for your case.

279
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,090
You'll have to do like an individual one.

280
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:22,430
And it'll just be probably more complicated for you if you don't come to class because then you'll do it by yourself.

281
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:26,089
But yeah, so just try and show up.

282
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:30,690
But we know things happen sometimes. Okay.

283
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:36,620
So, yeah, this is the case that you'll have to read for next week.

284
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,680
We don't have Monday class, but we will have discussion section.

285
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:50,360
And then if you want more information on kind of like how the different components of the case, this reading is really helpful.

286
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:54,319
Do you guys see it on campus or. I couldn't. Okay. Yeah.

287
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,240
So this reading is really helpful to you if you want more information about the case. But yeah, you do have to buy the course back.

288
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:08,719
You can figure that out amongst yourself. Okay, so just for office hours, I know like everyone's in the same department,

289
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:19,950
so like does Tuesday like 1030 to 1130 more or do I feel like a class or no to a class or it just I have a class but I class 1130.

290
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:23,860
Yeah. Oh, okay. So.

291
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,100
Okay, raise your hand at 1030 to 1130 on Tuesday. Works.

292
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,360
Coding. Okay. But class is starts at 1130.

293
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,770
What is it like Tuesday? Thursday. Cause it's just two days.

294
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,150
So it's Thursday work 1030 to 11:30 a.m.

295
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:52,299
12? Yeah. 1130. 12. It would be better, I think, on Thursday because one of the times of the day, so does 1132 1230.

296
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,920
You kind of work on Thursday for most people here.

297
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:03,750
Okay. And if it doesn't work, you can email me or like I can have other office hours, too.

298
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,670
Okay. And so now we're going to sign for groups. So 4 to 5.

299
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:12,390
What would you guys prefer to make your own groups or. Okay, great.

300
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:25,110
So in a group of 45 people, I would say, yeah, because this is my first semester.

301
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:29,349
I don't know how to get the last one. How is your back?

302
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:33,130
So you guys are wondering if we've got to go back.

303
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:37,810
I want to know.

304
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:44,700
Okay. Yeah, cause I write down on paper that I need.

305
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:53,950
Okay. So when you get in your group, have one person write down like everyone seem in the group, and then give me that piece of paper.

306
00:33:54,570 --> 00:34:01,030
I don't agree with that. You like to write it down?

307
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:07,300
I like that.

308
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:13,110
It's just a guy who writes for.

309
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:22,780
I mean, does everyone have a group?

310
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,750
Are there? Yeah.

311
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:31,040
I wonder if he wants to donate to a group of three.

312
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,240
Yeah, there is a group needs to be 4 to 5 people.

313
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,300
You can't have more than five or less than four.

314
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:46,830
We don't have every weekend we can donate.

315
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:56,060
I can donate myself. Yeah. Yeah. Julianne, remove five persons out.

316
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:03,750
Oh, yeah.

317
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:18,600
Well, I'm all I have, and I really think we have to remember what we're doing with all the water flowing out.

318
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:25,080
No, I think I was really wrong.

319
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:41,830
I. I started on that one, but I'm increasing the number.

320
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,350
No, no, no. Oh, this is my family here.

321
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:49,770
Oh, I am so close.

322
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:54,140
Is that. I like that. I like that sort of thing.

323
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,650
I don't like it. Okay.

324
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:04,130
Did everyone find their group? I mean, everybody has a group.

325
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:08,390
It's 4 to 5 people. Are they all four people?

326
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:12,970
Or. Okay. That's okay. Report.

327
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:17,120
Okay. Perfect. And then there might be more people.

328
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:25,490
I don't know. Well, okay. Any other questions about the case or the cause or anything?

329
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:31,849
I'll probably send. I'm on a Friday discussion section, but there I think it's nutrition people.

330
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:39,980
So I'll see if my office hours work for them too. But any other questions at all about anything?

331
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:45,110
Yes. You need us to like. You know, we are groups anywhere. Yeah.

332
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:53,570
Give me the piece of paper when you're done. But if you don't have any other questions, I think we're cool here.

333
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,670
So here's what it's like to go through.

334
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:03,100
It's great that I cover the media.

335
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,750
Yeah. I'm not expecting 25 minutes, so I should know better, I think.

336
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:17,860
No, it's okay. Yeah.

337
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:26,900
No, I don't think it would be a good idea, I.

338
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:41,860
You guys. Because I really don't like you.

339
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:55,680
And I don't really like what I.

340
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:00,520
What I wanna do. I.

341
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:35,070
You know, I have a credit. I mean, there are other things, but I think I just like what I said and that's all I can credit for.

342
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:45,159
That's what it's really like here.

343
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:51,000
You're talking about just I mean, you really like it.

344
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,210
I don't like the past.

345
00:38:55,270 --> 00:39:02,320
I was like, oh, you. Okay.

346
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:11,660
I like it. Yeah, I just.

347
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:27,930
I don't know. I mean, just. Yeah, I was like, I think in the middle of the summer.

348
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:39,540
You. Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know.

349
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:46,090
You know, I just, you know, find anything you like. Yeah.

350
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:53,400
Grandmother. This one.

351
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:57,600
I'm. I need more time for that.

352
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:11,370
I was supposed to celebrate giving them a year, a lot of time, so I'm not sure it's going to be very soon.

353
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:18,080
It's hard not to. I don't think you.

354
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:28,250
I think that everybody.

355
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:38,140
Right now.

356
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:42,970
We're out here, guys. Want to go forward?

357
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:57,550
Yeah. We want us to prepare for the hard thing like that.

358
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:01,120
Well, I wish I had.

359
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:12,800
I love you, and I hope that I can.

360
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:24,460
Yeah, I just wanted to ask for money.

361
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,800
Yeah, you know?

362
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:35,890
Yeah. I mean, I want my husband at home.

363
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,399
I don't want to be out of my head. And I can have a new government.

364
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,510
Does not mean everything I do.

365
00:41:56,790 --> 00:42:02,260
Like. I like.

366
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:15,670
I'm not. I'm not proud of myself.

367
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:19,360
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

368
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:31,180
Oh, okay.

369
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:38,019
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

370
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:43,239
It's amazing when I was able to help the number and. Yeah, I honestly, I don't know how to do.

371
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:59,830
Like, I just. I think, you know, but also she got exactly.

372
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:19,650
Yeah, right, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

373
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:33,810
To drive our. I just had to sign up for this.

374
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:38,060
I know. I know. I like to keep up with.

375
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:45,910
You know, there's other things that.

376
00:43:52,050 --> 00:44:00,510
It feels like Heather and.

377
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:08,320
Know. You break it out.

378
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:19,680
You know, there's a lot of you know, I find myself going there and I was like, you know, I haven't.

379
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:44,890
That's what you get. That's why. Do you ever have.

380
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:56,640
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

381
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:20,580
And like, you know, want and part of my. And I know that if I haven't heard that, I've never had anything in my life.

382
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:28,520
Yeah, that. But I got an idea. It's not.
