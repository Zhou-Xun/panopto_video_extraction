1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:08,520
Give it just a couple more minutes and see. There are eight people enrolled in the class, so this is a small class.

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:15,650
But I just want to see if a couple more people trickle in to any of, you know, other the other people who are.

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:26,260
I know. I just want to make sure.

4
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:27,830
Much. Okay.

5
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,729
I know a couple more people are supposed to be here today,

6
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:43,680
so I'm just going to go ahead and get started and they can drop in whenever I'm recording these classes every every class session on Panopto.

7
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,400
And so those will be available on canvas if you need.

8
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,320
If you can't make it to class or whatever. I want some clarification on something we talked about.

9
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,590
So yeah, welcome to case studies of environmental disasters.

10
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,130
I'm really happy to have you in the class.

11
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:10,980
I love this class. I just really enjoy going through these different case studies.

12
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:23,370
Obviously, they're terrible events, but they're really profoundly interesting and I think illustrate a lot of the mechanisms of toxicity

13
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,970
in a way that is more interesting and engaging than just kind of going through PowerPoint slides of,

14
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:38,430
you know, chemical reactions and that type of thing. So for those of you who don't know me, I'm Morris Pagoda.

15
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:46,710
I am a assistant professor in the department, and I also have an appointment in pharmacology in the medical school.

16
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:53,070
But my office is here in IHS, so this is where you would see me the majority of the time.

17
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:04,980
So welcome to the class. Today's class we will go through student and instructor introductions I and then I will

18
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,170
provide an introduction to the course and kind of the structure and the format of the class.

19
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:21,360
So again, one more person that was signed up that I don't see yet but and then I'll talk a little bit about toxicology basics.

20
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,110
So if we could if you if we could go through some quick introductions,

21
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:33,899
I know you get this in probably every class and it's maybe a little bit annoying, but especially for the smaller class,

22
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,780
I think this is kind of a nice environment where we can get to know each other a little bit better compared to some of the bigger,

23
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,820
more personal or less personal classes.

24
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,400
So these are the items that that we can just kind of get used to guide our introductions.

25
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:00,780
So they mentioned my name is Lawrence for Boda. My pronouns are she her and I am.

26
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,700
Originally I was born and raised in Michigan. I'm from the Flint area.

27
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,040
I lived in Grand Blanc, just south of Flint,

28
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:17,250
and did my undergraduate at Michigan State and Chemical Engineering and did my Ph.D. here in IHS in toxicology.

29
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,840
And then I did my postdoc at Michigan and I stuck it around.

30
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:34,930
And now I'm a faculty member. My research is focused on the effects of early chemical exposures, on cardiac outcomes in particular.

31
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:41,020
So how does exposure to chemicals like LED, PBS, arsenic,

32
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:47,860
those types of things during these early developmental windows like pregnancy, lactation and early childhood?

33
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:55,720
How do those affect the long term cardiovascular risk trajectory, cardiovascular health trajectory?

34
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:06,160
And I'm really interested in particular in sex differences as we are finding that a lot of chemicals have sex specificity in terms of their effects.

35
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:12,070
And we also know that many diseases, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease,

36
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:23,830
all sorts a whole spectrum of diseases have a lot of sexual dimorphism or sex specificity in their prognosis and pathogenesis and how they're treated.

37
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:36,670
What I hope to get out of this classes, I hope that you all get a great introduction to an overview of the toxic mechanisms.

38
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:48,070
There are some major kind of key mechanisms of toxicity that you will run into if you continue in environmental health sciences or in toxicology.

39
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:54,280
That I'd like you to be able to walk out of this class with that information and

40
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:02,380
then also getting a broader idea of hearing some about some of these different

41
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:09,040
environmental disasters and kind of the environmental justice issues and the policy

42
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:16,630
failures and the just the the what factors led to those environmental disasters.

43
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,110
A fun fact about myself. I am a mom of triplets.

44
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,930
I have two girls and a boy who are 11.

45
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,320
And they're going to be 12 on February 1st, which is just insane.

46
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:36,820
And I did my thesis defense when I was pregnant with them, and I was.

47
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,150
So I had them in February and my thesis defense was in November.

48
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:50,410
And I already looked like I was full term and it was just huge. But yeah, they're very healthy and I'm very grateful.

49
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:55,750
I also really love swimming, cycling and running.

50
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:04,090
I do a lot of triathlons and road races, like half marathons and marathons and some shorter races as well.

51
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:10,300
Yeah, and that's kind of my background. So do you want to start here?

52
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,260
Yeah, sure, sure. I'd like to highlight. Is she her pronouns?

53
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,780
I'm from Michigan, so about an hour away from here. And I'm a I'm an undergraduate.

54
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,760
So public health sciences, I've never taken a toxicology class before.

55
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,210
And this class just really interested me because, you know, you hear about like,

56
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,420
these disasters and like either, like, sometimes intentional or sometimes unintentional.

57
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:40,370
I always wondered, like, like why they hurt people or why like years later, we find like we find out exactly the same stuff.

58
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:49,000
So I was just intrigued to learn more. Yeah, you can see me around campus on my Margaritaville, like if you're familiar with,

59
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,739
like, Jimmy Buffet and it's like, yeah, as like, as we keep hearing it on,

60
00:07:53,740 --> 00:08:02,000
it is just like like that is isn't like yellow and it's is like 5:00 somewhere inside and it's like brown tropical, like with palm trees on it.

61
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:07,980
Oh, nice. Yeah. It's parked outside. Like rain, snow, like.

62
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,709
Yeah. Okay, you're another one of those I might get around to.

63
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,340
I have, like, snow tires on my bike. Yeah. Awesome.

64
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,950
Nice to meet you. Hi, I'm is my grandmother.

65
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:29,470
She heard I'm from Michigan. So also now I'm a first year master's student in toxicology.

66
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,750
I'm from Wisconsin,

67
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:37,120
hoping to get the better understanding of the mechanisms of different chemicals and then also learning how to read scientific literature.

68
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,980
Great. And then I dance for 16 years.

69
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:46,660
Oh, awesome. What type of dancing? Everything okay?

70
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,510
Nice. I'm my friend a I'm.

71
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:57,760
I'm originally from Ghana, West African. I'm a fancy master's in toxicology.

72
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:02,660
Like, just like I want to get fitness classes.

73
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:15,010
Uh, just like the real, like some examples of all of the studying bone toxicology, just seeing what actually happens, the rule.

74
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,230
Yeah. I like soccer. Awesome.

75
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,480
I'm Josh. He I'm pronouns.

76
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:34,010
I'm from Massachusetts and I'm an undergrad sitting sociology class.

77
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,100
I made my MPH next year, so I just kind of want to I don't know, I kind of public health.

78
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,640
I want to do so. Like, it's kind of like seeing different aspects of it, I guess.

79
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,140
Fun fact about myself is that I coach soccer.

80
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,880
Oh, well, that's so. Well, welcome.

81
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:59,409
Hi, I'm Maria. I see your pronouns. I'm from Detroit and I'm doing I'm a first year grads as well.

82
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:07,510
And I'm doing ecosystem science management at Sears. Um, but like for my undergrad at Environmental Science and then my mother's toxicology,

83
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:12,370
so like toxicology is really cool and I take more of like an eco tox aspect of things,

84
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,240
but like seas is more of like conservation and sustainability school.

85
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,750
So they don't really offer a lot of courses like this. I, I've been like kind of itching to get something,

86
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,950
but because that would overlaps with some other courses and they're asking the next week type of advisor.

87
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,300
Fun facts about me is I played hockey and shoot archery.

88
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:39,400
Awesome. I really miss reading their programs or seeing her in hers.

89
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,610
I'm from Dearborn, Michigan, which is like 30 minutes away.

90
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:50,110
I'm a senior on the B.S. Trucks and public health sciences, and I've never taken an environmental class.

91
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,959
And I remember in high school, the Flint water crisis was happening.

92
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,560
And so you never really learn like what the causes were like, how it was really detrimental to the children.

93
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:06,790
So I'm interested in learning more about that. Fact about myself is I play tennis, the whole family plays tennis.

94
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,080
I'm the oldest grandchild in 21, so we're all tennis class.

95
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,270
I said, Yeah, my my husband plays tennis as well.

96
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:20,260
I never remember anything that requires coordination and soccer and like how for me?

97
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,770
Hi, my name is Jason and I use them pronouns.

98
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:34,510
I'm from Royal Oak, Michigan. I'm I'm a second year student and Paige, but my focus is in industrial hygiene.

99
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,329
Um, what? I hope we get out of this class.

100
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:43,920
So I originally enrollments classes because I needed, like, one more class to do, but, like, now, the more and more I think about it, you know,

101
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:51,010
I've only taken one toxicology course like six or to like the essentials and that was like during my first semester now kind of reflecting,

102
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,960
I don't think pretty much from that class.

103
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,600
So I'm, I think what really excites me about this class is like just having like the case studies integrated with everything.

104
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,530
Hopefully let me retain more about, you know, like the mechanisms and all that.

105
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:10,329
Yeah. Um, and then a fun fact about myself. Um, I use the same font that I use for like my first class was boring and I like,

106
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:16,540
left my phone on the bus this morning so I know they can track it down. So yeah.

107
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:22,510
Did you have to use the find myself. Yeah. So I like had my iPad out was like trick in the house and then when it came around the same time.

108
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,640
Fernando Torres wow.

109
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,440
Well action packed start to the to the week.

110
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,300
Yeah, that definitely got my exercise. Yeah. I'm going to just shut this door.

111
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,150
I just noticed how they it's.

112
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:54,290
Distracting me. But if you all start getting warmer, uncomfortable, just let me know when we can open that back up.

113
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,580
So I'm going to give a quick introduction to the class and kind of the format.

114
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,920
So this is out of the syllabus.

115
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:17,110
But the overall objective of the class is to develop a critical understanding of how environmental exposures cause health disorders and disease.

116
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,670
So we'll kind of go from the molecular and cellular mechanism,

117
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:28,960
molecular and cellular level of toxicity all the way up to the particle physiologic mechanisms of disease.

118
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:37,900
And in understanding this in the context of different environmental disasters.

119
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:45,310
And then we'll talk about through the journal clubs and primarily you'll get a feel for the current

120
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:50,740
methodology that's used to assess and predict adverse health outcomes from environmental exposures.

121
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:59,770
So the course will be much more effective and enjoyable, obviously, especially for a smaller class like this.

122
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:09,100
If students participate. I know some of you are maybe more or less comfortable with with speaking up in class, and I completely respect that.

123
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:19,600
And just I want to challenge you to, you know, get out of your comfort zone a little bit and participate in class.

124
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:27,460
Part of your grade will include participation, but if you are sick, please do stay home and take care of yourself.

125
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,380
If you're having a rough week, you're run down. You're just not. You need to practice some self-care.

126
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:43,330
Please just let me know. You have some some family emergency, whatever, and we can arrange if you're absent.

127
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:51,460
And this is in the syllabus as well. The classes getting recorded on Panopto again and will be available on canvas.

128
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:59,130
So if you can submit a short written summary of your thoughts on the case study or the journal cover lecture,

129
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,130
whatever was covered that day, that would be great.

130
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:07,780
I'm going to open up so under the assignments and canvas that you won't be able to see it on there yet.

131
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:15,610
But I'm going to open up a place where you can post your your short little write up if you miss class that day.

132
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:29,410
So the first three days are kind of longer in terms of hearing me talk more, they'll be more lecture with a couple of short break out activities.

133
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:39,580
But then after that, we'll get into the case studies and the case studies will span two class days.

134
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:49,840
So for the first day, I'll talk about I'll start with the lecture, which could be 30, somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes ish.

135
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,170
And then each of you will sign up for a case study.

136
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,920
I'm going to post the sign up sheet for the case study.

137
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,610
All of the case studies are also listed in the in the syllabus.

138
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:12,520
I usually do the I usually cover the Flint water crisis and the lead topic myself

139
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:20,559
because we have more cases available than we have students a lot of the time.

140
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:32,870
And I work on web exposure so but the there are tons of other really cool case studies and I'll post those dates and you can pick,

141
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:41,350
pick one and sign up. And so then the next thing, the next part of day one will be a case presentation.

142
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,750
So you'll give a presentation on the case study. So what happened and who was affected?

143
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:54,490
What were some of the systemic factors that are failures that led to that event occurring?

144
00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:01,630
What was the outcome of the event? Is it still are people still suffering from this event?

145
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,440
What is the likelihood that it could happen again? Those types of things.

146
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:16,540
And the you have on canvas already some examples of PowerPoint slides from the case studies in the journal clubs.

147
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,790
So you can have a look at those and kind of get a feel for or what those entailed.

148
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:28,450
And then after that is just some discussion around the case study.

149
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:40,660
So you will develop a few questions from the case study and then the rest of the class will we can talk about,

150
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,480
you know, those questions that you that you pose. And it's pretty laid back.

151
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:56,140
I know people get really nervous giving presentations and especially when you have a couple of different presentations.

152
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,380
But again, this is this is really laid back. It's a small group.

153
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:07,450
So we just want to keep this, you know, a fun and interesting exercise the second.

154
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:17,800
A is a journal club. So what we'll do is you'll pick a journal article related to that chemical in some way.

155
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:28,820
So let's say you pick the methyl, assassinate the Bhopal India case study, which is a really fascinating case study.

156
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:36,010
And so then you would talk about the the metal assassinate release and kind of, you know,

157
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:41,840
environmental justice issues around that and whatever whatever details you find that are interesting that you want to share.

158
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:49,399
And then the next day would be the next class session would be a journal club where you've

159
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:57,320
picked a journal article on metal assassinate and some it's just some mechanism of toxicity,

160
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:03,320
of metal, of cyanide. And the rest of the class will read the journal article.

161
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,660
So I'll have you send it to me ahead of time and I can post it on canvas for everybody to have a read.

162
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:15,560
And then we'll talk about the Journal article so that the Journal Club presentation, you would typically,

163
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:22,210
I think, get a little more details in the next couple of slides on that, but basically have it.

164
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:27,440
How many of you have done journal club before anybody? Sort of.

165
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,510
Yeah, well, this is this is a great place to learn how to do this.

166
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:45,910
And if you are planning on staying in academic research for sure, but potentially other areas that you are constantly, you know,

167
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:54,499
up against some new you want to keep current on the literature and this is a way as

168
00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:04,460
a group to to critically read and evaluate literature in your field of interest.

169
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:15,020
So a lot of lab groups, you know, I did a grant, I was a graduate student and a postdoc here and our lab groups would do a journal club once a month.

170
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,850
So we take turns and each person in the lab would pick a journal article.

171
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:26,600
And most of them were related to, you know, some small subset of topics that were relevant to our research.

172
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:33,499
And then we'd read it all as a group and talk through it and talk about how it impacts what we do research wise,

173
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,720
and do we want to change anything based on those.

174
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:50,990
So it's a really useful exercise for learning how to read journal articles and be able to talk about them and and critically think through,

175
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,390
you know, what are the strengths and limitations of the study.

176
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:05,150
And so, again, you know, this is a small group, so I want you to to to feel, you know, comfortable, don't, you know, not panicky.

177
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:12,230
And this is a great place to to start, if you have to if you have to learn how to do this.

178
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:17,839
My post-doc mentor, when we would do journal clubs, I would get a lot of anxiety.

179
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:25,129
She would actually like drill us on the paper and expect you to understand every

180
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:29,540
aspect of it and just could be very it can be a very unpleasant experience.

181
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:40,100
That's not what I want for this. So we'll also have three guest lectures throughout the semester and those are on the syllabus.

182
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,260
I talked about class recording.

183
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:52,700
I want to mention that I find this to be kind of a long period for especially if it's a lot like on a day like today where we're just talking,

184
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,440
doing a lot. I'm doing a lot of talking and it's kind of you're sitting here in a lecture.

185
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,810
So I do want to take a break, a five minute break for every class,

186
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:12,769
roughly 1215 on these days where it's just lecture, you know, I'll break it up at some point during the lecture.

187
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:24,050
And then for classes where we're doing presentations, it might be between my lecture and the start of the case study or the journal club.

188
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:32,300
Yeah. So the Journal Club usually lasts 40 to 45 minutes.

189
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:41,760
And the so that that day, the day that we have the journal club, that's the only thing I have planned on those days.

190
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,440
A class. So you will probably be able to get out a little bit early on those days.

191
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:49,700
But other than that, the classes an hour and 20 minutes.

192
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:51,920
Yeah.

193
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:07,730
So for your assigned case study, I have readings on each of the cases and the chemicals involved in the case that I'll post every week on canvas.

194
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:15,020
So for the case study presentation, you don't need to worry about finding literature to send me to share with the class or anything like that.

195
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:24,780
I'll have any I'll have some information posted on canvas that each of you can look through and, you know,

196
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:30,500
it'll help facilitate the discussion and facilitate your understanding of the of the case study.

197
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:38,720
And then each student will be responsible for the Journal Club for choosing an article for their assigned journal club.

198
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:48,470
And since all of you are new to this, please feel free to let me know if you're having some trouble finding journal articles.

199
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,230
Have you? Do you all know how to do a PubMed search?

200
00:23:52,130 --> 00:24:00,440
So and you can look in like if you pull up PubMed, you can look at, you know, the, the dates that when articles were published,

201
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:11,930
you know, for journal clubs that we do, we do in our lab group, we tend to pick newer articles, but that's not necessarily.

202
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:22,079
I don't think that's necessary for this class. And the reason being that some of these chemicals, the mechanisms of toxicity,

203
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:30,330
have been known for quite a long time, and there's often not a lot of new literature on some of them.

204
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:41,760
So if you can't find a paper of interest that's relatively recent, you can go back, you know, just to find something that that is interesting to you.

205
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:51,180
For this, we want to focus on since this is a toxicology and mechanisms of toxicology class,

206
00:24:51,630 --> 00:25:00,330
I want to make sure that the articles that we're talking about are toxicology related and also mechanistic rather than descriptive.

207
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:11,030
Toxicology studies typically use in vitro or animal based models to explore a research question How does mercury cause neurotoxicity?

208
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:20,670
So maybe you have some animal study looking at that, but in an epidemiology, studies are by nature not mechanistic.

209
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:29,790
People in previous classes have used epidemiology studies for their journal club, and I think that's fine as long as.

210
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,770
It's not something like, let's say,

211
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:48,250
a biomarker study that is sort of that doesn't give you any insight into mechanism like lead exposure and genome wide DNA methylation.

212
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:52,810
And they just sort of. Don't give any insight into mechanism.

213
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:57,910
So if you wanted to pick an article on an epidemiology article,

214
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:08,860
then what you'd want to do is even if there not a lot of mechanism in the article you'd want to talk about in your presentation,

215
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:15,790
what are potential mechanisms that could be involved in this exposure and human

216
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:21,570
health outcome study based on what what you've learned in the class so far,

217
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,510
does that make sense?

218
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:33,670
And maybe, you know, and you can do that through searching, getting more information elsewhere about a chemical and its mechanism of toxicity,

219
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,240
and hopefully the lectures for each of the class,

220
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:44,030
each of the case studies will kind of focus on that chemical and how what is known about its toxicity.

221
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:54,910
So hopefully that will help as well. I know a lot of people get nervous about papers being very long and if you have a paper that's very long,

222
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:58,810
but you still want to you still want to talk about it, you're excited about it.

223
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:04,750
Feel free to just highlight a subset of key figures for the discussion.

224
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,230
And, you know, as we're reading these articles.

225
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:14,080
I know that a lot of you get stressed, you know, pressed for time.

226
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:19,210
And, you know, so I think reading the abstract,

227
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:28,810
reading some of the introduction and getting a feel for why they are doing this study and going through the the results, you know,

228
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:34,510
summarizing quickly, like going through the results section and looking at the figures and that will help

229
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:39,880
you get a feel for the study if you can't read the entire paper in its entirety.

230
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:46,030
And yeah, please see me again.

231
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:50,020
If you have any questions or concerns about this or need some need some help.

232
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,620
So do you any of you have any questions so far about anything you talk about?

233
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:11,970
Okay. The other thing I wanted to mention too is I talk about in the syllabus, but there is a short homework assignment that's like six questions.

234
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:24,100
Most of them are either a quick like fill in kind of a short answer or a multiple choice at the end, kind of go with each case study.

235
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:28,440
So there are be 11 of them total in past semesters.

236
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:35,190
I've ended up giving like ten and then the 11, 11, one you just get full credit for.

237
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:40,610
I may end up just doing that depending on how things work out.

238
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:49,680
But there's right now we currently have you won't have not more you won't have more than 11, probably ten homework assignments.

239
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:58,050
And again, they're short. They're not not going to be something that takes, you know, hours and hours to do, hopefully.

240
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:11,369
And then the second thing is, at the end of the semester, there's an exam that you'll take on canvas and you'll have plenty of time to like.

241
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:16,850
I give how? Probably think last year I gave people like a week to complete the exam.

242
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,510
It's not something where you open it and you have to be done with it in a certain period of time.

243
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:29,070
And it's open book, open note, not something that you each want to like take to work together as a group,

244
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:36,810
that that would be something that you'd want to work on individually. And that's all detailed in the syllabus as well.

245
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,060
There's one more thing.

246
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:48,820
Oh, the other thing that I wanted to note that's also in the syllabus, but I just wanted to highlight is flexibility with due dates.

247
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:54,340
I realize and especially with the COVID pandemic over the last couple of years,

248
00:29:54,700 --> 00:30:05,320
people just went on under unprecedented amounts of stress and there's been a lot of anxiety, and I want to avoid contributing to that.

249
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:13,170
So the due dates that are mentioned in the syllabus are guidelines like I'll

250
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:19,240
post the the homework assignment after or during the week of the case study.

251
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:23,709
And I say in there in the syllabus that's due like a week later,

252
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:31,810
that's to keep you on top of your assignments so that you're not doing them all at the last minute at the end of the semester,

253
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,900
which gets a little stressful. But if you can't hit that deadline, you're not going to be penalized.

254
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:46,990
You just get it done whenever you can. Same with I'm very flexible with the exam, you know,

255
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:52,809
as long as as long as you guys can get all of your assignments to me before I have to give me a couple

256
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:58,180
of days to finish the grading and turn in grades before I get yelled at by the registrar's office.

257
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:03,160
I'm fine with that. So I just wanted to note that as well.

258
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:15,400
So when you think about environmental disasters, just to kind of get a survey of what you all know already within about this topic,

259
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:25,240
which environmental disasters come to mind for you? Are there any in particular, any that you've read about in the news or.

260
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:35,590
When I was in Venice. One for me. Yeah. At that.

261
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:39,510
Yeah, that is. Yeah. Yeah.

262
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:47,129
Yeah. And we have that leaky roof that's on the. I kept that one on the syllabus.

263
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:53,430
Or not. Yeah, that's one of the classic environmental disasters.

264
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,620
Yeah, like Chernobyl. Chernobyl?

265
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:06,450
Yeah. We don't get intimate as much about radiation in this class, but that one is a really fascinating study.

266
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,640
And have you read the book Midnight and Chernobyl?

267
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:18,990
So that's a really cool book. If you're interested in these types of things, I would highly recommend that book.

268
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,970
Yeah. The BP Oil Spill. Yeah.

269
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:36,420
That's a question for what came out was I thought the PC because there was all sorts of chemicals involved in Love Canal benzene or PCBs, dioxins.

270
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,280
Yeah. All sorts of nasty stuff that was dumped in this at the site.

271
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,630
And then they went and built houses on it and it ended up in people's basements and whatnot.

272
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:58,450
The other thing I will pose to with the environmental disaster with when we talk about the disaster each week is a pull out podcast.

273
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,510
How many of you listen to podcasts like I listen to them all the time? Yeah.

274
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:08,910
Great thing for like doing laundry or going on a long run or something.

275
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:14,180
So I'll share some podcasts that I thought are particularly good.

276
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:24,240
There's a few. There's one like I'm Love Canal and the Bhopal Disaster and and also books.

277
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:30,600
I've also read a lot of books on many of these topics, so I'll share any of those that I find.

278
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:40,440
So are there commonalities among the different disasters that that you can come up with?

279
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:52,350
Any any of these sort of health effects? Or were there failures or what about target populations who were typically affected in these situations?

280
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,230
Aftermath. Any thoughts?

281
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:20,820
I think one of the one of the factors you'll see that as we go through these case studies, there will be a lot of themes that come up repeatedly.

282
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:25,200
Yeah, I was just say, like injustices of the population.

283
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,190
There are minorities or lower socioeconomic.

284
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,920
Yeah, absolutely. But I don't have any more to the target population or some failures.

285
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:38,490
I kind of do kind of both. So, yeah, for sure.

286
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:49,950
And that is something that you'll see we'll see come up again and again as these the Bhopal, India and Nepalese society disaster.

287
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:57,900
You know, they had this factory built in this slum, in this area where people barely had anything.

288
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:08,280
You know, there's very, very dense population, very, very poor, low socioeconomic status, you know, not a lot of access to medical care.

289
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:16,739
And this companies, you know, build in these poorer areas for a reason because they can get away with it.

290
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:23,430
You know, if you try to build a plant like that in Ann Arbor, that's not going to go over well with a lot of people.

291
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:32,850
And there's a lot of people who have more power and money to fight off these types of developments when they come up.

292
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:41,640
And so they end up in areas where, you know, people don't have as much as much political clout and ability to to fight.

293
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,060
Yeah. So lots of commonalities will come up.

294
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:53,930
Any other thoughts on. Yeah.

295
00:35:54,210 --> 00:36:02,910
So what I want you to take away from this kind of introductory toxicology section,

296
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:11,340
so today in the next couple of days would be able to define toxicology and how it fits into public health lists,

297
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,850
the methods by which toxicant exposures are assessed.

298
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:25,050
Be able to describe some basic concepts of toxicology, like dose response or measles absorption distribution, metabolism and excretion.

299
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:33,300
L.D. 1550 Lowell Noel And then list the major routes of toxicant entry and elimination from the body.

300
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:39,330
And I think before I jump into that, do you guys want to take a quick five minute break now?

301
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,810
I think this is a good place to start and a quick transition.

302
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:53,590
So why don't we it's 1207, so let's come back at 1212 again.

303
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:07,560
Sure. Anybody know who I have been over to the new two page one since I've been back for the semester.

304
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:14,040
Is that store open is there's no limits was open supposed to be this semester you know but I don't know.

305
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:22,769
I haven't been over there. Yeah, I was just wondering, was there something about like a flood that happened there?

306
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:26,130
They learned that, you know. Oh, yeah, I think that was the basement of this building.

307
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:30,610
Oh, yeah, it was all I can say.

308
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,550
Yeah, I didn't hear about it again, but yeah.

309
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:42,270
Mean the other comment I wanted to mention too is like, food wise,

310
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:47,469
feel free to like I brought string cheese and I ended up getting hungry before class.

311
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:56,760
So I just really quick but you know, anytime during class, if you need food or whatever, drinks, I don't I don't have I don't care.

312
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:00,780
So this is kind of a crappy time for the bus offering.

313
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:09,030
I tried to get the time changed. I have tried for like two years now and they keep they never can fit it in with all the other classes.

314
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:14,010
So yeah, we're kind of left with spanning lunch time.

315
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,329
So again, you know,

316
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:27,640
the restrooms have to go to go upstairs or downstairs it's not for the super annoying things

317
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:33,389
know I can't believe they can't renovate this building and get a new bathroom on this.

318
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:39,590
For instance, if they had to.

319
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:14,740
And. Yeah, but you just.

320
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:24,520
I mean, just cause I was. I was in graduate school, actually, so I should know it is.

321
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:28,350
I didn't know I was talking. How you didn't remember?

322
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:34,560
Oh, yeah. That's a smart business. What's in your retirement? Consultants.

323
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:44,210
That's from. Okay.

324
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:04,829
A pretty jam packed schedule. Well, you know, I think.

325
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:10,319
Do you miss it? I got kind of ten and three kind of all jumped in together.

326
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,500
So I'm actually glad this is at this time because it's all just been.

327
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:19,530
Yeah, good. So, listen, I only class tonight.

328
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,469
Yeah, it's only my second class.

329
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:31,380
And then for the day or so. Oh, nice. Yeah, this is my first class and I have one right after until three.

330
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:41,100
Okay. We don't have to. I, I taught, I was like, I want to change the class time, but not 830 in the morning.

331
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:46,570
We don't want anything starting earlier than 935.

332
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:51,090
That's class that the world is just not civilized for me.

333
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:59,280
I, I mean, I'm up at 430 in the morning. I, I run or swim or, you know, that was my training.

334
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:08,070
That's enough. I don't get it done. First thing will happen, but I just don't want to get up any earlier than 430.

335
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:17,189
And, you know, I, I need to like the kids get off to school and get out the door and get here.

336
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:23,730
And yeah, I just don't like rushing. I don't like 830 classes, no meetings.

337
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:28,440
Okay. Do you teach any of this kind of school?

338
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:37,800
So in the fall semester, I teach the it's a scientific communication class for us.

339
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:43,350
And so I did that in the fall. I do this one in the winter.

340
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:46,350
I've also taught the environmental epigenetics class.

341
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:51,570
But Doctor Illinois, he did that. Yeah, that's a fun class.

342
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,010
I think you guys. I really like it. I've done that in the past.

343
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:02,610
Just depends on like sometimes and we may depending on how things go with this class,

344
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:13,080
we may offer this every other year, but we'll see how see how things go in the next couple of years and forth that one.

345
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,020
And I also have some teaching responsibilities in pharmacology.

346
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:26,640
So in the fall I give a couple of lectures on toxicology, like basically the stuff in their intro to pharmacology class.

347
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:38,490
And this semester I also am involved in their student seminar class where each,

348
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:45,030
uh, PhD student has to give a research seminar on their, on their research.

349
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:50,520
And so they have to do a practice talk with us, and that's like a two hour thing.

350
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:55,770
And then they give their talk and there's like a long feedback period after their talk.

351
00:42:55,770 --> 00:43:00,450
So it's pretty rigorous. It's like a very freeing time for the students.

352
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:07,140
Yeah. So for my senior year.

353
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:16,560
So last year I had like writer review paper on pages I'd like to present it to or like our science stand and then anyone else.

354
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:24,560
Oh, and it was the first time I ever really I was talking to an organism's class and I said, orgasm.

355
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:33,690
Yeah. It was just like I just saw everyone's faces, like, and I was like the seven person's persons.

356
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:40,290
It was like their song wasn't crazy. Yeah. Like, I heard lots of different faces and I was like, I'm so sorry.

357
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:47,820
I'm not working so. And like I said, all my years of doing it, like I've never done that.

358
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:50,879
I thought it was so embarrassing. You know,

359
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:58,410
sometimes that helps breakouts know sort of like it's it's a really you like the tense environment or

360
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:03,930
something like that where it everybody starts slapping like kind of like breaks out in a little bit.

361
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:11,280
Yeah, it was like all this stuff that I was like working since freshman year.

362
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:15,800
So it was just like it was funny, but also very embarrassing.

363
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:20,129
We've all yeah, we've all done these types of things.

364
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:27,600
I haven't quite made that slip before, but there are certainly other things that I've done that have been super embarrassing.

365
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:33,330
Or you just you're giving a talk and you don't realize, you know,

366
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:39,030
you have different mannerisms that you things that you do when you're nervous and you have to learn how to control that.

367
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:46,650
And um, my thing was like water bottle and I watched a recording of my presentation and I was just doing that.

368
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:50,040
It's like we're playing with a water bottle the whole time.

369
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,660
And, uh, and I just, it was horrifying to watch.

370
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:59,430
And so I'm very. Everything, you know, after the fact, you know, that I can't believe I was doing that.

371
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:06,030
So, yeah, that's kind of what we talk about in the scientific communication classes.

372
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:13,350
You know, learning how to give a talk without having some of those distracting mannerisms.

373
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:20,580
So, yeah. Any other any questions where we get started?

374
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:26,370
So we'll go till this class goes from 1130 to 1220.

375
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:32,030
So, all right. So for the time being, we'll just talk about intro to toxicology.

376
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,610
So how does toxicology fit into public health?

377
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:45,450
And, you know, toxicology or public health is interested in how an environmental mental exposure produces a particular health outcome.

378
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:53,010
And toxicology falls in there in the middle, where we want to understand the mechanism by which that exposure causes the health outcome.

379
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:58,710
And toxicology lies at the interface between biology and chemistry.

380
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:13,890
And there are also other fields that have really evolved over the last few years that have a really profound influence on the field of toxicology,

381
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:17,459
including bioinformatics and mathematics.

382
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:25,590
So there's a lot of interest in big data, as we'll talk about in a little more detail.

383
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:31,889
There is still a place for these, you know, really detailed, really granular,

384
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:39,940
mechanistic toxicology studies where you're looking at how a chemical affects a particular ion channel in the body and how does it you know,

385
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:45,060
does it result in phosphorylation of this particular amino acid residue?

386
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:48,870
And how does that affect trafficking of this protein in the cell?

387
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:53,850
You know, there is definitely a that's still a really important part of toxicology,

388
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:59,520
but there's also bioinformatics has really unlocked this ability for us to

389
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:05,040
look at globally like what happens at a systemic level with gene expression,

390
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:11,760
what we're interested in this particular gene changing with a chemical exposure.

391
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:20,669
But we also can look at a whole system of genes and are they related to a particular pathway or particular disease and that type of thing.

392
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:25,320
So bioinformatics really gives us tools for for that.

393
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:35,430
And there's also, you know, mathematical modeling in silico modeling of chemical reactions and how chemicals

394
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:39,479
interact with different proteins in the in the body and that type of thing.

395
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:47,610
So these computational methods are also are also being developed that really help our

396
00:47:47,610 --> 00:48:00,720
understanding of toxicology and also will help minimize or reduce our need for animal studies.

397
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:07,140
So there's a real interest in getting away from animal studies altogether in biomedical research.

398
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,980
I think we're a long way away from that at this point.

399
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:24,000
But there are in Silico methods for understanding the mechanisms of toxicology and also all sorts of alternative approaches,

400
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:36,450
such as organs on a chip or, you know, in some organoids where you're growing a particular organ in vitro so that you don't have to do animal studies.

401
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:41,759
That's the goal is to get away from that. But again, we're not we're not there at this point.

402
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:48,270
We still we still use animal models quite a bit. I use cell models in my research.

403
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:54,570
And I also we also do studies with mice. And yeah,

404
00:48:54,580 --> 00:49:02,280
so the scope of modern toxicology really spans from the molecular level where you're looking at an individual chemical and

405
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:11,730
how it interacts with certain bases and DNA or certain amino acid residues on proteins all the way up to different systems,

406
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:18,810
organs, individual patients in the clinic and up to the population level.

407
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:26,670
And this class will mainly be focused on the kind of molecular mechanisms of toxicity,

408
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:34,560
but use that to inform our understanding of what's going on at the population or at the clinical level.

409
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:43,260
So some basic principles of toxicology. First is the principle of homeostasis.

410
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:52,260
And this is the ability or tendency of an organism or a cell to maintain its internal equilibrium by adjusting various

411
00:49:52,260 --> 00:50:02,190
physiological processes and repair processes and compensatory processes that it uses when it responds to an environmental factor.

412
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:12,930
And if a cell can't maintain homeostasis, it's unable to repair some damage or compensate for some particular change in its environment.

413
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:23,670
Then you can get toxicity that occurs. And we're constantly being exposed to toxicants, where every day we're being exposed to radiation,

414
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:29,880
ambient radiation, or even higher on airplanes and that type of thing.

415
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:37,380
We're constantly be exposed to UV light, to chemicals in our food contaminants, in our drinking water.

416
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:45,660
And in most cases, thank goodness our DNA is replicated and repaired with really high fidelity.

417
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:54,030
And we have a lot of cellular repair and compensation processes that allow us to buffer the

418
00:50:54,030 --> 00:51:00,660
effects of these toxic exposures and stay healthy for a relatively long period of time,

419
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:14,340
as we'll talk about. There are many factors at the individual level and otherwise that can affect our ability to respond to chemical exposures.

420
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:23,420
So one of the most common words you will hear in pharmacology or toxicology is the dose.

421
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:31,580
So what is a dose mean? Exactly. And it can mean multiple things depending on where in this process you're looking.

422
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:38,330
So you have a potential dose, for example, the amount of sulfur dioxide that's in the air.

423
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:47,460
So the amount of contaminant in the exposure media, then you have your applied dose, which is the amount of contaminant at the absorption site.

424
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:56,930
So in this case, it would be in your lungs. How much of that sulfur dioxide is getting down into your lungs at the interface between the

425
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:04,879
alveoli of the lung and the capillaries that are that are there to pick up not only oxygen,

426
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:13,400
but also chemicals? Then you have the internal dose and this is the amount of that contaminant that gets past that exchange boundary.

427
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:21,020
So in this case, it would be the exchange boundary between the the alveoli of the lung and the capillaries.

428
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:27,860
So your bloodstream and gets into the body and then you have a biologically affected dose.

429
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:33,920
And this dose is a function of how that chemical is distributed in the body.

430
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,919
So where does it go and where does it get concentrated?

431
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:44,510
And depending on the molecular properties of that chemical, it's going to tend to concentrate in different regions of the body.

432
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,179
And it's also a function of metabolism.

433
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:56,450
So metabolism the liver, when you think about chemical metabolism or drug metabolism, you probably primarily think about the liver.

434
00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:03,260
And that is the main side of of of metabolism.

435
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:11,690
But there are also other areas in the body that are metabolically active, like the kidney also to some extent that the olfactory system.

436
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:17,090
Your lungs. To your question. I do I was going to wait until your.

437
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:23,690
Oh, yeah. No. So for like the one contaminant is bioavailable.

438
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:29,990
Is that your dose or is that the bio biological biologically effective dose?

439
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:35,059
Because that's when it interacts with the target tissue or like bioavailability.

440
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:40,580
Or is it just like. When? I don't know.

441
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:44,000
I don't know if I spend that much and I don't know. That makes sense.

442
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:56,510
The bioavailable biologically effective dose or the bioavailable dose is the dose that actually going to have some effect on and on the body.

443
00:53:56,570 --> 00:54:02,780
So that's going to be the applied dose may be higher than the biologically effective

444
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:07,520
dose because not all of it is going to make it across that absorption site.

445
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:14,510
Okay, that makes sense. So yeah, the applied dose may or may not be the same as the biologically effective dose,

446
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:19,580
depending on how efficient the body is at absorbing that particular chemical.

447
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:27,290
Does that make sense? The other questions feel free to interrupt anytime whenever you think comes up.

448
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:34,430
So what are some examples of common absorption sites in the body that you can think of?

449
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:39,680
This isn't really a trick question. Yeah.

450
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:44,950
Dermal. Mm hmm. Yeah.

451
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:51,260
So that's a big. Well, we'll get into some examples of some dermal dermal toxin.

452
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:54,410
Dermal absorption. Like the lungs.

453
00:54:54,650 --> 00:55:02,030
The lungs? Yeah. That's a major site of. Of chemical absorption when swallowing something.

454
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:08,720
Yeah. Yeah. So along your GI tract is another great absorption site.

455
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:13,220
Um, and then there's some minor ones as well. Yeah.

456
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:21,200
Yeah. So that would primarily be. So when things are ingested, they're going to go to the liver.

457
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:27,590
That's the first they're going to picked up in the bloodstream from the GI tract, and then they're going to go straight to the liver.

458
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:37,460
So, yeah, that's a really important component of that. So how do we measure human exposure to chemicals?

459
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:44,280
There are many different ways that we can do that. We can survey.

460
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:53,510
We can send out a survey or a questionnaire and ask people how how much of something that they're being exposed to.

461
00:55:53,510 --> 00:56:01,400
Are you being exposed to this in your work environment? And as you might expect, there are some limitations to this.

462
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:05,540
It's an indirect mechanism for assessing exposure.

463
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:10,110
It's imprecise and it's prone to response bias.

464
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:19,310
So you can imagine that if you have a group of people who are afraid that they've been poisoned by a particular chemical,

465
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:25,130
there's going to be some bias in who responds to a survey about exposures.

466
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,120
The people who are more motivated,

467
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:32,600
who are concerned about the health aspects of a particular chemical are going to be far more motivated than somebody who isn't.

468
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:36,710
There's also stationary monitoring devices.

469
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:49,190
So this would be, for example, a device that measures the level of social sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides or other chemicals in the air.

470
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:55,190
A device near a near the marathon oil refinery in Detroit.

471
00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:05,930
There are systems for checking the air to see what levels of contaminants are present.

472
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:14,150
And those are going to fail to account for individual differences in the how much somebody is exposed.

473
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:20,990
So somebody who goes outside and runs ten miles every morning in that area is going to have a higher exposure level,

474
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:25,730
presumably, than somebody who stays indoors all day in filtered air.

475
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:35,030
And so these can this can be difficult when you want to link chemical exposure and health outcome and potential mechanism.

476
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:41,780
There are also personal monitoring devices. So this would be something like a sensor badge.

477
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:48,860
So if you if you've probably heard of people who work in a facility where there's radiation,

478
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:54,649
they have to wear a badge that monitors how much exposure they're getting to radiation.

479
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:59,300
And if they're you there, exceed some certain level there, they're out for a period of time,

480
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:08,030
clothing or there's also devices that assess levels of specific chemicals at the point of body contact.

481
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:19,790
There were several talks when I went to the Society of Toxicology meeting last spring where people now are researchers are developing.

482
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:29,630
They have these like just wristbands that they give people that can allow them to assess exposure to,

483
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:36,500
I don't know, some aromatic hydrocarbon or some other lipophilic chemical or that type of thing.

484
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:45,380
And that's one method that gets a little bit closer to assessing individual differences and exposures.

485
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,340
And then there are bio monitoring assays.

486
00:58:49,640 --> 00:59:00,410
And this is going to be the most specific method of assessing levels of specific chemicals and bodily fluids, blood, urine, saliva and breast milk.

487
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:08,180
And the disadvantage of this method is that it's more invasive and more expensive.

488
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:14,690
You have to get you have to recruit people and you have to be able to get these different biological samples.

489
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:19,820
You have it's more rigorous from a regulatory standpoint.

490
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:24,170
You have to get IAB approval. And, you know, there's there's a lot that goes into this.

491
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:29,479
There's certainly IRB approval probably required for personal monitoring devices as well.

492
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:35,480
But bio monitoring, you're increasing in this direction.

493
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:47,760
You're getting more specific or more granular data on exposure that's also getting more expensive and more difficult from a regulatory standpoint.

494
00:59:48,070 --> 01:00:00,120
Yeah. So with bio monitoring, does that help us determine internal dose or biologically effective dose or fall or does it depend really?

495
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:07,560
Yeah, we're kind of on it would be it would depend on the chemical in the situation.

496
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:15,570
But I could give you either give you the amount that is cross the absorption site in this getting access into the bloodstream.

497
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:24,000
And that may or may not be, you know, how much is actually reacting with the target in the body.

498
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,190
We may not be able to fully know that. Yeah.

499
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,729
You know, you can you can figure that out experimentally in a controlled setting.

500
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:42,660
But in an intact person, that's going to be more difficult unless the chemical unless the chemical is absorbed

501
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:48,210
in the body and then has to be converted to an active metabolite by the liver.

502
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:54,780
And in that case, then you can, you know, get and get an idea of the exposure to the chemical.

503
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:59,549
You know, if you have the inactive metabolite in the bloodstream and you also have the active metabolite,

504
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:09,960
you can get a feel for how much of, you know, each of the those chemicals are present and how they are going to impact biology

505
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:19,380
for the rest of the body fluids like some things are excreted through urine.

506
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:23,520
Does that mean that it wasn't like you don't fully take in.

507
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:27,999
Like you don't get it because you're able to excreta.

508
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:37,330
Or now I think in some cases the chemical is picked up in your bloodstream or you know,

509
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:43,060
in your GI tract or whatever and picked up in the body and it has no effect in it.

510
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:45,550
So it just goes through your urine and.

511
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:54,760
But there are certainly chemicals that phthalates, for example, the chemical, the phthalate comes into the body.

512
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:59,469
It's metabolized by the liver to certain active metabolites that are believed to have

513
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:04,510
their endocrine disrupting function and then excrete those metabolites in the urine.

514
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,520
And so phthalates in particular,

515
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:19,360
our urine urinary valley metabolites are like the gold standard or the most the most widely used method for assessing phthalate exposure.

516
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:30,040
Whereas, you know, there's different chemical, it depends on how what the half life of the chemical is in the body, how it's distributed.

517
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,090
Is it does it concentrate in certain tissues?

518
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:36,940
Is it rapidly metabolized and excreted?

519
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:44,379
Phthalates are an example of that, where they have a relatively short half life and they're rapidly metabolized and they're sent out in the air.

520
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:49,060
And and so that's how you get a feel for metabolite, for phthalate exposure.

521
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:53,920
But for something like lead, you know, people use blood,

522
01:02:54,460 --> 01:03:02,380
but probably the best indicator of lead exposure to really get the body burn of lead is to look at bone.

523
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:06,340
So you can look at, you know, how much lead is concentrated in the tibia.

524
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:14,770
And that's a common place to look. Arsenic exposure is assessed, I believe, through like hair and fingernails.

525
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:21,969
So just depends on how that chemical is metabolized and where it goes and how long it stays in the body and that type of thing.

526
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:25,750
So it depends on it depends on the chemical. You.

527
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:37,290
Yeah. And then one thing I wanted to mention with regard to bio monitoring is this idea of a target versus a surrogate tissue.

528
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:42,240
Things like blood, urine isn't really a tissue.

529
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:52,080
You know, saliva is not really a tissue. But you do get like epithelial cells from if you're doing like a buckled swab of your cheek,

530
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:58,560
you can pick up cells from from the lining of your of your mouth.

531
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:01,710
So that's technically a tissue.

532
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:15,450
And the other common tissue, sometimes people use skin, but these different bodily fluids are tissues or what are called surrogate tissues.

533
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:26,770
So they are giving you an idea of the exposure of a chemical, but they don't tell you what's going on necessarily in the target tissue.

534
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:31,440
So let's say you're looking at blood lead levels.

535
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:38,070
That gives you an idea of what what you have that you've been exposed to lead.

536
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:42,930
But that doesn't necessarily tell you what's going on in the target tissue in the brain.

537
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:49,110
You can't take a biopsy of somebody's brain, you know. So there is a lot of research.

538
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:57,360
We I'm part of actually a consortium that just finished up that had multiple universities that was interested in understanding

539
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:04,080
how what's going on in surrogate tissues with a chemical actually reflects what's going on in the target tissue.

540
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:12,300
So how does blood epigenetic changes or transcriptional changes in the blood with a different particular chemical

541
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:17,820
correlate with what's going on in the brain or the liver someplace where you can't just go in and get a tissue sample.

542
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:23,340
So that's all they had with regard to exposure.

543
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:28,920
Another important thing I want to talk about.

544
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:33,330
And with regard to assessing toxicity is biomarkers.

545
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:41,040
So a biomarker is an indicator of a biologic response to an environmental stressor that is objectively measured.

546
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:46,350
This may or may not be part of the mechanism of toxicity.

547
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:57,690
So something can be a a biomarker of exposure and be super, super important for an environmental health study or a toxicity study.

548
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:01,860
But it may not be part of the mechanism of toxicity.

549
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:07,350
So I'm trying to think like you might see DNA methylation at some particular

550
01:06:07,350 --> 01:06:14,880
region of the genome that is just giving you a readout of the chemical exposure.

551
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:21,900
But it's not necessarily a part of the genome that encodes for a gene that's involved in the mechanism of toxicity, if that makes sense.

552
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:35,330
So biomarkers can be molecular, cellular or physiologic, and this can include molecular changes or things like formation of DNA at us.

553
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:46,890
So some oxidized bases in DNA are common for assessing oxidative stress from a chemical exposure.

554
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:58,290
Tumor cell DNA is a really important area of cancer research, and it's being used to assess early,

555
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:04,230
early can early cancer formation before it becomes clinically like a tumor.

556
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:10,379
And so there is a lot of interest in being able to detect tumor cell DNA in the blood

557
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:19,140
before before a cancer becomes something that we can't treat because metastatic cancer,

558
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:31,740
we really haven't gotten we as a the scientific community, as a human society, we really haven't gotten much better at treating metastatic cancer.

559
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:42,720
I mean, over the last 50 years, there's a lot of cancers like once once they're in multiple organs, they're, you know, essentially not treatable.

560
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:48,930
How do you know to do that prior to the tumor?

561
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:57,360
So that's it depends on it depends on the cancer, I think.

562
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:04,649
And this is an area, you know, my p my post-doc was in pediatric cancer research,

563
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:10,500
but and so I went to the ACR, American Association for Cancer Research.

564
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:15,540
I went to a lot of symposia and conferences for that society.

565
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:26,670
And there are a lot of people interested in using tumor cell DNA to to detect cancer and using that.

566
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:33,000
A screening tool. And with any screening tool, you have to have an understanding.

567
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:36,540
You have to figure out how to prioritize who gets screened.

568
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:43,470
And so I think your question, it depends on the particular cancer in the population you're looking at.

569
01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:50,040
So for example, if you have a group of people who are or, you know,

570
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:55,499
are at a high risk of developing breast cancer because they have some genetic mutation or they

571
01:08:55,500 --> 01:09:00,690
have they've been lifetime smokers and they're probably at a high risk of developing lung cancer.

572
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:11,550
Can you use tumor cell DNA to potentially detect the tumor before it gets to be so large that it's no longer treatable?

573
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:20,790
And using that, this is this would be far less invasive tumor cell DNA in the blood and much easier to do for a

574
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:27,029
large population of people compared to something like having to do a CT scan or PET scan on people,

575
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:29,579
which is radiation. And then, you know,

576
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:38,879
all sorts of it's much more invasive and expensive and people are going to be want to you don't want to expose people to radiation unnecessarily,

577
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:43,920
but to take a blood sample and look at tumor cell DNA or to yeah, tumor cell DNA,

578
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:52,680
that's not going to cost you as much financially or risk wise risk to the person being being assessed.

579
01:09:53,070 --> 01:10:01,170
That makes sense. And then there's also epigenetic changes in the blood that people look at.

580
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:05,880
So I mentioned DNA methylation, biomarkers of exposure or toxicity,

581
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:12,450
some other molecular markers that you're probably familiar with, proteins in the blood.

582
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:19,070
So if somebody has a somebody comes into the hospital and they're having chest pain and have, you know,

583
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:25,850
symptoms of a heart attack, one of the things that they're going to be assessed for is cardiac troponin in the bloodstream.

584
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:30,690
So when and then there's another one and I'm blanking on it right now.

585
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:45,270
But essentially when a a heart attack occurs or there's some sort of toxicity to an organ, a lot of the cells will die in that organ.

586
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:56,700
So in the case of a heart attack, you're starving the heart from blood and oxygen, and those cells will undergo necrotic cell death.

587
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:59,100
And I'll get into that in a little more detail what that means.

588
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:06,060
But essentially the cell gets swollen and eventually bursts and releases its contents into the bloodstream.

589
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:15,809
And so if there's damage to these cells from a heart attack, you're going to see cardiac troponin, for example, released into the bloodstream.

590
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:22,469
And then you can pick that up. And that's a a sensitive indicator of a myocardial infarction.

591
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:28,200
And then you say, okay, this person's having this person has, you know, looks like they've had a heart attack.

592
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:33,870
Let's go in and do scans and other things to see what level of damage there is.

593
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:43,200
So just helps people in the clinic kind of assess and assess what's going on and then other

594
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:49,230
proteins in the blood that may be related to cancer such as prostate specific antigen or PSA.

595
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:59,700
So this is a test that a lot of men have, I think I don't know if all men are all men get this at a certain point.

596
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:06,810
This is controversial, you know, as far as how much screening to do for different cancers,

597
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:15,720
because screening always comes with false positives and potentially biopsies and things that have a lot more risk.

598
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:27,360
And PSA is one of those one of those examples. But PSA levels rise in the blood if you have prostate cancer developing.

599
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:36,540
And so that might prompt biopsies or further further clinical assessment changes in

600
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:44,280
cellular populations or cell death would be more of a cellular level biomarker.

601
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:52,469
And then also as a if you have a patient that comes into the clinic and they have cholinergic toxicity,

602
01:12:52,470 --> 01:13:02,820
we'll talk about this in the case study on the Tokyo sarin gas attack.

603
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:08,430
That one was really interesting as well. We'll talk about nerve agents and how they work.

604
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:16,620
So if somebody comes in and they've been exposed to a nerve agent, they're going to have a reduced, significantly reduced heart rate.

605
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:22,590
They're going to have changes in respiration. They're going to have their lungs are going to be full of fluid, that type of thing.

606
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:31,960
Blood, oxygen saturation is going to be lower. These types of things are used as biomarkers of of disease or potential toxicity.

607
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:45,270
Um, I mentioned that, uh, bioinformatics and big data are particularly important now in the context of toxicology.

608
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:55,109
And there's a lot of different omics technologies now that allow us to identify not only

609
01:13:55,110 --> 01:14:01,410
just an individual gene or an individual metabolite that changes with chemical exposure,

610
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:08,540
but now you can get an entire panel, an entire signature of, of of a response to a toxicant.

611
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:13,800
And so these are some of the different omics studies you have proteomics,

612
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:21,930
which is changes in levels of different proteins, genomics, which are changes in transcript.

613
01:14:23,010 --> 01:14:31,950
There's also foxo proteomics. So proteins are an important mechanism for regulating protein function is phosphorylation,

614
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:41,010
which is a chemical modification to specific amino acid residues in those proteins that regulates their function.

615
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:45,659
So there's a whole field of possible proteomics, metabolomics,

616
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:55,170
which are all of the metabolites that change in your blood or in a particular tissue in response to some disease state,

617
01:14:55,170 --> 01:15:01,290
in response to a dietary change or a chemical exposure, whatever, you're looking at protein protein interactions.

618
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:12,780
So you can look kind of proteome wide to how protein protein interactions change with in a particular exposure disease state.

619
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:22,920
And then lots of computational analysis that tell you that simulate some of these exposures at the computational level.

620
01:15:24,990 --> 01:15:30,750
And then there are biomarker bioinformatics tools that are available that identify

621
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:35,370
physiologic and pathophysiologic pathways that are perturbed by these toxicants.

622
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:45,929
So let's say you so I had a study where we exposed animals to lead during pregnancy and lactation.

623
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:52,860
And I'm very interested in how DNA methylation and gene expression in the heart changes with light exposure.

624
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:59,910
And so we take the heart and we look at how all of the genes we look at all of the

625
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:04,530
genes that were changed in the heart with light exposure versus the control animals.

626
01:16:05,010 --> 01:16:13,799
And we can use various bioinformatics tools to identify what pathways are are we seeing that are coming up.

627
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:16,440
So not only individual genes, but pathways.

628
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:25,859
And what we found, for example, with with family exposure and also with lead is that we see some heart failure,

629
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:31,020
relevant gene pathways that are altered by the chemical exposure.

630
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:39,420
And so this is kind of a way bioinformatics tools give you a way to to look at a more systemic level.

631
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:46,260
This is not an area of my expertise. This is exploded, really.

632
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:56,970
I mean, this has got been probably in the last 15 years, you know, we've had bioinformatics studies, but it's really exploded in the last decade.

633
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:06,749
And when I was a graduate student, there was you know, it was much more tedious to do these types of studies and they weren't as widely available.

634
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:12,210
But now you can just do these omics studies for fairly cheap.

635
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:18,450
And the limiting factor is who, who can handle the data and who can analyze it.

636
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:23,790
And so there's a whole field of people that, you know, are this is all that they do.

637
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:28,110
Yeah. Is that kind of similar to what happens in their amounts?

638
01:17:28,150 --> 01:17:36,389
Elizabeth Holmes, a company that she started where you can like just get a drop of blood anywhere like CBS.

639
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:42,390
And within a matter of minutes, you, like, find out if you have, like, all these different diseases.

640
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:50,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She wanted to have a particular, like a single with a single blood drop,

641
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:59,220
get this whole panel of everything, you know, in the kitchen sink and be able to assess disease.

642
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:13,860
Yeah. And potentially, I'm sure that they would have to employ some bioinformatics tools to to understand wink, wink what they find to disease.

643
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:24,599
But yeah, what she talked about was so unrealistic and you know, so many people who are experts in that field were like, this is just this is insane.

644
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:31,320
This doesn't work. And, you know, had a lot of whistleblowers along the way who were harassed and whatnot.

645
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:37,340
There's a. Great book. I think it's called Bad Blood. Have you read any of you read it or listened to it?

646
01:18:38,030 --> 01:18:44,120
I am. I devour books through podcasts because I train for marathons and I'm out for 4 hours running.

647
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:51,409
And so I have to listen to a lot of books. Bad Blood is a fantastic book if you're interested in the Elizabeth Holmes thing.

648
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:56,180
And there's also a podcast called The Dropout, which is super addictive.

649
01:18:56,750 --> 01:19:01,520
It's just like a short series of podcasts that goes through the whole story.

650
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:09,410
Anyway, I as usual, I didn't get through nearly you know, I didn't think we wouldn't get through all the slides today.

651
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:12,440
So we'll just continue on Monday with this.

652
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:20,809
But yeah, I get very talkative and I also like this to be interactive, so I want to be able to pause and talk about things.

653
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:26,330
So I think I'm going to stop here today. And again, we'll pick up where we left off on Monday.

654
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:29,860
And yeah, it was really nice meeting you.

655
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:36,379
I'm really excited to work with you this semester and I will again be posting a sign

656
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:44,930
up for the case studies and also setting up assignments for like the write ups.

657
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:55,310
If you miss class and we won't have a homework assignment until and we'll post that like next week, so it'll be for the first three classes.

658
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:57,980
Great. I hope you all have a nice.
