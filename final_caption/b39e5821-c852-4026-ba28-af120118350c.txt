1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,130
So I'm going to remove my mask so you can hear me well.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:11,280
But then when I get close to you, I will probably put it back because I'm having my third booster next week.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,800
So I want to kind of make a right. Okay. Okay.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:28,950
So so they we have this second part of our topic, which is measuring that and you may open this and this is the outline.

5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:40,410
So then my job today is to convince you that even though food frequency questionnaires are horrible, they are the best option for large scale studies.

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,139
Okay. So then I will start saying why if if use and not other methods.

7
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:53,590
Because you know there are other methods to measure diet and then I'll go into a few kind of like details around if you like.

8
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,410
Should we ask for portion size?

9
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:05,640
I'm going to touch briefly on the measurement error and then adjustment, because the paper that you read is talking about that.

10
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:15,050
So then, I mean, if you want to understand it, well, at least I have to give you like some kind of like use that we have a whole topic.

11
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,060
I mean, we have two weeks to cover measurement error later on and we have two weeks to cover energy adjustment.

12
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,210
Those are two very important things in nutritional epidemiology.

13
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:30,720
So we will cover that in a lot of detail. So don't don't worry if you don't get what I'm saying today, it's okay.

14
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:39,090
Then we'll go through the full composition tables so you can see that's another source of error when the grading diet.

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,740
And then we'll talk about the validation methods for the food frequency questionnaire,

16
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,709
because when you have something that is supposed to be measured in something, you have to validate it, right?

17
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,130
You have to make sure that it's actually measuring what you want to measure.

18
00:01:53,130 --> 00:02:05,220
Right. And validating if use is a little funny because I will get your way later and this is actually what you are kind of like going to do.

19
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:11,780
In the second part of the latter, you are going to compare kind of like with other nutrients measure by other kind of like

20
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:17,370
tool and then see if more or less kind of like what they think you is measuring is okay,

21
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:27,510
right? Okay. So that's the outline. And then I like starting with this sentence because this is the editorial.

22
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,310
If you read the editorial, it's supposed to look at the question is how bad is good enough, right?

23
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:40,950
So because we are always saying that, okay, because the question is are not really good, but but maybe they are good enough.

24
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,180
So then yeah. Okay, good enough. What is good enough and what is bad, right.

25
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:53,630
So, so before we actually go into the discussion of, of some of the main topics,

26
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,190
main issues in the, in the paper, I would like you to start filling out.

27
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:04,200
And if you I'm not kind of like expecting you to fill it out completely, but go to this.

28
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,010
How many of you have filled out? And if a few before. Oh, nothing.

29
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,940
Okay. Okay. Good. Okay. So now you already have some experience.

30
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,110
Now let's see this one.

31
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:25,200
So this is that you actually this is one of the these is already the third version because they have kind of like been improving over the years.

32
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,860
But this is one this is the one that they've done.

33
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,519
The manuscript is trying to validate the validity of the first version.

34
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,600
Right. And there you go here.

35
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,320
This is the demo site. Sure.

36
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:48,230
Yeah. So you can choose to speak Spanish, your French, Spanish.

37
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,370
And then you just kind of, like, start filling out.

38
00:03:52,490 --> 00:04:01,790
Right. So then you start your questionnaire. I mean, you can say your age and say so.

39
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:10,970
And then you can see what beverages did you drink? Right. So then you have to kind of be just on this list.

40
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,990
And then in the next. And you just follow their way this.

41
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:22,729
Right. So this is I mean, one of the nice things about this, if a few, is that instead of giving you like a paper form that is like a list,

42
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:27,470
the sometimes people get a little lost and they forget to fill out some of the items.

43
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:37,220
This one is kind of like guiding you through all the potential, you know, foods and beverages and then ask for the portion size later and so on.

44
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:43,970
Right. So is this actually better design than all the f f goes in that sense?

45
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:48,890
I mean, the list is the same. That is the Fujitsu the same. But they kind of like the way you fill it out.

46
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,070
I mean, it's making it a little more friendly.

47
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,000
Right. Okay. So I stop talking.

48
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:03,590
So just start filling out for yourself. I mean, what is your kind of like average intake of those things?

49
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,770
So I'll give you 10 minutes. More than that.

50
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:53,350
We will listen. How long does it take so long?

51
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:03,600
Oh, it's very long. Yes, I learned that the two finishes that they come on like an hour maybe.

52
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,910
Yeah, it depends. Yeah. Yeah, we will talk about that.

53
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:19,970
Is there a reason why they did you feel like they asked you how many times you drink soda in the summer versus that year?

54
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:30,430
Yeah. I mean, because something is our association. I literally. You drink mean you drink the same.

55
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,380
It's okay. I mean, you're distance all the same, but some people kind of like change their intake depending on season.

56
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:47,559
So that that's actually, in theory, trying to make it easier for you to fill it out.

57
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:55,420
Because if they don't ask that, then and you change your intake, you have to do the math in your head, which is a source of error.

58
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:45,290
Okay. Let's stop. So now how far were you able to kind of like go into there for the official place, the beverages?

59
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:52,220
Some people do an event, right. So what was that? You didn't finish the beverages because you have many beverages.

60
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:58,460
Did they take any beverages? I let random change my drink every day.

61
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,380
Mm hmm. Yeah.

62
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,890
So the people who were able to pass their relatives. Where did you arrive?

63
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:11,030
I took fruit.

64
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,990
Okay. Yeah, but no. Any. Anyone go beyond fruit.

65
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:24,270
No. Right. So then, I mean, it's true that we were like 7 minutes away, but I mean, there's visibility is there is fruits.

66
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:30,629
Then you have the veggies, then you have the day, then you have been made some fish and then you have, you know, all the food groups, right?

67
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,260
So then you can get a sense of how long it's going to take, you know?

68
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:40,800
So. So what were your first impressions?

69
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,680
And you didn't finish. And then also, based on your past experience filling out, kind of like if it kills me,

70
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,130
for me, the first one is that you need a lot of patience, right?

71
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,370
Because clearly it's a long questionnaire. Right.

72
00:12:53,670 --> 00:13:02,220
So if I were going to ask you about smoking, so kind of like the first question would be, are your smoker or not?

73
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,400
I mean, if you are not a smoker, it will be just check and that's it, right?

74
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,680
If you are a smoker, even if you're a smoker.

75
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:14,850
And I kind of like gave you like a whole questionnaire to make sure that I capture all your exposure if they're smoking,

76
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,130
probably in the 7 minutes that we were filling out the beverages, you will be then.

77
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:24,540
Right. So you can kind of like compare that to other exposures.

78
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,590
I mean, really, diet is very tedious, right?

79
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:35,190
And this is one of the reasons why many unfortunately, many large cohort studies, they don't collect diet because they feel like, Wolf.

80
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:44,219
I mean, it's like if we send these long questionnaires to people, they're going to get so bored and then we have other things to do as well.

81
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:51,240
So unless the people working in that cohort are really nutritional epidemiologist and very invested in nutrition, I mean,

82
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:59,100
most people don't do it, or maybe they just ask a few short questions about the fruits and veggies and that's it and so on.

83
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,490
Right. So so it takes it takes a lot of time.

84
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:13,400
Okay. What other impressions did you get? I used myself not really thoroughly in reading the instructions for each item that you like,

85
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,530
including this, but not including this kind of like crazy every so long and.

86
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,790
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

87
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:27,159
So then on top of being alone, I mean, there are many instructions that probably you won't bring and then you probably will be answering.

88
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,540
Not correctly. Right. Because it's not. Which is another source of error.

89
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,680
What else? Yeah. I think there were some things that I didn't know.

90
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:42,610
Like for the coffee one, I guess I drink coffee or usually the popular information is like, if it's our girls, it is.

91
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,340
And I'm not I don't know, I'm not a coffee expert.

92
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:53,790
So I feel like it was just a little confusing sometimes to know how to answer it, even though some of these terms of using.

93
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:59,470
Yeah, exactly. And also that brings another point is like if you eat outside home,

94
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,489
a lot of the time, you don't really know where you're eating most other than I mean,

95
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:09,110
if you're cooking, you, you know, I mean, you more or less if you're cooking yourself, I'm not even someone is cooking for you.

96
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,230
Right? So so you can see that is again another source of that.

97
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:19,170
It's so difficult to say, okay, home, I don't know how many tomatoes I put in this dish.

98
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:25,120
Right. Okay. That was another. Yeah, I just noticed that I don't eat that often.

99
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,460
I know I've had it like in my house. Yeah, but I don't really remember, like, how much.

100
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,450
Hard to recall. What's this quantity?

101
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:43,970
And also, after I finish the parodies I have, like I was thinking maybe I should choose mashed to with groups because it's pretty cool.

102
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:48,080
Yeah. So then you feel like let's do it.

103
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:57,190
Kind of like really quickly. Yeah. Yeah. So, so I mean, it really is very difficult to say how much of something you would do it in.

104
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:03,560
Even even for the things that unless there is something that you eat or drink regularly, I mean,

105
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,900
maybe coffee it happens with coffee because more or less coffee drinkers used to drink more or less regularly.

106
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:17,690
Not everyone, more or less. The rest is so kind of like difficult because I mean, it changes so much that you have to do that math in your brain.

107
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:22,219
And then asking about seasonality sometimes helps, sometimes maybe not.

108
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,460
I don't know. So it is really difficult. Right.

109
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,230
So also, I see, I mean, there are a few international students here.

110
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,239
So whether you think about well,

111
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:41,190
you are not able to go through there if you for the whole if if you what do you think that you will have any problem kind of like filling it out.

112
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,230
Do you think that it will reflect your usual dietary pattern?

113
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,870
For the average part, I don't think it is a good friend,

114
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:59,840
but I saw that this might sound bizarre or like soups and other can get from that taste or smell different from our traditional.

115
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:10,700
So that's another thing that if kids need to be kind of like built for every single population because populations have different dietary patterns,

116
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,059
right? So in the moment that you have like a mixed population,

117
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:19,750
that they have different dietary patterns and you use the same if if you for some people you will get even more error

118
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:25,480
than usual because they don't find the items that usually they get and they find a lot of things that they never eat.

119
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:34,159
Right. So that's another kind of like difficult thing of the fifth gives some FFA cues, particularly in the U.S. because there is huge diversity.

120
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,080
What they do is that they use to more or less kind of like a standard if if you form

121
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,560
a North American diet and then they do supplements for kind of like ethnicities,

122
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,870
right? So kind of like I mean, let's do I mean,

123
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:54,140
let's try to capture this are the things that are more kind of like people from Chinese origin in the in the U.S. consumers.

124
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,370
And then let's try to do a supplement that will even increase the length of the fifth year.

125
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,490
Right. But but at least you can catch your better. Right.

126
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:09,660
But is is is not easy. Is not easy. Right. So they you can see I mean, we could spend the whole class just looking out.

127
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:18,270
They they buy things about the fifth year. So so let's see what happened with the articles today because I mean, if,

128
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:23,299
if girls have been used for a long time in the immunology and there is still

129
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:29,570
use so and every time kind of like people think about and a few they always

130
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:33,799
criticize like say I know but this is really I mean people don't remember well

131
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,360
I mean this is really a kind of like a lot of fear or maybe we can do better.

132
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:46,579
So then what people try for a while is trying to improve the few, and that's what the articles for today were doing.

133
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:55,760
So then the, the, the, the silver paper was trying to kind of like showed that this if, if you are using the, the, the H.Q. from the CIA,

134
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:01,549
they spend a lot of time kind of like trying to make it better and then they

135
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:05,240
compare it with the other two or 50 years that were more kind of like popular.

136
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,920
They want to run Gladys look and they want from while they're waiting.

137
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:19,010
Right. And then basically, I mean, one thing that I like about the editorial remarks is that that centers that their scientific, um,

138
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:25,460
public cynicism about the field of nutritional epidemiology because it looks like, I mean, you're measuring something with so much earlier.

139
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:31,069
How can you kind of like make up like, I mean, and make any conclusions, right?

140
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,639
I mean, it's like, I mean, one day and those things make it to the headlines.

141
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,940
Remember, because nutrition is so sexy that people like it, right? So it's like broccoli is the for you organ of like up or no or whatever.

142
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:47,450
Right. So and it is just because the last if studies show like a relationship in one direction or the other,

143
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,470
but the relationships may be just the product of error, right? And bias, right.

144
00:19:51,830 --> 00:20:02,180
So, so because of that, I mean, nutritional epidemiologist be like, okay, we have to kind of make our measures and our tools better, right?

145
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:11,389
And that's why this kind of like came up the conclusion of the editorial after kind of like looking at their manuscript

146
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:19,460
and looking at the the answers is that full frequency methods are sufficiently valid for etiologic studies,

147
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:26,900
right? In the sense that what happened with excuse is that we are not trying to measure diet accurately.

148
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,520
We are not. That's not the purpose of the review. Right? Forget at all that we are not.

149
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:36,020
Doing that? Well, we are doing this trying to rank people, right.

150
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,550
So their ranking is more or less okay.

151
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:45,680
And the ranking actually it works pretty well in the extremes, not in between, because in between there is a lot of error.

152
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:54,560
But in the streams, if you compare people that whose intake is very low with people whose intake is high, it's probably okay.

153
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,839
At broadly, I mean, the grants that you get from your nutrients are not correct because I mean,

154
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,280
there's a lot of error, but at least you know that these people don't eat a lot.

155
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:08,640
These people eat a lot of that. Right. So that's kind of like the comparisons like we do with a focus on that.

156
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:17,090
And that's why the editorials are saying that is sufficient value for radiologic studies, because if there is enough variability in food intake,

157
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:24,830
we can kind of like come up with conclusions about it that is associated with any health outcome by comparing the people with low intake,

158
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:28,319
with people with high intake. But I mean,

159
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:34,840
they think that the editorial kind of like the another remark is that it there is conflicting views on food frequency

160
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:41,260
reports and representations of dietary composition that what Dr. William was thinking or the estimate of absolute.

161
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:53,660
That's what Dr. BLOCK was thinking. Right. So. So let's kind of like see, just kind of like a summary of the what happened with the article.

162
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:58,760
So they did all this improvement into the HQ.

163
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:04,640
Right. So they went through those cognitive issues to make sure that people it was easy for people to answer it.

164
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:10,160
Have you have you ever fill out an interview on paper, one of those that is just four pages that.

165
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:14,330
Yeah. So what do you think about those? They have, right?

166
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:18,710
Because it's a list that everything is really small. Kind of like to make it more efficient.

167
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:25,309
Not a lot of paper, but their heart rate. So that's why in the HQ they decided to get people near the space.

168
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:29,440
People need to be asked about some things before others.

169
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:37,240
Like, for example, you ask about milk and then people will tell you something and then they suddenly you say, well, buy milk added to coffee.

170
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:42,110
Then they are confused. Well, but it's all milk there or it's milk added to coffee about or things like that.

171
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,530
Right. So you have to be careful. Right.

172
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:51,109
They were also they didn't they foods and the portion sizes and they were using a new method to estimate nutrient intake.

173
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:57,010
That was a state of the art, kind of like trying to improve the position, tables and estimation and everything.

174
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,780
So they were doing the best of the best, right?

175
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:08,600
But when they compare with the reviewers, I mean, what happened is that, of course, I mean, they knew one that was better, did better overall.

176
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,380
Right, followed by the blocked one.

177
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:18,500
But then when you adjust for total energy intake, there were not really many differences between the three of them,

178
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,280
which is kind of like depressing because they spend so much time trying to improve it.

179
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:26,840
Then it's kind of like, well, I mean with the one that we were using was probably okay,

180
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:39,530
the HQ and Blood were better than estimating absolute intake, which is true, but the FDA is not really made to estimate absolute intake anyway.

181
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:46,549
Right. But all of them were comparable for us is that this is risk, which is what epidemiologist we are doing.

182
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:55,730
Right. So and then the last thing is that none of them are great, even the one that they spend so much time to including.

183
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:02,210
Right. Which kind of like goes to one of the comments that really that probably there is a ceiling of validity.

184
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:08,540
That means that we can really do better with a few because it's very difficult to ask people about their diet.

185
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,620
So it's like when you have something that is very valid,

186
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,890
you are assuming that the correlations with your goal stand that are going to be point eight and above.

187
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:29,150
Right. That's what I kind of like a strong correlation is with the effect cuz most of the times you don't see correlations even of 1.5, right?

188
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:36,110
So it's kind of like even lower, right. Which are weak or moderate correlations at most that that's that's the best you can do.

189
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:41,840
Maybe with things like coffee and caffeine, you can go up 2.7 or something like that and not better than that.

190
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,890
And this is because well, I mean, there is a lot of error involved.

191
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:50,810
And then we have to do radical acceptance here.

192
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:56,870
You have to live with error. That's what kind of like becoming a nutritional epidemiologist is.

193
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:06,830
I mean, error is this. So then that's why you have to be careful about your conclusions, the limitations, and you can do sense of all that.

194
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:10,100
I mean, there are I mean, we all kind of like check.

195
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:15,190
One of the topics is correction for human error. You can correct from a human error.

196
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,300
So you can do that or you can kind of like do other things that we will discuss this semester.

197
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:31,070
Okay. So, so now that we know that if you is not great but is good enough, so why?

198
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:39,280
Q And not other methods. So then what are the methods that we have as kind of like nutritional assessment methods?

199
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:44,620
And when we talk about nutrition assessment methods, it's kind of like are we use broader, right?

200
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:48,399
Because I mean, it's not only diet, I often intake what we are assessing,

201
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:54,670
but we can also kind of look at metabolites in our tissues or we can even look at anthropometric

202
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:59,010
indicators because those are kind of reflecting our nutritional status in another way.

203
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:04,150
Right. But yeah, so we will have kind of like nice.

204
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,110
We will have this one two ways to discuss this topic, this topic.

205
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,680
And maybe for weeks we will discuss this,

206
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:18,580
identify mind because now we are going to focus only on the methods that we use to measure food intake, their diet.

207
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:25,659
Right. And most of the studies where students here are nutrition, students of India are very familiar with those.

208
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:30,010
But we are going to review weekly for the non nutrition students.

209
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,450
So you know that they are kind of like the ones that are shelter.

210
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:42,520
They before our records and data records and the ones that are trying to measure London maybe that history and then this is the

211
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:50,499
one that we have and do I mean they used to be not that different from the food questionnaire so can any nutritionist deal.

212
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,400
And so what is the difference between the 24 hour record some day diet records?

213
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:05,050
It is just part of a longer time period that they collect information about, but they're less.

214
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,810
Well, no. Did I ever cause you are collecting prospectively.

215
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:19,960
So that's the so basically that they recourses you have one day for their records or you have one day for 24 hour records.

216
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:26,650
Right. So with 24 hour records, basically, I'm asking you, what did you eat during the last 24 hours?

217
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:31,960
Right. And then you have to remember everything. So in theory is very accurate.

218
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:37,390
Right. And sometimes is difficult because sometimes people don't remember what they yesterday.

219
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:46,420
Right. But through interview and using the algorithm, kind of like going a few times through kind of like, okay, what do you eat for breakfast?

220
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,860
Whether you eat for lunch, whether you for dinner? Did you eat anything in between?

221
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:54,850
Going through a list of things that people forget drinks, snacks and things like that.

222
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:59,080
Sometimes you get a pretty accurate information, right?

223
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:08,979
So the problem and that's the 24 hour recall and then this is relying on past memory, short term memory by this past memory,

224
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:15,040
because what happened yesterday, like the day of recall, is doing kind of like a similar thing just one day.

225
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:20,560
But you are kind of like recording what you are eating as you are eating.

226
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,609
It is perspective. So then you wake up in the morning and there's yoga.

227
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:31,300
I'm going to have my cup of coffee and going to kind of like have my cereal or are you going to have a banana or whatever, right?

228
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:36,450
And one of the advantages of the day of recall is that you can't even introduce like a scale, right?

229
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:47,110
So you can kind of like measure it weight exactly how much kind of like milk you are put in or how much how many grams your banana eat.

230
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:53,260
Right. So it is very accurate, right? I mean, you have to train people in doing those things, but it can be really ugly.

231
00:28:53,560 --> 00:29:00,520
Now, this is the usual thing with this and thing is that you really call it only one day,

232
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,969
either 24 hour recall or I recall, because we know from last week that one day is not enough, right?

233
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,990
One day can be your birthday and then you were eating a lot of cake, right?

234
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:22,780
So usually you call it a few days and usually you try those few days to kind of like be a representative of your kind of like long term intake.

235
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:27,460
So it should be something a few days during the week.

236
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:36,040
I mean, taking sampling weekends for a few days, sampling with this ratio, then that is sometimes you can do it over a long term period,

237
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:41,460
then you may even kind of like date to sample different systems to make sure that those days have representative.

238
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,480
That is what they are.

239
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:51,510
We are using they were doing when they had this kind of like 28 days and those were dietary records they were all doing over a year.

240
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,100
So that's why we say that. That's like the true intake.

241
00:29:54,670 --> 00:30:03,550
Now, what is the problem with that, that, yes, when people are reporting on the need, they may be better.

242
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:08,650
If they don't want to break down. Yeah, or more simple.

243
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,150
Right now, you're right.

244
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:15,280
That is the problem with the virus, because they may be more accurate, but we may be completely biased because if you think about,

245
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:21,930
okay, I'm going to do this fantastic spin of life or kind of like dinner, and then it's like, oh, my goodness, what?

246
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:25,480
So, I mean, let's go with this. A banana. And then that's it, right?

247
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,580
So then, yeah, people change, may change their behavior, then maybe we react to that.

248
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:37,570
They may change their behavior. That's an advantage over the 24 hour it goes to different Oracle jewelry anything like so so yeah.

249
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,360
So both have pros and cons,

250
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:48,880
but the main con of the short term is that you need many ways because otherwise you won't be captured in the long term anything.

251
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:57,100
Right? So and the problem is that when you have only 20 people in the study and maybe you can afford many of these,

252
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:03,339
but you have 30,000 people, you can't you can't really you cannot really you cannot even do three days.

253
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:08,530
I mean, a lot is a lot of kind of life resources and and very difficult.

254
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:21,970
So that's why instead of using this, most large studies will use full frequency questionnaires because even though it's long,

255
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:28,360
you already have one year of data kind of like and that one year data,

256
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:33,400
we are making the assumption that if you are an adult, probably roughly as your long term intake for the last few years.

257
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:37,080
Okay, so that's I mean, you're already covered in the long term intake.

258
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:42,610
So so why a fifth year?

259
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:48,849
Because long term intake is important and you can only get long term intake with 24 hour records.

260
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:52,480
And they have records, if you call them, over a year, which is not feasible.

261
00:31:52,720 --> 00:32:00,070
Right. Um, sometimes it may be better to have crude information over a long period than precise information for a short period.

262
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,480
So that's the main issue.

263
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:10,600
And sometimes, believe it or not, it may be easier to recall usual intake than the intake yesterday, although I I'm not that sure about that.

264
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:22,030
Yeah. I mean, one thing is also it may be easier to recruit more participants when it's less of a in terms of I mean,

265
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:25,810
you might not get many people to like buy into more in their food every day.

266
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,160
Yeah, exactly. That's a very good point. I mean, the burden on on people.

267
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,180
Yeah, definitely the burden on people is very important to you are going to I mean, this is it's very intense.

268
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:44,079
Then not many people will like to participate. And actually the few people who participate probably self-selected.

269
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,740
I mean, you have a lot of selection bias and you don't want that in many studies.

270
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:56,889
Okay. So, so remember also the I already talk about this, so remember that it is strongly variable from day to day.

271
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:02,049
This is from last week and making only one day is very poor assessment of bias.

272
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:06,940
And then you will need to measure multiple days with a 24 hour recall and they're under they of records.

273
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:15,009
And that's why usually we don't use them we use those to validate or review by we really use the I mean, it's not true.

274
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:19,569
I mean, some studies are using 24 hour records and and they have records.

275
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:23,950
But but sometimes they use just two or three.

276
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:30,670
No, no more. Which then, even though it's accurate, is not reflective of long term anything.

277
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,470
So you have to be careful about that.

278
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:43,239
Okay so bottom line for a year so we are not so much interested in a and have to look into remember because that's

279
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:50,049
not I mean we have a lot of error right but in ranking individuals so who eats a lot of something compared to who?

280
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:54,400
It's very little something. Right. And they do have limitations.

281
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:59,440
I mean, you just try to fill it out and you are not able to perceive even the ability.

282
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,130
So it takes forever and on and and they have a lot of outlook,

283
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:09,519
but there is a compromise with an accuracy and being able to conduct population based studies.

284
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,040
So this is the even though I told you they are not great, this is the best we can do.

285
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:23,979
Okay, so then let's try to use them correctly and knowing the limitations that makes you kind of life empowering in way because I mean,

286
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:29,799
you know how to kind of like interpret the associations better. Okay, okay.

287
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:38,710
So now let's move into should we ask for portion size because this is a huge issue that is also discussed in the article.

288
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:47,259
So for focus, your question is come in all sizes and colors and they are very different, right?

289
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:55,300
So so some I mean, you could find some with no portion size at all.

290
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,430
I mean, they are just asking the frequency.

291
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:06,310
I mean, those are the most frequent, but frequent one is when you have the person say size is specified but is skip fix.

292
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:14,679
So that's kind of like if I send out water, will it if it gives that one, that's why it's called semi quantitative.

293
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:20,890
But so basically that's why you you don't ask people when you ask people, how often do you drink milk?

294
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:30,760
And they will tell you, well, I mean, to isolate, for example, and then instead of asking you, okay, and when you drink milk, how much do you drink?

295
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:39,100
They don't they don't ask you that. They just put in brackets that parentheses, that one portion is eight ounces of milk.

296
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:42,940
So then you have to do the math and you're kind of like brainless.

297
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,780
Yeah, I know. My milk portion is eight ounces.

298
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:55,209
Then that's fine. I say two. But do they bug me if my portion is half because I put a lot of coffee, then probably.

299
00:35:55,210 --> 00:36:00,520
Then if it's hard, then I say once, are they right? Because I mean, even though I take it twice, right.

300
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:04,690
So you in a way, you have to do that math. Do people do the math?

301
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:13,360
Probably not. Right. So most likely they're going to like ignore the portion size and they put whatever frequency with their own portion size in mind.

302
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:19,120
The good thing about adding something is that at least it gives some clarity, like what the portion size is.

303
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:23,950
I mean, for other things, right? Because MSNBC, you don't put anything, I me people are completely lost, right?

304
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,010
And then the third option is to ask separate questions about abortion,

305
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,399
say so you can use words or you can use pictures or models or shapes or whatever.

306
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:39,910
Right? So saying I mean, some and many of you in addition to probably familiar with with a way of asking

307
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:43,989
people because kind of like with models for models and things like that.

308
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:50,080
Right. Okay. So what, what do you think is the best of the three approaches?

309
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:12,760
Why the middle one? Because just asking, like you can see people have very different ideas of portion sizes.

310
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:18,909
Mm hmm. And this is a fair question.

311
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:22,000
This might just be too arduous for people to. Right here.

312
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:27,939
Me? Mm hmm. Well, I tell you what, because most usually it's kind of like counterintuitive,

313
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,710
because usually most people think that, oh, the more information you have, the better.

314
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,050
So then kind of make you think that you have a portion size, you are more accurate, right?

315
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:43,170
But what happened with people? People are terrible at answering frequency.

316
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:51,290
They are even more terrible at answering portion size. I mean, humans are not I mean, our brain is not made to kind of like estimate portion size.

317
00:37:51,290 --> 00:38:00,609
So we are very easily tricked by container is like I mean if you think about when you that's why like when people tell you you want do it,

318
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:05,080
let's just put it in a small plate, right. Because you will think that you are eating more.

319
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:09,650
Right. So imagine asking people about their portion size if you don't know the container.

320
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:14,649
Right. Or kind of like people have sometimes this portion size ideal in their brains,

321
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:23,350
but then when they kind of like put it and some things are easy like for example, I don't know, maybe eggs are small, medium and large.

322
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:31,059
So then, but think about just normal food that you put on a plate and then it goes depending.

323
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:35,750
Of course, if they play this big on in that setting, the plate is not that big.

324
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:39,670
Right. So then you you are it's very difficult to calculate your portion size, right?

325
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:45,180
So the truth is that portion sizes are generally police.

326
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:54,460
They made it even more than frequencies. Most of the inter individual variations actually due to frequency, not so much the portion size.

327
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:58,660
There is modulation of course, but the higher variation is due to frequency.

328
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:05,799
So the one that we want to to capture is mostly due to kind of low frequency and actually portion size is correlated with frequency.

329
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:11,640
So in a way, yes, asking frequency, you are captured in some of the variability in portion size too.

330
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:22,300
So then you are not that bad. And there are studies that show that asking for additional portion size does not have substantial effect on ranking.

331
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:27,219
And of course it changes some of the absolute data, but we don't care about the actual data.

332
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:36,459
Remember, we care about the ranking. So if the ranking is not going to change, why should we ask about portion size when first it adds more burden?

333
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,480
Because on top of one question, you have to answer the second question, right?

334
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,290
I mean, the frequency and then the portion size.

335
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:48,700
And you have to think about all and then sometimes actually asking the portion size and that's my personal experience,

336
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:55,180
sometimes even introduces more error and helps because people are completely unaware of the portion size.

337
00:39:55,180 --> 00:40:04,300
So then that that will add more error. And this is kind of like this is a very old study, but it was showing kind of like this psychology behind that,

338
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:09,340
that of course, if you train people to estimate portion size, they they do better.

339
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,629
I mean, and that happens.

340
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:17,050
I mean, if you think about kind of like nutrition is they are pretty good estimating portion size because they are doing that all the time.

341
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:21,800
Right. So then you train people, this is work like this is a percentage error.

342
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:30,570
People can say some different things and you can see that they I guess they're more kind of like less solid at something very high in

343
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:38,580
their they but there they are right when you train people they over the end of them already still there but it decreases a lot right.

344
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:44,830
But then when you ask them like one week or even four weeks later, I mean, one week, they still train, right?

345
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,559
Or even getting better because you are asking the same face.

346
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:53,680
But one month later they kind of like error returns to the initial one so people get and train.

347
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,810
I didn't I mean, you are not trained constantly. I mean, if you are not a nutrition or something like that, right.

348
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:04,930
So then basically you go back to your kind of like all thing of I don't know what I'm estimating, right?

349
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:14,620
So, so yeah. So no matter how many you repeat this experiment with many people who are not gooks or creationist,

350
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:18,820
they will kind of like get a lot of error in the portion size.

351
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:28,570
So, so what online you can ask about portion size but not necessarily is going to prove much, right?

352
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:32,649
Sometimes it maybe even worse. Okay.

353
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:36,549
So the other thing that you saw in the articles,

354
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:46,360
they were talking about the different types of error and then we were kind of like familiar with the variation between person and within person.

355
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:53,170
So those are different sources of potential error. But there is also another classification which is random and systematic, right?

356
00:41:53,590 --> 00:42:01,750
So you take into account those for kind of like face, then you end up with full four different types of error, right?

357
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:09,069
So you have random within person, random within person itself, within person variation.

358
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:15,520
The one that we were kind of saying the other day that we want people I mean, this is kind of like a true long term value for a person.

359
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:21,100
And then some people are kind of like going up or down every day, which is not really error, I mean.

360
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:28,740
Through radiation, but we are considered in that way. But that could be instead of random, could be systematic.

361
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:36,240
I mean, it could be that someone, when reporting their diet, is systematically always reporting a higher value or a lower value for whatever reason.

362
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:42,550
Right. So and then you also have it between persons, random and systematic.

363
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:52,680
Usually random. You have it when when you have through kind of like you have within personal random populations, then you will have that.

364
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:57,780
But you can also have systematic error between between person because I mean,

365
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:04,320
depending on the categories of people, some people will report consistently higher values as opposed to all.

366
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:08,459
Right. So the the the important thing here and don't worry,

367
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:15,810
because we will kind of review that during two weeks is that random within person error can be measure

368
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:22,500
can be corrected with a single replicate measure is what we did last week right we were getting

369
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:28,739
rid of the we think person random with to replicate you have to replicate you decompose the

370
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:35,520
variance using ANOVA and then you can get rid of the within person variation but systematic error.

371
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,909
When you have systematic error, you need that calibration study.

372
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:48,420
So you need an another study where you measure things with a gold standard and you can calibrate your your tool, right?

373
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:56,930
So we will see that kind of liking in I feel it said towards the end of the semester anyway.

374
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:04,470
And that white energy adjustment and this is one of the this is probably going to like they're the most special

375
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:09,960
topic in nutritional epidemiology because no one of us has an allergy assessment and energy to adjust for.

376
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,240
Right. So energy intake, maybe a primary terminal disease, we know that.

377
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:24,179
But most important, individual differences in energy intake may lead to what we call extraneous variation.

378
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:29,580
So then kind of like when we want to look at the between person variation in a nutrient,

379
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:39,179
I don't carry that variation comes because there are differences in age or differences in sex distribution or things like that, right.

380
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:43,469
Or difference in size. But I don't care because those are not the differences I'm measuring.

381
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:51,390
Right? I mean, of course, I mean, if you you are six foot, your total energy intake is going to be very high.

382
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:54,870
And that means that your nutrient intake of something, you're going to be high, too, right?

383
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:57,840
Because you I mean, if you eat a lot or you eat a lot of everything, right?

384
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:04,379
And if you are kind of like just five feet, then your intake intake is going to be lower, right?

385
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,660
And then your intake of nutrients is going to be lower.

386
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:14,670
So then the difference between those nutrients that is due to the fact that you are taller, I don't get all of that because you're like, hello.

387
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:20,399
I mean, you are told you are shorter, right? So then that's kind of like a strenuous variation in the Newton.

388
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:20,610
I mean,

389
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:30,450
what I get really is about the difference in then in their nutrition in terms of if you are eating too much in respect to your total energy intake,

390
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:35,790
right? So that way we care about the nutrient composition there, the kind of like composition in the diet, right?

391
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:42,479
No, not kind of like the absolute intake of the nutrient because that can be up or down because of your total energy intake.

392
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,459
Right. So that's why we adjust for total energy intake many times in nutritional epidemiology

393
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,170
to make sure that we get rid of that variation that is due to other factors.

394
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:57,600
Okay. And then finally, totally the intake because of that,

395
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:05,100
because it can be associated with a primary with the outcome of the outcome, and it's always associated with nutrients.

396
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,429
I mean, clearly, if you eat a lot, you eat a lot of everything.

397
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:14,489
So then it will be always an association. So then it can it can work as a confounder, right?

398
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:18,870
So then that way we kind of like adjust for, for the calorie intake.

399
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:30,100
Again, we will have two weeks to cover that. But I'm kind of like copying this paragraph from, from later blogs,

400
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:39,360
a comment that said the whole issue of the appropriateness of adjusting for energy in all

401
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:44,189
situations and for all note this has been resolved in the minds of many researchers,

402
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:53,220
but not in mine. For micronutrients in particular, requirements are usually expressed in absolute terms rather than relative to energy intake.

403
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,370
I really want to know whether a person's vitamin C intake is 45 milligrams or 90 milligrams per day.

404
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,180
I want to be able to infer that 45 milligrams per day is low,

405
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:09,930
and I don't want to infer that this level is normal or even high simply because it is high in relation to a very low reported energy intake.

406
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:16,769
So she's right and she was wrong. Okay, so she's right that yeah.

407
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:20,170
When you have micronutrients, you want this president, as I saw.

408
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:25,190
MP and I completely agree with her.

409
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:30,620
I mean I but she's wrong. The same that I just mean for energy in all situations.

410
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:36,770
Unfortunately that's that's not true. Exactly. This is one situation in which you want, I guess, for what they get.

411
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:46,270
So then we will see when we arrive to that point that we sometimes you don't want to just totally dig for several reasons and we will cover those.

412
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:50,989
Now, another situation is the situation of the food frequency question.

413
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:56,830
And when you are evaluating the food for your question, if you want to adjust for total energy intake,

414
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:02,770
when you are doing the correlation between your RFQ and your 24 hour recall, so that the records for three reasons.

415
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:07,540
One, because usually what you really care is about the food composition.

416
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,030
I mean, when you're talking about most nutrients, right?

417
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:18,520
I mean, yet when you are looking at item efficiency, you look at the absolute and when you are looking at fatty acids, protein, carbohydrates,

418
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:25,179
all other things, you really you are really concerned about the composition of the food as a percentage of total energy intake.

419
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:31,450
Why not? Not the absolute grams, right? Second, because it will decrease that.

420
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:39,080
Is this an issue between personal radiation that we talk about? I mean, I don't care if you are taller or shorter or you are older or down.

421
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:47,350
Right. And then finally and this is very important because in a way, it will compensate for the error.

422
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:56,410
So you can think about like you are measuring your nutrient with error and then calories with the same error and kind of like cancel out.

423
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:02,390
It's not it's not like that. So, you know, but it helps in that in that way.

424
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:11,680
Right. So kind of like ego and you so that the results from that there will as a few improve when

425
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,940
they adjusted for totality because they were kind of like getting rid of the errors,

426
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:18,760
you know, right on the kind of like canceling outdoor setups.

427
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:27,820
So that's why when you do a validation of an F few with information from the fifth on the 24 hour recall,

428
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:31,210
you want to adjust for that because that will improve the correlation.

429
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:36,280
Right. So then that will help with the validity. So that was the main reason why they did that.

430
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:42,130
Okay. And then I will go, I'm almost done because I've been talking a lot.

431
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:51,430
Go quickly to the food competition tables and the last thing, and then we will take a break and then we'll talk about for the for the lab.

432
00:49:53,470 --> 00:50:00,880
So another problem with the fuel is that not only you have error in how people answer,

433
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:05,110
which is a lot we know because people are not good at estimating the frequencies.

434
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:10,870
They are good estimating their the portion size. And they also have some social desirability bias.

435
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:17,680
Right. That they want to answer that I'm eating very well when I'm not right, which is impossible to avoid.

436
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:25,450
I mean, it happens to all of us. Right? So but on top of that, when you have your force, then you want to calculate your nutrients, right?

437
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:37,000
Now, how do you calculate your nutrients? You need to know kind of like how many kind of like I don't know how much how many grams of fatty acids are.

438
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:43,140
So the fatty acids are in soybean oil or how many kind of grams of protein are in in a day.

439
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:44,079
Right. Or things like that.

440
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:51,640
So what do you go you go to your nutritional databases, which they use the is fantastic is a huge database that has a lot of information.

441
00:50:52,030 --> 00:51:01,030
But even though they use these bands, a lot of kind of like money in trying to kind of like calculate those or estimate those kind of like

442
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:06,669
nutrient contents is still we are always making an assumption that there is a constant nutrient content.

443
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:10,670
So then when you look at a covered in the USDA,

444
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:15,579
we're assuming that all the carrots in the world have the same composition, which we know is not right.

445
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:21,790
I mean, we know that there's variation. I mean, not all carrot will have the same amount of miracle it no matter what they use the ACS.

446
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:31,350
Right. So there is already there another layer of error for Chile.

447
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:39,940
Right. And it's even worse if you go to kind of like you go to the USDA, you have I mean, you can get lost there.

448
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:46,030
Right. So have so many. I mean, you put carrots and they will kind of like have like a long list.

449
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:50,259
I mean, even if you put they have they analyze every single brand, everything.

450
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,220
I mean, it's amazing, right?

451
00:51:52,180 --> 00:52:00,340
But if you are not working in the US and you're working in other countries, and particularly you're working in low middle income countries,

452
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:05,020
and then you want to know about the composition of the foods that are nutritional.

453
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:10,990
There sometimes you may be in trouble because they even though they are American international directly for competition,

454
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,630
probably there is not so much information. Right.

455
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:19,180
So some foods won't be there or you won't have the whole kind of like composition or things like that.

456
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,270
Or they maybe the competition is from. 1970.

457
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:24,700
And they didn't reveal it later or things like that. Right.

458
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:36,630
So kind of like you can see that even in the US that we are fortunate to have such a amazing resource and even that it is still we have a.

459
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:40,720
So you go to other countries then you have even more sometimes.

460
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:45,490
I mean, we have to kind of like go to the USDA if I'm something similar, right?

461
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:49,360
Which yeah, it may work, but again, etc.

462
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:52,480
So we are just always adding error and error to our estimate.

463
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:58,710
So that's why you have to be I mean, I'm after this pleasure problem and the same thing with the professions,

464
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:03,040
because there's no way I can measure that. Well, no, you can.

465
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,849
But remember that that that's not the goal to measure accurately.

466
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:11,049
The goal is to rank people. And for ranking people, this is good enough, believe me.

467
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:14,860
So we will be able to do that. Okay. Okay.

468
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:20,409
So that's. And then finally, how to validate that they're 50 and this is what you are going to do in the lab.

469
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:25,720
Right. So the problem with validating that data is that there's no real gold standard.

470
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:29,799
Right. So you're measuring for a sample. I don't know.

471
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:39,580
I mean, you you're comparing, for example, BMI, which is a in theory, a proxy of of adiposity, not a great proxy, but more or less.

472
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:43,150
We use it a lot in the field like you have.

473
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:50,820
You can do at DEXA, right? You can do excess gun and that would be your goal standard become your measuring in very accurately your yeah.

474
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:54,730
Your fat deposits and also you can measure the bone, right.

475
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:59,830
So but for diet, we don't have a gold standard.

476
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:03,880
We don't unless I mean the gold standard would be I mean,

477
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:07,990
let's have you and then I'm going to follow you for the rest of your life kind of like and

478
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:12,129
see what you are eating and measuring everything so that that would be the gold standard,

479
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:18,820
that that's impossible. Right? And even that it will be not real because almost every year you are going to change your life.

480
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,340
Right? So then we know that that that will work.

481
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:31,110
So what we do as a gold standard is we use repeated dietary records or 24 hour records and then more the better, right.

482
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:34,209
I mean, you have a lot like they they they they they do.

483
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:38,830
I work in ways that is kind of like 28 day records over a year.

484
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:40,149
That's that's pretty good.

485
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:50,469
So that's kind of like seem to be more or less cycles than that is not but is closest to the list that right I know that thing that we can do is to

486
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:59,320
validate against biomarkers way because of biomarkers if they are good biomarkers biomarkers are a nutrients that you can measure in your tissues.

487
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:03,830
You can measure them in in blood, in saliva and adipose tissue depends.

488
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,270
Some senators will be better biomarkers depending on this.

489
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:12,940
Right. So if you can measure those, at least you know that biomarkers are objective, right?

490
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:16,300
So that at least you know that kind of like it is what it is.

491
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,300
I mean, you're measuring that. I mean, that the lab has to. Right.

492
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:27,800
But usually has a low and that's kind of like that can be quantified with a collision of radiation and things like that right now validated.

493
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:32,889
I guess the biomarker sounds like, oh, that's great. But actually it has its own problems.

494
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:38,980
I mean, and we will see we have again two weeks on the topic of biomarkers because there are no

495
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:43,870
biomarkers for all nutrients because they are super expensive and difficult to collect.

496
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:47,199
Right. So imagine to us all they want to give you adipose tissue.

497
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:54,189
I mean, most people are not that, you know, and also because there is some problems with time integration,

498
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:58,420
they must I mean, the best thing that you can get from people usually is blood, right?

499
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:09,250
And in blood, we can measure many things. But whatever happens in blood is reflecting what you were eating yesterday, not two years ago.

500
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,719
Right. Because it's a kind of like short term thing.

501
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,900
Right. I mean, it goes very quickly and then it will go to other places. Right.

502
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,810
So so biomarkers are not perfect either.

503
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:30,730
And one thing we can do and that's kind of like been done in, in, in the last kind of like two decades is that you everything you can.

504
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:37,569
So there is one dietary method and this one method it's called the method of trial that

505
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:44,020
used another dietary method maybe 24 hour recalls on or the had records and biomarkers.

506
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:54,730
And we triangulate that and we are going to do that in the let me show you is this we're going to do that in the in the in the topic of the FDA.

507
00:56:54,820 --> 00:57:00,070
So we will have the biomarker here, the reference method, the present day, of course.

508
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:04,870
And the if you we kind of like calculate that and we are assuming we get some validity coefficient.

509
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:08,830
So that's a very nice way of evaluating something. So we will see that later.

510
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:14,830
But in the meantime we are not going to use the biomarker, we're just going to use delay of wrinkles.

511
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:20,860
So what are the statistical methods that you can use? You can use anything.

512
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:25,710
Because they are just comparing the nutrient from the few with the nutrient from their diet records.

513
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:31,530
Right. So what can you do? You can do many things. Now, in practice, most people just do corrections.

514
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:36,730
Correlation coefficient is the most straightforward thing because those are continuous variables, right?

515
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:41,520
You will get low grams of protein from one method and grams of protein for the other.

516
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:46,499
And then you just correlate and see if the correlation is high. The correlation is high enough.

517
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:55,170
We'll talk about that. What is high and low in nutritional epi then you assume that you are measuring well with if you look.

518
00:57:56,250 --> 00:58:02,219
So that brings me this problem of correlation coefficients that you have to be aware

519
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:10,230
of the correlation because of the way that the correlation coefficient is built,

520
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:13,920
right, because of the formula will happen.

521
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:22,080
And then this is illustrated here in the two figures is that the correlation is going to be lower, is there between first and variation decreases?

522
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:34,890
So if you look at this and then you look at this, you could tell me from both figures that in theory, the two variables are associated the same way.

523
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:38,390
Right? I mean, you can see that their life is the same right from the life.

524
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:49,020
Is it okay? But the correlation coefficient is going to be lower here than here because the variation, the nutrients lower here than here.

525
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:52,080
Right. And this is this is a problem with the correlation coefficient.

526
00:58:52,080 --> 00:59:01,139
So you have to be careful about that too, because as I told you that some nutrients on food have low variability in certain populations.

527
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:04,470
So you have low variability, your collision coefficients are going to be low anyway.

528
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:12,920
Okay, so be careful about that. No matter what, people still always use correlation coefficients for for this validation method.

529
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,299
Okay. Okay.

530
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:30,030
And then okay, so I'll stop here and then we will ask you the questions because I think now you probably want to have a bathroom break back.

531
00:59:31,800 --> 01:00:03,180
So 5 minutes and then we'll go back. Like.

532
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:23,570
Go. Coming down to the wire. But I do want to.

533
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:38,870
I was. Yes.

534
01:00:56,380 --> 01:01:02,080
She? Would you?

535
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:54,840
You. And you tell us.

536
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:03,050
You're not.

537
01:02:15,630 --> 01:03:14,570
I'll let you off on the Hollywood. This is the.

538
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:44,120
Was. Do it.

539
01:03:57,370 --> 01:04:11,520
You can. What do I have to do this weekend?

540
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:35,370
To. You.

541
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:59,260
Yes. Question. Mm hmm. When we talk about using only do to.

542
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:08,530
Was closed. It was all very.

543
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:13,160
Yeah, but I thought it was going to include both thinking.

544
01:05:13,930 --> 01:05:18,820
No, you have it, but you have less. Yeah, you have less, but you have it.

545
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,540
But you still have between people and between us.

546
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:24,040
Always. I mean we think. Yeah.

547
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:31,700
So when you have only one day that with in person variation is much higher because it remember the effect of sampling like when you have the,

548
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:38,430
the 28 days to put it through and then you take seven days just to see kind of like the,

549
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:45,040
the distribution gets wider so less and when you when you have one only then even wider.

550
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:52,290
So then you can see that there was impression variation is higher, less when you have fewer, kind of like less.

551
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:59,290
Yeah. Because from 1 to 2 you have more than 11.

552
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:01,850
So that is lower, but it's still there.

553
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:10,670
So is when in the third question, when you remove the with person variation, that's the whole purpose of the third question I think is the third one.

554
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:16,399
Okay. It's good to I mean, we can I mean,

555
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:22,820
we will have time later now to do the labs and then we can go to that and you can ask me and then I can go on ticket with it.

556
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:28,850
Okay, let's go back because I have a couple of questions for you and then I'll go into the lab.

557
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:35,240
So. So in today's papers, the review was validated against a number of 24 hour records.

558
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:41,060
Right. So, um, so whether you think about 24 hour courses, the reference is three.

559
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:52,330
So this is your gold standard. Is it true?

560
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:55,790
Ghost under. No.

561
01:06:56,690 --> 01:07:01,910
It's an imperfect ghost on that. Right. So, I mean, is the best you can do, but it's not better.

562
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:10,939
So and the the main problem, and I'm not sure if you remember from the discussion in the in their paper and in their in their letters,

563
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:18,050
is that is it reasonable to assume that errors between the 15 and the 24 hour records are uncorrelated?

564
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:32,110
Why not? Because people who make overreporting on a frequency questionnaire probably more likely to report on income for recall and vice versa.

565
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:37,690
So if you underreport, you should always under one rule.

566
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:42,110
Yeah, exactly. So that was actually one of the reasons why.

567
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:49,520
Well, they will mention that either errors are correlated and when you are asking portion size, probably there was an even more correlated.

568
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:57,350
Right. So then that can inflate the correlations that can make them apparently looking better, but they are not really true.

569
01:07:57,380 --> 01:08:01,970
I mean, these know that they are higher. They are just kind of like getting that in this situation.

570
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:06,650
They are always kind of like going in the in the in in their advantage.

571
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:13,579
Right. I mean, the error is correlated with 24 hour recall and that if you then you are going to see a higher correlation because

572
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:20,549
the people who make a never make it in the sense in in in the two things right or even higher or either lower right.

573
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:25,680
So that kind of like increases the correlation. So that that was that that that was one.

574
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:32,989
I mean, of course, this is not that correlated sort of error.

575
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:40,160
Correlation is not explaining all the differences between they all live a huge they they they have history boasting about it still better.

576
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:46,100
Right. But it may is playing a little bit of the differences between with with what the this question.

577
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:51,080
Okay so now let's moving to the right to the break.

578
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:57,980
So let's move into the into the lab. So that part two, we're going to validate the question with that request.

579
01:08:58,370 --> 01:09:03,769
Remember that they are the records intended for our records are used they are not

580
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:08,960
exactly the same because we saw what are the differences and the pros and cons.

581
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:17,120
But for the purposes of validation, it doesn't matter because we will just have a feel either that the records are few 24 hour

582
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:22,240
records that are supposed to capture the long term data and are supposed to be read through it.

583
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:31,880
And the true kind of like estimate the true intake, we are assuming that is it will be like a gold standard even though we know is not okay that.

584
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:37,520
But that's the best we can do. Okay. So now you have your for one week they are records so that remember this is

585
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:42,890
the same kind of like people that you had in the in the previous last week.

586
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:46,850
But you have another dataset for that for that thing.

587
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:54,469
So you have your 1980 women and those were kind of like collected that then there was no three months representing that whole year.

588
01:09:54,470 --> 01:10:01,280
So that's supposed to be the true intake, right? So after completion of the records, the women completed food frequency questionnaire.

589
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:05,990
So therefore so the question is always asking about the past year.

590
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:10,600
So the year that they were collecting the their records is the same as the past year in the fifth year.

591
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:15,320
So they now become a component. Right. So they mean intake for it.

592
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:22,100
Submitted was calculated using all 28 days of their records and it's assumed that this represents the true intake.

593
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:27,920
Okay. So that's all stuff. And they, they are on the collection in canvas and it's called validation.

594
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:31,160
Okay. Not variation variation with what we know.

595
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:37,100
This one is validation that anybody able to identify like protein, fat, carbohydrate,

596
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:43,639
vitamin and cholesterol, both from their food frequency questionnaire and from their 28 days of diet record.

597
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:52,430
And note that the labels of the environment are more or less I think I think actually the the name of the viral survey,

598
01:10:52,430 --> 01:11:01,009
I think they have labels on most positive, but if not, you can recognize them easily because there may be this protein divide.

599
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:05,120
This is several hundreds and it is collected.

600
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,879
The only thing that is not that is three for one is the calories.

601
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:15,320
Because the calories when you have if it's coming from a few of it, they or the four weeks of the day.

602
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:23,130
Okay so the idea is that this is less for wheat means that we know that only eight days and because

603
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:28,640
that is a true intake and if less than a few is that is coming from the food frequency question okay.

604
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:33,349
So the only problem here is calories, but I think you have to use calories.

605
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:36,440
And then what one maybe is I don't know, but these are calories. Okay.

606
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:41,270
But in any case, I'm almost positive that the variables have labels.

607
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:45,349
So you can change that. We have broken this. Okay. Okay.

608
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:48,740
So now really how personal carefully recursive.

609
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:54,980
I mean, the question actually is not that kind of like a larger body has a lot of information to clarify it.

610
01:11:56,030 --> 01:12:00,600
So now the problem with nutritional data is that it never falls below zero.

611
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:07,160
You're going to have negative calories, right? And it will usually not be normally distributed.

612
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:15,380
So it's kind of like bound it at zero. And then usually you have a low and kind of like then because there are some people who are alive.

613
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:18,740
I mean, there are people who eat a lot of something, right?

614
01:12:20,690 --> 01:12:30,319
So sometimes you may need that summation of the data for statistical methods that are assuming a normal distribution of the data like correlations.

615
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:36,650
I mean, the correlations we're using are based on correlations. So those are assuming that both variables are more widely distributed.

616
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:42,950
We can do experiment correlations. And then that one made that assumption and I'll talk about that later.

617
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:48,710
But for now, let's do some correlations. Okay. So there are several ways to test for normality, right?

618
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:52,040
One good way is to blood values.

619
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:55,100
Values, like I said, normal distribution. So you can do that in SAS.

620
01:12:55,550 --> 01:12:58,850
We have shown blood in the univariate pursuit. Right.

621
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:06,760
And then you have the the code in your in your in your in your lab now.

622
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:08,900
So the question is in, in,

623
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:19,400
in black for each nutrient blood then transform nutrients using the blood and in some investigation and plots that are be linear instead of linear.

624
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:29,450
I'm sorry. I'm losing my. Oh, yeah. Is that only to indicate alleviation for normality so they have their normal priority is

625
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:35,510
that you have a line right at 45 degrees and in theory the points should lie on the line,

626
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:39,379
right? So the moment that you get something instead of like a linear thing,

627
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:43,940
you get something like this, then clearly your data is not normally restricted, right?

628
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:48,590
You can also look at the historical right because a historian is kind of like, okay, for the stuff used to run.

629
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:54,420
Like more or less like a normal curve is normal is doing the exact histogram like this while that's not normally stated.

630
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:59,920
Right. So then you can choose either.

631
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:06,379
It's okay. So try this in procedure after log transform in there there are usually natural logs and we see that that's the most

632
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:15,200
kind of like you saw one usually that improves the normality of the data and compare your output to that transform.

633
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:22,220
You can use a statistical test on top of the of that you can use the capital Walcott on this.

634
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:28,879
But I don't recommend this approach because statistical this are very conservative

635
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:33,440
and I will spend that now and the set option for getting that this is normal.

636
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:39,080
Okay so the null hypothesis for that this is that the data is distributed normally.

637
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:43,520
And then my question now is for which nucleotide formation is appropriate, right?

638
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:49,190
So in your homework we showed that you check each variable for normality and this and future assignment.

639
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:54,979
And this is very important that I formed the data when I broke it. I'm not going to remind you that all the time.

640
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:58,310
So you always you will have to do that for the rest of your life.

641
01:14:58,330 --> 01:15:04,040
You are working with the tree data. So every time you have to check the distribution of the library there,

642
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:11,120
because if it's not normally distributed and you're using the statistical days that are assuming normal distribution,

643
01:15:11,390 --> 01:15:18,490
then you are doing something wrong. So you need to transfer the data or you need to do other statistical checks on

644
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:22,040
maybe you need a super large sample size rice or something that works too.

645
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:34,069
Okay, so this is the SAS code. So basically this is a data step to create a log variable for the property life and you just use the log fashion.

646
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:42,889
This is the natural log, so don't use the similar views, the natural law that works better, you can call it whatever you want.

647
01:15:42,890 --> 01:15:46,760
I just put it that way because it's not that easy to identify.

648
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:51,890
And then this is what you are going to do. Yes, we are going to use univariate on your dataset.

649
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:56,419
The normal option is going to give you the plot, the histogram sun.

650
01:15:56,420 --> 01:16:02,540
And then I might be the one that we told you. And the normal option is going to give you that.

651
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:10,660
This option is going to be the block and then you do it for both variables, the null transform and the sure.

652
01:16:11,090 --> 01:16:15,650
And then you check if Brody needs to return form or not.

653
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:19,530
Right. Checking which which this decision looks more.

654
01:16:19,550 --> 01:16:24,980
Not right. So you have to do that for all the notice that you have now for the future.

655
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:34,910
Note a couple of things, but for this lab and for the future, the transformation sometimes don't work well.

656
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:40,150
So editor automation does not improve. Normality don't transform, okay?

657
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:45,469
Because it does not help and actually makes more complicated interpretation of the variable is have

658
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:50,180
to pursue this not now because we are going to do all the correlations but for linear regression,

659
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:58,340
nothing like that. I mean the interpretation of the radical features in the log scale, r.p, I mean it's kind of like what the heck is.

660
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:04,090
But one unit increased the change in the law, the grams of nutrients, right?

661
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:10,370
So it's very difficult to do that. But so you can consider all the transformations that we want to call it.

662
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:19,249
Sometimes they work better, but again, that information doesn't work for me now that this one normality are very conservative.

663
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:24,930
So that means that even if you look something like this really show you.

664
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:35,150
You have something like this? That looks pretty normal, right?

665
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:40,340
But if this is it, you can see that this is a really high skill.

666
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:45,739
So this is going to kind of like be like not this is not gonna but when you have a large sample size,

667
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:49,370
something like this is kind of like, it's okay and you wake up soon enough.

668
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:56,300
So don't rely on this because it does sound very conservative, particularly when you have a large sample size, if any.

669
01:17:56,540 --> 01:18:03,230
I mean, you have something like this perfectly normal, and it's only there's one person here, kind of like outlier.

670
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:07,210
Then this is going to kind of like break everything.

671
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:14,660
So it's going to show, like, almost nothing. And it's like, so kind of like just common sense.

672
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:19,970
I mean, when you see something like this, yeah, that's not going to be seen again no matter what.

673
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:24,260
So that's really how you see that. You see something like this.

674
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:34,150
So it will be up to you to decide what is reasonably normal.

675
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:37,300
And also you will have to decide depending on your sample size.

676
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:47,110
The larger the sample size, the more departures from normality you can afford, the lower the sample size, the more strict you have to be.

677
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:54,700
Okay. So and the other thing is that if normality is clearly violated, then the commission can improve it.

678
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:59,679
You can use non parametric methods. These are all the methods that we will cover.

679
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:03,879
But instead of for the case of the person correlation coefficient,

680
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:11,260
you can use split among experiments and non parametric method which you use exactly the same code as seen in SAS.

681
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:16,670
But you put the option spearman. Okay. So then you could use that too, and then you will have to test for them environment.

682
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:19,980
So that's another option. No.

683
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:24,800
So this is the normal distribution or not? This is an example.

684
01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:29,179
So you can see you can see the normal. This is I'm sorry.

685
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:32,899
This is all apple that looks awful. And we now you have better blood.

686
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:37,910
But you can see this and this. The normal quality, the blood looks pretty good, right?

687
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:41,990
So kind of like all the boys this month. They are more or less on the on the line.

688
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:50,480
Right. So and then here you see, like, yeah, it's not perfectly normal, but it's not that bad either, right?

689
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:56,210
So it's kind of like shock, right? But look at the look at this.

690
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:59,480
So all the tests are telling you are not normal. Not normal.

691
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:05,300
Not normal. Right. So this is why it kind of like I'm telling you that they are they are very, very conservative.

692
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:10,690
So then it's kind of like you have a large sample size and you have something like this, like it's okay.

693
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:15,070
It's probably okay to say, yeah, they are normal, so don't don't rely on this.

694
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:19,960
And remember, this is kind of like like they know they're in the eye of the beholder.

695
01:20:19,970 --> 01:20:24,830
Like they're all psychological where people will look at two face until they got it right.

696
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:28,809
So some people will look at that and would feel, yeah, that's perfectly normal.

697
01:20:28,810 --> 01:20:34,430
So people will look at that with similar but like skew. So sometimes it's ambiguous, right?

698
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:38,810
So I'm okay. I'm not going to kind of like generalize you.

699
01:20:38,810 --> 01:20:43,760
You tell me that this is skewed because, well, media is not normal, right?

700
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:48,420
So but you justify, okay, I'm not going to penalize you.

701
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:53,899
Just say, well, that this are not normal but actually looks pretty normal, so I'm going to go see it and that's fine.

702
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:57,020
So I'm gonna justify your decision on fine.

703
01:20:57,140 --> 01:21:03,410
Okay. I mean. If you show me something like this and you beat me.

704
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:06,490
Oh, yeah, this is more like. No, that's okay.

705
01:21:06,730 --> 01:21:10,150
So that's that's the kind of life that really skip.

706
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:18,070
But something that is more or less in between is okay. So don't worry about kind of like don't agonize deciding if it's normal or not.

707
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:21,730
Okay. Okay. So then you have to do that first.

708
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:26,270
You have to do all those comparison centers for measures to make sure that they are normal.

709
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:30,850
And now in question, do we want to validate the audience from the few?

710
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:33,720
And we're going to use the go somewhere.

711
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:41,229
So we will, for example, check if protein from the fifth gives a good estimate of the true intake by comparing with a protein from that,

712
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:46,960
I guess we consider that. So then what we are going to do is just a correlation between the two proteins.

713
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:55,299
Okay. You could use many different statistical then the next one for the purpose of the hunger, we're going to use correlation coefficient.

714
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:56,680
So you are going to use this call.

715
01:21:56,680 --> 01:22:04,419
SS So this is the in your dataset and then you're going to note that because those are based on correlation coefficients,

716
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:07,420
the variable need to be normally distributed.

717
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:14,050
And because I already take that protein, I mean, maybe you think that they are distributed in this.

718
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:18,520
Okay. But I felt no, they are not normally selected and whenever they are formation they look better.

719
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:22,629
So then I use the love transform variables to do the correlation.

720
01:22:22,630 --> 01:22:37,180
Okay, so now if you don't want to transform, you can always again use deltas for variables and here you can add the option.

721
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:43,419
Spearman And that will be the non parameter. You will still get a correlation coefficient, but that's a no parametric correlation coefficient,

722
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:48,420
that is instead they'll be based on kind of like the reality is based on rankings.

723
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:55,509
Okay. So and then the last question is kind of like just something that you had to think on your

724
01:22:55,510 --> 01:23:00,190
own how the correlation coefficient could change if you adjust my total energy intake.

725
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:10,260
We discussed that in today's lecture. I think I even discussed really no calculations necessary and you can isolate any questions.

726
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:21,190
Is it more or less clear? Okay, so now you can start and you have like a little less than 30 minutes.

727
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:26,350
Okay? Then you can work and you can also see this.

728
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:36,819
So I'm sitting with you. Listen, you can go back to the first part to you have questions and I'll I'll be here.

729
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:40,270
Okay. So then do you have any any source.

730
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:43,809
Yes. Call me and what? I'm going to do this.

731
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:46,300
I'm going to dump this.
