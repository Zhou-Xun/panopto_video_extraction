1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:12,820
Hey, good morning, everyone, and welcome back to your new favorite class was your science and health.

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:20,730
A couple of quick things that I neglected to mention on Tuesday that I wanted to cover really quickly as we get started.

3
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:29,170
Uh, one is grading. So I have the syllabus pulled up here from the canvass site grading as well.

4
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:34,030
You can read that grading is is really straight. There's no curves.

5
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,400
There's no predetermined grade distribution I'm looking for.

6
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:47,290
My goal is for you all to get A's in the class, because if you do that, then it means I've done my job well in terms of teaching.

7
00:00:47,290 --> 00:01:01,930
That said, I really tried to take on less of a focus on behalf of students for grades per say,

8
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:08,650
try to the extent possible to focus more on learning versus the grade that you get in the course.

9
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:18,610
Whether you get an A and B minus B plus B, it doesn't really matter to students in the programs that you are in and go on to be extremely successful,

10
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,900
develop wonderful careers in jobs that you enjoy doing.

11
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,580
So trying not to get caught up in whether you've got a point or a point,

12
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:34,210
they're focused more on whether you're comprehending the material and learning and benefiting from it.

13
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:39,400
And to that extent, you know, as I mentioned on Tuesday, don't hesitate to reach out to me,

14
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,470
because if something is not clear, you know, that's my fault. It's my job to teach well.

15
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,850
So please don't hesitate to call me out on that.

16
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:58,720
In terms of the kind of dividing up that overall course grade, it's pretty evenly across those different assessments, 30 percent for the exam,

17
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:07,060
30 percent for the proposal, and then 30 percent for the group debates that we'll work on toward at the end of the semester.

18
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,810
10 percent is allocated towards class participation.

19
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:18,650
And as I mentioned on Tuesday, it's not an evaluation of how correct your answers are or, you know, factual.

20
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:25,190
The statements that you make, it's just you're engaged, learning in the class.

21
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,000
It's simply what the participation is.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,910
And then related to that and why I think it's actually important to have it as an incentive to get you all to participate is,

23
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:43,780
you know, as I mentioned before, hopefully you're going to learn something from me during the course of the class.

24
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:50,680
But importantly, you're going to learn from one another. You all you're all in different programs.

25
00:02:50,680 --> 00:03:00,690
There are students in this class in environmental health policy and promotion, occupational and environmental ideology, nursing program.

26
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:06,100
You really kind of come from all over. And then, you know, prior to your arrival here at Michigan,

27
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:15,730
you bring unique experiences and backgrounds academically, professionally through your life experiences.

28
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:21,580
And so, I mean, honestly, I will learn from you, which is really cool for the selfish on my part.

29
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:27,460
But I'm trying to generate and facilitate as much of that crosstalk between you all,

30
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,410
because in addition to learning for me, you're really going to learn from one another. All right.

31
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:39,130
All of that said, any questions? Just as a follow up from Tuesday, we kind of like we're rushed with time.

32
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,720
I didn't quite get to the last couple of slides and we kind of broke without an opportunity for any kind of wrap up.

33
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:52,860
Do you folks have questions at all? OK, can I have your permission?

34
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,250
I really don't know how to handle this seating chart thing,

35
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:04,860
so what I'm proposing is I'm going to use my personal phone and just take like a snapshot over here, a snapshot over here.

36
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,710
I won't do anything with those images of the Leedham as soon as I'm done with them, but I will kind of sketch out,

37
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:18,180
I don't know, maybe in PowerPoint or something, some very rudimentary location of each of you and then maybe post it.

38
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,170
And have you confirmed that I actually have it, accurate or not?

39
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:27,180
Because I have the challenge of I barely know most of you and we're all wearing masks.

40
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,690
And so I'm going to do my best to figure out who's who.

41
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,350
Does that sound OK? And if you have a better idea, please let me know.

42
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:41,430
This is the best that I've come up with to try to manage this. So anyway, any objections to the to the quick vote out here?

43
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:51,590
OK, I'll do this really quick. You don't have to worry about smiling, right? We're on this side of the room.

44
00:04:51,590 --> 00:05:03,990
Got it. And one of Mr. And we need to update it as the course goes, we'll do so and again, that the whole purpose of that is for contact tracing,

45
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,680
it becomes something of importance are necessary during the course.

46
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:18,460
All right. Let's go ahead and move into some of the prepared slides for today.

47
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:24,940
So on Tuesday, we kind of started with environmental health and an introduction to environmental health as the

48
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:32,920
context of exposure to science today will actually launch into exposure to science itself.

49
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:39,510
And importantly, we'll talk about what define some of the important terminology related to exposure science.

50
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:45,640
We'll get back. We'll start talking more about that exposure science model that we briefly touched on on Tuesday.

51
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:53,630
And we're going to be referencing that model frequently throughout the course.

52
00:05:53,630 --> 00:06:04,280
So exposure science is predominantly observational, so you might think of it being in the field, whether it's in someone's home,

53
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:12,140
someone's community, someone's workplace, in a contrast, at least within environmental health sciences and easy.

54
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:24,230
Contrast this with toxicology, which tends to be almost predominantly in a laboratory setting in terms of assessing the toxicity of different agents.

55
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:35,450
So, you know, the goal is to to learn and obtain knowledge through exposure, science, using real data that's obtained through observations,

56
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:44,350
measurements, et cetera, so that we can get to a point where we no longer need to keep making those measurements in the field.

57
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:52,580
They're their time and resource intensive. They're invasive to people so that we start understanding and characterizing relationships

58
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,510
of what typically happens within a given microenvironment based on a person,

59
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:03,500
their job, where they live, what what their vulnerabilities are.

60
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:12,200
We can actually create a model to better understand this and to apply it to to broader populations.

61
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,430
And then again,

62
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:24,590
the goal here is to come up with a paradigm or a framework that allows us to to more effectively identify and then implement environmental health,

63
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:35,780
public health policy options for for prevention and reduction of those exposures.

64
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:43,220
So historically, exposure sciences has addressed a discreet exposure, right?

65
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:50,810
So I'm going to use air quality as my go to example for most things, because this is the world that I live in.

66
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:57,230
But, you know, back in the day, it was, wow, we're concerned about air pollution.

67
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:09,950
And so we go and measure air pollution a on some people and we determine, OK, this is the impact of pollutant, a on some health outcome.

68
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:21,020
And this is this is kind of the historical approach to exposure science and what it's evolved into over the last, I don't know,

69
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:27,470
decade or so is a much more of an integrated approach which acknowledges that, yes,

70
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:34,970
you may be exposed to air pollutants a and that might be affecting health outcome being.

71
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:43,280
But in reality, you're also exposed to so many other things that could potentially be impacting health outcomes.

72
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:50,180
Right. It is kind of across the gamut of those example stressors that we looked at on Tuesday.

73
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,320
Right.

74
00:08:51,320 --> 00:09:01,130
Not just the chemicals in the air pollution, biological stressors, physical stressors, psychosocial stressors, what you eat for breakfast that day.

75
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:12,710
Right. You know what your your your emotional or psychological stress level on that day, what impacted you at home before you left?

76
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:20,720
What impacted you in the workplace during the day? All of these things kind of potential impact on health outcomes.

77
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:33,380
And so this is really the framework that exposure science is going to be moved into and studying things from source to dose, integrating across time,

78
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:47,160
across space and biologic scale, as I mentioned, to multiple stressors, acknowledging that this is the reality of our lives.

79
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:56,220
And then back to this really simplified model that we'll focus on over the course of the semester, so and there's a lot of interplay here.

80
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:05,520
So, you know, we have sources of stressors. They end up in these different microenvironments that we may or may not encounter.

81
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,830
And they exist in certain concentrations or intensity.

82
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:17,310
And then we may be exposed. We might come into contact with these stressors.

83
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:30,060
If we do, then we're interested in actually quantifying what dose we've received of that stressor, and it might impact a certain health outcome.

84
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,530
Our time, activity and our behavior has a huge impact right.

85
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:46,010
On this this exposure, this stressor may exist, but if we don't come into contact with it, our risk of exposure is almost nothing.

86
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:56,790
And as we learn through this exposure science approach, the relationship from sources to outcomes and everything in between,

87
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:02,280
it can inform and impact and modify our activity, our behavior.

88
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,770
This is where you come into intervention in mitigation comes in.

89
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:20,970
As well as intervention and mitigation from a policy or regulatory perspective of the sources of those stressors in the first place.

90
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,290
So let's start with a few definitions. One is hazard.

91
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:32,220
So what's a hazard? This one pretty easy. We we, for the most part, covered this on Tuesday.

92
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:42,510
Hazards within exposure, science we define to be chemical, biological or physical agents capable of causing an adverse biological response.

93
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:51,150
And we hit very well on those examples of each on Tuesday.

94
00:11:51,150 --> 00:12:01,260
In terms of a source. Right, so this is from that exposure science model, sources of these hazardous or toxic agents,

95
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:08,280
they're defined by a couple of different classifications and they can be defined in different ways.

96
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:15,780
So one classification is a point source.

97
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:23,990
Does anybody have an idea what be an example of point source of a stressor like?

98
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:29,080
Dr. Yes, sir.

99
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,950
Absolutely.

100
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:38,590
So one of the images here, down here on the bottom, this power plant right there, the smokestacks, and there are some emissions coming out.

101
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:54,610
This would be a point source as a single location, a single point that is emitting these potential toxic agents were hazards into the air.

102
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:59,560
Let's see. What about an area source? What do you think that might be?

103
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:19,170
What are some examples of what we might consider an area source? Yeah.

104
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:24,600
Sure. So, so excellent example, in contrast to a point source, right,

105
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:32,100
where we might have like a single smokestack or pipe release of a pollutant or contaminate an area source

106
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:40,290
generally is a there's not a single point that you can point to where that hazard or toxic agent is coming from,

107
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:48,600
but it's instead spread out over a much larger area. What about some of these, you know, don't think too hard on them?

108
00:13:48,600 --> 00:14:01,980
What about a stationary source? What's an example of a stationary source? Is it kind of operational definitions?

109
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:08,370
Yeah, yeah, right, so we can actually point back to this PowerPoint, right? Most of them are not moving any time soon.

110
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:19,280
And so this would be an example of a stationary source. In contrast to that would be examples of mobile sources of hazards.

111
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:25,360
Sure, motor vehicles, cars, trucks, busses west.

112
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:32,070
Cigar smoke from wildfires. Smoke from wildfires.

113
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:42,840
That's a tough one. That would definitely be an area source versus the point source.

114
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:54,790
That's a great example. So the fire spreads and moves, right?

115
00:14:54,790 --> 00:15:03,190
So the source of the contaminants coming from it are coming, that it's evolving, right.

116
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,640
Their location is evolving in that way.

117
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:12,610
That's a great example. Like smoke can travel long distances, but maybe that's for sure.

118
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:19,450
This is part of the transport of it. And that would be, you know, kind of irrelevant or applicable to most emissions,

119
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:23,650
whether they're mobile or stationary or point or areas that once they're emitted,

120
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:28,520
then, yes, we have wind direction that can carry them long distances.

121
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:38,670
Yeah, that's a that's a really that's to talk to some folks about that and see how we characterize a wildfire.

122
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:43,680
You know, in terms of a classification of stationary versus mobile,

123
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:51,940
because the location of the source of the smoke actually evolves over the course of the fire at times.

124
00:15:51,940 --> 00:16:03,600
Absolutely. Absolutely. And then what about anthropogenic sources would be examples of anthropogenic sources?

125
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:12,660
And he joins us from. So things that we do like build power plants to burn coal and generate electricity.

126
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:18,190
So that would be an example. Again, this is a very convenient image to have on the slide of an anthropogenic source.

127
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:28,120
So. Right. So those that are generated from from human activity, what would be examples of non anthropogenic sources?

128
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,220
On radar. Something that naturally exists right on.

129
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:41,150
We'll talk about Rita in quite a bit later in the class, but it's naturally geologically deposited in here.

130
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:48,700
Have any power? Sure. So how is methane emissions and the others?

131
00:16:48,700 --> 00:17:00,900
There's actually lots. This ain't right, so a lot of ultraviolet radiation and other sources of radiation from the sun.

132
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,380
Absolutely. All right. Nice job.

133
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:13,340
Thank you for that. OK, so here the slide is filling in some examples, most of which we've we've hit on.

134
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:19,460
Volcanoes. OK, so defining exposure.

135
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:31,910
So exposure is actually an event that takes place when a person comes into the comes into contact directly with that hazard or toxic agent.

136
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:39,620
It's a dynamic process and it varies from person to person, depending on a number of variables.

137
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,690
Our behavior, our location, our lifestyle.

138
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:51,260
And it also varies from one toxic substance to another.

139
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:59,750
And then, you know, just as a distinction, for those of you that are in the Sexo two class,

140
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:05,720
which I know is a subset of you and not all of you, and if you're not in that class, you know, no worries.

141
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:11,990
But it's a it's an easy contrast. Is that with toxicology?

142
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:18,410
You know, again, this occurs almost exclusively in a laboratory setting.

143
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:27,440
And we've conducted course, you know, teaches the course. And we actually have this exposure course in the toxicology course,

144
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,570
pretty well coordinated so that we're hitting on similar topics as the semester goes along.

145
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:43,460
And this course will absolutely address exposure, but stopped short of really going into the domain of toxicology.

146
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:51,740
And likewise, in the six hours to class, the focus is really on toxicology as kind of assuming that some exposure and the means and

147
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:59,380
mechanisms of which how it got to that point just kind of took place that it's in for.

148
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:16,520
Yes. So so it may be a potential hazard, but not yet identified as a toxic agent.

149
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:26,830
That's basically what you're trying to decide. What? Sure, sure, sure.

150
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:31,810
Yeah, you would still characterize it.

151
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:41,860
It would have basically unknown, maybe hypothesized, uh, chemicals of concern that would be contained within the plastic.

152
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:51,680
Right. But, yeah, you would you could still consider that an exposure with a level of risk associated with it.

153
00:19:51,680 --> 00:20:10,080
It's highly uncertain. So exposures can be simple in this this slide, the example is more like a single medical X-ray, right?

154
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:18,310
It's a kind of a one time very short, very well defined event that takes place during that X-ray.

155
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,580
You know,

156
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:33,670
someone's exposed to a very well known and quantified amount of radiation exposures can also be really complex and not easily definable or quantified.

157
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,240
Again, I'm going to go back to my air pollution example,

158
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:43,840
but let's say we live in an urban area and we're exposed to air pollution over the course of a year.

159
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,160
That exposure is highly variable. Over the course of a year.

160
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:58,000
It changes from day to day based on our activity, based on emissions sources, based on wind detection relative to where we are.

161
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:09,550
And it's also not just great. It's not just air pollution, a it's a whole plethora of pollutants contained within the air.

162
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:16,050
So it can be really complex and a mixture of agents of concern.

163
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:27,270
I'll new exposure's occur, right, so we talked about sources of pollutants for the anthropogenic types,

164
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:31,530
many of them are are manufactured through a process.

165
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:37,080
Right. So some of those examples of potential exposures are occupational.

166
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:45,360
Right. If someone works at a location that's manufacturing, where we're emissions or exposure to stressors could take place,

167
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:53,730
emissions to the air, wastewater effluent, all related to manufacturing.

168
00:21:53,730 --> 00:22:04,140
Then once an agent is manufactured and anthropogenic agent, it's stored someplace or it's often transported.

169
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,740
So during the storage and transportation, there are opportunities for leaks, spills.

170
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:19,350
These are generally by accident. This can impact soil, water, air quality and biota.

171
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:27,120
And then the use of some of the whatever it was that was manufactured is now being used or applied in that process.

172
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,670
There's yet another opportunity for exposure to take place.

173
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:39,480
So some examples might be application of pesticides, right to crops or farm fields, consumption.

174
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:45,810
So ingestion of those pesticides as residues on food and some food.

175
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:54,540
It's, you know, things that are purposely added to food, dermal, exposure to cosmetics, inhalation of gasoline vapors.

176
00:22:54,540 --> 00:23:03,450
So if someone is ridiculing their car at a gas station, you know, there's some exposure that takes place there and then, you know, in in disposal.

177
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:09,330
So whatever it was, it was manufactured, stored, transported, used, applied.

178
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:15,510
Eventually it's life cycle ends and it's disposed of somehow.

179
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:21,300
And oftentimes this creates opportunities for for additional exposure.

180
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:26,190
One would be just in waste that we generate.

181
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:32,910
Sometimes this goes to landfills. There are opportunities for exposures related to landfills.

182
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:42,720
Sometimes it gets incinerated. So it goes to a facility and then burned in mass out of smokestacks.

183
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:51,820
The skin impact surface runoff leach into groundwater, many different aspects.

184
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:58,120
All right, so what is your exposure assessment? Any questions?

185
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:07,340
Yes. What would be an example of an exposure that would be safe and have a.

186
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,610
So I'm going to turn that around. Good question.

187
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:24,230
What would be an example of a disposal method that would be safe and not for risk or for contamination or exposure?

188
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:28,620
They have never been seen all the time.

189
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:47,640
And I know. That you are coming back right now and whether or not you're going to pay them, but all of you knew they were paying more and you still.

190
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,020
Those are both really good examples, and the first one that you mentioned was going to be my best answer is,

191
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:56,880
you know, something that you can biodegrade safely and easily.

192
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:06,650
Any others we have to carry? Some more that someone else like a little bit more pretty close.

193
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:12,420
And obviously, that can be dangerous to cross doing that.

194
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:19,090
The. Excellent.

195
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:26,460
Does that address your question? OK, good, thanks. All right, so exposure assessment.

196
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:39,300
So what does this mean? So it's the process of measuring or estimating if we can't directly measure what exposure actually is to people,

197
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,580
animals and maybe related materials or ecosystems.

198
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:49,200
And there's four key components to exposure assessment.

199
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,030
One is in magnitude. So how much of the agent is there?

200
00:25:54,030 --> 00:26:01,740
One is the frequency. So how often does contact occur with that agent duration?

201
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:08,550
How long does the contact lasts? And then routes of exposure are really critical.

202
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:13,110
So how does the agent actually enter our body?

203
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:24,330
And so then exposure ends up being a function of the magnitude, the frequency and the duration.

204
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:29,610
So in terms of magnitude, right, to this, how much of the agent is there?

205
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:37,770
We're typically measuring this as a total amount of examples here on the slide picocuries of radiation,

206
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:45,270
kg of a chemical, it might be levels so like decibels of noise.

207
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,610
And then very often it's measured in concentration.

208
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:57,450
So a unit of agent mass or volume per unit of the media that that agent existing like air or water.

209
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:11,490
So some examples of a concentration might be for air micrograms per cubic meter of a pollutant in air, micrograms per liter of water for liquid,

210
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:23,310
micrograms per gram for contaminant in soil or food, micrograms per liter as we might measure a contaminant in blood as a biomarker.

211
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:28,770
And then also you'll find the terms used as parts per million are parts per billion.

212
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:34,350
And this is simply just basically a one microgram per gram.

213
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,560
Instead of saying micrograms per gram,

214
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:49,630
that scientific community will often just a KPM or PDV as parts per million or parts per billion within the media.

215
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:54,220
Another key aspect is that exposure science model is dose, right?

216
00:27:54,220 --> 00:28:03,220
So what is dose defined? So it's measuring or estimating how much of the agent actually gets into our bodies.

217
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:09,160
Right. So there's an exposure. We had the example on Tuesday of CO2 in the room.

218
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:18,680
There's absolutely CO2 in the classroom right now. But just because it's in the room doesn't necessarily mean that we're receiving a dose.

219
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:24,640
Right. So exposure can take place. There might not be a dose.

220
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:33,280
There are different types of doses. We'll talk about this in a minute. Exposure can lead to a dose.

221
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:39,310
But I mean, this might sound intuitive, but a dose can occur without being exposed.

222
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:48,310
Right. So in that case, the magnitude or the concentration doesn't necessarily mean that exposure took place.

223
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,310
And it doesn't necessarily mean that the doses received.

224
00:28:51,310 --> 00:29:02,730
These are all very differently defined terms and characterizations in the exposure assessment process.

225
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:04,540
And then again, back to our model, right,

226
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:16,590
so the magnitude is fits into this sphere of the environmental intensity or the concentration of an agent, we have exposure actually taking place.

227
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:23,250
And the key aspect here is whether we come into contact with the contaminant.

228
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:36,630
And then from that point, we are characterizing the dose or how much of the agent you were actually supposed to or how much was taken up in our body.

229
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:47,430
Contact, boundry. So this refers to the outer boundary of our bodies, so our skin, our eyes are our nose,

230
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:57,180
our mouth and the boundaries that the agent must cross in order to be absorbed into our body.

231
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:12,260
Right. And actually result in an internal dose. So more specifically, our skin, our eyes, our lungs and our gastrointestinal tract.

232
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:18,680
Some examples here walking through with regards to sources of further Tiffiny,

233
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:24,500
some sources you talked about, physical agents, biological agents, chemical agents.

234
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:30,080
Again, we've done a really nice job of coming up with some examples of those, though.

235
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:38,600
The origin of the agent can either be natural or non anthropogenic or it can be synthetic related to human

236
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:47,210
activities or anthropogenic in nature in the setting for the exposure to an agent within exposure science,

237
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:52,430
there's a very clear distinction between whether it's taking place in a

238
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:58,100
community or residential setting versus taking place in an occupational setting.

239
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:04,340
And much of this has to do with the regulatory framework, which we will talk quite a bit about in a week or two.

240
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:13,790
Yeah, I don't know much about a lot of what we're talking about or this would be more of the.

241
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:20,600
Yeah, that would be more of an internal dose. And we're actually going to define really quickly here the roots of exposure and what they are.

242
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,340
But excellent question. But yeah, once once it's actually internal to the body,

243
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:34,370
then their various target organs and so forth that we where the dose is actually received that we can quantify.

244
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:42,560
Really good question here in the U.S. that there's a whole lot of people who

245
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:49,950
have been held up by the country's constitution to decide what matters like.

246
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:57,440
Very well. Yeah, so it's it's interesting because the you know,

247
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:06,700
the community has defined things and actually going back a couple of decades, they didn't even know you were alive.

248
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:13,600
There was like the occupational health world that that basically only dealt with what people are exposed to in the workplace

249
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:22,720
with a complete blind eye to like the rest of their lives and where they encountered hazards or agents of toxicity.

250
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:30,610
And then on the on the flip side, people that studied and characterized community exposures right around air quality,

251
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:39,520
water quality and so forth without really paying attention to what was someone's occupation and what were they exposed to in the workplace.

252
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:49,810
The good news is that in recent years, those those areas of characterization have have merged and come together and integrated.

253
00:32:49,810 --> 00:33:00,850
But the regulatory framework that was defined in this country over 50 years ago and a rough timeline similar in Europe,

254
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:07,130
was kind of what built that structure in the first place. But the good news is that now they are integrated.

255
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:15,790
Yes. In in low income countries where maybe this is less defined, you know, you your workplace, maybe your home.

256
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:26,560
Right. Or, you know, various examples. But, yeah, you would still look to even if there's not a regulatory framework there,

257
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:35,790
what to quantify it and classify it, whether it's occupational or not.

258
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:44,950
Any other questions? OK.

259
00:33:44,950 --> 00:34:04,710
All right, so I have questions for you. So what are some reasons that an individual's exposure to a particular hazard might vary over time?

260
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:11,280
Yeah, it's. Sure.

261
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:17,580
So time in how long per day they work at their job,

262
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:24,940
but also time in the sense of how long did they were they employed or have that job in the case of months or years?

263
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:34,780
A good example. And the others severely injured soldiers, Mr.

264
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:48,450
Higher. Sure. So you're your level of activity or your respiratory rate, right, could impact how much you're exposed over the course of a day.

265
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:55,920
A good example is. Two very different systems developing.

266
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:05,020
I'm going to go all the way down. So so let's think about that one.

267
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:19,660
So the answer was eight, right? And with changes, a kind of vulnerability based on the new strength of immunity over life course.

268
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:25,870
And the exposure might not necessarily change based on the potential impact

269
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:30,670
from the exposure could absolutely change based on someone's immune status.

270
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:38,830
It could be impacted by their age. I would definitely agree with you if you said age related to lifestyle.

271
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:46,180
Right, because children and their activities and behaviors are very different than, say, elderly people.

272
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:51,070
And that would absolutely impact exposures. Kids spend, for example, more time at the playground.

273
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,270
Right.

274
00:35:52,270 --> 00:36:04,150
If they're climbing on playgrounds, built with pressure, treated lumber that has arsenic in it, which elderly people for the most part, are not doing.

275
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:13,410
Yeah, but the the exposure itself wouldn't necessarily change based on immune status.

276
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:23,190
Any other examples of the accident of. Certainly know that you for.

277
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:30,040
Let's put that. Sure, sure.

278
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:43,210
So the relative dose related from that are leading from that exposure to pesticides is absolutely of season,

279
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:49,830
is in many geographic locations, a huge, huge impact.

280
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:56,500
What if itself is another factor that affects.

281
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:07,510
Excellent. Yeah, so the source might actually be changing, even if our our behaviors are activities or otherwise are the same or constant,

282
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:12,130
what gets emitted might change diagonally from day to night.

283
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:23,130
Traffic is a really good one. It's kind of like a morning rush hour and evening rush hour emissions related to that kind of behavior.

284
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:34,890
For example, the Golden Gate Bridge closure, and they want to push it to these soldiers in the morning for sure.

285
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:38,670
So, uh, so where you go over time right now?

286
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:42,930
Actually, I think leads to my next question. And it does.

287
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:49,170
Let me let me step you these examples here real quick. So what we end up with are our patterns of exposure.

288
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:59,130
Right? They might be relatively continuous. However, for reasons that we just discussed, they can be quite intermittent or even random.

289
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:06,960
They could be cyclical, like the factory that operates during the day and then is shut down at night.

290
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,550
They can be random. There can be they can be highly concentrated.

291
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:18,240
So a huge amount of exposure to then very slowly drops off.

292
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,190
Some examples sticking on this on this temporal scale.

293
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:27,300
So how exposure might change over time is related to land.

294
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:37,860
And this is looking at a long time period. But land used to be added to gasoline on purpose, improved engine performance.

295
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,490
Fortunately, we learned that this was not good for environmental health.

296
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:51,180
It was basically purposely distributing land throughout our communities and leading to high exposures.

297
00:38:51,180 --> 00:39:00,780
But basically just going to get back to age. If you're looking at a retrospective exposure assessment over the course of someone's lifetime,

298
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:06,960
someone who was alive in the 1970s through no fault of their own was exposed to high

299
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:14,280
concentrations of lead because of lead being emitted with the combustion of gasoline.

300
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:24,510
All right. So getting back to to Josh's last comment, what are some reasons an individual exposure might vary over space?

301
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:31,540
Yes, it's from. Here is the highest.

302
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:37,670
And so it's. Absolutely.

303
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:46,610
Really good point. And a couple of things, one is the location of the wildfire, but then also, as we mentioned earlier, just impacts from wind, right?

304
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:50,660
The wind doesn't blow in the same direction. It changes from day to day or even hour to hour.

305
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:56,800
So this could absolutely impact exposure over space.

306
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:07,380
Any other examples? So it's you know, we're going to bring.

307
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:23,390
Person to you might be. Absolutely, yep, so your proximity to a source where you are versus where someone else's.

308
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:28,900
Sort of moving around.

309
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:36,700
Absolutely, yeah, so that's a great example, right? That was an entirely valuable exercise in the experiment.

310
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:42,190
Our exposure was tremendously reduced because we stopped moving over space.

311
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,690
Right. Our mobility was hugely reduced. All right.

312
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:50,470
Excellent. Yeah. So some easy ones.

313
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:56,500
We kind of already hit on this. We talked more in the context of wildfires.

314
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,810
So this is a particular example in Southern California, high air pollution in general.

315
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:07,510
But if you kind of zoom in on that, it's not high everywhere, even over a metropolitan area.

316
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:16,030
So depending on where someone lives versus where they work, where they commute or they're traveling,

317
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:23,410
their exposure can change because the pollutant concentration has a very big spatial gradient.

318
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:27,220
But there's also the overlay of time and space.

319
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:39,190
Right. So the time of day for a person related to the exposure over space or the concentration over space.

320
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:43,120
This is a busy slide, apologies in advance,

321
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:51,520
but these are things we're going to hit on over the course of this semester and something will the state will start to distinguish in this lecture,

322
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:58,930
will distinguish further next week, on Tuesday. But there are exposure pathways.

323
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:05,920
So basically how an agent is is emitted from a source and the pathway or the media that

324
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:13,940
it may be transported within before it can actually come into contact with a person.

325
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:23,680
And then there are routes of exposure which kind of gets back to when it opens earlier comments whether we might be exposed through the breathing,

326
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:30,730
through inhalation, through ingestion of food or water.

327
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:36,820
We might come into contact on our skin.

328
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:47,370
So right, so those those exposure routes, so how agents could get into our body and we're going to talk to in more detail about this on Tuesday.

329
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:51,880
But the relatively simple, but they're extremely important.

330
00:42:51,880 --> 00:43:01,600
So ingestion, right. So through food, water, in most cases, this is purposeful, like we eat or drink on purpose.

331
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:09,940
But in the case of children right on the ground, crawling dust in a household, contaminants, you know,

332
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:17,500
outdoors where they're putting hand to mouth and ingesting contaminants, you know, without purpose inhalation.

333
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:23,380
This this is a huge one. This is actually the biggest driver in workplace settings for exposure.

334
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:29,020
So. So what's in the air and what are we breathing in?

335
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:36,610
And then direct contact with our skin. And this can have two distinct routes.

336
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:42,580
One is simply contact where the agent is is on the outer layer of our skin.

337
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:49,330
That itself can lead to to adverse outcomes and then skin absorption.

338
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:56,920
So actually, having the agent go through our skin, get into our bloodstream, be distributed throughout your body,

339
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:03,670
can have a different set of of health outcomes or lead to a different set of health outcomes.

340
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:08,110
There are and we've already, you know, through some of these examples started to talk about some of these,

341
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:16,210
which is great, but there are different susceptibility factors related to exposed populations.

342
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:20,260
It might be related to to age or late stage.

343
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:25,010
We had a great example of that earlier. It might be culture or lifestyle.

344
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:37,240
What's the norm in terms of behavioral practices, our activities, our personal activities that we do purposefully or our occupation?

345
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:43,210
Right. That we're kind of asked or demanded to do as part of a workplace setting.

346
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:50,950
We talked about geographic distribution. It might be where, like Joshua said, we're we're sitting in the classroom or where we live in the world.

347
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:59,860
Right. Socioeconomic status. This is this is a huge one, very well characterized in the literature.

348
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:07,930
Those are all related to kind of exposure and activity. And then there are ones that are more biological susceptibility factors.

349
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:14,740
So, again, age or lifestyle, and this one is more related to not so much activities,

350
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:19,850
but was mentioned earlier with a susceptibility in terms of like immune status.

351
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,980
It was a great example. Gender.

352
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:32,500
There are definitely differences that are characterized between men and women in terms of susceptibility, genetic differences,

353
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,620
our health status in general,

354
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:45,040
if we have preexisting conditions and then previous exposures may actually make us respectable to later following exposures.

355
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:52,870
This graphic down here on the bottom illustrates some some important and interesting

356
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:59,110
differences that while socioeconomic status know for the most part in the literature,

357
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:05,950
we associate, you know, lower socioeconomic status being associated with the increased exposure.

358
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:16,420
And this is absolutely the case across many variables down here on the slide, cadmium and lead are two that are pointed out,

359
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:22,810
and they're just two of many where lower income is associated with higher exposures.

360
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:28,960
But there are actually some and increasingly over time where people of higher

361
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:34,240
socioeconomic status are exposed to higher levels of particular compounds.

362
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:40,990
So over here on the left, you can hardly see it. We certainly minor in yellow there is mercury.

363
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:45,940
So, you know, seafood, fresh fish is expensive.

364
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:51,340
And so generally people with higher socioeconomic status can afford to buy fresh fish.

365
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:56,020
It's also oftentimes, depending on the fish, a big source of mercury contaminants.

366
00:46:56,020 --> 00:47:01,300
So you often will see higher exposures of mercury, of arsenic.

367
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:08,070
We talked about some of the purported substances.

368
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:17,010
All right, so getting back to dose and this is this partially addresses, hopefully orange question from a few minutes ago.

369
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:21,210
So some more concepts in terms specific to dose.

370
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:31,660
So we have a potential dose if we have an agent on our skin or surface.

371
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:39,140
We have absolutely an applied dose if that agent is absorbed through the skin.

372
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:44,690
Once it's within our bloodstream, it can be distributed.

373
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:51,260
I believe Warren was talking about the blood brain barrier, right, or placental barrier is right.

374
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:56,270
So there can be a delivered dose to a specific target organ.

375
00:47:56,270 --> 00:48:02,480
And at that point, we can actually characterize a biologically effective dose.

376
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:11,840
And again, this is where we kind of like leap off into the field of toxicology, where knowing what the potential toxicity is of a particular agent,

377
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:17,750
what the dose is that's received to a target organ or target cells,

378
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:29,360
we can we can characterize that biologically effective dose and what it's very likely to lead to in terms of health outcomes.

379
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:35,810
Another schematic with a little bit of different information, but still kind of focusing on.

380
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:38,890
This is a potential dose to the body, right?

381
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:48,080
So the amount of a chemical ingested or inhaled or what kind comes into contact with our skin that apply dose.

382
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:53,780
Right. If the amount of that chemical is absorbed, whether it's through the skin, through our lungs,

383
00:48:53,780 --> 00:49:00,200
to our gastrointestinal tract that absorbed dose and the amount of chemical available

384
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:07,850
for interaction with those target organs and then the delivered dose rate,

385
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:12,440
the amount is transported and actually ends up in that organ,

386
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:19,610
that tissue or fluid of interest, where we can then characterize the biologically effective.

387
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:30,260
And this is what allows us to, with the most accuracy, predict what what adverse impacts are likely to come.

388
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:41,960
So with regard to exposure and dose rate and integrated exposure is the sum total of exposure to an agent, all routes of exposure.

389
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:46,010
Right. And all media over a specified amount of time.

390
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:55,880
So you might think of this as kind of a total area under the curve of an exposure profile in the units of

391
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:08,270
that integrated exposure over time are expressed by multiplying the concentration by the period of time.

392
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:15,590
So the dose rate ends up being the total dose divided by the time period of the dosing.

393
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:23,690
And it's usually expressed in units of of mass per time or mass per time, normalized to a body.

394
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:29,960
So something like milligrams per kg per day and will actually go through.

395
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:35,020
A couple of examples here to help clarify that.

396
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:47,170
So in terms of exposure and dose rate calculations, so we're we're making these measurements of magnitude, right?

397
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:58,540
Over time, the concentration varies and we're able to calculate a time weighted average concentration over that time period.

398
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:10,720
So it's the amount of exposure per time period. Some example units might be milligrams of an agent per cubic meter of air.

399
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:17,980
So then our dose rate would be the total dose divided by the time period of dosing.

400
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:21,940
And then we bring into some information our own body weight.

401
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:33,300
At that point, we can calculate the dose rate in milligrams per kilogram per time or typically per day.

402
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:42,270
So classifying exposure's based on duration, duration, of course, is the period of time over which a person is exposed,

403
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:48,450
an acute exposure to some terms little here and a lot of the literature and readings.

404
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:56,430
Acute exposure generally involves one contact with the chemical, usually for a pretty short defined time period.

405
00:51:56,430 --> 00:52:06,090
Something less than a day, might be an hour, might be a work shift or a community environment, something that's within the course of a day.

406
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:17,730
There are also chronic exposures that generally take place over a substantial portion of time, maybe even a significant portion of one's lifetime.

407
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:25,800
And then there's the the very vague term of a some chronic exposure, which basically means anything between acute.

408
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:35,730
So more than a day, but generally not, you know, a significant part of someone's lifetime, some chronic might be weeks to months.

409
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:46,220
Typically, there's a time frame, but it's pretty vague and kind of a vague middle ground.

410
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:51,590
So the timing of exposure assessment in relation to exposure,

411
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:59,650
so I mentioned an example a few minutes ago of a retrospective or historical exposure assessment.

412
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:07,640
Right. This is something that we do. The example here on the slide is is estimating someone's cancer risk.

413
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:18,170
So in order to estimate someone's cancer risk, we might try to reconstruct their lifetime exposure to something like ionizing radiation,

414
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:23,000
whether it's where where they worked, what their occupation was,

415
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,130
what their typical personal behaviors and lifestyle is,

416
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:37,790
and and identify how much ionizing radiation they've been exposed to over their lifetime in order to estimate the potential cancer risk.

417
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:45,350
There are current exposure assessment or present day where we're actually able

418
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:56,900
to to monitor one's exposure through through instrumentation or other means.

419
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:10,040
And this is good for for getting reliable information, so it might be an opportunity in a workplace to quantify one's one's exposure.

420
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:14,870
It might be in order to assess regulatory compliance.

421
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:24,680
Right. So we have workplace exposure rules. So someone might be monitored just as a routine to make sure significant exposures aren't taking place.

422
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:30,980
But this is something can be done in the present and then there are prospective exposure assessments.

423
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:34,670
So these are kind of what if scenarios on the slide here.

424
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:40,790
It's a, you know, community setting where they're proposing to to build a waste incinerator.

425
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:46,370
And so, you know, a question to inform whether that gets built or not is what would be the possible

426
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:53,990
exposures to the community that might live in close proximity to this waste incinerator.

427
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:58,880
So in that case, you know, we don't have any historical information.

428
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:10,160
It's not been built yet, although maybe there are other similar waste incinerators that we may be able to infer, pull some data to inform the process.

429
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:15,800
That is typically the prospective exposure assessments are typically relying on models and

430
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:23,900
inputs and the accuracy of those inputs related to the source related to the emissions dictate,

431
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:32,780
you know, how how valuable or predictive that exposure assessment or accurate exposure assessment is.

432
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:51,050
Yes. First 100 days exposure assessment to interpret those words was one of the soldiers says.

433
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:58,790
So, so great question. So kind of like so what's the point basically of assessing exposure and what are you hoping to do with it?

434
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:02,720
And I think it varies. So and you gave some great examples.

435
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:11,120
So within and I think you asked us the question in the context of research, but it doesn't necessarily have to be researched.

436
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:15,710
But, you know, one is for for building these models.

437
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:26,150
Right, to to have better models, we might go out and just measure the magnitude and intensity,

438
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:32,510
measure concentrations over time and space without even worrying about where people are.

439
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:43,130
Right, in a workplace, in a community, in a school or whatever it might be, so that we can improve the accuracy of that input to those models,

440
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:49,580
that then actually does try to predict what impact it would have on someone's health.

441
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:58,220
It could be a cohort study of, you know, adults with cardiovascular disease or hypertension or something.

442
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:01,880
Right. And in that case, yes, we're actually trying to quantify, you know,

443
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:09,650
what's the dose to an individual study subject and how is that impacted by what their exposure was?

444
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:22,640
So there were there would be, you know, potentially many possible purposes of exposure assessment kind of across that exposure model.

445
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:33,150
Great question and the others especially given the context, but is there often between the symbols are like this one,

446
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:37,580
are you trying to get more people to be ready, for that matter?

447
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:47,510
Depends on who you ask. What they're what they want to study is the gold standard, what you see.

448
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:52,580
Fantastic question, and fortunately,

449
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:57,500
I think there's a slide coming up that's going to directly address that and kind

450
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:05,300
of give us a hierarchy of what our preferred exposure assessment approaches are.

451
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:11,750
Excellent question. Before we get to that, actually starting to address that.

452
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:24,200
So how how can we assess exposures to people and really what's looked at as the gold standard are our direct methods of exposure assessment.

453
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:34,940
This is often through personal monitoring. So I'm like where, you know, a badge or some type of monitor on my body.

454
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:40,700
If we're concerned about a contaminant in the air, the inlet of that monitor would be near my breathing zone.

455
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:48,950
Right. So as to best approximate what I'm actually inhaling, it could be achieved through biological monitoring.

456
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:55,550
So if we have what's called a biomarker, maybe a metabolite in our blood,

457
00:58:55,550 --> 00:59:00,950
it's a really good indicator of how much we've been exposed to a particular contaminant.

458
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:07,670
These these would be kind of the gold standard or preferred direct methods of exposure assessment.

459
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:16,460
But they're not the only ones. And a lot of cases, for many reasons, they're their time and resource intensive.

460
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,050
They're costly.

461
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:27,320
They're generally invasive to individual people, somebody who has to wear that monitor or has to have blood drawn in order to get that information.

462
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:37,190
So in those cases, we have indirect methods. So instead of monitoring me in my breathing zone,

463
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:44,750
we might estimate my exposure or all of our exposures by having the stationary environmental monitor,

464
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:52,880
you know, kind of in the center of the classroom that approximates all of our exposures, even though we're not wearing it personally.

465
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:57,680
It might be through questionnaires or diaries that you asked and went to keep.

466
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:05,220
So where did you go to school or where did you work before you came before you came to Michigan?

467
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:09,530
Right. Based on the information, what what type of job did you have?

468
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:18,230
We would begin to put together an exposure profile. What types of things were potentially exposed to where you used to live, where you used to work?

469
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:24,380
And, you know, both of these can inform exposure models.

470
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:34,910
Again, even if we do have the ability to monitor biologically or personally monitor people.

471
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:42,260
The goal is not to do that forever. The goal is to inform and characterize those types of exposures so that they can

472
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:51,420
then be used to construct a really accurate and predictive exposure and more.

473
01:00:51,420 --> 01:01:01,110
All right, busy slide, we took our very simplified exposure science model and added a lot more graphics to it,

474
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:05,310
but it's really just to kind of illustrate how and where some of those measurements

475
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:12,780
kind of fit in to the exposure science model so we can have remote sensing,

476
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:19,650
taking advantage of GISS systems, participatory assessment.

477
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:28,920
Right. People's time activity and their behaviors that help us to estimate and learn what they're exposed to.

478
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:32,790
You know, different nano sensors, bio monitoring.

479
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:38,890
We mentioned different biomarkers that can help us quantify dose.

480
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:45,970
And then this slide even more explicitly addresses your question, Josh, so you know, what's our preferred?

481
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:52,600
What's the hierarchy of exposure assessment data? And really the best is starting here at the top.

482
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:56,540
So a quantified personal measurement, right?

483
01:01:56,540 --> 01:02:07,450
Whether that's a biomarker sample, an external personal monitor attached to one's body would be the most accurate and most

484
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:12,740
preferred and kind of what we consider the gold standard for exposure assessment purposes next.

485
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:17,440
Beyond that would be something we would call area monitoring.

486
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:22,840
And again, that would be the example that we have a single monitor in the center of the classroom and that

487
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:29,680
serves as a as a surrogate measure of exposure for all of us during our time in the classroom.

488
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:35,980
And then, you know, going down the list is kind of decreasing preference.

489
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:47,830
So if we can't have personal measurements and if we can't even measure quantify within an area or the vicinity of where we are, there's other things.

490
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:57,610
So there might be quantified surrogates of exposure just based on estimates of a food intake or drinking water intake.

491
01:02:57,610 --> 01:03:02,710
Right. Kind of going back to the last place we said, hey, a typical person, you know,

492
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:08,570
consumes two liters of liquid a day, eats this many grams of food per day.

493
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:12,850
If we ask a person to keep a diary or just do a questionnaire,

494
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:22,540
we can estimate what their exposure might be based on that distance from a site and the duration of an exposure.

495
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:29,830
So we knew that you were entering 1755 from eight thirty to ten.

496
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:34,250
After that, you walked across campus. That took you 15 minutes.

497
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:39,550
Then you were in your apartment, your roommate was cooking, you know, bacon and eggs.

498
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:45,400
I don't know what it was kind of a smoke filled kitchen for 45 minutes or so.

499
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,100
You know, based on this type of information,

500
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:56,950
you you can begin to estimate some exposures and might be as simple as something as distance or duration of residence.

501
01:03:56,950 --> 01:04:02,440
Right. So kind of like with that example of air pollution in Southern California.

502
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:07,120
I lived in Los Angeles for 10 years. Then I moved somewhere else.

503
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:16,900
Right. So just based on where you were for how much time you might be able to put some estimates of exposure,

504
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:25,300
residents are unemployment right in the geographical area within a reasonable proximity to the site where exposure can be assumed.

505
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:34,330
So based on where you worked, not just what you were exposed to at work, but maybe your commute to and from, we can infer some things.

506
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:42,820
And then, you know, again, this is kind of going down the list. We get to like the really the worst type of data for estimating actual exposure.

507
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:47,770
But it might just be like, hey, you lived in Washtenaw County for two years.

508
01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:59,580
That's all we know about the person that based on that, we might be able to come up with some kind of rudimentary estimate of exposure.

509
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:05,580
So how do we describe Exposure's? There's a lot of different descriptors.

510
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:14,920
Here are a few, but we're typically evaluating and relying on on a mean exposure.

511
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:26,010
What's most typical or representative of a population?

512
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:35,640
Aside from that, though, while we're most usually interested in kind of an average exposure to most people,

513
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:41,910
we might be interested in other components of an exposure in the case of a peak exposure.

514
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:47,400
All right. So if we know that there's a threshold effect for particular agent for contamination, right.

515
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,700
We might really not care about what the average exposure.

516
01:05:50,700 --> 01:06:01,850
We just want to know what's the highest exposure to know whether that whether that threshold was broken or not.

517
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:12,620
OK, this is kind of an introductory slide, we're going to have a couple of lectures coming up and maybe two weeks around exposure limits.

518
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:19,790
So regulatory standards that are in place, there are many within the workplace.

519
01:06:19,790 --> 01:06:24,380
So occupational standards. There's something called a threshold limit value.

520
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:31,280
Tell you something called a permissible exposure limit or recommended exposure limit.

521
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:36,380
These are specific to workplace environments. And then there are community standards.

522
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:45,590
So standards for the quality of air we breathe, contaminant levels in water that we drink,

523
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:51,440
acceptable levels of contaminants in food through through various.

524
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,160
These are US government agencies globally.

525
01:06:55,160 --> 01:07:06,410
The World Health Organization actually puts out guidelines in all of these media for acceptable exposure limits.

526
01:07:06,410 --> 01:07:10,400
All right. I'm going on and on and on.

527
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:14,480
We've got a few minutes left in the class. Let's do a really quick break out.

528
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:23,820
I'm going to ask you to turn again, kind of like we did on Tuesday, maybe to no more than three, just based on your proximity where you're sitting.

529
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:30,860
Turn to the people or person next to you and answer these two questions.

530
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:41,030
So on a poor air quality day, the airborne PM 2.5, these are particles less than two and a half microns in diameter.

531
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:45,930
The levels are 50 micrograms per cubic meter.

532
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:56,970
If people in jail just assume one cubic meter of air for our right to our lungs over a day, it's over 24 hours.

533
01:07:56,970 --> 01:08:01,890
Question number one is what's the concentration of your 2.5 in question?

534
01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:28,790
Number two is what would be the calm 2.5 dose? So go ahead and take two minutes with the person next to you and will report back.

535
01:08:28,790 --> 01:09:53,490
Yeah. Whichever ones you want to use.

536
01:09:53,490 --> 01:10:33,960
Do you like one more minute?

537
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:50,990
All right, let's go ahead and see what folks came up with for question number one, what's the concentration of the PM 2.5?

538
01:10:50,990 --> 01:11:02,270
50 micrograms per cubic meter, correct? So, yeah, a little bit of a trick question, but yes, this is great mass per per volume of media.

539
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:08,390
So in the case of an airplane, my 2.5 it's micrograms per cubic meter is,

540
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:13,850
in fact the concentration president or the environmental intensity of that pollutant.

541
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:23,540
OK, the one that did require a little bit of work, what would be the 2.5 dose?

542
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:35,970
Confectioner's. So Josh says, twelve hundred micrograms.

543
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:50,660
Anybody in agreement or have a different answer on. So you're going to modify Joshes from the amendment every day or is OK?

544
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:54,950
And I think the question is, is over a day. So yeah.

545
01:11:54,950 --> 01:12:06,960
So in that time period that we're looking for is the 24 hour time period. Did anybody come up with a different answer?

546
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:16,710
OK, not to belabor it, but yes, so I actually heard Josh saying this out loud, exposure's the magnitude times the frequency times the duration.

547
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:23,220
Right. So how much of the contaminant, how often and then for how long?

548
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:30,210
And yes, you're absolutely right, 50 micrograms per cubic meter times,

549
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:40,020
one cubic meter inhaled over the course of 24 hours gives us twelve hundred micrograms for that day of juice.

550
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:46,050
All right. I'm going to try to move through a couple of slides because I want to make sure we get to the assignment for next week.

551
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:49,560
I'm actually going to skip this one. But it's another example. We did it.

552
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:56,250
We just did one for air. This is looking at drinking water for lead.

553
01:12:56,250 --> 01:13:03,330
And it really we rely on different sources for some of this information.

554
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:10,740
We know some things. We need to know how much of water is ingested, what the chemical concentrations might be in the water,

555
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:15,360
what the chemical liability bioavailability might be in the GI tract.

556
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:22,770
And the good news is there is an EPA exposure factors handbook that has a lot of data

557
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:28,680
on a lot of these variables that allow us to to calculate or estimate what exposure,

558
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:41,160
what a dose might be for contamination of drinking water by lead in this factors handbook has examples of drinking water consumption rates,

559
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:48,090
breast milk consumption rates, food consumption rates, breathing rates, all in relation to body weights.

560
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:54,180
There's a lot of information that can help us guide our estimates of exposure.

561
01:13:54,180 --> 01:14:04,830
This is what some of that data might be, what look like this is actually a page or a table from the EPA Exposure Factors Handbook.

562
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:16,160
Going to go over this very quickly. Uh, we don't have time to address this, but we would kind of step through if we had time, some different examples.

563
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:22,350
And maybe just think about this. We've talked about being in an urban area exposed to air pollution.

564
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:30,450
How might this change if you're trying to estimate radon at home, asbestos or shipyard workers and so forth?

565
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:39,630
I wanted to cover this. So for the next class, we're going to have maybe the first part of the class allocated to some to some lecturing.

566
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:45,810
And then we're going to break out and do an exercise titled Exposure Science in the News.

567
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:52,200
So in advance of next Tuesday, find a recent article in the popular press.

568
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:57,840
You don't need to, you know, go through the latest journal publications.

569
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:02,160
This might be, you know, wherever wherever you get your news, wherever you look for information.

570
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:08,520
I know some of you keep track of blogs or news feeds or podcasts, which actually thank you again, Wolf.

571
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:17,880
I haven't had a chance to to check that out, but I want to share that with the class, try to so it's not completely random to the extent possible.

572
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:24,600
Maybe pick something that's from where you grew up, your hometown, state, country, whatever, whatever you want to use.

573
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:30,270
But just to kind of hone in geographically and then, you know, kind of read it,

574
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:34,290
understand it, think about it and come prepared to talk for five minutes,

575
01:15:34,290 --> 01:15:39,480
give a five minute summary within the group that cheering after we do that will kind of break out.

576
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:46,780
I'll ask you to, I don't know, maybe pick what was the most interesting article or topic from your from your group discussion?

577
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:55,980
They come prepared to summarize or quantify or discuss, you know, what was the agent, what was the source of that agent?

578
01:15:55,980 --> 01:16:00,510
Who is the relevant population of concern for exposure?

579
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:09,810
Think about what those pathways and routes of exposure might be and to the extent possible, with the relevant health effects I have.

580
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:14,040
I just pulled this example yesterday.

581
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:17,700
You're not allowed to use it. Sorry. What's that all about? Did you.

582
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:22,530
Okay, so I have already claimed it. No one's allowed to use this. This is mine.

583
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:36,060
But yeah, this was an I don't have time to go through it. But a report out yesterday that billions of people are being impacted over time,

584
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:43,260
millions per year, and there are years of life being lost simply from exposure to air pollution.

585
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:51,630
Geographically, the highest was in India, where the estimate is that there are six years of life lost on average per person globally.

586
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:55,690
I think it was a little over two years.

587
01:16:55,690 --> 01:17:06,730
I'm going to finish with some resources here that we discussed over the course of this lecture, some really great sites around approaches,

588
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:13,030
and I was able to leave about a minute and a half left for any questions that folks might have,

589
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:22,230
either on the material discussed today or for the assignment coming up on Tuesday or anything else.

590
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:30,480
What is the reason? Good question. Yeah, so it doesn't have to be like today or something, that's a space between now and Tuesday,

591
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:37,230
especially if you're going to confine yourself to like your hometown or some geographic, let's say, within the last year.

592
01:17:37,230 --> 01:17:42,950
You know, maybe it's more interesting the more recent that it is, but.

593
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:52,080
Again and again, this is like this is part of the participatory component, you know, there's no great being assigned to, like how we're using our.

594
01:17:52,080 --> 01:18:02,140
Any other questions? Now, is a blood test typically the best thing like.

595
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:10,590
It's absolutely part of that what we can consider gold standards of preference, of hierarchy, of exposure data.

596
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:19,130
The downside is that blood tests are only useful for for certain hazards or agents.

597
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:27,600
There's like metabolites of opportunity that exist for some, but for many, it's not really a viable approach.

598
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:36,940
Great question. And the others.

599
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:42,370
All right, thank you so much for your attention and reach out to me as you come up with any questions between now and Tuesday.

600
01:18:42,370 --> 01:18:53,420
Otherwise, have a great holiday weekend.
