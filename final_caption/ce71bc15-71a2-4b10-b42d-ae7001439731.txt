00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,027
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:11,027 --> 00:00:15,951
Until now, we've learnt a few ways of manipulating aggregating data in Excel.

3
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:19,803
In this video, we will get into some additional features in Microsoft Excel

4
00:00:19,803 --> 00:00:23,740
that you can exploit for doing data analysis and manipulation.

5
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,940
The big thing that we'll be learning in this video will be Pivot Tables.

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:33,392
Now Pivot Tables are a powerful tool to calculate, summarise and analyse data,

7
00:00:33,392 --> 00:00:37,740
that lets you see comparisons patterns and trends in your data.

8
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:43,265
So until now to calculate say the average of the count of variable values in

9
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:46,970
by subgroups a region or say the sex of the respondent.

10
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,705
We did a bunch of manual copy pasting to whip the data into the desired formats,

11
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:55,458
Pivot Tables automate or relatively automate that process.

12
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:59,998
A few things to know, that your data should be organised in a tabular

13
00:00:59,998 --> 00:01:03,115
format and not have any blank rows or columns.

14
00:01:03,115 --> 00:01:07,026
Ideally you could use what's an Excel table that we have learnt about in

15
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:08,062
an earlier video.

16
00:01:08,062 --> 00:01:12,118
The tables are a great Pivot Table data source because rose added to a table

17
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:16,192
are automatically included in the pivot table when you refresh the data.

18
00:01:16,192 --> 00:01:20,368
And any new columns also added would be included in the pivot data fields less

19
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:22,040
once you refresh it.

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,770
Otherwise you need to either change the source data for the pivot table or

21
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,861
use a dynamically named range formula.

22
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,298
Another thing to note would be that data types in the columns that you're using for

23
00:01:32,298 --> 00:01:33,930
your source tables should be the same.

24
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,540
For example, you should not mix the dates and the text in the same column.

25
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,369
One thing to note is that pivot tables work on a snapshot of your data,

26
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:43,940
which is called the cash.

27
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,156
So your actual leader does not get altered or affected in any way or

28
00:01:47,156 --> 00:01:49,155
whatever you do with your pivot tables.

29
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:53,948
For today's demonstrations, we will be continuing to use the expenditures

30
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:58,961
data set that we have worked with before, as a reminder that has data from a sample

31
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:03,998
of households from regions in the United States along with some basic features.

32
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:08,808
Like household size, region, income income rank and also the household expenditures

33
00:02:08,808 --> 00:02:13,366
by each category like food, housing, health care, transportation and others.

34
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:18,672
With that, let's move on to our Excel sheet.

35
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:19,883
So this is a tried and

36
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:24,459
tested expenditures data set that we have worked on multiple times before.

37
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:26,451
So welcome back.

38
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:30,156
So the first thing that we do with this one, we want to create this is the source

39
00:02:30,156 --> 00:02:32,690
for the pivot table that we're designing, right?

40
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:37,840
So the source is gonna be an Excel table which what we learnt in an earlier video.

41
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,162
So to make it an Excel video, to make it an Excel table,

42
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:43,370
there are two ways of doing that.

43
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:48,507
One would be to just do an insert.

44
00:02:48,507 --> 00:02:52,311
So, yeah, one would be to do an insert.

45
00:02:52,311 --> 00:02:54,302
You come to insert here and then do a table, right?

46
00:02:54,302 --> 00:02:59,422
And that could be the one we are doing it or the other thing would be to do

47
00:02:59,422 --> 00:03:04,840
a command T or control T based on if you use Windows or Mac as your system.

48
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,340
So I do a command and ctrl t.

49
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,963
Command or ctrl t.

50
00:03:08,963 --> 00:03:10,670
I'm gonna do that.

51
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,340
This is the table that I get, right?

52
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,460
And this is gonna be the source table for my pivot table.

53
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,040
Let's call this a stable source now, okay?

54
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,660
So now, how do we insert up to the table?

55
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,540
So we go to insert and here you have this option of inserting updated table.

56
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,707
And I click on that.

57
00:03:30,707 --> 00:03:34,647
It again shows me the table that I want to be the source could be a table source.

58
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,773
I could also use an external source and so on.

59
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:38,404
But I don't wanna do that right now.

60
00:03:38,404 --> 00:03:42,951
And I wanna place specify a value of a, well, I replaced the pivot table.

61
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:45,940
I wanted to be a new worksheet is not on the existing worksheet.

62
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,140
So do a cat.

63
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,811
And this is the Canvas.

64
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:52,056
So to say right off the pivot table that we're designing.

65
00:03:52,056 --> 00:03:56,519
So here are the sort of to build a report which is the output or

66
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,927
could be the output of a pivot table, right?

67
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:02,487
You could choose the fields from the pivot table fields,

68
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:05,917
which essentially are the fields from your original Source Table, right?

69
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:07,750
These are things that we've seen before.

70
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,011
So now you have these four sections.

71
00:04:11,011 --> 00:04:13,522
So to say, right, which you could play around with and

72
00:04:13,522 --> 00:04:16,154
drag your fields between these areas and see what we get.

73
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:21,450
So let's take region and drag region to what our roles and see what happens,

74
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:27,016
when I do that, I essentially get all the unique regions in my dataset, right?

75
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:31,285
Including the NA which is households for which there is no region or

76
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:32,745
region missing here.

77
00:04:32,745 --> 00:04:37,130
Remember when we had done that in an earlier video, we did that in the manual,

78
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,983
copy all the entire region collar, move that to a different sheet.

79
00:04:40,983 --> 00:04:42,989
Remove the duplicates,

80
00:04:42,989 --> 00:04:48,540
this one does that in a wave of finer matter if that's the word.

81
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,700
So you get all the individual or unique roles.

82
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,820
The regions that exist in the data, right?

83
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,671
And now let's see for the region.

84
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:59,080
I wanna calculate the number of households.

85
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,540
So I see something called values here.

86
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,840
So what I could do is, I want to counter for the household guides, right?

87
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,961
Second Move Household two values here.

88
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,723
When I drag it there, I get something which I'm gonna zoom in so

89
00:05:12,723 --> 00:05:14,740
that you can see it better.

90
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,931
I get to some of the household idea because household ID is a number and

91
00:05:18,931 --> 00:05:22,915
by default, Excel assumes that you want a some of those numbers.

92
00:05:22,915 --> 00:05:25,977
But we know the ideas themselves carry no meaning right there.

93
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:27,660
Just unique identifiers.

94
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,340
So how do we edit that to make it account?

95
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,374
We come here and do a right click and go to field settings.

96
00:05:34,374 --> 00:05:38,942
Now in field settings, some is the default but I wanna count.

97
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:42,498
So I can select count here and I do, okay, when I do, okay,

98
00:05:42,498 --> 00:05:45,075
this seems to be more reasonable, right?

99
00:05:45,075 --> 00:05:47,891
You have a grand total which is the total number of households.

100
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:49,122
All the rows added up.

101
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:53,191
And you have the households belonging to each of the regions here.

102
00:05:53,191 --> 00:05:56,481
So we're no longer doing any of the countess and all those functions.

103
00:05:56,481 --> 00:06:00,340
And Excel does that automatically for us here, right?

104
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,309
You could also use filters, right?

105
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:09,309
If I wanted to sort of just have the region and remove the any value.

106
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:15,640
So I could remove that from here and display.

107
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,396
And that sort of gives me the grand total gets updated, right,

108
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:20,440
to just throw the non any households.

109
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,738
What if I did not want to see absolute numbers but

110
00:06:22,738 --> 00:06:24,480
something that's more relative.

111
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,850
What if I wanted, let's say,

112
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,460
the proportion of households across each of the regions.

113
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,735
How do we do that?

114
00:06:29,735 --> 00:06:33,376
That we can do by coming here.

115
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:34,699
Clicking on right click again.

116
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:39,812
Field settings, and in this one I do show data as.

117
00:06:39,812 --> 00:06:40,784
Now in show data as,

118
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:44,860
the default is no calculation that's what gives you the raw counts or raw numbers.

119
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,002
But I grew something like percentage of column total,

120
00:06:49,002 --> 00:06:52,161
when I do that, let's see what happens.

121
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,443
So this essentially gives me the percentage of households in each of

122
00:06:57,443 --> 00:07:00,475
the regions across these four regions, right?

123
00:07:00,475 --> 00:07:05,349
So 23% of the households belong to the ISH% Midwest, 18.5 of the households

124
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:08,861
in the Dataset belong to the northeast and so on and so forth.

125
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:12,910
We see the vast majority of the households in the data comes from the south.

126
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,490
That's one way of representing your data and we don't have to do any of

127
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,473
the mathematical calculations to arrive at this number.

128
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:22,921
We also have other sections that you have here which are missing, right?

129
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:26,740
Which before we go to that, let's also figure something else out.

130
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,473
When you go look in this one, right, let's click on field settings again.

131
00:07:30,473 --> 00:07:33,471
In the few settings, there's something called by the way.

132
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:36,498
There are other things you can also do, you can find them average max,

133
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:37,676
mean and so on and so forth,

134
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:40,740
right, what if I want, let's click on number and see what's there.

135
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,730
So this is how you represent the value that's displayed here, right?

136
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:50,160
I could display it as percentage but a certain number of decimals as I want.

137
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,740
I could display it as a number, just over a proportion of it, right?

138
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,934
I could display it as a fraction.

139
00:07:57,934 --> 00:08:00,031
So there are multiple ways you can do it with that.

140
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:02,690
Let's just stick to percentage, for now we're doing decimal places.

141
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,140
Okay, now let's come back to columns here.

142
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,062
So how do I, what do I do with columns?

143
00:08:10,062 --> 00:08:12,600
Now regions is one split of the data.

144
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,580
I can think of other split from the data as well, right?

145
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,540
Let's see what if I want to split the data by home type and region and

146
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,717
figure out what's the distribution of home types across the region,

147
00:08:23,717 --> 00:08:26,380
across the various regions in our data set?

148
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,744
How do we do that?

149
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:31,185
So let's bring our home type now to,

150
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:35,961
when you take it by default, it goes to our values.

151
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:39,147
So I'm gonna remove it from there, remove the feed from hell.

152
00:08:39,147 --> 00:08:46,306
So I'm gonna get home type here, am gonna [INAUDIBLE] and to that does.

153
00:08:46,306 --> 00:08:50,255
First of all you should notice is, it add them to the rules and

154
00:08:50,255 --> 00:08:53,430
within the big role, which is the midwest ride,

155
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,940
you have the distribution of each of the various home types, right?

156
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,840
And you get a repetition like this?

157
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,640
It can be useful in some settings, but it's not a very good visual comparison.

158
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,361
So what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna move my region two columns.

159
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,540
And this is what I get, now what do I have?

160
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,727
This shows me, the three plex is right.

161
00:09:15,727 --> 00:09:21,490
In the Midwest 2% of the households are three places while in the West 2.6,

162
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:27,270
2% of the households are three plexes or plexes and so on and so forth, right?

163
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,659
So this scandal help you figure out, okay, what's the dominant or

164
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:37,054
the majority sort of household type or the home type in each of the various regions?

165
00:09:37,054 --> 00:09:40,833
So clearly Northeast has an outsized proportion of apartments and

166
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,999
flats compared to the other regions?

167
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:47,557
The Midwest has a higher proportion of single family detached households compared

168
00:09:47,557 --> 00:09:48,810
to the other regions.

169
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,640
The south is close to the Midwest in that regard.

170
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,973
So these are metrics that sort of pop out when you sort of now look at two

171
00:09:55,973 --> 00:09:58,161
variables put together, right?

172
00:09:58,161 --> 00:10:00,152
I could also use filters here and

173
00:10:00,152 --> 00:10:04,369
filters can help little mind which hope that I want to be displayed.

174
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:07,634
Let's see if I just wanna get three plex, four plex,

175
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:10,401
I mean, this is not the most useful one here.

176
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,840
So let's remove the filters from here and get back home type here.

177
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:19,061
But yes, I'm just gonna remove the photos from this one and get everybody in.

178
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,092
Okay, so to the design team, we can ignore the filtering part about the home type,

179
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:28,540
thank you.

180
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,081
So we can now see the comparison between the various prototypes

181
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:37,240
across the regions and see the distribution there.

182
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,061
That's one way of sort of depicting this.

183
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,040
Now, let's see.

184
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,271
And to answer other questions.

185
00:10:44,271 --> 00:10:46,472
So one question that you could think about is,

186
00:10:46,472 --> 00:10:48,798
what is the distribution once you have learnt?

187
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:51,893
So now that you've sort of gotten some basic idea of pivot tables and

188
00:10:51,893 --> 00:10:54,731
now there are so many other features you can play around with.

189
00:10:54,731 --> 00:10:58,633
This was just barely increasing the surface of the potential of paper

190
00:10:58,633 --> 00:11:00,040
tables, right?

191
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,757
So let's see if I want to answer the question,

192
00:11:01,757 --> 00:11:04,140
what is the distribution of households by region?

193
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,403
And how does the distribution of households by region compared to

194
00:11:07,403 --> 00:11:09,420
the distributions of rich households or

195
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,830
those households which have an income rank above 95% by region?

196
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,761
How do we do that?

197
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:20,114
So let's come to our source again and

198
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:25,504
I'm gonna call this [COUGH] I'm gonna call

199
00:11:25,504 --> 00:11:32,340
this Pivot Table, home type region, okay?

200
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,540
Long name but that's fine.

201
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,341
And I'm also gonna create a copy of this sheet.

202
00:11:37,341 --> 00:11:40,261
The whole source sheet, so that they can use it in others.

203
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,040
We call it moved to end.

204
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,851
Okay, this is the one that you think [INAUDIBLE] the right?.

205
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,451
It's called a stable source.

206
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,800
And now, I wanna get the distribution of the rich households violation, right?

207
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,889
So now, first of all remember it depends on the income rank rich

208
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:06,240
households are those households which have an income rank of about 0.95.

209
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,240
So we need to define a new variable and call that the rich variable, right?

210
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,637
And as exploitable, takes it once, as soon as you add that column,

211
00:12:14,637 --> 00:12:17,153
the entire formatting big takes over from there.

212
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:20,224
So now the value and rich variable, right?

213
00:12:20,224 --> 00:12:23,168
Depends upon the value and the income rank variable.

214
00:12:23,168 --> 00:12:25,185
The income rank variable ranges from 0 to 1.

215
00:12:25,185 --> 00:12:27,210
You have a bunch of any values.

216
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,140
So we gotta keep that into account.

217
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,573
So essentially households which have income rank about .95 are going to be

218
00:12:33,573 --> 00:12:37,550
called rich below 0.95 we're gonna be called non rich, right?

219
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,040
And for any values, we're gonna throw them out.

220
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,180
So how do we do that?

221
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,108
So we start with the f function is equal to f, right?

222
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:47,376
The logical test that we have first of all is,

223
00:12:47,376 --> 00:12:52,536
if this is not equal to any, okay, I wanna first at least do a validation

224
00:12:52,536 --> 00:12:56,931
cheque to ensure that what I'm looking at is not in any value.

225
00:12:56,931 --> 00:12:59,038
Otherwise my entire field is gonna get messed up.

226
00:12:59,038 --> 00:13:03,690
If it is not any, then this can happen again.

227
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:09,088
So I again have an f function and asked this in f function whether this or

228
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,340
not any value is above 0.95.

229
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,710
If It is about 0.95, I'll call this rich.

230
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:20,440
If it is not above 0.95, I'm gonna call this not rich, okay?

231
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,726
And then I close my parenthesis to ensure the job is done.

232
00:13:24,726 --> 00:13:27,100
And this is what you get, right?

233
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,202
So clearly just do a quick cheques here, 0.25, 0.93,

234
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:36,460
0.65 but 0.87, right, so on and so forth.

235
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,813
Do any values got falls?

236
00:13:38,813 --> 00:13:41,557
You do have some rich person here.

237
00:13:41,557 --> 00:13:45,053
The rich household here which has 0.9816 and

238
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:49,050
they have that corresponding value in the rich variable.

239
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,760
Okay, so we've done this.

240
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,151
Now let's create a new Pivot Table.

241
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,710
Now let's create a new Pivot Table.

242
00:13:54,710 --> 00:14:00,717
So I'll do an insert, Pivot Table and I'm gonna call it Table Source 3.

243
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:02,646
It's actually called a Table Source 2 because that's the name of

244
00:14:02,646 --> 00:14:03,237
the table, right?

245
00:14:03,237 --> 00:14:05,751
That's not true.

246
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:08,567
So I call it and in the table the Table Source 2.

247
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:11,440
And now I'm gonna insert a pivot table.

248
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,440
So a new worksheet again, take the same table arranged.

249
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,223
I do it, okay.

250
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:21,081
So now that you see is, I have a new paper table field to choose from, right?

251
00:14:21,081 --> 00:14:22,340
This is called rich.

252
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,258
So clearly, I want the region and the distribution of the rich households and

253
00:14:26,258 --> 00:14:28,440
the gentle households, right?

254
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,361
So I'll take my region to my rows.

255
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,888
I'll take my rich to the columns.

256
00:14:35,888 --> 00:14:40,911
Okay, and the values that I want are the household IDs, right?

257
00:14:40,911 --> 00:14:42,761
So I think the household IDs to the values.

258
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,289
So I took my region to the rows, I took my rich variable to the college and

259
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:50,933
the household I did to the values by default.

260
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:53,842
It gives me some, I wanted [INAUDIBLE] count.

261
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:54,940
So I do that.

262
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,640
And I want to show the data as the proportion, right, person is the of total.

263
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,440
And do that, okay?

264
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,061
I have that, I do have a bunch of zoom it, so that you can see it better.

265
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,340
So what do we have here?

266
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,416
We have the Northridge households, we have the rich households,

267
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:18,040
we have the households which have missing income rank information.

268
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,430
And we have the total of all the households, Right Bridge and North Bridge.

269
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,370
So let's do some cleaning here.

270
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:28,801
Let's filter out any values second of the [INAUDIBLE] from head itself, right?

271
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:33,721
So this gets readjusted because the denominator now is the sum total of this

272
00:15:33,721 --> 00:15:36,311
column and you have the distribution.

273
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:40,603
So the one that you wanna compare based on the original question, right,

274
00:15:40,603 --> 00:15:44,240
is the rich versus the overall population, right?

275
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,564
Another Northridge.

276
00:15:45,564 --> 00:15:50,097
So a plot or a bar plot might have been a useful tool here.

277
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:52,405
So which we can do that in the next video.

278
00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:56,820
But here, what you can see here is some basic insights can be cleaned, right?

279
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:01,384
So for example, the northeast has 24% of its population or

280
00:16:01,384 --> 00:16:03,768
24% of the rich population.

281
00:16:03,768 --> 00:16:08,665
That's where to read it, 24% of the rich population is in the Northeast, right?

282
00:16:08,665 --> 00:16:12,046
While only 18% of the rich of the overall population is in the northeast.

283
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:16,103
So the Northeast has an outsized proportion of rich people compared

284
00:16:16,103 --> 00:16:20,456
to the rich households compared with general household distribution.

285
00:16:20,456 --> 00:16:23,500
The south, on the other hand is the reverse, right?

286
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,611
The south has around 37% of the overall household population from our data,

287
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:32,740
but only 29% of the rich population in the data, okay?

288
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,880
And you can also have similar insights of Northeast for the Midwest and for

289
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,640
the West and so on.

290
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,745
So with that we are able to sort of quantify and

291
00:16:41,745 --> 00:16:46,244
visualise at least in a tabular manner, the differences between

292
00:16:46,244 --> 00:16:50,766
the distributions across these two combinations of variables.

293
00:16:50,766 --> 00:16:54,513
So that's in this video we began learning more about pivot tables and

294
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,269
how pivot tables can be useful.

295
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:59,650
You can think about so many other things you can do with pivot tables.

296
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,840
This was just the beginning.

297
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,022
We're gonna move on to plotting using pivot tables and

298
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:08,540
the other aggregation tools that we have learnt for better visualisation.

299
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,171
Thank you.
