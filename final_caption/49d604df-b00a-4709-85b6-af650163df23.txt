1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:09,160
Oh, your. So I was born in South Korea, but I left Korea when I was four years old and my parents are missionaries.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,620
So we kind of like grew up all over, all over the place. So I left Korea when I was four.

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:23,380
I, we moved to the U.K. first and then to Singapore and then Malaysia and then Inner Mongolia of China, which is like right up the border of Mongolia.

4
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,509
And then Beijing, China by one. And then we moved back to Beijing.

5
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:34,780
And then now I now I'm in Michigan. Over the past ten years, I came to here as undergrad.

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,520
And all my family right now is currently in South Korea still.

7
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,879
So some of my baby pictures with my younger brother when he was born and then we moved

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,910
when he was two and when I was four to the UK and then to Singapore and Malaysia,

9
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:58,570
we went to a boarding school and then Malaysia, Inner Mongolia and then Beijing.

10
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:09,400
And then I graduated like high school in a small private international school in Beijing and then came to the United States,

11
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:16,450
went to undergrad and grew up as Michigan, studying nursing and civil arts, and then worked a year as a cardiac nurse.

12
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,700
I knew I kind of wanted to do research in undergrad, but I still wanted some experience understanding America's health care system,

13
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:30,970
which is not great, but, you know, on the ground experience.

14
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,440
So that was really helpful to give get some context about America.

15
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:42,549
And then I studied, yeah. At Nursing under Dr. Dougherty.

16
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:48,640
Laurie, and I don't know whether you guys had Jodie for her, her lecture on like maternity waiting homes and all that kind of stuff.

17
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,900
I graduated out of a pandemic and all that to say.

18
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:58,059
I kind of grew up all over and traveling has been kind of like part of my life.

19
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:04,960
And I thought it was always kind of interesting how the soul around what I can, I can't do it.

20
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:11,740
What I'm saying and how that is being perceived by other people constantly, depending on where I'm at.

21
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:19,330
And that is definitely, you know, there's a lot of cultural nuances of like my personality is pretty like generally a little bit outgoing.

22
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,130
I, you know, like voicing my opinions and, you know, asking questions.

23
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,670
And that is generally a good thing. In Western culture.

24
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,000
People think you're a pretty like independent thinker, critical thinker.

25
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:40,599
Whereas in countries like China and Korea, it was very much perceived as like, why are you questioning like your teachers when they're like,

26
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:47,370
you know, giving you lectures or that I got like told that I'm a, you know, like too bossy or like all that kind of stuff.

27
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:55,240
Like I'm still me. But depending on how I'm interacting with my environment, it constantly changes the norms about what I can or can't do also.

28
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:05,050
So I always thought that was really interesting. And so my general interest and my research focus is in kind of understanding how women's identities,

29
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,670
abilities and resources interact with our environment, social norms and culture.

30
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:17,230
And in the context of health, there are different types of privileges and power discrimination that women face depending on where they're at

31
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:25,149
and how all that influences our health and the ability to access different services is my general research,

32
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,310
interest and passion.

33
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:34,570
So my long term goal is to empower women of low and middle income countries as a factors of health for themselves, their family and their community,

34
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,990
but also to further improve the systems and the structures around the woman,

35
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:44,170
to prioritize woman and their health, woman's health, so that they can pursue their maximum potential.

36
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,749
And, you know, around the world, I feel like there's always in one country or the other, there's that notion of like, you know,

37
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:55,840
strong woman, strong mothers, like, you know, women are resilient and they're the backbone of the communities and their families.

38
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:02,860
But overall, I want to strive for a system and a structure and a culture where women can also have a soft life.

39
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,530
And we don't have to be always so strong and resilient all the time.

40
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:14,020
And so I want to spend the next 5 minutes, if you can, turn to the person next to you, kind of like talk about and like process a little bit.

41
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:21,760
You know why you chose public health and epidemiology, why you're taking this course for that five minute if you feel comfortable enough,

42
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,909
I would like to hear a little bit more and my two to partners and here that's

43
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,160
starting over zoom would also like to get to know about you guys a little bit.

44
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:40,990
5 minutes. Go get started.

45
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:56,500
Why is it so important that we go on with our lives?

46
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:19,220
I don't know medically what that was like working with Grace or something like that.

47
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,980
Gordon There was something. I mean, I'm blessed. Rachael Benson, can you hear us?

48
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:38,980
I can hear you. I can hear you. That was disappointment and a little bit.

49
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:45,400
I think they can hear a lot of bulk.

50
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:53,460
I don't I hear. But I think see we.

51
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,680
I am also hearing about it's breaking. Breaking kind of.

52
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:06,720
Are we breaking stories? Yeah. I'm hearing, you know, at the beginning, the voice was very clear about trade.

53
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:13,770
Okay. Welcome. Make it a little bit to talk directly to the microphone.

54
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:20,210
My name. Okay? Yeah, I think so.

55
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,300
I was like, Oh [INAUDIBLE], I don't know what I've talked about it,

56
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:36,559
but then like print media and fill out like like with on and like they had to you're going to have to in the midst of it.

57
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,200
We still got to.

58
00:06:50,360 --> 00:07:42,580
I know literally the president and the U.N. Security Council, as well as members of the Senate that are running this election year.

59
00:07:42,990 --> 00:08:06,660
I just want you know, I knew this was going to happen.

60
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:26,430
That's not what I hope the White House I mean, what's going on with this stuff?

61
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,040
I don't think so.

62
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:39,760
I'll probably be honest.

63
00:08:44,580 --> 00:09:26,100
I would not have been around for that much money if the war was really just open for him.

64
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:52,170
Yeah, that's one of the issues that we're going to need to see.

65
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:57,410
More seconds. Are we good? 30 seconds?

66
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:04,290
You know, are there any volunteers that would like to share a little bit about their journey?

67
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:18,600
You guys are so active. Please. Something that I think most of us didn't agree with, Jim,

68
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:25,180
was just that a lot of this started as an interest in medical aid or pre-med when I realized we were missing

69
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:31,330
that social aspect of behavioral aspects and that so that kind of prompted us to transition to public health.

70
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:36,910
Oh, that's so interesting. So a lot of you guys actually have a lot of like medical background a little bit.

71
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:43,810
That's cool. Anyone else. Sure.

72
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:49,239
I did not have local background. I specifically went to public housing for many reasons,

73
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:58,360
but also because I knew I didn't have to do with one necessarily important things like an evolutionary biology background.

74
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:05,560
I always assumed that I wasn't interested in like mathematical modeling, all of that stuff,

75
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:15,730
and I sort of recognized through coursework both in undergrad and interestingly no and necessary to that there's this incredible need.

76
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:21,940
And I was going to become this incredible need for addressing health disparities in the

77
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:28,059
sense of climate when we know that the global distribution of infectious diseases,

78
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:34,600
for example, is going to change the climate and not just talk about climate, they're like, no end.

79
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,280
I feel like, Is all doom just going to end? But yes, that is very much of a hot topic.

80
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:47,350
And I feel like everybody, every conference that I go to, like there is always such a big emphasis on like climate crises that we're dealing with.

81
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,230
But thanks for sharing. Okay.

82
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,519
Yeah. So I did come from a very bad background.

83
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:04,450
I majored in neuroscience, so I was doing a lot of doctors and I realized, like, I didn't like the U.S. healthcare system and I can relate,

84
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:09,170
but I'm going to focus more of like, you know,

85
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:16,010
addressing addressing the symptom rather than getting into all the the all of the patients are presented with like diabetes.

86
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:19,400
Cholesterol is all the same.

87
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,090
Clearly, it's a concern of the population.

88
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,680
And so that's when I figured out that public health existed. And so that's when I was in the ship.

89
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,770
And someone told me epidemiology was like many diseases.

90
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,320
I felt like, why not take me out?

91
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:39,670
Yeah, that's yeah, that's also yeah, a lot of research just like preventative stuff and like kind of like start the pattern.

92
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,610
So to prevent, you know, I don't know whether you guys talk about the upstream and downstream work,

93
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,110
but yeah, that's why I could research to being at the bedside.

94
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,570
Anyone else? Yeah. So for me, I come from like a permanent background.

95
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,540
Like when I saw a doctor, especially you in hospital.

96
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:04,670
I've noticed like how privileged people have access to medicine to go out and and come from Brazil and being part of the LGBT community,

97
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:09,079
I developed an interest in handling the disparities within a health care system that

98
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:14,389
involves LGBT patients and lemon expansion because of the language barrier or,

99
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:18,200
you know, racism or whatever circumstances. Almost everybody talks about it.

100
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:25,010
So then I know, especially the like my end goal was to go to Mexico with my doctor, but I couldn't build a bridge between public health.

101
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:31,370
I was a bit too related topics and medicine might be more like public health, like medicine.

102
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:39,470
Doctor And just like if prescriptions all the time, we kind of try to make medicine more communitarian rather than just like a business.

103
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:46,820
That's how the program works. Way So uh huh, yeah, that is, that is a very, very unique perspective that you bring in.

104
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:52,100
I want to start like the medical process too. I mean, medical education and training, so that's awesome.

105
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,399
Okay. Last chance. Okay.

106
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:04,330
Moving on. Okay.

107
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:13,270
So the first project is called the Governance, Citizenship and Accountability Project and a very short and very brief overview of Uganda.

108
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,390
It's a landlocked country in Eastern Africa where 43 million people and the maternal mortality

109
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:26,530
rate ratio in Uganda is about 236 women that died for every 100 line births that women get.

110
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:31,719
And so to put that in a little bit of a perspective, in other average low income countries,

111
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:40,240
the average maternal mortality ratio is about 460 per 100,000, and in high income country that's 11 per 100,000.

112
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,240
And United States is pretty like odd in a sense. It has a little bit higher.

113
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:50,620
It's like 23, 24 for every hundred thousand births on average, woman give birth to 5 to 6 children during their lifetime,

114
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:55,989
and 35% of the women are giving birth by the time of their turning 88 years

115
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:02,710
old and 88% of Ugandans are considered poor by the World Bank's definition.

116
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:10,569
And so this specific project aims to improve the quality of the health care system in Uganda and Uganda.

117
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:22,120
Like many other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, they function in like six decentralized levels of referral governments, health care facilities.

118
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:29,470
And so Health Center, Truth and Health Center three, these are the most rural and they're distributed amongst the rural communities.

119
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:37,630
And in theory, they should have the resources and the health care providers to treat and diagnose basic illnesses.

120
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:44,170
So they're the ones that are giving all the vaccines, doing like basic deliveries and animal care, postnatal care and cetera and whatever.

121
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,280
That cannot be handled out.

122
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:51,010
Health Center two in health center three will be further referred to higher up to the general and regional referral hospitals.

123
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,819
And so we know that in theory that these hospital,

124
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,890
these in all parish and subcounty level health centers should be able to provide these services for the people.

125
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:04,450
But there are still a lot of inefficiencies and inequities in public health sector.

126
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:14,899
Health facilities. And one of the big contributing factor to this is this widespread accountability gaps underlie many of these,

127
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,230
I quote unquote, last mile delivery failures on the part of the government.

128
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,819
And by this like last mile, we mean the patients show up, overcome.

129
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,500
There's like so many different barriers that they have to overcome to even show up at the health facility in the first place.

130
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,600
And once they're there, the health care centers are failing to provide the services that they deserve.

131
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,600
And so some of these, you know, delivery failures, quote unquote, include like health worker absenteeism.

132
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:44,960
So the patients show up at like 9 a.m. and the clinic hours are supposed to be like nine to like five.

133
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:50,750
But the health care worker is not there for work or like no health health worker up performance.

134
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:58,130
They, you know, a lot of time they're like very the ratio is very like an equal compared, like more high income countries.

135
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,820
So there is fewer health care providers with a lot more patients to see.

136
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,709
And so it adds a lot of burden.

137
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:09,170
And sometimes they have they can be like rude and provide disrespectful care and like suboptimal care to their patients.

138
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:15,889
And there's also like diversion inventory. So like they have specific numbers of like amount of like drug or supply that

139
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,310
they're receiving from the government in a monthly basis or an annual basis.

140
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,620
But sometimes like they leak into the black market.

141
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:28,160
So the patients that actually show up in the in the health system are not able to receive what they are asking for.

142
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,200
And also a lot of these like, you know,

143
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:38,090
services that are provided as a health center to that health center three should be technically covered under universal health coverage.

144
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,969
However, some health facilities can still require informal payments, which is often not a lot,

145
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:49,550
but still can be pretty burdensome for people who are living, you know, under $2 a day.

146
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:56,180
And so why do we involve politicians? Because this specific interventions, we try to target the community members and the politicians.

147
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:03,650
So each government health center three is are headed by a democratically elected politicians, also known as chairperson or local council.

148
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:10,160
Three And these politicians saying, look, we have the authority to oversee their employee performance and service delivery.

149
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:17,420
And they also technically have the power to report negative performance to higher personnel, depending on what they find.

150
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,820
And another interesting thing about, you know,

151
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,709
health care providers that are working in health centers tools and health center three is that once they're hired in,

152
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,840
it's very, very difficult to get them fired.

153
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:33,920
So their job security doesn't rely on patient satisfaction like the way it is in a lot of these, you know, high income countries.

154
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:40,610
And so we kind of really have to rely on people who have actually like the authority to exert, like, negative consequences.

155
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,020
And these politicians often a whole lot pretty close by the health center so that

156
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,250
they're able to deal with whatever they find in a credible and cost effective way.

157
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:54,080
And unfortunately, while they do live close by, they're not the ones that are accessing the services.

158
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,239
So if you have more financial resources or have a higher social status,

159
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:09,889
you generally want to go to private health care facilities or like a more higher level, higher level of hospital.

160
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:17,720
They already have specific specialties. So these health centers are generally targeted and most dominantly utilized by people who,

161
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,580
you know, they don't have other means of health care services that they can receive.

162
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:30,140
And also the politicians. From their perspective, they are motivated to address citizens need in order for them to be elected again.

163
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:33,680
And Uganda, compared to many other subsaharan African countries,

164
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,660
they have a decently functioning democratic system, especially at the lower tier like politicians.

165
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:46,330
And so this is a pretty unique and a larger scale project that we have both University of Michigan,

166
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:55,470
like researchers like governor, government, people from Uganda, and also universities from Uganda and also local NGOs.

167
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,500
So from the University of Michigan, we have Dr. Lisa Mattioli, who's a faculty at school public health here,

168
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,230
and Josh Greenberg, who is an M.D., Ph.D. candidate who should be wrapping up this year.

169
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:10,550
And this was technically his day to take part of his dissertation study.

170
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:19,130
And him and Mr. Adorable DeBoer actually co-founded Progressive Health Partnership, which is our local NGO who does all the ground work with us.

171
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:25,760
And there's me from Skilled Nursing at Center for Global Health Equity, Timothy Lubanga from the Office of Prime Minister.

172
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:32,900
And because we are working with politicians, we want to make sure that we are doing things that are culturally appropriate and that it's you know,

173
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,520
there are both written and unwritten rules when it comes down to this type of things that we want to be

174
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:42,650
constantly communicating with the local people to make sure that we are not crossing any boundaries.

175
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,480
And you also have a Fredman Moosa from University, a Makerere University.

176
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:56,300
He's a faculty at the School of Economics. And Jordan, Mr. Jordan Matisyahu, the director of the Progressive Health Partnership.

177
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,690
And he has been incredible in all the project implementation.

178
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,040
And honestly, yeah, none of this would have happened without him.

179
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,790
And so the two main interventions that we implement,

180
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:11,320
one is a quarterly accountability meeting between the community members and the local politicians.

181
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,879
So we simply have these like large tents in a quarterly basis and we people go

182
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:21,040
around mostly people from AP with microphones and we have different advertisement,

183
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,269
making sure that coming members know that we have these meetings coming up and we have this in a

184
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:29,770
quarterly basis so the committee members can show up and the local politicians are also invited.

185
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,120
The health center three chair people are invited to come.

186
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,650
And so then this becomes a platform for community members to voice whatever inconveniences,

187
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:43,480
whatever issues that they're seeing with their current health centers,

188
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:49,299
committees and the type of, you know, issues that they're seeing they're able to bring up to the local politicians.

189
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:55,060
And the local politicians will explain, oh, this is like, you know, within the scope of my work and I will try to address it in X,

190
00:21:55,060 --> 00:22:00,250
Y and Z in the next few months and then the next accountability meeting then that the

191
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:06,280
committee members are able to monitor the politicians performance in an ongoing basis.

192
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,440
So we have that intervention going. And another component is actual politicians skills training.

193
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:19,030
So once they're elected there, they don't currently have like a very formal and in-depth training when it comes down to like how

194
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:24,700
to monitor health centers and what are the standard that we are holding these health centers at?

195
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:30,700
What are their like open hours? Like what type of medications should be available when you're just like come and visit, etc.?

196
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,750
So we provide like in-depth training and refresher courses for the politicians.

197
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:42,170
And so the overall objective of the study is to understand the causal effect of the meeting intervention itself and

198
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:47,570
the training interventions and the two intervention implemented together on a number of health related outcomes.

199
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:53,900
And broadly speaking, we have I mean, all variables are trying to capture a difference health care utilization,

200
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,690
health care quality and health outcomes.

201
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:04,880
And we are still in the process of finalizing all those outcomes from the pilot project that we are product data pilot, the data that we collected.

202
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:11,060
So the pilot project, like I mentioned, it was completed in August of this year.

203
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:14,690
It was a two by two randomized controlled trial across 20 different localities.

204
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:21,650
And the scale up project, we're hoping to begin some of the groundwork early next year and start the

205
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:27,080
implementation of the different interventions in October of next year hopefully.

206
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,960
And we'll try to scale it up to 300 localities.

207
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:41,650
And from the pilot project, we have a comprehensive, you know, list of like different type of survey tools and protocols for the fill up.

208
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,950
And these include like household survey that you're collecting at the Baseline

209
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,879
Politician survey to try to assess their like knowledge in all of these,

210
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,630
you know, things that we are like teaching them pre post and health facility audits.

211
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:57,700
Sometimes we go in without telling the health care providers that we are going to come and then we go through all of

212
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,930
the supplies that they have and the drugs to make sure like whether they match up from what they're supposed to have.

213
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:10,430
It's like actually, you know, what they have in their inventory. And we also have scheduled visits where we tell them like, oh, we are going to come.

214
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:15,530
So and then, you know, they can be a little bit more prepared and then you actually have this time to like interview

215
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:20,690
all the healthcare providers that are working there and some observational survey for,

216
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,030
you know, the accountability meetings that we have, people that march, how many people are showing up?

217
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:32,360
What's the percentage of the people who are like the community members versus like, you know, more of the elite community members,

218
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,850
how much each you know, people are talking and we have all the percentage of that calculated.

219
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:44,990
And there's lot of focus group discussion that we collected from the committee members who participate in the accountability meeting.

220
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,340
So just to go over some of the pilot outcomes for the partition of training,

221
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:56,889
we had a ten of total chairperson and nine of them actually attended with a ten sending

222
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:01,510
like a delegate and achieved at least like 80% participation rate for the entire training.

223
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,950
And they report it like that.

224
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:09,640
The knowledge and everything was quite beneficial and there was actually quite a bit of cross-community exchange of experiences

225
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:15,600
amongst the politicians because amongst themselves do they don't they lack platform to come together to kind of like share like what

226
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:21,630
are some of the lessons learned how to how is it in your locality and like how what are some of the issues in my localities and like

227
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:29,020
it becomes a platform for them to exchange knowledge and information and experience and for the accountability meeting as well.

228
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:33,550
We had strong participation and engagement by both the committee members and the local leaders.

229
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:37,880
A lot of feedback that we got from the politicians was that like, you know,

230
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:45,340
they also lack platform for them to engage the people that they're supposed to be, you know, interacting with on an ongoing basis.

231
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:52,600
And so this platform kind of also gave them the opportunity to share about all the things that have been trying to do for the community.

232
00:25:52,960 --> 00:26:03,370
And so the general community took up about like 95% of the participants, like 5% being like the community leaders and elites and women were 62%.

233
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:06,459
And the comments that were made throughout these accountability meetings were

234
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:10,720
also pretty proportionate of the people who actually showed up in the meeting.

235
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,890
So it wasn't like dominated by like a few men in the group or anything like that.

236
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:21,880
And the facilitators did a really good job, like trying to make sure all the people who wanted to voice specific things had a chance to talk about it.

237
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,350
So we just wrapped up the focus group discussion.

238
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:34,690
I've been trying to go back like multiple times and like Ryan knows all the hiccups along the way because they recently had another Ebola outbreak.

239
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,970
But anyways, we were able to do everything virtually because my partners were very capable.

240
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:48,549
And the overall aim of this specific focus group discussion was to kind of explore and understand the community members

241
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:54,790
perception of the meeting and the impact of the meetings that they were observing in their health and their lives.

242
00:26:54,970 --> 00:27:01,210
So as researchers and as people were implementing the study, we have this grand idea of what it's supposed to achieve.

243
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:08,050
But I want to understand whether the committee members is this like what they are thinking, how these meetings are being played out,

244
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:14,560
and whether there is actually that tangible thing that they are experiencing in their personal, their family and their communities life as well.

245
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,370
So we kind of like ask them like what their thoughts are on the accountability

246
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,670
meetings compared with some of the other community meetings that they participate in,

247
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:27,429
whether they're understanding of the politicians role and what they can and can't do have changed or like

248
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:32,379
they've learned new things about them and some of the motivation for them to attend these meetings.

249
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,450
How many of the meetings have they attended?

250
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:41,740
Is it like a one time thing or do they actually show up on an ongoing basis to see whether the politicians did what they

251
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:47,260
promised to do and also some of the impact on their health and health care system and their communities life as well.

252
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:57,170
So these are some of the pictures that my club Reuters took on the grounds that we separated focus group between like men and women.

253
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:03,200
Because sometimes if it's a mixed gender group like one gender tend to dominate the

254
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,690
conversation and specific things might not be brought up if it's a mixed gender group.

255
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:17,600
So we kind of did, too. One male, one female focus group discussion from each of these six random, randomly selected localities.

256
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:26,510
And we are currently in the process of transcribing all of it because it's in the local language around people they don't understand much.

257
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:31,160
And so we have our local partners transcribing it, and then they will also translate it.

258
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:39,290
And I plan to do some data analysis in February and March and work on the manuscript and results segmentation and,

259
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:43,010
you know, April, May maybe going into the summer, if anybody's interested.

260
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:47,110
And being a secondary view of the data, qualitative data, please let me know.

261
00:28:48,710 --> 00:29:00,440
There will be a paper out of this. So you know. Yeah, but no funding because I'm like so poor for the for the white woman.

262
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:08,930
Yeah, but it's not going to be in the summer and I don't know how long I'm going to go into the postdoc stuff and I might wrap up earlier,

263
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:12,950
but that's a good point. I don't know, maybe there may or may not be funding.

264
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:18,500
So but for the scale of project, we're talking to a lot of, you know,

265
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:25,219
NGOs and foundations and public organizations because it's a very specific type of interventions.

266
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:32,560
And it's not something that we can like. It's not like hard science. And a lot of like NIH grants and those grants are like very hard sciences.

267
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:41,920
But anyways, and so we are in the process of hiring a product manager and hopefully will launch the scale up next year.

268
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:49,090
And so right now I'm going to turn over so that we can hear a little bit from Jordan Porter Seabaugh.

269
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:53,090
He is the director and co-founder of the Progressive Hall Partnership,

270
00:29:53,330 --> 00:30:00,379
and he's been on the ground for the past few decades doing all the amazing work on the ground.

271
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,580
And he's locally from Mbarara as well. And these are some of the questions that I asked him.

272
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:11,149
But I would like to I'm just going to open the next like 15 to 20 minutes so that he can share a little bit about who he is.

273
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:15,810
And then you can also ask questions from him as well.

274
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:21,000
How do I. Do I just maybe exit out of the stash?

275
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:26,930
Okay. As do I.

276
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:35,090
You know, after two years of pandemic. You think I would have figured this out? But you told him not to be here?

277
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:42,710
Yeah. Speaker Jordan, you can unmute yourself and you can start talking if you'd like.

278
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:47,059
Yeah, yeah, I have unmute myself, I think.

279
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:51,230
Are you hearing me? Very well as we can't hear you. Okay.

280
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:59,180
Yes. So, yes, Jordan, but this is my name and I'm the director of programs for Progressive Health Partnership.

281
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,340
So maybe I can talk briefly.

282
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:14,430
I like my background a little bit. So I'm a born of a Lula area, so I was born in Lula, Uganda.

283
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:20,330
Of course, the biggest percentage of Ugandans we live in about we live in rural areas.

284
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:28,470
And then maybe after education, that is when we actually joined the the urban centers or the towns for the few cities that we have.

285
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:33,960
So those are my names. And I work with Progressive Health Partnership.

286
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:48,750
So me and my friend called Joshua Greenberg, who in has just mentioned, who is a student of history at the University of Michigan.

287
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:53,670
We started working together in 2009.

288
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,900
Josh was a student at Duke University.

289
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:04,200
I think by then he was in college and then he got an opportunity with other students.

290
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:16,290
They came and visited us here in Uganda in 2009, and then by that time I was working with an NGO called my Anja Memorial Hospital Foundation,

291
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,580
and then me and Josh, we met and we became friends from then.

292
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:34,179
And then we shared, you know, we shared, we had like similar commonalities about the community work, but then during our stories.

293
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:43,260
So he found out that actually whatever we are doing right now, when I was still young, I experienced almost everything.

294
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:53,610
So one of the challenges that actually I encountered when I was still in my mother's womb is when my mother was pregnant.

295
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:59,340
So it was very, very hard for her to access and seek antenatal care.

296
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:06,360
So because it was far from my home to a health center, it was very, very, very far.

297
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:15,870
So after knowing how I were how I survived when I was young and how my mother was pregnant, you know, the difficulties that she went through.

298
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:23,910
So I decided to go come into work so that I can basically save all her, those people,

299
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:32,130
the mothers who are actually suffering from the same challenges or the same problems that I encountered or I experienced when I was too young.

300
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:38,639
So from there in 2009, me and Josh, we actually shared a lot.

301
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,140
And we we had it was, you know, small, small,

302
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:53,700
small ideas that maybe in the future we may start an NGO and then we start supporting the mothers or the poor people here in Uganda.

303
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,359
So from there that was the starting point.

304
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:07,830
So we started our NGO in 2010, 2011, and right now we are ten years old and here we are.

305
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:14,219
So that was the that's how we actually started this non-governmental organization.

306
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:20,190
And then that's how in Janus like one year ago.

307
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:30,060
So that is my background mainly. So that's how Progressive Village Partnership was actually introduced, that's how we actually started.

308
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:36,000
And you're right now and we started it was small, but right now it is actually big.

309
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:44,040
So we started with one subcounty in one district, but right now we are in ten districts.

310
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,970
Actually, we are almost covering the whole of south western region.

311
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:59,610
So it is a very big deal now. So even they were in was talking about scale up of the accountability project.

312
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:07,259
So we have been planning to scale up to the whole country of Uganda, so to the 43 million population.

313
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:11,970
So in the near future we shall do that and that's our plan.

314
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:18,330
So if I interested. Yes, you come on. We work together with public health students.

315
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:25,800
So, you know, there's a lot of work here, so you should think about it so that in the future I'm wondering as we learn from each other.

316
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:33,720
Okay. Yeah. So, um. So that is the simple background of progressive business partnership.

317
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,530
So then to add on that.

318
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,870
So why are we doing this accountability project?

319
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:50,160
How is it related to the mission and the vision of progressive in partnership?

320
00:35:50,760 --> 00:36:03,690
So we found that in Uganda, in our communities, there is a lot of issues in terms of accessibility of his services.

321
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:14,760
And because most of the people are poor, it is hard for them to get service health services, especially the poor women.

322
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,310
So we find it, as you know, it's a very big gap.

323
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:27,780
So we decided to start this project for the governance and accountability projects so that

324
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:35,250
we can create a platform for the poor people to get an opportunity to say something.

325
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:44,050
Well, maybe to air their views to get a product from where they can actually say what they want to say to the politicians.

326
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:54,220
Because here our government, the politicians are the powerful people in our system.

327
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:59,440
So they are the supervisors. They are the monitors of our health care system here.

328
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:06,210
So why we decided to started this project was to create a grid,

329
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:17,770
a platform for these models so that they can actually air out or they can say they their views that politicians on number one on the

330
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:26,770
accessibility of health care services number two on the quality of healthcare services that they are getting from the health center.

331
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:34,530
And, you know, to give feedback to these politicians and we as an organization, after getting that feedback,

332
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:39,669
then it helps us to report to the higher levels of government so that it can

333
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:45,610
help to improve the health services because there is a lot of corruption here.

334
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:54,790
So you find out the health center, the government brings medicines and then the medicines are actually they are stolen by the hands workers.

335
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:01,150
So during that meeting, so the community members, they give feedback.

336
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,470
They said, no, when we go to the health center, we don't find drugs when you go.

337
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:10,120
These all these services they start. They are private clinics.

338
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:15,170
Private clinics. And they steal medicine and they take them in their private can.

339
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:20,680
So we get many information, we get a lot of feedback through such meetings.

340
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:27,430
So and the number two training the local politician.

341
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:38,800
We empower them. So, you know, in our country, after these local politicians are elected, they don't get any opportunity of getting any training.

342
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:46,150
So because, you know, remember, they are the ones who monitor and supervise these health centers, but they are not trained.

343
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:51,940
So what it does is to train them with trained of local councils,

344
00:38:51,940 --> 00:39:01,390
which are persons on monitoring those health centers because they are in charge of health unit, unit management committees.

345
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:06,200
So they are the ones are responsible for supervising and monitoring.

346
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:14,890
And so pitch be trained is them. We empower them, we equip them with the knowledge and then they know on what to do.

347
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:21,759
So mainly so the accountability meeting is more of advocacy,

348
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:30,670
really advocating for these poor community members to know their rights about the accessibility of healthcare services.

349
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:43,420
And then this being an organization, our vision and our mission is to make sure that we eliminate the burden of diseases on the poor.

350
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:50,820
Oppression in Uganda. So I actually most of our activities in Lulu areas,

351
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:57,730
that's where we actually work because most of the people in rural communities, they are actually poor.

352
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:05,620
So they are poor. They are not educated. You know, there are many challenges and many challenges we are still developing.

353
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:10,719
But one day, one time, we shall reach and we shall be developed.

354
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,580
I don't know how many years to go, but right now we are still in that stage.

355
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:21,790
But as as an NGO, we are working very hard to make sure that those communities they develop.

356
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,910
So right now, that's what we are doing. So there's still a long way to go.

357
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:37,900
We still have a lot of work here. We still need more funding, you know, so but one by one, we shall reach in the in the future.

358
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:42,340
So basically that's what we do as an organization.

359
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:50,620
So and then of course, we have another project called Casa Number Drop Program there.

360
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:58,300
We support mothers. We support mothers always medi medication and medical supplies.

361
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:08,890
So it is the responsibility of the government to buy medicines, drugs and all types of surprise the health centers.

362
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,650
But they don't actually provide enough. They give like like a quota.

363
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,540
So you find the health center is completely stuck.

364
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:29,810
So so what BSP does. So we procure medicines and medical supplies to the and support this health center.

365
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:41,530
Got to work with us. And the reason is we want our mothers when they come for illnesses and deliveries, you know, at least to to find something.

366
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:48,160
So we try to bridge the gap in case the government doesn't provide the medication and medical supplies.

367
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:55,360
So we come in we come in to bridge the gap. So that is another program apart from the accountability.

368
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:04,570
So we also do that in that area. So mainly we are we are, we are we are on maternal and child health care programs.

369
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:10,160
Mainly, that's what we do. So I mean, do I need to add any other.

370
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,420
That's a I know. I mean, I think you did a wonderful job about explaining, you know,

371
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:20,900
like how you got involved with the Progressive Health Partnership and what we do as a as an NGO and the,

372
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:28,120
you know, the type of thing that you do on the ground. And just like a few things that I want to add here is that, you know,

373
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:32,390
he measures a lot like the accountability project and all of this you targeting at the health center.

374
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,610
But we keep bringing up like maternal child health.

375
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:40,450
And that's because like that's where we still see a lot of like needs, like kids that are under five.

376
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:48,920
Like we still have very high mortality. We don't even get to like, you know, not there is like now a aging population and there is a need for,

377
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:52,520
you know, like people who have like cardiac issues and diabetes and all that kind of stuff.

378
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,429
But like that is not even where we are at at the health center.

379
00:42:55,430 --> 00:43:01,069
We are still treating like women who are dying while they're pregnant and delivering and, you know,

380
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:06,830
children who are like under five and susceptible to all of these, you know, diseases that the kids are exposed to when they're growing up.

381
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,030
And we're like still get it trying to get like our vaccination rate higher for the kids.

382
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:20,840
So that's why a lot of our interventions are still focused on like maternal child health in these region and another like big kudos to in that.

383
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:25,340
Yeah I worked with you know NGOs and like Zambia, like Nigeria,

384
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:31,879
Liberia and I have to say like is like one of the best like equipped the type of work that they do,

385
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,450
like the way that they follow the protocol it is like to the team.

386
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:41,210
So I thank you so much, Jordan, for all the work that you do. And I look forward to more of the stuff that we all do together.

387
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:49,750
Yeah. I guess the question is, please let the students feel free to ask me as many questions as they can.

388
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:54,489
So maybe I can say that since they are public.

389
00:43:54,490 --> 00:44:01,130
Harris students. So, you know, in sub-Saharan Africa.

390
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:05,290
So there are still many, many challenges, of course, you know.

391
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,670
You know, the world is like, you know, we call it we say it's a group of village, so the whole world is one.

392
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,930
So we need to work together so that we can really develop each other.

393
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:20,740
So there's still a lot of work to do.

394
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:27,730
You know, we are still behind. So the students should actually know that these are a lot of opportunities.

395
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:34,239
These are a lot of you know, in sub-Saharan Africa, we still need a hand.

396
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:43,360
We still need to partner with people from the West, you know, and in other countries so that we we learn from each other.

397
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,740
We work together.

398
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:55,270
And then I can give an example of COVID 19, you know, started from maybe China, but reached every, you know, all corners of the world.

399
00:44:55,780 --> 00:45:04,179
So you see, it is you know, it's a small problem, can start from the in one corner of this world,

400
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:07,780
but it can actually spread into, you know, in the whole world.

401
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:16,560
So the problem of sub-Saharan Africa is not the problem of sub-Saharan African alone.

402
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:21,880
You know, it is a global problem. So whatever we we experience here.

403
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:28,690
So it is a wide concern. It is for the World Health Organization to handle, you know, the United Nations.

404
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:37,780
So we still need to work together as a team as as as, you know, people in the whole world so that we can really develop this world.

405
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:45,790
So, you know, those are the tips that I you know, I was actually giving the public health students.

406
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:55,350
So they need to you know, you need to think there is a lot of challenges in this world.

407
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,610
You know, I know even in the United States, I know even in Europe, you know, they are still there.

408
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:07,090
So, you know, they should think beyond the classroom and they should really just think about,

409
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:11,310
you know, something that you really like or maybe you love.

410
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:19,150
You do a lot of research about it and then you develop maybe an innovation or maybe you think, how can this one be solved?

411
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:25,690
So there are many challenges in this world and we can find solutions for all those problems.

412
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:31,360
Thank you so much, Jordan. I hope you guys think about some of the questions that you can ask him toward the end.

413
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:39,400
After I talk about the other interventions that we were working on and then after we have an opportunity to talk to Dr. Shamir,

414
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:44,500
we'll like open up the floor so that you guys can ask questions to Jordan and Donna as well.

415
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:52,470
I'm not ending this way. Oh, I thought this about it.

416
00:46:52,530 --> 00:47:00,450
I think so. Well, actually, maybe not. What does this probably have to, like, escape and then put your palm back up?

417
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:04,960
Since then. Go back to and then go back to the same.

418
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:09,310
I would like to know after sharing the screen. It sounds good. Perfect.

419
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:17,890
So the other one other big part of the project that I'm doing, as I'm sure are.

420
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:24,770
Well, those are rough spots.

421
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:28,770
Thank you. You're very welcome. There we go.

422
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:38,040
Sounds good. Thanks. Yeah. So another project that I'm working a lot as a postdoc and since as a PhD student,

423
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:45,750
is this savings group so briefly to go over again about like the maternal and child health issues around the world.

424
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:53,100
Globally, they say about 810 women die every day related to issues, pregnancy and childbirth.

425
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,700
And 94% of these deaths come from low and middle income countries.

426
00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:02,910
And two third of these deaths are from sub-Saharan Africa. And for every woman who dies during pregnancy and childbirth,

427
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:08,190
it is expected that there's 20 more that suffer from some sort of infection, injury, injury or disability.

428
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:14,300
In Zambia I did. My dissertation work is more on the southern part of Africa,

429
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:23,210
with 18.38 million people living there and 20% of deaths among women ages to 2025 years old are related to pregnancy and childbirth,

430
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:32,900
which, if you think about it, is crazy. And 40.8% of the population is considered extremely poor, as defined as those who are living under $2 a day.

431
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:41,630
And so the maternal mortality burden and the morbidity burden is significantly higher for people who are,

432
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:46,340
you know, like Jordan mentioned, people who are poor and people who live in rural areas.

433
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:50,780
And these are because, you know, if you are making $2 a day,

434
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:59,329
there very limited opportunities for you to save from what you're making to kind of prepare for any emergency life events like here in the States,

435
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:05,900
your car might break down like somebody might get into an accident. And these all unexpected life events can occur.

436
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:10,010
And it's really difficult to assess this usually large sum of money for these people.

437
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:16,700
And as while as much as we think here are more on the western side of the world that like, you know,

438
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:24,470
pregnancy and childbirth is something that you plan and, you know, it's more of a life event rather than like unexpected, like emergency event.

439
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:30,950
A lot of a lot of times like here, you know, if they have limited access to family planning, it is.

440
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,650
And if you are like pregnant and toward the end of your pregnancy, things can become very emergent very quickly.

441
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:41,990
And if you don't have the cash in hand, then you have to.

442
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,559
A lot of times people have like sell their chicken and or like some like ask for

443
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:49,550
like transportation from their like one person to come tomorrow to have a car.

444
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:56,419
And all of these delays add up that can, you know, you know, we called it the three delays.

445
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:01,040
And I know whether Jody mentioned that. But the delay in seeking and reaching and receiving care.

446
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:06,230
And so a lot of like money is involved, especially if you're trying to get a transportation.

447
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:10,790
If you live like more than ten kilometers, you're not going to try to walk at the onset of labor,

448
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:17,540
ten kilometers to go to the health facility to deliver. And so and there was also like very limited availability with ambulances.

449
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:23,809
Sometimes there's like one and a lot of times like they don't have fuels and fuel here in America is expensive.

450
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:27,680
And in Uganda it has been skyrocketing. Yeah, everywhere.

451
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,839
And it's crazy. And so there is, you know, costs regarding transportation.

452
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:39,650
And once you get to the, you know, health care facility to try to deliver, they're often told that they're supposed to bring these like mama kits.

453
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:45,440
And these mama kids often involve, you know, plastic sheet that you're going to deliver and cotton gauze, scissors.

454
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:49,910
So you're supposed to bring your own item because there's no guarantee that the health facility is going to have them.

455
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:55,520
So they might have the midwives and the, you know, health care providers. But women are often encouraged to bring these mama mama kits.

456
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:59,030
And they're expensive, you know, for for these people.

457
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:03,470
And it's also challenging to find them at the last minute.

458
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:09,590
And so there's a lot of different type of like money that is involved in seeking, reaching and receiving reproductive health services.

459
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:12,290
So savings group is also, you know,

460
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:21,950
a type of informal microfinance mechanism that is often targeted for these people that are called like poorest of the poor and in the world, really.

461
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:27,079
And these savings group provide financial services such as savings and loans for

462
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:31,280
people who are extremely poor and they have different names for savings group.

463
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,900
And I don't know whether you've heard, you know, silks, which stands for Savings and Internal Lending Communities.

464
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:42,260
BSL stands for Village Saving the Loan Association, but the basic way that they function is very similar.

465
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:50,569
But the name varies depending on the type of NGO that's implementing or like it's the same thing that's implemented in this community of Uganda.

466
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:53,270
The name changed by the time it goes to a different community,

467
00:51:53,900 --> 00:52:01,610
etc. But the general function is the same and it has quite a bit of advantages compared to the formal financial services that we often access,

468
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:07,670
you know, like banks or more formal financial institutions. First is that it does not require outside funding.

469
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:13,460
So all the things and the loans from the community members pooled collectively,

470
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:17,600
pooled money so they don't get the money from a bank or from third party.

471
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:26,719
So there is like it's like a little bit safer and it's also considered very respectable because they can, you know, decide their own savings amount.

472
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,750
Like it's not like anybody's be like you have to say a specific amount.

473
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:34,610
They get to decide like, oh, I think in my own capacity I can save like $0.25 a week.

474
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,450
Then that is pretty flexible among the committee members to decide.

475
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:44,479
And the interest rate also like if I take decide to take out a loan, I think 3 to 5% interest is like fine.

476
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,880
Then the community members themselves get to decide that.

477
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:52,750
And there's like no external institution or organization kind of forcing that, forcing a specific amount.

478
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:57,470
It is also easy to access. A lot of times these people have like very limited literacy,

479
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:01,490
so they don't have to go through complicated paperwork like you do if you're trying to open a bank account here.

480
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:05,710
It is also shown to generate a sense of community because the same number,

481
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:13,070
same community members will show up in a regular basis and it becomes a platform for them to like come and talk about various life events,

482
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:18,290
like maybe your kid is starting school or like this thing is happening in the community and I want to

483
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:22,930
invite my other friends so it becomes a platform for community members to share different information,

484
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,670
knowledge and set up. And so this is how it generally functions.

485
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:31,989
Each group and, you know, people would advertise like, oh,

486
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:37,180
we're going to start this group and 15 to 30 plus people can self-select themselves that if

487
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:41,650
they want to join this group and they kind of commit the commit to joining a serious group.

488
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:47,410
And once these members are locked in, it is pretty rare for them to drop out in the middle of a cycle or have new members join.

489
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:57,069
And so these communal members, who often also live in a similar geographic location and they will decide to meet on a regular basis,

490
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:59,510
whether it is biweekly or on a monthly basis.

491
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:06,400
And they will say every time you come, I'm going to try to put down $1 or like this other person, I'm going to try to put down like dollar 25.

492
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:12,760
And so that every time they meet, they will put down the money that they decided that they were going to each save.

493
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:19,360
And so then they will put it in this like locked box and then they'll have their own way of keeping a record.

494
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:25,360
It's on it. It's usually like a stamp. So like each stamp on your book will note will mean like $0.25 or something like that.

495
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:31,990
So if you put down a dollar at the end of the month, then you will have like four stamp on your book and the individuals get to keep a book.

496
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:35,860
And then there was like a community savings group wide book as well.

497
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:42,010
And the key there is know like, you know, three different locks and it's distributed among like three different savings group members and

498
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:46,900
they can only open it if there's more than 80% of the savings group member present at the time.

499
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:52,360
And from these like savings that, you know, that people like pulled their money together,

500
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:56,259
people can then take out loans from this pooled money for various things like,

501
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:00,999
you know, my, my kid got sick this week and I had to take him to the hospital then,

502
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,260
you know, and you don't have this like money easily accessible than you can,

503
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,799
like take a loan from here or like paying for children's like school fees or buying

504
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:13,150
livestock or different equipment to expand your income generating activity or,

505
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:22,420
you know, by different materials to rebuild part of your houses like wall or put a tin roof on the house, etc. and then these loans will be paid back,

506
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:27,060
pay back with a specific, you know, predetermined amount of interest, whether that was three or 5%.

507
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:31,030
And then at the end of the cycle, which is often anywhere from 10 to 12 months,

508
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:38,860
people will share out the savings that they put in with the interest that also accumulated over time while people are taking loans.

509
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:45,760
And so there was like two papers that Ryan kind of like sent to you guys that was like my dissertation work.

510
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:52,120
My primary research question around this was, you know, does self participation impact household wealth,

511
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:56,080
financial preparedness for birth and utilization of various reproductive health services?

512
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:04,270
And my first like, you know, sub aim was to understand the association between Self's participation at the individual level, household wealth,

513
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:11,050
financial preparedness for birth, and to examine the association between the sex of the participants and the financial preparedness for birth.

514
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:17,790
And a second aim was to understand the association between having access to skills at the community level.

515
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:22,980
So it wasn't like everybody within this community who actually participated in the Silk's.

516
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:28,649
I simply conducted a survey amongst people who were just like living in that

517
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:33,450
community to those that had access and those that didn't have access to folks

518
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:36,329
to kind of compare like their household wealth and financial prepares for

519
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:40,620
birth and utilization or reproductive health or reproductive health services.

520
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:46,100
And just to briefly go over some of the results for the first paper,

521
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:53,390
I found that Phil's party participation led to an average increase of 7.32 items of the 13 household wealth items.

522
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:58,100
So I asked them like in the beginning, like before you join stocks, like how much did you harvest?

523
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:02,179
Like what was your house material? Was what was your toilet system like?

524
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:07,820
Were you able to pay for your school children like school fees? Did your children have like shoes and clothes?

525
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:12,770
All those question that they're like 13 different items and they compare them like before they joined socks.

526
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:19,070
After they joined socks. And if there was an improvement at the end, it was, you know, an increase.

527
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:24,200
So out of the 13 items, there was an average of seven items that individuals said that there was an improvement.

528
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:30,799
And so participation with their most recent delivery after joining socks were more likely to be financially

529
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:35,720
prepared for birth when we compared it to people who had their most recent childbirth before they joined socks.

530
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:44,210
So we asked people like, Oh, for your most recent delivery, were you able to purchase all the material that you were asked to purchase?

531
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:47,330
And that's how we assessed financial preparedness for birth.

532
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:57,310
And yeah, and females were more likely to be financially prepared for birth than males if they had their most recent delivery before joining cells.

533
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:04,460
So for people who had their most recent delivery after they joined those, the gender of the participants no longer was shown to be significant.

534
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:12,180
And so this showed that the cell participation increased household wealth and financial preparedness for birth for both men and woman.

535
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:16,880
And one of the plausible explanation is that, like the sell to us function as a total platform.

536
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:23,960
So when women were having issues with their pregnancy and childbirth and concerns regarding like the money and all that kind of stuff,

537
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:28,640
when they were sharing all this type of stuff during the during the health meeting,

538
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:32,569
the men was also then like informed about like, oh, I should also prioritize X,

539
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:38,570
Y and z of these financial resources for my spouse is a possible explanation, but I don't have data to prove that.

540
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:47,020
And that's why I'm conducting more studies on this. My second paper that was looking at the interaction effect of community groups and time points.

541
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,710
So community groups were divided between three different types of community.

542
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:58,100
So the first community coming group one had neither access to maternity waiting homes nor silks coming group to have only maternity waiting homes,

543
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:01,550
and three had both maternity waiting homes and silks.

544
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:04,969
And it was shown that it was significantly associated with maternity waiting,

545
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:09,020
room utilization, health facilities delivery and skilled provider delivery.

546
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:15,170
And even though like, you know, in theory, like if you're delivering at a health facility, you should also be delivering with a health care provider.

547
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:23,990
That is not necessarily the case in these settings. So more specifically compared to one from Community Group three that had access to both,

548
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:33,080
community of one had lower odds of utilizing maternity homes and delivering at a health facility and woman from Community Group one and two that was,

549
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:37,220
you know, like had neither access access to need of them or had only maternity waiting homes,

550
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:41,120
had lower odds of delivering with a skilled provider compared to women from community groups.

551
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:47,240
And the lots of they having access to skills was associated with increased maternity weighting,

552
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:51,410
home use and health facility delivery when maternity waiting homes were available.

553
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:58,430
But access so felt was associated with increased skill provider assisted delivery regardless of availability of maternity waiting homes.

554
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:03,200
So further, like research questions that I developed after the study is that like how can

555
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,940
Simmons Group enhance like male involvement for married and childbearing age woman?

556
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:13,690
And how does the woman's relationship with her husband impact savings group activity, though a lot of them were married,

557
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:19,630
but there was no data on like how much they talk about their like the woman they use for activities or like,

558
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:22,540
you know, if there is specific loans that she took out on.

559
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:26,950
Like, is it like actually her decision that she was going to take out a loan or did the husband be like,

560
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:32,529
oh, take out a loan so that we can like do X, Y and Z? Like how much decision making process, like,

561
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:42,070
how did that play out amongst the couple and whether and whether same is good related activities and experience vary for woman with marital status.

562
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:46,840
So a lot of these like literature are just mostly focused on like married woman.

563
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:51,010
And if you guys, if any of you get like work with like demographic health surveys,

564
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:55,989
which is a very like systematic list of questionnaire like each of these stuff

565
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:59,440
they're in low income countries collect in like every three or four years.

566
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:02,620
It's only targeting like almost like almost, yeah.

567
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:09,210
Old married woman exclusively because there aren't they're just like there's a lot of like stigma and there's like, you know,

568
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:13,750
there's like hierarchy of like people were like, oh, you're not married, you're not like adult enough and all of that.

569
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:20,320
But anyways and widowers to widows widows and also like how to woman use savings for

570
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:24,460
related financial gains especially in trying to access like health care utilization,

571
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:28,899
health care services, not just reproductive health stuff, but like as a kid is like three years old.

572
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:33,340
And if the kid got sick, like how much of the money do they use it for the families?

573
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:40,900
Health care. So I am conducting another study with Dr. Özdemir in Uganda.

574
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:47,860
And this we are looking at obviously and just doing some preliminary literature review.

575
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:51,160
I found that, you know, again, statements group is often targeted at woman,

576
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:57,580
but there is mixed results on like women's empowerment and woman's marital status and how all of that are associated.

577
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,980
So this one study in India found that married woman had higher amounts of average money,

578
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:07,240
saved total amount of loan use and total savings compared to single woman.

579
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:13,180
But they don't go further in-depth. What are some of the possible explanations for this and some discussions around that?

580
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:21,200
It was very limited. Another study in Zambia found that married woman had 26% higher profit from business, started with savings group resources.

581
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:25,560
But again, they didn't go into detail of why that was the case.

582
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:31,030
Well, like the husbands, like involved trying to help the woman, you know, get loans to start businesses like we don't know.

583
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:39,660
And so I am kind of like beginning to study instead of this study to try to understand whether woman's marital status, influence,

584
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:43,230
pattern of their value related to financial gains and expenditures,

585
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:49,649
health care utilization and empowerment and married woman I'm stratifying it by like married woman single and never married.

586
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:54,330
Woman Like widows, separated, divorced woman, which, you know, divorced and separated.

587
01:02:54,480 --> 01:03:04,050
Divorce is kind of very rare. And I'm also like interviewing married woman like husband and Beasley participating men.

588
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:07,530
So some of the savings are exclusively only woman.

589
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:15,600
Some of the savings group are like more mixed gender. And the, you know, as you can probably assume, there's like different dynamics there as well.

590
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:22,889
So these are some like my savings in woman is pretty much, you know, marital status.

591
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:27,060
How does that influence patterns of savings, loan use, health care and empowerment,

592
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:33,840
but also factors like determining woman's decision to involve or not involve or how much to involve their husbands.

593
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:39,929
And some of the similarities and differences in woman's perception and experiences and obviously based on their

594
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:46,380
marital status and whether there is a need to improve the currently existing the SLA to better meet woman's need.

595
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:51,149
And so it's going to be a mixed message study,

596
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:57,030
but this pretty comprehensive survey that we are going to do like pre post that includes like demographic.

597
01:03:57,210 --> 01:04:02,820
I think some of the interesting questions that we included here is like, you know, who made the decision for you to get married?

598
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:08,730
Like, what's the age gap between you and your husband? How old were you when you got married and how did you meet your husband?

599
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:15,569
All that kind of stuff and partner involvement of like how much you involve your husband or how much you talk about these financial decision

600
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:26,930
making processes with your husband as a couple and how supportive as your husband and household while of service use obviously antenatal care,

601
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:31,349
post-natal care delivery but also any of the family members like sickness and illnesses over

602
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:36,179
the past year like that you should have went to a hospital like did you if you did like

603
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:41,940
did you use the money from things group etc. and women's empowerment kind of understanding

604
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:47,340
like how much just how much power does she have when it comes down to how you use health,

605
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:52,230
family money and the sociocultural stuff, when it comes down to, you know,

606
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:56,339
intimate partner violence and their like attitude toward, you know, can you refuse sex?

607
01:04:56,340 --> 01:05:03,719
Like, can you ask her husband to, like, wear condoms if you know, and when is life being like, acceptable, which is never.

608
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:08,250
But like, these are the questions that like, are you do you need your husband's like permission to, like,

609
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:14,400
leave the house or like meet your family members or go to the market, all of that and their education level and like health as well.

610
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:18,900
So all of that consist of the women's empowerment parts.

611
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:22,920
And we are also collecting data from the booklet that I mentioned that we have like the stamps

612
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:27,270
to make sure like to keep track of like how much are people like saving and taking out loans?

613
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:29,310
Are they able to pay back or not,

614
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:35,760
etc. and focus group discussions among like the stratified like woman and men depending on their like marital status.

615
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:40,229
I'm trying to better understand what their experiences are with the SLA and the pros,

616
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:44,250
cons and like needs of with a current on the SLA is that they're part of.

617
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:53,830
And so these are some like the deadlines that I have for myself to kind of like work ahead, which often gets keep postponing.

618
01:05:53,980 --> 01:06:00,459
But anyways, the accessibility of stuff like the feasibility of the impact by talking to the committee members like these are

619
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:06,700
like our research question like is this like value like is this valuable is important for us to ask or like,

620
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:13,000
what do you think? Or is it like useless? Are we just like coming in and being like, Oh, this must be important or making assumptions about this?

621
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:15,970
And we also like try to test out some of the survey tools and focus group

622
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:22,150
discussion guide that we developed and observed while we originally had four.

623
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:26,440
But now we have had these meetings trying to see like how they run each of these meetings.

624
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:31,750
And we found that one of them actually had like more than 90 members and it takes them forever to go through all of it.

625
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:36,220
But all of this was completed September. Thanks a lot to Dr. Özdemir.

626
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,959
And we're currently in the process of getting IRB from three different institutions and going back

627
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:47,320
and forth and all that fun stuff and applying for more grants and hopefully we will able to.

628
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:52,410
Implement the project sometime later this year, next year.

629
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:55,950
So right now, I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Shamir.

630
01:06:56,580 --> 01:07:03,810
She is a department head of Bishop's University and Emperor of Uganda at Gender Studies and Program Management.

631
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:12,790
So. Uh, solitaire.

632
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:25,820
Okay. Oh, yeah. Hey, I guess we're hearing you.

633
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:29,790
Thank you. Straight away.

634
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:38,430
My name is Dr. Simone Donna. And I have be in development management.

635
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:42,960
But my area of specialty is gender studies.

636
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:54,490
I teach at Bishop's to at University, and I've been a lecturer in the same institution for the last 15 years,

637
01:07:55,390 --> 01:08:02,260
so I really have expertise and experience in that area of my specialization.

638
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:06,580
I'm glad and happy to be part of this.

639
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:18,110
Lecture. Thank you, Dr. Li. I will straightaway go to the issue related to who I am.

640
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:26,210
Basically, I'm. I have passion and drive for gender related issues.

641
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:39,050
And I am someone who has a passion to see women in part considering that Uganda is among the developing countries.

642
01:08:39,650 --> 01:08:47,990
So we still have budgetary equity indices that require combined efforts in order to bridge the gap.

643
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:54,460
Why should or why am I doing this?

644
01:08:57,420 --> 01:09:00,450
You will agree with me that.

645
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:05,020
Women or the empowerment of women is essential.

646
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:11,990
If it comes to the area of health, then for you are health workers.

647
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:21,310
You are very sure that it is essential to the health and social development of the women themselves,

648
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:28,030
their families, whether they leave the communities and the country at large.

649
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:43,650
Because they are able to make decisions, they are able to be independent, make strategic choices that can lead to the health decisions.

650
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:51,950
If I may. Mention. By the way, it is very heartening.

651
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:57,150
When someone doesn't have money because money's poor.

652
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:05,080
I was in primary three when my mother died through childbirth.

653
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:16,560
And it was so disheartening that at that very moment when she started Labor, when their payments increased and increased further,

654
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:22,740
she didn't have money to go to the hospital, the clinics, the health facilities.

655
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:27,990
We are very far there. My father wasn't at home.

656
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:33,090
It was getting late evening. She could not do anything.

657
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:41,230
And, you know, she'd give birth from the house. And she bled till she died.

658
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:47,780
So when you talk about empowerment of women, they serve in groups.

659
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:53,300
Money and or capacity building as far as the empowerment of women is concerned.

660
01:10:53,810 --> 01:11:05,870
There are very key issues that we have to focus on to empower women and improve decision making and also to do with the health.

661
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:19,810
Uh. How do we know that the project we are working on, the savings groups like you have heard Dr. Lee mention.

662
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:29,590
We are studying these women and the savings group associations, mostly dominated by majority women,

663
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:38,710
and they're the ones who now come together to do the saving effectively and, you know, with little savings.

664
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:50,170
But they they are very committed, motivated, ready and willing to do anything but have money saved and be able to move notes.

665
01:11:50,710 --> 01:12:03,100
But all in the interest of improving decision making to their family level, to their own individual interests, and also at the community level.

666
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:11,830
So this project is very, very, very relevant to my professional world of told you money's poor.

667
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:14,590
You can't make a decision without power.

668
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:28,240
And if we are, if I may, or if I am to contribute to to the empowerment of women, their economic empowerment is a very pertinent area of empowerment.

669
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:36,510
And we have to combine efforts to make sure that these women also achieve the vision.

670
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:42,050
Empowerment of women is not the effort of ordinary women alone.

671
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:49,370
Everybody necessity is concerned and is supposed to be part and parcel of this process.

672
01:12:50,010 --> 01:13:00,930
The children. The elderly men because women who are employed live in the houses of me, most of them.

673
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:05,220
A particular setting like the London setting.

674
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:13,550
Most of the women live in the houses of May, and so their empowerment means a lot to the men they live with.

675
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:19,440
So without the support from the men, the empowerment of women cannot be attained.

676
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:31,020
So we believe that combined effort is very important to ensure that we empower women and improve decision making for their health,

677
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:39,360
for their children, for their families, and for everybody within their home, within their households.

678
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:48,540
What I can mention in as far as the public health students are concerned, is that.

679
01:13:50,540 --> 01:14:03,170
We need to prioritize. The health care worker, like one of the colleagues mentioned, that an African health challenge is a global challenge.

680
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:08,120
So I would encourage that each student in public health.

681
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:19,990
Puts a lot of effort in specializing and prioritizing the health work because it is the heart of a strong health system.

682
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:29,520
It should not be about being a doctor, not being enhanced, not just being a clinical officer.

683
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:35,250
But let let it focus on the advocates.

684
01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:44,160
I mean, on the advocacy for for better policies developing treatment on vaccines.

685
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:54,750
At the same time, look at how to address societal and systemic factors that can lead to improved health.

686
01:14:55,380 --> 01:15:01,710
Because if we don't combine efforts and we only want to act as a doctor in the hospital,

687
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:07,350
as a nurse, in a clinic, in a drug shop, we may lose out to that game.

688
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:21,090
We need to combine efforts and do these campaign combined efforts at the same time ensure that we develop treatments, we develop vaccines,

689
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:36,570
we ensure that we are within the communities to sensitize and educate the masses and the communities on how to also be part of health promotion.

690
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:41,720
Maybe finally I can say that.

691
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:48,790
When you haven't understood that things stuck.

692
01:15:50,890 --> 01:15:58,400
Then at times you have not even gotten to understand that you are the same person.

693
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,390
We stuck. Health cannot be avoided.

694
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:11,780
Each person's health is very important. Everybody is supposed to be in the know of health issues or health related issues.

695
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:26,150
So I believe that it is a concern and women are mostly affected by majorly their health issues because of lack of employment.

696
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:34,140
The health of women in terms of antenatal care seeking, in terms of fussy family planning,

697
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:41,700
in terms of delivery, in terms of child care needs, economic or need money.

698
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:49,020
They need power. They need cash to be able to solve immediate challenges or immediate problems.

699
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:58,440
So the Savings and Loans Association, the group that we are working on or trying to implement later in future,

700
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:06,360
is going to be very important in ensuring that we improve the the empowerment of

701
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:11,700
women with their capacity to save on loan out depending on their marital status.

702
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:17,940
Some women who are married have their own challenges different from those who are not married.

703
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:23,880
And at the same time, for those who are widows and those who are separated.

704
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:32,760
So the stratification is very important here because we need to get views and see how to support them accordingly.

705
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:42,930
Either sustains them, but depending on what they feel comfortable with and what is most appropriate and affordable to that project.

706
01:17:44,070 --> 01:18:06,520
That's what I'm gonna see over to you. Ella.

707
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:15,850
Hello. I know.

708
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:21,170
I think you're muted. No, I'm muted.

709
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:26,130
I'm muted. I was muted, don't I? Sorry. Yeah.

710
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:36,620
So now is the appropriate time. The microphone is on. Now we know. Anybody have any comments, questions for Jordan or Donna or me?

711
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:39,020
Now.

712
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:50,270
It's not like I'm the first one specifically help single women generally joins the convergence of say it's very women or is there a difference in.

713
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:58,130
I mean, I feel like Jonah might be a better person to question. It also depends on, like, how the savings group were implemented, because sometimes,

714
01:18:58,130 --> 01:19:02,270
like, you know, a lot of times, like, I showed you in the slide, like, it's.

715
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:07,860
It's also stuff like this. They've volunteered and a lot of times it's like one family member reporting,

716
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:11,940
like the other family member or like one friend telling all their friend that they should also join.

717
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:20,250
So you can see like sometimes certain segments group might be more dominantly single woman oriented and some of them are more married

718
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:26,070
woman because that's the type of social group that they have and that's the type of people that they will recruit amongst themselves.

719
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:33,900
But I would say that for people who are single, like the groups of single woman are in, there were more men in it.

720
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:37,410
So like for married woman or like especially the widows.

721
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:46,410
Like there aren't as many men in those groups, but for some reason, yeah, single women have like more like men involved in their like groups,

722
01:19:46,410 --> 01:19:52,380
which is interesting as a good or bad, we'll, we'll find out from the others.

723
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:59,820
Any one of those discussions is because you guys are the organization are going to try and collaborate with government officials.

724
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:08,960
Do you ever encounter areas where their political goals don't align with the organization's goals and what's happening there?

725
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,090
So yeah. Gordon, do you want to answer that question? Did you hear that?

726
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:22,100
You're not paying attention. Please. Just kidding. Did you want to say something, Donna?

727
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:28,520
Although I didn't hear what you say. Oh, do you want to say a little bit louder or I can just.

728
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:40,930
Yeah. My question was essentially, because you do try to collaborate with politicians and the government and the community work.

729
01:20:41,010 --> 01:20:44,999
Do you ever encounter events where the priorities are?

730
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:49,860
Goals for the government or politicians doesn't align with the organization's health goals?

731
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:55,630
And if so, how do you navigate that or manage that? The politicians.

732
01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:59,670
Yes. So if you. Yes.

733
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:02,460
For a lot of products, we work closely with politicians.

734
01:21:02,730 --> 01:21:09,720
But if the politicians, you know, role, not role, but like their goal is different from the organization or the research goal.

735
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:22,510
How do we navigate that like nuances and the differences? Now you see issues of politics here in Uganda are very critical and difficult.

736
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:32,350
Sometimes you find that the institution is always supporting the current government, the current politicians.

737
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:38,410
So it is all about lobbying and, you know, collaborating and, you know,

738
01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:45,340
sitting on a round table to agree to ensure that the politicians are inducted into the

739
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:51,130
research or the institution object or research objective so that they by their support.

740
01:21:51,550 --> 01:22:00,730
And that is what usually is done to ensure that they support collaboration and running all these research activities.

741
01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:07,600
But apart from that, you cannot go through institutions usually have to lobby and they talk to.

742
01:22:07,610 --> 01:22:13,300
And that's what is the norm here. And you kind of have to find the right people.

743
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:17,590
So before you go head to head with like a specific politician that you want to work with,

744
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:24,490
you kind of like do the informal like the dance with like kind of like trying to see where they are at with specific

745
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:30,160
policies and stuff like that before we approach them and have a better strategy of like how to how to approach,

746
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:37,060
you know, have this conversation with them. And it is a lot about like finding the right people who have the similar motivations.

747
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:41,200
So Timothy Lubanga, who we are working with, he is very much behind, you know,

748
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:46,240
better equipping the politicians also like really vocalizing the community members.

749
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:52,569
And he's actually like there was a government policy in Uganda some years ago that

750
01:22:52,570 --> 01:22:56,110
were trying to implement the decentralization of the leadership a little bit,

751
01:22:56,860 --> 01:22:58,780
and they actually want to like revamp that.

752
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:06,160
And they are actually working with PHP and OSC very closely and are paying very close attention to our research findings so that they can

753
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:13,810
use our research findings to inform because we are using outside money to kind of like do what they're interested in finding out anyway.

754
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:19,270
So it's like a give and take kind of, you know. Yeah, yeah.

755
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:26,030
We are smart about it. Anything you want to add, Jordan? If not, it's fine.

756
01:23:29,370 --> 01:23:40,370
Anyone else have different questions? My question as a community, I've heard the thought about the merry go round savings method.

757
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:48,400
Yeah. I mean, merry go round is the is the root of all of how say this group kind of like developed.

758
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:51,890
So if you look into like literature merry go round, you know,

759
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:59,260
have existed for so long and it essentially is very similar but merry go round is slightly different in a sense.

760
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:03,399
Like people becoming members will decide on a specific amount of money.

761
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:07,330
Everybody will put that money and for this meeting, go give it to you.

762
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:10,630
Next meeting, we'll give it to you. So we we go around taking turns.

763
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:17,880
But there was a little bit less accountability because once that member got the money, they disappear.

764
01:24:18,730 --> 01:24:21,680
Although there are some those with all of those issues.

765
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:27,430
So like say this group are a little bit more like a they kind of like distributed that risk a little bit, a little bit more.

766
01:24:27,610 --> 01:24:34,610
But we are very familiar with that method and like some company members still do that and it just kind of like depends on how much trust and you know,

767
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:38,710
all that is among November, but no. Mm.

768
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:39,640
An excellent question.

769
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:47,140
Have you ever faced pushback from the government about the savings groups, like attempts to regulate them or tax them or anything?

770
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:55,120
Yeah, that's a great point. And, you know, like feel free to chime in if you'd like to, but a lot of times there are too many.

771
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:59,680
And like if you look at the method, it's very easy to just start one.

772
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:06,070
So it's very hard for them to actually, like, regulate. And actually, for Uganda, they actually implement it into their policy to like start them.

773
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:10,180
And then a lot of time there were started like over governments being like this is a

774
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:14,440
very easy way to provide these like financial means for people who are very poor.

775
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:19,480
And then they got like just took up their own thing and then the government were like, okay, you guys do your own thing.

776
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:25,480
But they, that's also another thing that they don't. I was like looking for like a government document of like how they like keep track of them.

777
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:31,900
We couldn't find them. So a lot of them that they're very supportive and a lot of NGOs go into these communities.

778
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:35,860
Right now, there's like more than 70 countries that adopted some form of saving group.

779
01:25:36,190 --> 01:25:44,950
And I don't know that it's like I think it's like more than 70 million people who are part of some type of informal microfinance mechanism.

780
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:51,570
Would you like to add anything, Jordan or Dona sorry for me to just dominate.

781
01:25:51,570 --> 01:25:54,390
I'm taking up all the questions. Mm. Mhm.

782
01:25:55,410 --> 01:26:03,360
Like you have say there is no currently there is no policy regulating the village savings and loans associations,

783
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:10,799
but the engineers that have been given the mandate to influence fund,

784
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:21,240
establish VSL is and oversee them and in that matter they present what they do to the government and

785
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:29,520
know also sell ideas on how these VSL is should be run and how far they have gone in promoting them.

786
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:37,230
And so the Government is usually appreciative because the NGOs are also bringing in a new innovation.

787
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:41,910
Probably later in the future there could be some policies that are likely to be developed

788
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:49,740
because they are taking lead and they are very key issues that are becoming an emission issue.

789
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:54,830
So eventually they are likely to be policies that we to regulate these.

790
01:26:54,990 --> 01:27:00,209
This is more than anything else.

791
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:03,360
Anyone we are out of time. Okay.

792
01:27:04,770 --> 01:27:10,139
Thank you so much. Ha and Jordan. So it's absolutely amazing.

793
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:13,469
Really interesting. And I really have to sit around for a few minutes.

794
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:20,520
All for the kids. People. Yeah, of course. I mean, see you all on Thursday and in person as well for a last lecture.

795
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:31,870
I don't know, 30. They do it in any valuation?

796
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:35,590
Oh, yes. Valuation of the last period that it was opened.

797
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:38,950
At the end of the day, that would be great.

798
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:43,090
Yeah. So that I can learn to. What, what, when we all wanted to go.

799
01:27:43,090 --> 01:27:46,840
Well all of that. So. By Jordan.
