1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,420
Okay. So.

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:15,870
Hey, how you doing? So just going to follow up with aims to do a quiz on short quiz I should is roughly

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:24,580
10 to 15 let me put it knowing me that 12 questions it will be on the 24th.

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,730
So then you have all next week to go over. I'm actually thinking that I'm quite happy as well to do a zoom call.

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,860
It's like half an hour the day before in the evening and the second log of any particular questions.

6
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:42,700
I'm happy as well. I don't being stressed. And it'll be especially true for all of module one.

7
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,810
True or false, you know.

8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:57,230
A multiple choice short answer, that kind of stuff kind of guy and just a some gentle ease and and give you an idea.

9
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,530
So the question is, are we looking at the style? Again, we will not use that.

10
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,800
We don't directly go to any of the papers, not cover the end of the class. It's just purely going to be on the slides, that information there.

11
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,770
And you can kind of get a hint of what's really important in the slides because I bold things that is really,

12
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,550
really important for a particular aspect of conversation.

13
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:22,840
I often also note involving the underlying as well. So voting voting on the line that tells you it's important.

14
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,700
Obviously a general jet is also so. So. Uh.

15
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,700
Any questions on that? Up information up.

16
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,510
It'll be by tonight or tomorrow morning.

17
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,910
Okay, so I went swimming about here last time. Okay.

18
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,430
Well, let me. Okay. It's like show.

19
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:57,230
For me, the main message of this was the bacteria can modify your own material.

20
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:03,970
This case, primarily biomass, is to make them secondary boxes.

21
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:13,250
And primary viruses are important for the liver to process and support and destroy cancer cells.

22
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:20,680
All right. So if he you know, he was getting and on that kind of stuff.

23
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:32,060
Just a message that is important here and that is that these bacteria will be out of these Clostridium species will be altering what your body makes.

24
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,640
And by altering it, it reduces our body to detect cancer cells.

25
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,010
That makes sense. And that's the main point here.

26
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,120
So if you can deplete those harmful bacteria using antibiotics.

27
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,460
Yeah. Hey, we're in a good position now. Okay, so there may be some good things managing losses here.

28
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,750
Okay. Okay. Now I should mention this paper.

29
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,620
If you want to look at it, I've uploaded it for you and not required reading.

30
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,540
But if it helps you understand. And again, I don't really want, you know, the immunology I'm taking.

31
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:12,349
I'm going to tone down the immunology of this class. I do want you to know is how you bacteria can do weird things in our bodies.

32
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,580
And this in this instance, you don't actually physically produce something that's harmful.

33
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,690
They change something that's not good in your body to make it home.

34
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:32,980
That's the message. Okay. This keeps modifying the host involved in both oh and at times discussion points here.

35
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:40,120
How do we measure pathogenicity in which case then because if something is sort of insidiously doing something in the background,

36
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,290
that it's really hard to associate that with disease, right?

37
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:50,380
Because it's going to mean potentially years, a lifetime of association erosion before you get the disease.

38
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,360
Very tricky, right? It's not like it's an acute infection whereby.

39
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,980
Oh, no, I've got to cut. Get some pregnancy. Green stuff forming on my skin.

40
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,700
What is this? Oh, it's pseudomonas is causing problems.

41
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,870
This things is sitting there binding. It's time to levy doing damage.

42
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:13,140
What? Okay.

43
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,490
So this was being a pathogenic normal by microbiota as well as another normal

44
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:21,570
organism to have Helicobacter pylori and would how to be to go back to pylori.

45
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,120
Yeah, a little bit, yeah. So it's a really interesting beast.

46
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,410
It's associated with peptic ulcer formation. So in the stomach it glows.

47
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:38,250
It can irritate the stomach lining. They continue and it'll cause ulceration.

48
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,270
Now, if it keeps on doing it, it happens the same things over and over again.

49
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,830
You have an increased chance of actually. Gastric adenocarcinoma.

50
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,250
Crossword cancer. Stomach cancer. Okay. Okay.

51
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:55,200
Um. And that. Is that all directly damaging us?

52
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:00,490
Okay. It's certainly mediated by inflammatory processes.

53
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,260
And that means that, hey, it's bad. What about irritating?

54
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:13,720
Okay. And the risk of getting stomach cancer is a consequence of that relates to the organism that's doing it and, you know, genetics.

55
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:26,969
Makes perfect sense, right? And what's really interesting is that it seems to be some of these strains that many of them expect delivered the heat

56
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:38,580
to come back to pylori delivers this CAG first piece in it binds to the upper of the gut and puts cargo inside yourself.

57
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,050
This CAG a protein actually referred to as oncogene protein.

58
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,520
It hijacks your own cells to make them cancerous.

59
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:55,120
Isn't that bonkers. So back to and can produce something specific he wants to inject into yourselves to make them conscious.

60
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,530
Why would they want to do that, especially bearing the risk of cancer?

61
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,550
Well, I don't think necessarily that's to go make cancer, but it can be to make the whole area rough,

62
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:09,700
ruffled and inflamed so we can do more happily trying to make a better waste on a farm.

63
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:16,690
You've got to maybe surf is very readily available for it and the downstream effects it potentially can cause cancer.

64
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:22,899
Yeah. Are you able to kind of repurpose marker proteins to fight cancer?

65
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:29,140
So that's actually going to be one of the quizzes that workers take home course they're going to do near the end of the semester,

66
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,800
the toxins and things like that. So not quite that level, but very similar.

67
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,100
The idea of repurposing. Good question.

68
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:49,739
What is missing here. Okay. So the Indigenous microbiota when given body psych being administered in climate stays is stable in composition.

69
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:59,010
It was once you get all the emotions there and you're an adult and your lifestyle is sort of stable, the community is stable as well.

70
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:08,459
Okay. And that stability implies that invading microorganisms that enter this site from the environment, they are prevented from colonizing.

71
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,600
In other words, you've got a city, it's well policed city of my franchise.

72
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,990
I'm going to see the analogy about like it is a city of microbes in your in your particular in your armpit.

73
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:26,459
Okay. And you actually then you go swimming in a lake with E.coli in that the UK,

74
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:32,460
they probably want me to colonize your armpit because the microbes in that are there policing themselves

75
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:37,710
well and resources that might come into might cause trouble won't be able to do so I mean by policing,

76
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,640
producing enzymes, using the nutrients out all sorts of things.

77
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:47,129
I'll get that a minute. Okay. So the invader happens to be a pathogen.

78
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,340
This effect constitutes a potent host defense mechanism.

79
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,739
Otherwise the bacteria on you are defending you. Okay. And there's a variety of different words here.

80
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:07,410
So what is back to antagonism? Okay, we're one back to to another one is your host and host bacteria fight off the pathogen by this antagonism.

81
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:17,760
Okay? Bacterial interference is where one bacterial host prevents the other one from communicating with others to try and cause disease.

82
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,799
A quorum sensing action that maybe if I could ever know, I'm sensing this.

83
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:30,330
I repeat myself. I think as I mentioned before, say it again. Chrome sensing is where bacteria say, hey, pathogens.

84
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,180
One, two, three, four, five is not one over here, okay?

85
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:47,730
They produce molecules and because they're close to each other, local concentration is greater than the ones who desire to do that.

86
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:55,650
Think that this way, if one or two or three of us in the room were too sweaty, I always said, You give me a lecture sometime over here.

87
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,440
Okay. And it's a big room like it is.

88
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:06,300
You probably wouldn't know. But if I was to come from sweaty, come close to somebody, say, Hey, how you doing?

89
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,400
And come close. Listen, you can give good lectures far, and you do.

90
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:16,500
And then you would know that I'm sweaty because by juxtaposition that's the same for common sense.

91
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,980
It's basically just as close as the bacteria that you take to want to do.

92
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,360
Right. So that's what quorum sensing is.

93
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,850
All I'm going to cover a lot more this in the class. I shouldn't repeat description here, but it didn't really wasn't thinking about that way.

94
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:39,780
Then there's colonization, resistance, okay? And that's where the whole community, all your healthy organisms, like we don't want you here, stay away.

95
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:45,670
They're producing all sorts of things, is also things that can be going on and it's literally preventative action.

96
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:51,000
Get the pathogen from getting in the sick like you. They are about to cover me as an sense.

97
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:57,660
So the last one is more broad, a broad term, basically, meaning nothing's coming in colonization, resistance.

98
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,450
To your natural community of preventing the colonization of the pathogens.

99
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:15,760
So the good guys, you imagine this scene. The skin, for example, has your own pet and has the bacteria here and as cockeyed as long what shape sounds.

100
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:26,320
I can't rule, but you get the idea. This allows the other to use a parakeet like type of thing, like a tool.

101
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:33,280
But my point is, these guys prevented these worms and coming in as colonization, resistance, preventing the pathogens and colonizing.

102
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:44,840
When the normal microbiota is eliminated and through a prolonged use of broad spectrum antibiotics, colonization, resistance is lost.

103
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:50,150
What do I mean by that? You take antibiotics, antibiotics kill everything won't kill all the microorganisms.

104
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,530
You lose this community. Right.

105
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:59,330
So the white board for this community is preventing the pathogens and coming in, they prevent and colonizing.

106
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:04,220
But you take antibiotics, these guys, and now you disappear.

107
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:11,540
Okay. Yes, correct. And as a consequence of that, these pathogens can then come in and colonize.

108
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,120
Of course, disease. And that's why, for example, when you take antibiotics, especially in the hospital,

109
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,510
but also when you home transplant, you might get an outbreak of thrush,

110
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:31,620
especially as quite aggressive antibiotics make it flesh of the mouth because most the in your mouth are dying off and, you know, fungus or yeast.

111
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:39,030
Same thing. This instance can then take over and colonize because there's no natural community there to protect you anymore.

112
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,700
Yeah. So let's get back to 20 seconds here.

113
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,630
I remember last lecture. I said how the skin is the first barrier.

114
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,970
Right. Actually, you could argue the bacteria on the skin of those barrier to prevent infections.

115
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,570
Okay. And this kind of thing, it happens also.

116
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:06,940
It's been called pseudo membranous colitis. I came up with that here in the lecture and that's where Clostridium difficile then comes in.

117
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,520
He takes over and the guns. Okay. See, did you go to see different factions?

118
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,760
It's been the news. There's been a new strategy to try and prevent that from happening.

119
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:21,040
Do you have you heard about this? What does it involve?

120
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,570
Anyone know? But the.

121
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:31,660
The poop milkshakes. Yes. Lovely. Right. Depending which way it goes.

122
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,890
So we talked about that variant. So when you decide to put that in.

123
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:44,550
Yeah. It's by basically ripping natural microbeads back in again to put them back to fight off back against bigger.

124
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,650
And that's in the hospital. And the technical term is pseudomonas colitis.

125
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:55,959
Okay. And this isn't really that an older thing.

126
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,690
It really first started as first imported close to here in Ohio in 2002,

127
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:06,190
the first ever instance where patients receiving 70 so much the of antibiotics as potent antibiotics.

128
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:12,480
They went to the gut microflora and the pathogens came in and caused this like also

129
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:17,530
sort of like colitis and like these like doubling like in the epithelial into the gut.

130
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:23,770
They were massive diarrhea and it was all caused by the facility causing this disease,

131
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,290
all because wiped out the natural community that helps keep you healthy in your gut.

132
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,360
This has not been done recently, but it's kind of cool.

133
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:41,060
Some of the time he also has difficulty colonizing the guts when a healthy community is present.

134
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:50,180
There was a study done good few years ago, decades ago, thank goodness, of 14 volunteers giving 1000 salmon to take the by mouth.

135
00:13:50,210 --> 00:14:01,490
None developed disease. However, when the antibiotic streptomycin was given at the same time, 25% of those individuals got disease.

136
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:11,240
Okay, streptomycin probably based on cause, slowed the growth or emitted the growth of the healthy micrograms.

137
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:17,480
And that's it as it comes from salmonella. Then come in and take over those new colonization resistance anymore.

138
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,930
Does that make sense? That was the proof of the pudding is you.

139
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:33,560
You had an antibiotic to slow or remove your your gut microbiota and you are basically potentially colonized by harmful and causing disease.

140
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,450
Does that make sense? Any questions?

141
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:44,650
Okay. I got a pretty picture for you showing this, basically.

142
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:51,500
So I'm going on this side, so I'm not going to repeat myself too much next time. So you've got the left hand side, pre-antibiotic diverse microbiota,

143
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:57,650
and then you've got antibiotic depleted microbiota, which when guys left oil have gone, okay.

144
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,370
And then because you've got these big guys and there's no competition,

145
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,719
they take over and you have this situation and that could be your disease situation.

146
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:13,730
This could be the c diff taking over y and causing all the villi to become disease, shedding a few cells.

147
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:17,930
Your gut cells are dying because you've got this one organ is causing all this trouble.

148
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:24,680
Okay? The only way really to then get rid of it is to stop the antibiotics being delivered.

149
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:32,990
And by repairing the initial microbiota, how would you do you the case of total fecal transplant, as it's called?

150
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:44,420
It's by having some of your healthy bacteria reintroduced or healthy bacteria from a close relative being reintroduced into your into your gut.

151
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:49,880
Okay. And we'll give them a few minutes. And I put this picture here.

152
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:59,280
You do not need to know any of this, but I want to tell you is this is all because there is a complex community in your gut.

153
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:06,180
Here you have the untreated state, no antibiotics in the back, 77 producing polysaccharides.

154
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,610
Six utilizes polysaccharides that produces secondary metabolites, fairly simple sugars,

155
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,840
the simple sugars that are used like this organism which then produces hydrogen.

156
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:23,460
The hydrogen and hydrogen ions are used by this organism, which then peppers it to make this compound and so on and so forth.

157
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,889
You have a complex food web, okay? Other things could be happening as well.

158
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:32,940
It wasn't always and can be bindings. We have to protect it from things like oxygen or that kind of stuff.

159
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:41,700
But that's a stable community. You introduce an antibiotic and you might what from the get go kill.

160
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:47,850
This policy leads you to a place that could utiliza and the whole damn population collapses.

161
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,590
It's just going on. So essentially, you have this.

162
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:59,430
I use the word city of microbes on purpose. You have this city, you put an antibiotic.

163
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:06,880
It's like a terrible explosion, if you will, goes off these orders to stop dying.

164
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:11,560
And the ones that survive are the ones that oftentimes cause trouble for you.

165
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:19,150
I think if everything dies potentially other than eating, drinking and those one reporter.

166
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,790
What? It makes you wonder me to hear the word commensal.

167
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,930
Think about something else for measles that we have. Commensal actually are really important.

168
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,760
We lose them. We're in trouble. Yeah.

169
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:42,010
So if you take antibiotics, how how aggressive of a treatment do you need to kind of completely wiped out your microbiome?

170
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:46,630
Like, if you just have a sinus infection, you take antibiotics, that that will be a huge thing.

171
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:54,880
Shouldn't be what people in the hospitals that maybe are receiving cancer therapy have severe infections or something else.

172
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,660
And they're taking three cocktails of antibiotics because one antibody generally doesn't wipe out all my causes.

173
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,030
The worst case scenario, typically, if all gram negative is more gram positive, but it won't affect everything.

174
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:15,310
So yeah, generally you'd be on a cocktail and then get you in trouble maybe for a long duration.

175
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,600
So individuals at best maybe in there for 3 to 7 days before we start getting you see to have.

176
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,420
Bless you. Unless you're gonna. Okay.

177
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,370
So how does this colonization resistance work to get back to this beat here?

178
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:40,230
Let's get back to our natural community again. Is the bacteria or Joyce, whatever they have in their eyes.

179
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:44,480
Rod shapes how many more changes?

180
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,320
Like how did this community protect against the pathogens?

181
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,700
Why is it preventative mentioning? Well, there's at least three different reasons why this can happen.

182
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:58,000
And I should add again, to this point, I put like these names in the scene.

183
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,360
They were going to be sources.

184
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:09,650
This course is quite unique in that in many instances I'm going to do real deal papers, review papers, not a textbook case.

185
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,719
I'm doing all the work for you. That's why I'm saying size sides are good.

186
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,980
What I would be saying to you, go read a 50 page of this text, but then come to class.

187
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,309
I'm helping you out here, but if you want to then find these papers,

188
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:29,550
you don't have to say I have a comma and maybe a Q and a colonization resistance into Google and you'll find it in this paper.

189
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,299
But three memos of colonization resistance.

190
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:40,760
One use and removal of nutrients and energy sources, therefore not available for pathogens,

191
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,900
just gobbling up all the food items are healthy, these kind of nutrients, you've got to have that.

192
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:59,400
These ones may also produce compounds. Sometimes that interfered some way or prevent these pathogens from growing.

193
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:05,550
Maybe it's direct hitting action. That's my version of lightning cable cells.

194
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:11,010
Or maybe it's somehow changing the molecules used to communicate with each other.

195
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:19,440
Okay. But either way, they directly inhibit the growth of the pathogens and it prevents growing in the community.

196
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:24,340
And finally, these guys are on. What is your gut?

197
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,540
Gut feelings and your skin? Good potatoes.

198
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,209
Guess what it could be doing. And this is actually sounds far fetched,

199
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:36,750
but it is absolutely established now that you could be telling your body to produce things that kill the pathogens.

200
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:44,750
Okay. Or telling the host to do things that actually enhance their ability to do bad.

201
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,680
And a few things like small chain, fatty acids, things like that. Pretty cool, huh?

202
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:55,989
If I give this lecture about 20 years ago, I think much of it because not large chunks.

203
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,170
This information is only been happening in the last decade.

204
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:03,040
That's why a lot of it still is in textbooks right now. Okay.

205
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:10,960
Yeah. For the second one. Is that is that inhibiting or offensive or.

206
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,950
Yeah. I'm saying using a broad term is inhibiting something to other topics.

207
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,520
It could be inhibiting chromosomes and preventing them from mounting an attack.

208
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:28,450
Inhibition directly affects me going to be inhibiting telling them something is inhibiting from being inhibiting to colonize.

209
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:36,000
Yeah. This second one to a part of your commensal speech is selectively target pathogens.

210
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:43,090
I would argue in many cases they don't selectively target but you something is broadly anti-microbial.

211
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,679
Select example streptococci produce antibiotics which do only do this,

212
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,720
but they're just like antimicrobials that target a lot of other non streptococcus species.

213
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,849
So it can be famous it could be there is specific and how do you target it.

214
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:05,650
We'll get that inside the topic. Oh, I think it is. It's collaboration where they actually specifically bind to key pathogens, ignore others.

215
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:14,500
So you get close and, you know, through a microbial handshake, you want to call it that binding and then.

216
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:23,210
Keep your friends close. Your enemies closer. The cheesy, cheesy quote clearly.

217
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:30,020
Well, okay. Now. What you might be thinking is that the other question you ask yourself is, well, hang on.

218
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,770
So what happens if we remove all the microcosms from us?

219
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,600
What happens? But we can actually do that.

220
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:45,710
So we can make a germ free germ economic, whether it was carry forward microbe free or known to my opposite animals.

221
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:50,690
Okay. So for example, Chris, I can say to you, what is an antibiotic animal?

222
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:54,100
Hey, you go is an example question. Okay. Well, it is a multiple choice.

223
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:57,620
Even choice. Which one is the backbone of infected animals?

224
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:04,550
I see from birth by caesarean section for no one to vomit, sterilize food and water, and allowed to breed only.

225
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,780
They are animals that have no microorganisms on them. Okay.

226
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:21,330
When you take them out of these vessels, you containment units that have no microbes in that and they breathe a normal air very quickly,

227
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:29,150
I guess then these all really become conventional, like convection, like me, that they get the natural microbiota.

228
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:36,320
So no symbiotic. And then we start getting their the natural organs by being brought out of natural environment.

229
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:42,170
They are then conventional is because they are conventional mice then conventional normal microorganisms.

230
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:48,680
Okay. And that can be really useful if you want to do studies focused on comparing.

231
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:55,489
Right. What the benefits of the microbiome is versus no microbiome or the direct effects

232
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:59,540
of a pathogen on host cells and not being interfered by by the microbiome.

233
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:06,920
You see, like vitamins, vitamin. Yeah.

234
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,790
It's really quickly. Are they really just similar to other places?

235
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:17,850
That's a great question. And I would ask when I first went to the city in the season of the semester.

236
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:22,620
I have no idea. I would hazard a guess.

237
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:30,179
Possibly. There's increasing evidence to suggest that the Michael Jackson before the Michael alters that you have on you can produce

238
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:40,170
a variety of things you have since the cabbage patch is gamma alpha butyric acid that can actually alter brain function.

239
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:44,580
So, I mean, here's a question for you.

240
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:50,459
With the increased use of antibiotics, is that changing our government coverage?

241
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:57,240
And is that making us in some way altered in our mental state as a developed population?

242
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,010
Drinking Coca Cola, for example. Not changing things, changing our gut microbiota.

243
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,220
Carbonic acid and carbonic acid. She's a preservative.

244
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:13,049
So I'm just I'm not saying I'm studying this out there, but it's really exciting times, really exciting times.

245
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:19,140
We start thinking about disease causing. That's why this class I wanted to bring all this in.

246
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,299
It's kind of a blow your mind. Look what's currently happening in the future kind of thing.

247
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:31,320
And everything we do around that kind of like is, is cool, but this is really, really off the charts.

248
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:37,660
Okay. So let's look at some thoughts about the notable achievements.

249
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:45,249
So this providing information regarding harmful and beneficial aspects of the normal by virtue and the following

250
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:50,350
observations have been made so that few minutes ago germ free animals have less developed immune systems.

251
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,160
Why is that? Because the microbes and this stimulated the immune system.

252
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:00,320
Makes perfect sense, right? Geoffrey Rabbits and Mike show a great enlargement to the cecum beginning in the large intestine.

253
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:05,739
That's what most of my colleagues are. Obviously, no microbes and their body isn't happy.

254
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,830
It's inflamed. Okay. And that can result in death.

255
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:15,280
Okay. Germ free animals are frequently larger and generally able to live longer than their conventional counterparts.

256
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:23,830
That bit blows my mind as well. So the fact that they are relatively unhealthy but they can live longer.

257
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:33,040
What to make of that? I don't know the answer. Maybe the the bad outweighs the good.

258
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:42,490
I really doubt that. But for this way, though, I would bet my bottom dollar that it can't be particularly happy without that microbiota.

259
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:49,660
I don't be comfortable. Large intestine and so forth. Those are the kind of animal we can look at as well.

260
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:56,049
What do you think? You can take your notes, probiotic mice, and then say, you know what I mean?

261
00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:02,500
Think about it. We'll just give you the pathogen. So we'll give you see the virus in your skin and see how you do.

262
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:09,760
Okay. And these are going to give us I mean, take the pathogens away and have no one to blame for that.

263
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:16,440
Okay. So specific pathogen free animals have been delayed from jumping by establishment, but find the virus.

264
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:22,960
So we could give them a pathogen, or we can give them key organisms only and then maybe introduce pathogen later on.

265
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:35,340
And again, this is how you visualize these kind of obvious using germ free organisms, the use of these specific pathogens.

266
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:40,900
The animals as systems need to ensure that specific diseases do not occur or interfere with experiments.

267
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:47,620
So for example, if you're doing a wound model, you know that most animals to a remote or a rat, for example,

268
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:54,730
that they would have pseudomonas there and pseudomonas with that can basically create an infection and that would be dead within two days.

269
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:02,320
But if you have a germ free room has no pseudomonas and you add those walls into that, normally that would help the pseudomonas live.

270
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:08,680
Okay. And you can start working out the example of how wound repair works in great detail.

271
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:21,220
Does that make sense? They have increased body weight, longer lifespan, more successful reproductive performance and reduced infant mortality.

272
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:25,540
So that's kind of interesting that you're taking these pathogens away. Okay.

273
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,610
Now, think about this for a second.

274
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:35,830
You're taking the pathogens away or you encouraging the good guys that actually lends weight to what would you be doing these days?

275
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:43,120
It's not just on TV. TV's going to about it. Jamie Lee Curtis, HB Curtis, actress.

276
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:48,400
She says she talks about good bacteria, bad bacteria, yogurts.

277
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:57,520
They're seen as having a terrible. She was an actress was big in she came to Halloween never seen anything like it maybe and more of a liking.

278
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:03,910
But those kind horror movies True lies the psycho movies she it on TV even.

279
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:07,959
I don't I think it is and she's actually introduced the term good bacteria or bad bacteria.

280
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,840
The argument is that yogurt gives you good bacteria to fight off the bad bacteria and that harnesses your health.

281
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:23,500
And this you support that point. You make sure the bacteria, the the audience that you have, the animals that you have have only good bacteria.

282
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:28,780
They live longer, more productive, a greater fertility.

283
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:34,400
Okay. Interesting. Similar thing chickens.

284
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,410
Pigs grow larger when they receive broad spectrum antibiotics.

285
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,900
I know there's one person from five by seven in here, so I'm looking for that.

286
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:51,680
That's what we're going to cover. A lot less than five, seven of all the antibiotics produced in the world per year.

287
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:56,780
How much do you think animals receive to enhance their good?

288
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:05,690
5% of members of the law and 30%.

289
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:19,110
You hire 75% of all antibiotics produced worldwide goes to the production of meat to keep.

290
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,870
That's creepy. I like that. So beginning.

291
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:31,890
It's the animals that make them basic in that she grows even bigger before properties, more animals and provides lots more makes more burgers.

292
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:37,980
Yeah. So they're not giving the antibiotics necessarily to treat or prevent.

293
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:41,680
It's mainly just the larger make them grow larger.

294
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,540
Yeah, that's kind of that's and that is why, for example,

295
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:55,320
it's one of the reasons why you won't accept a certain president of is prior to our one this big deal about meat meats export to Europe.

296
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:06,120
That's why you wouldn't accept it because he abandoned you to do this to the two big players that are doing this right now China USA.

297
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,430
Okay. To maintain food out of population.

298
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:19,380
Yeah. So the interactions make the animals bigger. But like you said, it's probably uncomfortable for them without the actual probably.

299
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:24,270
Yeah. I mean that lost they can't get anything to compare against they were for that but yeah

300
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,130
if big lumbering animals I actually think you can tell the difference in the meat.

301
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:35,940
That's my personal opinion. Maybe I know too much. I was thinking I'm biased, but I used to obviously in England,

302
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:42,840
but in fact as well I'm quite confused as white hot and it seems to me that you know it's a

303
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:51,540
dog's goal is to actually issues with this one is potentially we are getting leaks of it.

304
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,840
My son is 13 years old, same height as me. What's going on there?

305
00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:00,290
I was joking. I don't know about that. But he's been appointed as the. Yeah, that's a definite possibility.

306
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:04,290
Right. We're eating meat tainted with antibiotics. That's could potentially affect us.

307
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,219
Also, we're eating meat tainted with antibiotics.

308
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,870
How about the rise of antibiotic resistance? And that has been proven actually.

309
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:20,430
Denmark stopped doing this stuff, doing this many decades ago because of that concern that's been all over Europe and stop doing it as well.

310
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:33,320
Pretty cool, huh? Okay. And so, yeah, we know why it makes these animals larger than been flushed out yet.

311
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:37,890
Yes. Removing the pathogens. So is having the WHO is encouraging these guys to go?

312
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:41,810
We're using certain antibiotics, actually, because the point of the question is very early.

313
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:47,900
What about do you do any sort of whatever they know certain antibiotics would tell you certain things.

314
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:56,630
So, for example, you could target gram negatives and enhance gram positives, many of which belong to the Group of 7 to 17.

315
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,950
He's going to associate with obesity obesity associated creative create a mushroom

316
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,410
meat mass and was getting posted by using antibiotics to select restaurants.

317
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:13,880
So the lack of certain bacteria, how does that make an animal larger?

318
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:21,340
So you have to have. A greater community of say, this is this gets bigger.

319
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:27,130
Right. It's not sharing nutrients, fighting with other ones.

320
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,330
So this makes this functionally more effective of breaking down things,

321
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:37,569
maybe producing certain fatty acids that then encourage the body to eat more food.

322
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:40,840
Do this, do that happen. I have no idea that that's the case would be out there.

323
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,550
But right now it's still very descriptive. Yeah.

324
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:52,610
Because then feeding the animals antibiotics increases the greenhouse gas production that they're closing.

325
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:59,260
Sure, I would think so. Yeah. Actually say I don't think when they say feed them antibiotics, be injected with antibiotics.

326
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:04,200
If you would like. I actually have some news articles.

327
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,740
It's not really I'll put it if you want into this course thing, but it's not really relevant right now.

328
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,720
First class is more the other class to talk about it.

329
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:17,980
But I'm happy to put like an article up for you to read if you want to have a look at some stage, maybe have a news article,

330
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:22,810
maybe a video or something, because it has happening in India as well right now as well in some places.

331
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:27,820
So China, if the worst one, though, USA and China, the worst two for this.

332
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:36,220
Okay. We're so into this stuff.

333
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:43,080
Okay. So, yeah. Okay. So other beneficial effects of normal microbiomes are aid and nutrients uptake.

334
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,730
That's where you select that. We want to do that.

335
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:53,830
Jack Daniels need about 30% more calories to maintain their body weight, essentially based on his even developed intestinal blood system.

336
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:04,510
Imitating in, of course, the vascularization of your gut makes sense.

337
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:13,960
Okay. And when germ free mice are inoculated with the intestinal microbiota of conventional mice, vascularization rapidly occurs.

338
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:23,100
Okay, so within ten days. So clearly there are some major benefits of having a good, healthy microbiota.

339
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,490
She's got a text here. Don't worry about it. Okay. I want you to really emphasize with this organism.

340
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:37,340
Okay. And it's all just present in your gut. And the reason why I did this is so you understand the picture.

341
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:46,730
That is it. Okay. The pictures show that organism, and it's breaking down copper hydrates to make simple sugars so that even having to get Panopto.

342
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:49,009
You have this slide in front of you here somewhere.

343
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:54,889
You have Internet to use to think about if you're studying or you think that things this audience binding

344
00:35:54,890 --> 00:36:01,070
to these carbohydrates and the producing enzymes outside the cell which is actually quite unique.

345
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:05,000
Okay. The breakdown, the two maybe pretty simple sugars.

346
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:15,740
Okay. First message that these simple sugars help that always accelerate the growth helps other species.

347
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,650
Okay. And can be absorbed by the host only it absorbed by the host.

348
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:29,540
There we go back to this bit again. So if you've got more of these guys and less pathogens, you can have more compounds to give to you.

349
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:34,550
Except. Okay.

350
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:39,649
You don't need to worry about me or when. It's like a hundred eggs, smoking time.

351
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:44,810
That kind of stuff is just simply that broken down carbohydrates, the simple sugars.

352
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:54,350
This is big, these sexual encounters with us right now, medical Nicole, Professor Nicole Kopechne and her husband having some really cool stuff.

353
00:36:56,330 --> 00:37:02,129
But it's how you always. It's all pretty tricky to go outside the house so nobody go anywhere.

354
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:07,970
If you had to go the big anaerobic tents, you ever seen these things?

355
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,420
You don't have seen them. Anyhow, we go.

356
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:17,110
And if you are interested, I'd be happy to show you an event in a lab.

357
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,180
Except it is functioning right now and it's totally, uh, equal to.

358
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,210
And what are you talking about? Absolutely no oxygen.

359
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:29,830
There's no oxygen. Big bags. It's smoke from here to about here.

360
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,319
Huge thing. Hands in second movie outbreak or something.

361
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:40,570
And you can handle these kind of orgasms in there. Okay, um, you need that $35,000 piece of equipment.

362
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:45,160
Um, so you get the idea. Very tricky.

363
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:51,820
Um. Um. The beneficial effects and normal microbiomes that help immune to other things and a whole new status.

364
00:37:52,900 --> 00:38:02,700
Um, so, again, don't worry about this information to simply this polysaccharide PSA form, actually the same organism very closely related bacteroides.

365
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:13,620
Oh, sorry. Protects bacteria from some extent of colitis,

366
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:22,320
but it also is required to suppress inflammatory responses like and excrete

367
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,940
expressed increase expression of other supposedly anti inflammatory cytokines.

368
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,430
What I'm trying to say is cut to the chase,

369
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:35,940
that there's organisms that can actually stabilize your gut and make your immune system not go out of whack.

370
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,750
Actually, they've already thought about this.

371
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:47,610
So many other benefits like the Botox and that's the key message enhances immune cells instead of homeostasis this bit here.

372
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:52,770
Okay. Don't worry about that. I just want to if you're interested, that's what's actually happening.

373
00:38:55,710 --> 00:39:01,680
And that's pretty complicated. But I do know that people in the class different levels.

374
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:13,320
So this is explaining if you are watching too many other things it can do commensal bacteria control to get into mucosal

375
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:22,320
associated and very few cells make cells and t cells and they play important role in controlling infections in the works.

376
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:30,550
The commensal bacteria provide your immune system to attack pathogens less.

377
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:37,260
And again. Okay. And that's not any of the bacteria from the virus action as well.

378
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,970
Trust me, I says, I'm toning this down a lot when I was. There's been a lot more.

379
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:49,170
I mean, obviously, I didn't think it was worth it at all. Okay.

380
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:56,680
Just make sure you know what I mean. So what? You mean we're going to make cell phones very busy in human cell as any of you.

381
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:01,080
The cameras are being asked and that the commensal bacteria make it do that.

382
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:06,490
I say. And we are saying how the vaccine to help your host fight off.

383
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,340
That's how it doesn't make cells. Any questions?

384
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:21,330
Now it's getting really, really psychedelic now. Who needs LSD when you got my good microbiome?

385
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:26,510
So the microbiome can change. So it's holding production.

386
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:31,290
Now, I don't know if you knew it. So, Tony, this tell me if you do. I'm not an immunologist.

387
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:42,270
I know little about it. Basically, it's basically a compounds compound that basically alters your brain function.

388
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:49,860
Okay. It's a new messenger. Now, other newer messengers as well, that's the microbes in your gut can actually trigger excess,

389
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:53,460
could actually produce that can actually then be your bloodstream.

390
00:40:53,790 --> 00:41:02,480
Okay. And these are dopa means known as F means Gabby's gap is what I mentioned earlier on a set of proteins.

391
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:12,150
So you've got this much altered producing all these messenger molecules that actually also affects nerves locally,

392
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:17,340
but also nerves in the brain and how they fire and how they interact.

393
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,480
Okay. Really fascinating, if you think about it.

394
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:26,070
And this is where we go really off the charts.

395
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:38,130
Klang itself provided evidence for a pathway by which intestinal microbes maintain host metabolic homeostasis by regulating daily circadian rhythms.

396
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,730
So basically regulating when you wake up and when you go to sleep.

397
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:50,260
All right. Pretty cool, huh?

398
00:41:54,540 --> 00:42:00,130
I said before. I look at each of you, look at me, and I think there's more microbes than people.

399
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,850
You can start to see now. I think that. Okay.

400
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:10,320
I think we. Intimately integrated.

401
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,130
Any questions?

402
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:19,879
This, by the way, I'm going to pretty much stop you on this topic because I don't really want to go off into supposition in the late night stuff,

403
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,090
and I can have a bit more in later on. But in the meantime, I'm going to pay for a vehicle.

404
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:27,920
No, again, nothing in the quiz will be on that paper.

405
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:34,760
But I thought, this is really cool. You read it. It's actually kind of nice, like a armchair paper.

406
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,980
You sit there with a cup of coffee, you know, whatever you want and read it in about 20 minutes.

407
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:45,079
Yeah. So it's the microbiome can regulate your circadian rhythm.

408
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:51,890
Are there certain, like certain bacteria you should do to help with your sleep schedule, or is that.

409
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,810
And that's a fantastic question, I would argue.

410
00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:00,230
Yeah. Has it been done yet? No, no.

411
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:04,760
What about it? That I'm kind of serious, actually.

412
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,660
You know, this actually could be something which is a next generation.

413
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:14,130
We know already, people producing probiotics. We know there's prebiotic to get especially things in minute.

414
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,120
But how about something that actually is a supplement to enhance your microbiome for certain actions, certain activities?

415
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:24,979
Now, I wouldn't say you drink and you fall asleep, for example.

416
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:30,470
I'm trying to say as you drink over like a few a month and that would enhance your sleep routine example.

417
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:36,560
And that's the middle way. Maybe I shouldn't say my emotions are related to stress.

418
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:40,610
We all know that when your body is stressed and you can't sleep, okay,

419
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:48,409
so maybe you take a supplement to augment certain organs that basically produce

420
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:53,570
compounds of don't body's compounds to prevent you from being that stress that be.

421
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:05,330
So the general question so I know what she was saying, obviously that can affect your microbiome and potentially behavior.

422
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:14,450
But for people who received those people as close to the and different places and it will happen.

423
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:21,710
I have no I mean, that's not to say it doesn't happen possible second pass of the day.

424
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:28,910
Feel free to have a look and let me know. Um, you know, in some states, yeah, that's a very good question.

425
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:37,010
I haven't gone that far out. And my guess is if there is a major change, probably the course right now.

426
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:42,900
So. And now we're into probiotics and prebiotics.

427
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:51,390
So probiotics involve the use of normal microbiota bacterial strains that are normal strains every day,

428
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:59,040
or sets of strains given to an individual in an attempt to improve that colonization resistance to a pathogenic bacteria.

429
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:07,270
Some pack about that bullet points. So you are taking an organism for another color and you think that's good for people.

430
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:17,700
So you take these guys to pick one. They then integrate into your community.

431
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:23,030
Okay. And they will enhance. Essentially you.

432
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:31,100
Okay, maybe making those make sounds even better, performing better, producing things, but also enhance your community.

433
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:37,170
And maybe even. Also helped kill pathogenic bacteria.

434
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:42,850
You get back to. You actually do that. Okay.

435
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:47,190
There's lactobacilli in there. Okay. Lactobacilli.

436
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:55,410
We try new things like this that reach, but actually more bifidobacterium, I believe.

437
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,300
Yep. Before this, regular artists.

438
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:07,130
So you can have these bacteria and you'll be able to guarantee your guts surviving in your stomach and get into your,

439
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,300
like, intestines and provide protection.

440
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:19,090
Okay, so these are microorganisms that enhance your body and improve colonization, resistance and infection pathogens.

441
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:28,359
Um, actually, I'm just going to just say, you know, as much as I didn't know North his name down,

442
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:32,560
but this is what I thought about co aggregation for example.

443
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:47,690
Our location. Gregor Reid inhibitor system 1980.

444
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:55,070
You. Or do you go and see some the people I was looking for.

445
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:02,560
Izzy's initiation. Initiations is a better way than that. Oh, that's it.

446
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:09,810
Lactobacillus inhibited production against associate cold and cognition ability with view of pathogens

447
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:15,430
and this lactobacillus you often find in many yogurts it binds to them and actually kills them.

448
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,910
And that is what is in your yogurt.

449
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:31,930
Now, that's a probiotic because I think if yogurt prebiotic now this thing of veggies and spices and certain I call them herbs,

450
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:35,560
you say, oh, that's right. And these can be.

451
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:44,710
So that should be fermented so that no specific changes to both the composition and or activity of your microbiome.

452
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:53,490
Okay. Now, that might be with pathogens or in that, but it only enhances the good guys, not the bad bacteria and pathogens.

453
00:47:54,690 --> 00:48:01,330
So, you know, probiotic, which is a living collection of microorganisms that you can take in the one species or multiple species.

454
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:09,360
And a prebiotic is actually essentially feeding your natural microbial community to keep them fighting off pathogens.

455
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:19,560
That makes sense. Jim Crow cream. And then a symbiotic is a combination of better.

456
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:33,120
I said. And you know that I'm thinking these important things about you.

457
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:39,120
Each of these was, as it had been for you, something that's going to crop up likely.

458
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:43,950
I think there's a really important things to know and going forward,

459
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:49,260
whether you go into health sciences or not, he was essentially going to be a lawyer.

460
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:54,210
You know, when you go to a supermarket and you see these things, you have to go, wow, I remember this lecture.

461
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,990
I've done a lot. This is a really important thing. Really important thing.

462
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:02,950
I think this is going to be the next generation of preventative, preventative.

463
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:08,010
So I guess this would be good for certain diseases, especially chronic diseases.

464
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,790
Okay. They look good so far.

465
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:20,350
Okay. Now, probiotics aren't really that new.

466
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,860
Okay. Vitamin C is database 1998.

467
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:30,640
Okay. Um. Has been a mistake here.

468
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:35,520
Actually, I need to correct this. Um. S.A.

469
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:42,430
It was taken, right? Yeah.

470
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:47,930
So it says here prebiotics can be for direct or indirect human impact.

471
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:58,590
I could have feelings to work American donkeys here. Yeah.

472
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:05,419
Yeah. So this word should be probiotic. Okay, so my.

473
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:09,059
My apologies that I will. Correct. So that should be probiotic.

474
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:12,690
I said that type of. Why do you say some people disagree? But let me take over.

475
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:24,870
Probiotics can be for direct intervention. You and I are talking about one of the gateway creams contains 59 types of normal chicken bacteria.

476
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:29,010
Okay. And it's sprayed in the farm. It's been the chickens with this bacteria, this mixture.

477
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,710
Okay. And it turns out when you spray them with this mixture of healthy microorganisms,

478
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:46,409
it prevents the chicks as they grow up from being infected by some really nasty pathogens salmonella, campylobacter, listeria and E.coli.

479
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:49,510
015787815787.

480
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:56,070
This is the worst kind of eating out that you do not want to get that as somebody who's had it.

481
00:50:56,910 --> 00:51:01,530
Trust me, you will spend a few days living in the bathroom. You don't want to be there.

482
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,129
So. So this kind of spray.

483
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:11,690
I the FDA, us. Drug Administration approved this.

484
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,870
And it actually prevents these chickens becoming infected.

485
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:22,249
And therefore, if they become infected during the process, then later on that they use, obviously,

486
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:29,120
for food production that the eggs and or the meat that they provide will not also be contaminated with these organisms.

487
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:35,420
So it helps us. Okay. Does that make sense?

488
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:46,309
Okay. That's used indirectly to increase the yield and prevent colonization of human pathogens on us, obviously on them as well.

489
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:51,440
Directly on them. Indirectly on us. That means that contaminated business.

490
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:59,000
Pretty cool because you never hear this before. Okay.

491
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:04,160
Going you. Check out some diagrams.

492
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,190
You don't really need to know about this at all. It's just really to think about it.

493
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:11,420
This is my this is this essentially in posh terms.

494
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:16,010
Okay. So the probiotic bacteria, if you will.

495
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:22,250
Okay. The probiotic bacteria. Well, I still symbol here with a little scrap at the end.

496
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:30,140
This expensive line basically inhibits pathogens to get the intended pathogens.

497
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:36,950
And if I it back to they also. Dotted line saying Upregulate mucin production in the gut.

498
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:42,330
Mucin means the body is making secretions that will enhance its growth,

499
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:50,669
but also maybe help with preventing damage to the mucosa without bringing pathogens in, but also enhancing slipperiness.

500
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:54,810
The pathogens bind and cause diseases that make sense.

501
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:03,240
They also produce emotions and emotions.

502
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:18,120
They can result in certain molecules with in IgG antibody and the ability that 24% positive about the basically immunity of the host to be better.

503
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:24,200
Okay. And things like psychics,

504
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:33,290
psychics and daytime talk show such a kind of adoption photosystem i's enhancing the body ability to identify damaged cells and kill them.

505
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:42,460
She's also good for cancer, like in cancer. Because it is papers already now.

506
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:46,510
I was 12 years old, but it's still being used a lot.

507
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:49,700
Today was actual. This was all hypothetical?

508
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:54,120
Yes. Can you use probiotics to undo like biotic?

509
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:57,730
Yes. Yeah. That's one of the things that people are looking at right now.

510
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:04,900
There is a potential downside and I'll get that in a minute. So I'm doing the basil doesn't get probiotics and cool.

511
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,700
All right. Yeah. There's a little thing I told you about. Yeah. You're actually very close to it, so I would have.

512
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:13,329
You sent me. Just said so. I'll tell you about a second, but yes, it can help.

513
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:16,210
But because there's a lot of damage associated.

514
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:24,520
And why should the bacteria, opportunists, probiotics, if given an opportunity, still can cause damage.

515
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:28,880
Even the friendliest of dogs can still bite. Okay.

516
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:34,750
Remember that when I was a teenager, they I thought to just, like, keep them going.

517
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:40,269
Okay, so now look at this beheads prebiotics.

518
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:46,720
Now, just a little more complicated, but I want you to think about what's happening with these guys.

519
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:53,320
I didn't really think a large amount of this really is about your way of thinking more so than actually the mechanism.

520
00:54:53,710 --> 00:55:02,140
Okay, so prebiotics feed the good bacteria, that probiotic bacteria, and they actually also alter the pathogens.

521
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:05,500
So they might look at some of the pathogens want, but they don't.

522
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:13,870
And as a consequence, they struggle to make sense what might make them produce something that's targets that actually has a negative effect.

523
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:21,069
But of course, it is important that probiotics, of course, in the pipeline to grow, except for pathogens anyway.

524
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:22,630
So either way, the pathogens are in trouble.

525
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:32,430
I don't know to what extent in the context of exclusion, the kind of stuff that to figure one as well, that is invasive species.

526
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:42,880
That's one thing that I use because of the movement killing that I may access in more detail now to obtain hyper short chain fatty acids.

527
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:49,930
So this is can have nine H and they are the ones that are actually involved in

528
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:56,230
modulating the immune system by increasing energy harvest and change how you feel.

529
00:55:56,670 --> 00:56:01,570
And so food and health and mental absorption.

530
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:07,759
Okay. And of course, they can actually produce things that prevent the advance immune cells.

531
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:14,260
And just given that we are able to make cells that actually then target pathogens.

532
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:19,900
So kind of doing an antithesis to the course types. Have you noticed that?

533
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:25,690
I'm kind of like say, hey, this is all about pathogenicity disease.

534
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:30,730
But I'm telling you, actually, it's not as easy as that.

535
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:35,230
One always isn't always mean. One disease, one always and kind of always causes that disease.

536
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:44,440
It has to do a variety of things to get past course, the disease and this representing a first line, if you will, of defense.

537
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:51,889
It's all this is a big realization. Now, a load of textbooks are just starting to come out.

538
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:56,900
Now, that took us back to pathogenesis. And the first chapter is immunology.

539
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:00,200
And actually the first section of immunology using formulas is doing the microbiome.

540
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,620
So this is why we're starting to use them to realize.

541
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:13,879
So let's have a little bit of probiotics. So says Orville, you don't need any names and nothing like that.

542
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:18,050
I just test basically to find it did a meta analysis of them and took all the papers

543
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:22,420
and did a kind of comparative analysis and the use of probiotics in diarrhea.

544
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:26,960
They found that probiotics significantly reduced antibiotic resistance associated diarrhea.

545
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:31,190
So there you go. Thumbs up. Probiotics reduce the risk of traveler's diarrhea.

546
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:38,300
So have this diarrhea. You know that is. So how many of you been aboard?

547
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:49,710
Two, three, four, five, six, seven for you. When I say what I'm doing, I should define the question basically being like to to Europe or maybe Asia.

548
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:56,760
Often times you go to those countries, you know, you're not used to what you're eating and drinking.

549
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,130
And the organs that are on that food can actually make you sick.

550
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:03,810
It will make any of the people that are that sick because they're used to it.

551
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:09,090
So by going back to this whole what's the natural microbiomes, you actually start changing a microbiome.

552
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:13,350
And you could argue that that's going to cause problems.

553
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:25,260
But if you strengthen your gut microbiota with these probiotics, the chance of it shifting dramatically and causing you abscess intestines is reduced.

554
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,470
All right, let's go another way.

555
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:36,670
You're eating new foods and different products and different spices, different organisms, different dish, whatever it might be, it's different.

556
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:41,860
And your gut will have to respond to it to deal with that.

557
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:50,110
And that might mean that some bacteria have to be lost or otherwise replaced, and that might not be good for your immune system in your gut.

558
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:58,570
It might irritate your gut because then producing different compounds, but if you have a production yogurt and you keep eating that,

559
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:03,460
those are like the police, if you will, that come in and help protect your gut.

560
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:09,460
That's the policing in the city of microbes. Okay.

561
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:24,180
Well, good. Or to actually put out a meta analysis on the use of products to prevent necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm neonates.

562
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:30,750
Their measured analysis confirmed the benefits of probiotic supplements, reducing death and disease in these neonates as well.

563
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:36,420
So young children is offering a protective effect when their gut microbiome is established.

564
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:40,140
Go back to last lecture, as I have always every time. And this is protected.

565
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:50,280
Which he and women of 2012, in a meta analysis on efficacy for gastrointestinal diseases,

566
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:57,230
have found that probiotics are generally beneficial in treatment prevention of gastrointestinal diseases, but navigate to the big base.

567
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:02,440
So I voted this, obviously. Just be clear. You don't need to do these studies.

568
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:06,739
It's just me to say, hey, hey, some cool study is information and problem solving.

569
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:16,010
The key point here, however, some diseases were not helped and some pilot species were not positively associated with good outcomes.

570
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:26,889
And expand too much on that. So then you start hunting around a bit more and bunkers and spam again in 2016 presented a

571
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:34,330
detailed analysis of the Papandrea probiotics and pancreatic pancreatitis trial and multicenter,

572
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:40,959
double blind, placebo controlled clinical trials with 24 of 152 of the patients.

573
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:50,140
About 16% of the group receiving the probiotic died versus only 6% in the placebo group.

574
01:00:53,440 --> 01:01:01,700
So it could be that when you have pancreatitis, things are different in some way and probiotics maybe are not what you want to detected.

575
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:06,780
Pancreatitis. I do. I don't like human.

576
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:12,960
It actually is terrible, but I do notice things to things like altered bio and production and things like that.

577
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:17,610
So maybe that's related to similar to how the gut bacteria respond.

578
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:25,530
I have no idea. But my point here is that probiotics are not the proverbial silver bullet.

579
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:29,640
If you're healthy, it can really help.

580
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:38,760
I think in general, the evidence suggests that if you are ill, it comes down to what illness you have with the probiotic we have used to.

581
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:53,370
You have a few sticking points. I stop for a second. She for charity today.

582
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:57,340
Actually, we should mention next time it's 5 minutes. Let's do this.

583
01:01:57,350 --> 01:02:04,970
Come back with. Now we come to fecal transplants.

584
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:10,720
So instead of taking your best. Yeah. So.

585
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:20,790
Big test. We do it and then I'll get the phone to explain. So fecal microbiota transplantation has been used to try and kill a variety of diseases.

586
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:27,930
Should we still have an okay with the most positive evidence for its use in prevention of the current infection, we see this.

587
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:31,890
Okay. I call it Clostridium difficile development since earlier on.

588
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:35,190
It's a name change, but I am hanging over the past. I'm sorry.

589
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:39,120
I still call it Clostridium excessive pesticides now officially.

590
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:47,850
But C death. Okay. The current infection is common in patients receiving high concentrations of antibodies in their last.

591
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:51,879
And here's a pretty picture of what we discussed earlier. Exposure, antibiotics.

592
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:57,810
And they're like boys in black. And I see that. I mean, supplementation, the proximity disruption.

593
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:05,640
The only way to get rid of them is down in some way to what the antibiotic that specific

594
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:13,270
target C decreases as well or you from either direction have some fecal matter,

595
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:19,770
fecal transplant back again, not necessarily your fecal matter is already gone, but a close relative.

596
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:27,510
Okay. And so they walk back and back of those officers are then flying to see them.

597
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:32,160
And you want to be healthy again. That's and actually the success rates are pretty high.

598
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:37,100
Why is it so resistant to antibiotics? It just is.

599
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:41,900
Uh, so this is what I don't like to see.

600
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:45,730
At least one professor. Form sports.

601
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:51,160
So sports are not affected by antibiotics.

602
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:56,780
Second thing is that when persistent, I don't like it. I don't know if you like.

603
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:03,189
So you said resistance and I like, get you. I got some things.

604
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:11,020
I hope you change my mind. It is a resistance. Many since it is tolerance because resistance is different from tolerance by the word and as a concept.

605
01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:17,410
The other thing is torture. I say I'm a to I apologize by doing that.

606
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:21,370
I looked at Star Trek and there's a group in there called the Borg.

607
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:26,470
We've all heard of them, the machines. And they say resistance is futile and is kind of it's good.

608
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:33,040
I got my daughter anyway, so it's not satisfying. And what that means is they're saying if you try and fight this, you're going to lose.

609
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:39,010
That's what resistance means. It's a response to an attack. I see.

610
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:44,800
That actually doesn't respond to an attack. It's just intrinsically has it just a tolerance.

611
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:50,220
So you throw an antibiotic, which I say, well, what if I just just happened to work?

612
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:55,830
It will actually then go into resistance mode and watch Fox Sports. All right.

613
01:04:56,040 --> 01:05:01,859
So that's the problem. So what you do instead, you then just basically bring in all these other orgasms.

614
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:03,209
That kind of to be honest,

615
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:12,030
I think they literally extend we can see that they just work so well together and see that this is kind of like lonely meeting guys that is excluded.

616
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:15,390
So over time, see that disappear and you just take over again.

617
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:25,950
So since. That's my last name.

618
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:31,030
So I was told we got. 5 minutes.

619
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:38,760
2 minutes. I've got a video for you. Let me speak a little bit of video clips on this show to ask you to watch it in your own time.

620
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:46,600
6 minutes, I think. So my studies involving people should have been carried out using inulin and fructose by motorcycle.

621
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:52,150
So basically prebiotic prebiotic oligosaccharides w that any of this stuff.

622
01:05:52,490 --> 01:06:03,060
Okay. And the simple crisps, these carbohydrates and simple sugars are what actually I was assigned to early on the activities,

623
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:06,730
the bifidobacteria, all these are all mixing organisms.

624
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:14,620
They break that down to simple sugars and the mostly focused on that and the bifidobacteria that we see,

625
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:23,409
they do particularly well on this kind of stuff. And that's where we've been really realizing coming out of contracts that use probiotic bacteria are

626
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:29,229
the same ones in the joint in which prebiotics they seem to be good about what they're getting.

627
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:34,780
And I've mentioned in mobile times now that are policing guys of your gut and the same thing is

628
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:42,249
happening now we're starting to realize a certain factor that police use in publicity and attention.

629
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:43,290
Back to you.

630
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:52,000
So women have said to realize, hey, can we use certain things to try and enhance the good guys and prevent the bad guys and causing disease?

631
01:06:55,790 --> 01:07:02,420
The video is pretty neat. It's a YouTube video. I would just show it to you, but we weren't actually going to be able to float in any pointers.

632
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:12,469
Who's going to take the no more interesting? So it should be just that we know transplanting fecal matter from a healthy person can save the life

633
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:19,160
of a patient suffering from a C difficile bacterial infection by offering them good gut bacteria.

634
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:24,810
Kids are now trying to figure out if they can create hundreds of other conditions.

635
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:30,210
Mental and physical and physical. Pick up a specimen and brace yourself.

636
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:35,250
It gets into patients via pills and enema or in this case of whole endoscopy.

637
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:39,180
And this is the clinical trial here in Toronto,

638
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:47,370
generally transplanting fecal matter from healthy brain donors into obese recipients to see if it improves their weight and metabolism,

639
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:53,850
which I discussed last class of blood sugar, as well as the changes in the intestinal microbiota.

640
01:07:54,540 --> 01:08:00,930
The microbiome is a colony of creatures living on or inside your body skin gut melt.

641
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:06,450
Each area is teeming with trillions of bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms.

642
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:09,749
So either have a healthy microbiome or we don't have a healthy microbiome.

643
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:16,190
And that really relates to these organisms and how they interact with each other, the byproducts of what they release.

644
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:23,550
Studies are revealing there are differences between the gut bacteria of healthy people and those with Parkinson's disease,

645
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:27,990
Alzheimer's, autism, depression and a variety of intestinal disorders.

646
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:35,730
But the question is, did the gut bacteria cause the disease or did the disease trigger changes in the gut microbiome?

647
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,760
At this point, researchers aren't even sure what exactly is benefiting patients with C difficile.

648
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,489
What is actually most important? Is it actually bacterial or is it the byproducts of the bacteria?

649
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:54,720
What's actually helping the patient? We don't really know. Slide it in and yet people are trying to capitalize on fecal transplants.

650
01:08:54,990 --> 01:09:02,850
My interpretation of this sort of hype to data ratio right now is that we're somewhere near type, experts warned.

651
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:09,750
While fecal transfers may sound natural and safe, they're not in the U.S. A study participant recently died,

652
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:14,190
prompting the Food and Drug Administration to issue a warning and halt some clinical

653
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:19,920
trials after donor stool one improperly screened for disease fecal transplant.

654
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:27,690
If it does nothing, if it has no positive benefits on health, it's still unpleasant and inconvenient, but it can be harmful and even deadly.

655
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:30,210
And I think that that's something that everybody needs to know.

656
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:40,620
Everyone agrees, understanding the microbiome, great promise for new treatments, but there's still a lot that needs to be pushed them.

657
01:09:41,370 --> 01:09:47,350
Christine Muir on CBC News, Toronto. It was only 2 minutes that went.

658
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,850
There you go. She didn't look it now. Okay. You really want to, but there you go.

659
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,660
So that's. That's the, uh. The last bit's, I believe.

660
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:59,600
Yeah. Um, and that and the topic one.

661
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:04,280
What I have done for you as well. So let's quickly to show you what I've done.

662
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:12,560
I want to emphasize a few things here as well. And I was getting stressed about anything is if I then go to home page.

663
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:17,760
You go to the sources is topic one.

664
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:21,370
Now, it's totally updated. Okay.

665
01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:27,979
To make sure that no typos and have a corrected version of the prebiotic probiotics, I can correct that for you.

666
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:33,160
It's a tiny little typo. And then I put here papers to re look at them.

667
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:37,870
So you don't get too worried? No. You don't have to read any of this.

668
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:41,170
Really? I mean, what I mean to focus on is primarily this picture,

669
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:47,590
but when I explain it to you might be like I fully understand is only two pages that miss that page and a half.

670
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:54,220
Okay. It's not really rocket science. That's maybe some interesting immunologic logical terms in them.

671
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:58,360
So I say, Well, don't worry about that. It's the general concept I'm looking for.

672
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:05,110
That's all. Okay. Okay. Let's go back now to the next paper.

673
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:08,170
Which resources is this one?

674
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:12,100
And this I actually highlighted? Just look at that.

675
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,870
Actually, these words I've been using and things that are cropping up later on actually here.

676
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:21,470
Okay. This will help you make topic two, topic three to look forward to if I'm so on and so forth.

677
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:28,430
Okay. So I thought that's useful. Currently these early symbiotic probiotics prebiotics microbiota microbiome metabolome

678
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:32,790
about metagenome followed by some of these are pretty obvious summary over.

679
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:37,150
Okay. And then all the aspects that have a little read of this.

680
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:44,050
Okay. And this one is about we talked a slide about how your microbiota changes as you get older.

681
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:48,700
It's like one little paragraph there. And again, you don't need to learn this.

682
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:54,250
It's just think about it. All you need to do is think about you don't even know all this stuff.

683
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:58,240
Of course you don't. And then that's.

684
01:11:58,270 --> 01:12:02,560
It's a little paragraph there, and that is it. Right.

685
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:06,400
So not much at all. But it's about concepts.

686
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:11,830
Okay. Thinking about things, how things work. And then I put to the papers here.

687
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:15,730
This is of interest, but you don't need to read them. Microbes in the mind.

688
01:12:15,730 --> 01:12:19,840
That's the coffee table. What if I. If you really interested by this, I can feel that be kind of cool for you.

689
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:23,500
So here, the immune cells, they go. GABA.

690
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:32,020
No, I've never talked about the local nerve endings, but also the brain and to the foods actually help with this.

691
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:38,170
So it's not a long term either. It's not been any crazy or anything, but it's just a matter of, I think, the kind of interest to read it.

692
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:46,420
I never got the information from. And this one here is Oh yeah, this is the liver one.

693
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:55,599
So again, this is short. And if you unsure she talking about it's just literally one page in a bit one back to that not

694
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,560
this donate phase has nothing to do with it but you can see that's the figure that I used.

695
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:04,300
Okay, so I've done the work for you or you see to do sit back and have a little.

696
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:07,870
We think about things and feel free to send me questions.

697
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:13,210
Is everything okay with the idea of giving it? Not next Tuesday, the following Tuesday.

698
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:21,190
Does that sound reasonable? Lots of time as to weekends, and I don't have a lot to think about and I'm happy to do on the Monday the night before.

699
01:13:21,550 --> 01:13:28,840
Just do a quick, you know, half an hour, 45 minutes. I can go on zoom it's gonna last minute questions and all that and it'll be a simple short quiz

700
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:33,760
that help me gauge where everyone's at the class and or that will have equilibrate basically.

701
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,930
So that's the 24 hour, 24 minutes. Okay.

702
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:42,910
So not next Tuesday, 24th, correct?

703
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:50,950
What do you guys think that the time and help is going to do a fireside chat on a Sunday the day before,

704
01:13:51,670 --> 01:13:54,790
if you then do anything in that audience on this. Okay, let's do that. Okay.

705
01:13:55,570 --> 01:14:00,260
I'll put out a little information for you, an announcement. And it's good to see you.

706
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:06,280
Have a lovely weekend and we'll catch up on Tuesday next week and we'll start topic two.

707
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:12,450
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
